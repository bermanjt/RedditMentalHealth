3,"Last year I permanently withdrew from my University because I was upset with how my department were treating me and becoming increasingly confused and frustrated due to a lot of miscommunication going on (as well as lack of communication). A week later, I was reinstated to return this year. A month later I became unwell (I have bipolar), leading to me receiving a disciplinary and permanently withdrawing again.


&amp;nbsp;



It's a very long story, but I'm not allowed to return to my previous course due to the impact of my behaviour (I was also arrested for my behaviour, due to the severity of my behaviour, but I wasn't charged with anything - they decided it was not in the public interest to charge me). However, I do want to reapply for a different course at the same University. I asked the University about this, and I was told there is a hold on any future readmission.


&amp;nbsp;


t is likely I will have a disciplinary if they were going to consider allowing me to reapply. How do I approach trying to reapply to the University? Should I bother?",25Aug2019,2

5,"I am currently 19 years old and am severely addicted to video games. There's a variety of factors that have lead me to having this addiction but I believe the biggest factor is that my parents are and always have been incredibly lenient and have enabled me to do whatever I want in my spare time. Recently, they've become more and more frustrated by my suffering university grades and finally had their last straw this morning when my father told me to move out. He later apologized to me for lashing out as this is probably the first time I've seen him say such harsh things to anyone but I think he had a point. I've been pondering the thought of moving out for the past few hours and it seems to be what I need to overcome my hurdle of immaturity. I know that moving out is hard. Ridiculously hard. Probably many times harder than the hardships I am envisioning and multiply that by 10. But I feel that it is necessary. Under my parents' roof, I feel as though I become a complete child. They do everything for me and I never take initiative in any thing I do in the house because I simply fall over and lean on them. I think now is the time to experience the brutality of life and in doing so learn to find my own sense of motivation I need to succeed academically. I've currently saved up $5000 and I can work 16 hours on the weekends when school starts back up in September.

I want to tell my mother I dont want to go to college. I want to focus on my video/film production career.

 Not that I don't want to go but for many reasons it just doesnt make aense right now. She will be out of her regular job for a few months, and I dont want to take video classes during that or maybe even until i move out. Doesn't sit right with me having to ask her to borrow money for my video classes while shes struggling with house payments. 

I understand its something she really wants me to do, and i do too. she just doesn't get it.

WITH ALL THAT SAID, if i dont go she will kick me out. and im not sure what is gonna happen with my car. she purchased it for me but she is a recovering nmom so i dont know if this may bring up, some issues. 

I figure I have to 
A:Save money to move out, maybe make a down payment on rent and then a few months rent.
B:Save money for the car and insurance.

my big worry is that i may not have time to. i just got a new job which is great, nice pay and nice everything. I could move anywhere right now with my job. 

I just, feel a little bit lost in my situation. I know that all I want to do is focus on the path ahead. I just am not sure where or how to start, without absolutely ruining my life.

You say anything to people or even look at them they get mad. I can't deal with it. Because of this I can't talk to people and I have to walk on eggshells around people not to make them mad so they won't lash out at me. People can tell I'm scared and sensitive and they jump on me. Being normal in a world filled with crazy people is hard and sucks. I'm an outsider. I don't know what to do. I'm committing suicide soon.,25Aug2019,4
16,"I recently had a falling out with a friend (let's call her Emily) that I've known for five years. 

Long story short, we'd had a touchy last few months of friendship because she would often be passive-aggressive, and admittedly, I was distant at times. I started questioning if I wanted to be her friend, but kept that to myself. But what finally did it is that I told Emily honestly that I didn't think her relationship with her girlfriend (let's call her Anna) was healthy, due to them constantly fighting almost on a daily basis, and we had a mature talk about it. I voiced how I only wanted the best for her and that I hated her seeing so hurt. However, once Anna heard that we had this conversation, she accused me of ""talking shit"" about their relationship and repeatedly cursed me out through text. Emily herself told me that her girlfriend ""wants me to tell you that you're a fucking psychopath and that you should mind your own business."" I was hurt that Emily didn't defend me in the slightest, but I didn't put that against her. She would do anything that Anna told her to do (which is why I think their relationship is unhealthy in the first place).

The next day, we talked about it face-to-face, and again, it was very open-minded. She said that she understood if I didn't want to be her friend anymore, but that she would still remain civil and always be there for me. I said that I didn't want to end our friendship. That occurred at the end of the last school year. (I'm a sophomore now.)  


However, I haven't heard from Emily in a few weeks, and once I checked Instagram, I realized that she blocked me. It really shocked and hurt me, which is such a Gen Z thing, haha. Now I feel like this was an official-official end to our friendship. The struggle I'm having is that she was a very close friend of mine, that I hung out with daily, and our friend circles are VERY intertwined. And a big reason that we've been close for so long is that we always have the same/similar classes together, and once school starts, I don't know how I'll act around her. Should I try to talk with her and keep the relationship civil? What would you do in this situation?",25Aug2019,1
17," I have an eating disorder, anorexia specifically, with other symptoms mixed in. The specialists I see and go to weekly therapy with (the Emily Program, they're great) think that I need to go to residential treatment because of my consistently low intake that's steadily dropping even with weekly appointments and goal setting. 

 I was all ready to go next Wednesday but yesterday I got a call from insurance with a denial of coverage because I'm not immediately in physical danger despite the rate of weight loss and symptoms I'm experiencing. It took about three hours between requesting pre-authorization from them and when I got the call, so I don't think they really looked at much besides my current state.

 I'm planning to appeal on Monday after I see my therapist and see if they can add to my case. I just want everything that could be convincing there to make sure this happens. Residential has been the plan for months and now that the rest of my situation is clear to go insurance is the problem.

 The insurance company is Kaiser Permanente in Washington state if that makes a major difference.

  I intend to make a call instead of the online form because I feel like then they would actually have to deal with a human instead of a form that's easier to deny. I also intend to say how this has been an ongoing problem and that the current level of care has not been enough and it doesn't seem to be improving, but that alone doesn't seem super convincing to a company whose job is literally to pay out as little as possible because it's the only insurance you have that covers the service.",25Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when‚Äôs our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‚Äòmines 21st‚Äô and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‚Äòoh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?‚Äô Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‚Äòooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don‚Äôt think my bf would like that, I don‚Äôt think my bf would like that‚Äô  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn‚Äôt even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I‚Äôm A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‚Äòawww are yer?!‚Äô In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn‚Äôt know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she‚Äôs not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I‚Äôm usually very quiet.

20,"Today I went to a friends birthday in my old town where I was raped. In attendance was a girl I used to know who went to the school where everything happened and i felt reallly uneasy about going because I didn‚Äôt know where she stood with all that. My other friend messaged her before and she reassured her that she didn‚Äôt know anything which put me at ease. 

I get to the party and my other close friend tells me some horrific shit that honestly makes me feel so terrified and unsafe. (Bearing in mind he raped me almost happened 2 years ago and at the time he told me he wanted nothing to do with me and he wanted to put everything behind him). I come to find out since I left none of them (old friends and him) have stopped talking about me and all seem pretty obsessed. 

The girl who I was friends with before is now apparentally in their group and has been this whole time (so she lied) and actually knew everything. When she found out I was coming to this party she texted a group chat with them in it and to my friend they all started saying incredibly disgusting shit about me. They apparentally do this al the time and have many running group jokes about me. 

This deeply disturbs me as I only knew these people for a month or a couple weeks at most. The rapist I dated for a week and then dumped and now 2 years later when I‚Äôm finally starting to recover is still smearing my name. 

I feel so betrayed and so lost, I‚Äôm so worried that if I see him in public in my old town where I am now what he‚Äôll do, considering the great lengths he‚Äôs gone to keep my name alive since I‚Äôve left that school. I feel so lost and don‚Äôt know what to do..",25Aug2019,2

24,I rarely have food in the house. I have to go days without eating. My whole family is mentally ill. We live off the state.,25Aug2019,1
25,"The other day I was having lunch with an acquaintance. I finished my food before her. She says ‚ÄúOh my gosh! How did you finish so quickly!?‚Äù To which I responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I just ate my food.‚Äù She goes on to say ‚ÄúI just love food so much. I love the before taste, I love the during taste, and I love the after taste. I just love food on a whole different level.‚Äù All I did was smile and took a sip of water. 

I tried giving her the benefit of the doubt and tried believing she was only trying to make conversation and express her love for something. However, her initial statement, followed by her unsolicited expressions of love, combined with her smug look and tone gave me a particularly strong sense that she was being condescending and implying that she loves food more than I do because she eats slower. 

I have never gotten any increased marginal utility from eating my food faster. In fact, I find that I get bored of food when I try to eat extra slow. I‚Äôve always been upset when people make comments like ‚ÄúDid you even taste your food?‚Äù Or ‚Äúdid you even take a breath?‚Äù I know virtue signaling wasn‚Äôt what she was doing. I don‚Äôt have the vocabulary for all the contemporary social dynamics terms and phrases so maybe she was doing some form of invalidation? I get very annoyed when people invalidate others‚Äô experience based on their own experience. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of encounters like this many times before with other topics such as art, music, movies, etc. I‚Äôve never been confrontational when these situations arise. I mostly just stay quiet or ask questions.

26,"I'm pretty self-conscience about my arms, being how skinny I am. Not only do I look good in a button up, but it also hides my stick-arms. I refuse to wear shorts, also.

It's mostly my co-workers who ask me this. I work at a blown film factory doing logistics, which is usually pretty hot. Even in the warehouse, it's typically a \~90 degree atmosphere, and I'm the only one with a long sleeve shirt. Even the office workers have short sleeve shirts. They always ask me and some even compliment me on it, but I've avoided the questions so far. What should I say when they ask? I've had other people ask before, at other places, and everytime I say the real reason, their response is usually disappointment, or just awkwardness. Is there something I could say to get a laugh or two? I have said ""Because ZZ Top told me all the girls like a sharp dressed man"" (Referencing their song) in the past, but that's usually when I actually *sharp dressed.* I'm not exactly *sharp dressed*, it's just a shirt. I can't wear a tie, so I can't even play it off. I do keep it tucked in, nice and neat.

I don't want people to think I cut myself (I do not cut myself)... Not that they could, because half-way through the day, I'll usually roll up my sleeves just once or twice, therefore, revealing my wrists.

27,"Recently I have been caught in an unfortunate apartment situation. I was formerly living with 3 other girls during the last year. 2 of them ended up moving out after a year because the other girl is quite toxic and difficult to get along with (I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until I had to live with her).

I recently made the decision to move out as well, because the two girls that my former friend found to replace our old roommates seem to be just as toxic as she is. So the agreement was that one of the new roommates was going to live in my former bedroom (it‚Äôs the large master bedroom upstairs, and the others are downstairs) and I made it clear she could move in beginning September 1st. 

I moved out over a month ago, but I still paid the entirety of August‚Äôs rents so the other girls could have time to find someone to replace me (I was still legally on the lease). Because I paid for the entire month of August, I felt no rush to have my room ready for the new girl any earlier than September 1st. They‚Äôve all honestly been a huge pain regarding me moving out, they‚Äôve actively tried to make it as difficult as possible, so I just wasn‚Äôt in the mood to be nicer than I had to be. 

Last week, the new girl began texting me asking when she could start moving her stuff in. I ignored her first text because I already told her it would be ready September 1st (she hasn‚Äôt paid any rent yet, so moving in early would mean she was living there for free temporarily). 

However, she texted again a couple days later, so I agreed that she could move some of her stuff upstairs, but stated that the room still needed a few things to be removed before it could be cleaned out (she requested that I have it professionally cleaned out before she moved in, which I felt was a bit ridiculous, but I had full intentions of deep cleaning everything out and having it ready for her). I once again clarified that it would be ready for September 1st, and that I would be coming by this weekend to finish things up. 

So I drove over to my old place this afternoon, (11:30) and imagine my surprise when I turn on the light in my old room and see the girl has completed already moved all her stuff in, has clearly been living there, and was SLEEPING IN HER BED! It was obviously totally awkward, I muttered some form of apology and then said ‚Äúwell I guess I‚Äôll come back another time‚Äù and I got the hell out of there. 

I texted her after I left and said ‚ÄúSorry for intruding, I had no idea you would be there. I said the room would be ready for you by September 1st because I paid for the entirety of August. Let me know when a good time to come back is.‚Äù She did say sorry and said I could come back to finish if I was still around, but at that point I already left. 

So now it looks like this girl just thinks she gets to live in the room rent free for the rest of August, and cleaning it out is going to be much more difficult since literally all of her stuff is now moved in. I thought she meant she would move a few pieces of furniture or something, not literally all of her belongings. 

Do I ask her to pay me a week‚Äôs worth of rent or is that an asshole move? I‚Äôm just so annoyed because the room was essentially empty (aside from a dresser) and totally ready to get deep cleaned, but now that‚Äôs impossible, and it will also be much more difficult to move my dresser out now.

33,"Hi, to better understand my situation, we have to go back in time almost a year. 

I was with this chick for a few years, which was very toxic. 

Her and I ended it beginning of this year, which she most likely created an Instagram alt, let‚Äôs call that account ‚Äúabc431‚Äù because it had letters and numbers such as the actual account and I don‚Äôt want to give it out. 

After my ex and I ended it, abc431 dm‚Äôd me. This account had 0 followers and following 0. They said they were here for me and that I didn‚Äôt need to know who it was, but their texting style was very similar to my ex. 

Months pass, my ex does reach out to me and I knew it was her. Her and her new boyfriend accuse me of leaking her nudes, which I didn‚Äôt. They meet up with me but I thought I handled it well because her man wanted to beat me up. 

Months pass by, and my ex reaches out again, and this time asking if I met up with her man because he‚Äôs saying that he beat me up, which was false. 

I blocked them both and continued with my life. 

Months pass by and now we are present time. I still notice abc431 looking at my stories and I just let it be. 

Present time, my username is my last name triple times. 

I started seeing Instagram accounts looking at my stories with very weird usernames. 

I don‚Äôt wanna give my username but as an example, so let‚Äôs say my username is ‚Äúlastnamelastnamelastname‚Äù 

The new accounts are three of them: 
‚Äúlastnamelastnamelastnamefirstname‚Äù
‚ÄúLastnamelastnamelastnamefirstinitial‚Äù 
‚ÄúFirstname.lastname002‚Äù

All of this accounts have my username but with my first name to it and my first initial and the second one has my first name and my last name.

34,"I‚Äôve known my husband since 2006, in that time I‚Äôve known his family and been there when his mother was diagnosed with and passed away from cancer. 

My husband was super close with his mom, she was everything to him. When she passed, his entire world was flipped upside down and he‚Äôs struggled with depression since. The way family dynamics worked - (mom always fought for and protected/favored my husband. Dad always fought for and protected/favored his sister. Sister and mom butt heads, dad and husband butt heads).  By no means is his dad a bad person, at all, but it‚Äôs very hard for him to understand my husbands point of view/feelings... it also doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs more religion oriented than mental health...

My husbands only and older sister has always been extremely temperamental, if she‚Äôs not getting her way, she‚Äôs known to make sure everyone knows - and will refuse to apologize for her behavior.. and dad will never discipline her, but will be the first to snap at my husband for trying to speak up and favor his precious baby. 

My husband is so extremely upset and overwhelmed with not having any support from his family and feeling like he‚Äôs got nobody in his corner. He speaks up and gets shut down. He doesn‚Äôt want me to speak up (because it‚Äôs my nature to protect my love ones and be fair and equal to everyone). He thinks if we speak up or defend our boundaries/needs we‚Äôll be creating tension. 

So dad gave a deadline of when things needed to be out of his house (respective childhood rooms)as he‚Äôs moving and recently threw away my husbands belongings(in childhood bedroom) before the deadline date(special gifts from his mom to him), but is holding all of his sisters belongings well after the deadline(because daddy I can‚Äôt) and has not touched anything of hers.

37,"We both started our new jobs a month ago and between not knowing many others and going through the same training program we‚Äôve spent a good bit of time together at work. We get on well and chat to each other a few times a day. We both attended a company night out and spent most of the night talking with each other. 

She lives locally and I just moved into the area so I have also texted her a few times about things to do and where to find things etc. I want to ask her out but I‚Äôm hesitant to for a few reasons. 

Firstly, the company we work for moves people around a lot and we have both been told we mightn‚Äôt be in our current location for too long. This means she‚Äôd probably be hesitant to go on a date I‚Äôm guessing. 

There‚Äôs also the fact she‚Äôs one of my best friends at work and if I do ask her out this could cause me to lose my friendship with her. I only moved to the area recently so haven‚Äôt met many people yet so don‚Äôt want to lose anyone I have become friends with. I have also often heard that it‚Äôs a bad idea to ask out a coworker with the phrase ‚Äúdon‚Äôt shit where you eat‚Äù quite common. Should I just go for it though and ask her out?",25Aug2019,3
38,"Hopefully I can make this as short as possibly

I'm in 22 years old, just started my fifth year of college. I started out college planning to eventually work in my dream field with a degree in a stem major but I found out after three years of community college and a year at an expensive private college that it isn't the right choice for me. Now I'm back at community college for a fourth year taking some random classes to transfer to a university potentially for a business degree. I genuinely don't know what to do with my life and I'm losing motivation for school. I really do want to graduate with a bachelor's degree but I just don't know in what major thus explaining my lost motivation. I currently work in a retail job which although the pay is absolute shit, I do enjoy the job. I definitely want a job where I won't be at a desk or doing the same thing everyday. I considered marketing because I took a couple classes on it in high school and was genuinely interested in it although I don't think I could see myself doing it as a career. I joke about starting businesses with my friends all the time and that also interests me but one of the things that worries me about that is the money... I definitely don't have the money to start my own business. I wish I could work a job like my retail job but with better pay but unfortunately I don't think any careers like that exist. After this fall semester I'll have taken all the courses I can that will transfer for the business degree I'm considering so technically I could apply and transfer in the fall but realistically I cannot because I can't afford to move out at this time. I'm considering not transferring until next fall and continuing to work all through the spring and summer and save up money so that I can move out in the fall and go to university next fall as well. However, my friends are telling me this is a bad decision and will make me not want to continue to go to school if I take a semester off. I understand their viewpoint but besides not being able to afford it I also know I'm not ready to transfer yet and I've also ~~wanted~~ needed a semester off (for my mental health) for the last two years but have continued to push myself which has in turn been not the best decision in terms of grades. I really don't know what to do and I know a lot of people are in the same boat as me but I just don't know where to even start figuring things out. Help :(",25Aug2019,1
39,"Background: I'm 24. Live in Pennsylvania and work at a gas station. It's a small 24 station with a subway built in and I run the subway over nights. Honestly I'm a glorified Janitor since I just clean and serve customers all night. This is a small town. Its population barely breaks 8000 people.

Explanation: We get mostly people who work at the local lumber mill, on the gas lines, sewage plants, warehouse, mechanics, or are truckers. Most of them are also ex military.
 Most of them older late 30s to early 70s men. Some women. These customers often ask me if I'm looking for a ""Real"" job or when I'm going to get a ""real job"". A job like theirs....
Of my own admission I'm not a physical person don't get me wrong I'm not fat or lazy or unwilling to work. I just really don't like doing the kind of labor they do. I hate being filthy for days at a time. These guys shower sure but they still look filthy it's just general staining from doing it for years. I don't mind getting dirty but I couldn't live like that. I'm just not cut out for that or the military. 

I don't want to work where I do but it's my only option or what I don't want to do, what they do either... The older ones aren't and are actually very understanding. The younger ones mid 30s to mid 40s aren't. And don't even get me started on the ones close to my age... They've actively treated me like I'm less of a man or like I don't have a real job. I hate it!

Its difficult. Growing up I wasn't like these people. I'm not a normal manly man type I don't like sports or being coveted in filth or lifting stuff so heavy it'll kill my spine. It feels to me like theres 2 kinds of men. These assholes, and well honestly the kind most if my generation is. The soft hipster types. I'm neither and I hate both of them. I agree with most older people about some of my generation but I don't agree with their idea of being a man.

I'm caught in this weird limbo of middle ground where I see these men and a bunch of manbun having pussies who get offended at everything and I can't stand either because they're equally ignorant in my eyes but they both make me feel like a lesser man who's wasting his life or doing a womans job. It irritates the hell out of me and I have no idea how to stop feeling like this. Its making me hate a job I used to at least be okay with",25Aug2019,2
40,"I am writing a character where at a certain stressful situation he starts questioning and slowly losing his own sanity. He starts hallucinating, he starts to believe that his life is in danger and that everyone wants to harm him, even hi teammates. Also his thoughts start getting a little too vocal. 

Most of the characteristics he experience suits as a psychotic episode, but that's just what I found on Wikipedia so I have no idea if that's actually that or not.

Can a mentally healthy person have an episode like that under stress? What other situations can lead to it? How long can it last? What other symptoms can someone get? 


If not, is there anything that could cause such effects except of drugs? (Like poisons, gasses, foods etc)

45,"A little background on my situation-
 I (18f) have in the past few years of my life become afflicted with what could be considered a physical disability. I have 'slipping' rib syndrome which basically means my floating ribs aren't properly attached to my muscles and cause me immense pain. I have had two operations to try and correct it, the most recent being June of this year. 
  This leaves me very limited in my movement; even standing for too long is painful. Naturally, because of this, I can't get a job. 
  The second limit I face is that I am a full-time student, 5 classes and 4 days a week. I know this is going to take a lot out of me. 

Here is my largest challenge and the basis for my question though- I live in an emotionally abusive household and need to move out as soon as possible. My father is very mentally ill, but besides from that is a complete ass. I spend most of my free time acting as an in-home therapist of sorts or getting yelled at by him over any small thing. I simply can't handle it. I love my family, but it is unhealthy for my mental and physical health.

47,"So this is my first post ever and i made a reddit for this specific reason so thanks first off to anyone who answers and thanks for reading.
Ill be refering to people a letter example ""A talked to B"" and i wont name the business or anythign like that. 
So im looking for advice to save my friend from being silenced cause she went out of her way to try and get me a job back as a shift leader and i truly appreciate what she has done. 
The store has been having manager problems form its opening and has had problems with gms my friend started working there for over a year after working for the company before. She quickly became manager cause of a combination of things. 
1. The upper staff wasnt trained right.
2. They struggle to stay staffed 
3. She knew every position 
4. She was extremely good at her job
5. The gm and the assistant both walked out the same day after about 4 or 5 months of making her manager and told her she was the gm.
And this is where the problems began. She was immediately give the job and exceeded every thing they asked of her and more. She has improved everythign about the job and the higher ups tell her and show in the stats that she has done an exceptional job. She had the same managers that were there from the last crew change cause no one was qualified to replace them it was so bad the other gms were fired for drug use sexual misconduct etc that B posted his number on the wall and the employees would routinely not follow the chain of command, and as i said earlier they struggle with staffing. The RGM or ""B"" ill call him b pressured her to have an AGM (assistant) and told her she had to pick out of the managers after she had done both jobs for around 8 months. She tried telling them no one was going to work out and they gave her 30 days. She picked ""P"" and B was hapoy about it. She hired me and my friend that had experince from that area of work. We worked circles around the other emplyees and she never gave me any special treatment i even asked her for a raise pretty quickly cause i was covering shifts and staying holidays when they needed it and she denied me untell i got monitored on all aspects of the job and she approved it. I respected that and did what i had to do to become shift lead (SL) . the managers didnt like that at all and assumed i was getting special treatment . after about 2 months a particular manger we will call her ""F"". F had a bad attitude and was working under the other crew and wasnt trained right and had issues with everyone from feeling under appreciated to feeling like she should have been AGM or GM. She would talk about people behind their backs lie not listen and avoid people leave early make excuses to get an extra day off every week etc typical shitty employee things . me and F argued one day in front of customers and i walked to the back and left the situation F came to the back and begun yelling at my friend and surprisingly my friend told her to go back and relax and were both written up and sent home . F called P who at the time was just a manager and P was told that F was afraid of her job and was afraid to talk to my friend after my friend didnt write her up and didnt threaten her job and didn't fore both of us . P and F didnt call my friend and called B . B chose to only fire me and told my friend that they should have followed the chain of command and shouldn't have called him and that he would think about what to do and they would talk about it B said to fire me  . i was fired and my friend said it was unfair and that both of needed to be fired . F then threatened my friend and threatens to sue the store. Nothing came of it. The store struggled to find a supervisor and a manger and still struggles to find employees . most cant work 40 hours a week or will quit after a short period . another manager went to prison and another was fired after missing multiple shifts for varying reasons. They have 1 manager 1 Agm and 1 Gm and 2 or 3 emplyees who work 40 hours a week . the AGM B made my friend hire is pregnant and wants 3 months off witch is a joke. B blames my friend for giving her that position and told her that shes ""captain of the b team."" And has made a comment about her saying "" they made blank long enough so i can finally reach around you and grab them."" B has been leaving with employees and smoking (WEED) and drinking with them. B also tells the employees about my friend and Bs business . He has told her he would have ran the store better and if it was his choice he would do everythig Diffrenet. B has had other managers coming to the store to ""help."" My friend asked B if they could bring emplyees back to help or at least offer to bring them back to help . B didnt like this idea cause B was directly involved in firing me . my friend who had been having issues with P has written her up for not following directions and doing things wrong she has had 3 months to learn. P is leaving soon and doesnt know if she wants to come back after after her maturity leave and wants it extended my friend said thats not gonna happen cause where the store is at. B and his other managers have been coming to the store every week almost and he belittles my friend almost on the weekly basis hes been sitting in on interviews and hiring people and not giving my friend any position to do anything . B also had another manager from a store in a diffrenet area ask about if it was a good idea to bring me back . all of the employees that were working there at the time said good things and said it was a good idea and before i was brought up talked about they wish i was stilla round cause i was fun and worked fast and hard. B didnt like that . P didnt like that. P told my friend she didnt say anything bad to B but that she felt like i worked harder under my friend shifts. B told my friend it was a no because no one felt safe and that i wasnt a productive worker. My friend asked the employs what they said and they told her. She comforted B . B said they were lying to my friend out of fear for their jobs. The manger helping at the time told my friend no one said anything bad and that the owner told him and B on a call that it was my friends choice. B didnt like that. My friend nasked B why she was told that and B said it was his choice and she needed to listen to him. My freind was goign to talk to the owner but was intimidated by B. She didnt after i told her that was a good idea. She asks B again what the problem is and B gets aggressive saying its his choice and that the store is in a bad position and P is not respected and she needs to fire her or fire the other employees . not good considering the store is in extreme danger already for staffing. B starts to flex his power by implying that her job is at risk if she doesnt agree B tells the helping mangers that my friend needs to be watched and trained again. B continues to make comments at my friend further taking away her voice and making her feel like she wasnt able to say anything. B also tells my friend that P said she was scared and felt threatens by me in thebearlier situation and thats why i couldnt come back to help. My friend asks P the AGM and P tells her this is untrue and would be willing to talk to B about it. (P talked to B about it either over text or in the korning one of the other employees heard them talking about it before my friend got to work.)  my firend tries to talk to B about it B leaves early with a manger form another store and an employee and smokes and drinks withbhim and the employee comes back to the store to help close drunk etc. My friend confronted B last night in text to ask why he was trying to take her voice away and demoralize her to the staff. B doesnt like that. B says not to talk about it anymore. Today my friend talks to P and P tells her to listen to B because everyone is talking about my friend behind her back my firend says thats ok cause shes the boss and she doesnt need to be friend with them and P insists on inserting her selfninto the situation and tells my friend She knows whats up and to listen to B . P and my friend argue about it and P cries and leaves and tells B . shes not written up or fired yet. B talks to my friend and tells her shes in subordinate and that hes writing her up and writes her up . he told my firend that hes been talkign to the owner since last night and is making him feel weird and her actions are concerning and the manager that told her that the owner said it was her choice also said that she was lying . B and him of course are friends he said she was tryign to make him do something that he didnt want to do, and that she was concerning him and that all the employees are afraid of her basically convincing the owner that she shouldnt have her job. He siad to her they could rehire me to get her to shut up. Am i over reacting to this or does this concern anyoen else? I know alot of it is improper but im concered that my friend was trying to do something for me that she exposed the RGM and his power trip i dont feel easy about this cause i was the catalyst for the situation. Shes constantly be littled by B and P tries to manipulate her P was going to quit after having her kid tell B made her the AGM . she wants to fire P for lying etc but now is scared cause B wrote her up and is trying to make her feel little and voiceless i have an obvious biased for my friend but she wont tell the owner and she is on thenfence about documenting any of it cause she thinks she will just be fired if she talks to anyone about it. Does anyone have any advice or can anyone at least let me know that she is not the only one thats being treated this way im concerned for her and i dont really have any idea what to do for her besides tell her story she works very ahrd for the company and she tries very hard to be reasonable and make the right choices and i feel her pain when she tells me she feels stuck and that her opinion doesn't matter and that she doesnt know where to go cause she will lose her benefits and money should she tuck her tail and bow her head and hope that they dont push her out?",25Aug2019,0

Hello reddit this is gonna be a long post but I really appreciate anyone that reads it and offers any sort of help. I know i‚Äôm a complete idiot. I found a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù on tinder and proceeded to add her on snapchat. The account posted censored videos to her story and offered uncensored versions if you payed her through cashapp. I eventually decided to purchase a set of her videos and she sent the uncensored versions as promised. This along with some conversation through snapchat and frequent story postings led me to believe that the girl featured in the videos was indeed running the account herself. This is where I really fucked up. She posted a story saying she would be willing to have a meet up with someone if they ordered a gift she wanted. She instructed the gift to be ordered and then be brought to the meet up, in order to provide a sort of insurance. I messaged her asking what gift she wanted, but this was several hours after her story was posted, and she said someone had already got her what she wanted. That same day she posted another story saying she was looking for people who had bitcoin withdrawal/deposit linked to their cashapp. So she offered me a different deal. She said if I provided her with a blank cashapp account she would meet up for free. She explained that her cashapp account has a limit on to how much money could be transferred per week, and so having a second account would allow her to transfer more if she made more through her shows that week. This all made sense to me at the time and I was desperate to try and meet with this girl. So I agreed. She made sure that I removed all of my bank and personal information before giving her the account. However,  registering for the cashapp bitcoin process involved scanning my drivers license and entering the last four digits of my social (I know i‚Äôm a fucking idiot). I do not know if there is any way she can access those and  I no longer have access to the account and the time we set to meet up has come and gone, so I am now hating myself for letting my dick get the better of me while trying to figure out what to do to secure my information. any advice would be greatly appreciated",25Aug2019,2

64,"So there's this girl who works at the coffee shop by my house and I've been going a few times a week and she seems to recognize me and always strikes up a conversation and is super outgoing and nice. We talk for maybe a minute every time I order something (even in the drive-thru) and it's always quite pleasant. Now I'm 18, (I have been told I look older) and I'm not sure how old she is but I'd guess maybe 22?

I guess my question would be, is she just being friendly? Or is she interested in something more? She seems like she's shy but she talks to me anyways. Then on top of that, assuming she is just being friendly, would it be creepy to try and get her number and hang out? If so any recommendations on how? I'm very ""unsmooth"" with women but I'm brave enough to put myself out there =)

Lemme know, thanks guys!

66,"A few months ago, my girlfriend was at work at walmart and a guy she went to school with started flirting with her. She told him she was in a relationship, and I happened to be walking by at the same time and stopped to talk to her.

The next day, he sent her messages on facebook telling her to leave me and be with him. She asked me to message him and tell him to leave her alone.

This started a conversation that lasted a few days which consisted of him threatening me and me telling him to grow up.

Fast forward to an hour ago. My girlfriend has since quit walmart and I work there for 1 shift a week on the weekend for extra money. The last thing I have heard from this guy was 3 months ago when he said the next time he saw me he was going to beat the shit out of me and I told him ""Fuck off, this is why you're single"" and then blocked him. I was at work and he came in. When he walked by me, he yelled to me that I was a ""fucking bitch"" and I replied ""what? Come say that to my face"" and kept walking. I heard him yelling shit after me but I don't know what because I ignored him. Then I found out a few minutes later that he was going around the store talking shit about me to my coworkers, who used to be his coworkers before he got fired 5 months ago. His mom also works here.

I told management about it, and also told his mom that she should probably have a talk with him, because the only reason I didn't engage is because I was at work.

So he knows where I work, wants to beat the shit out of me, and clearly has no problem approaching me at work. I'm not scared of him (he's like 5'4 and 100 pounds, I'm 6'2 and 200) but in also not stupid enough to get fired/arrested for fighting him at work.

68,"Hey friends, 

I‚Äôm currently living in NYC making $55k with husband making $58K. I just got two job offers, one in Charlotte &amp; the other in NYC. Both are great companies with amazing perks. 

The pay in NYC would be $70k while the Charlotte one would be $60k. 

Given that our current combined student loan debt is $2800 a month. Which do you think would be a better option? COL is cheaper in Charlotte in terms of rent is cheaper but what about other things? Would we make up the difference in rent with Cars/Gas/car insurance? 

Aside from pay, which one would you recommend for the long term? 

What other pros/cons do you see for living in either? 

Any help would be appreciated!",25Aug2019,1
69,"Hello. To say this is urgent is complicated, because I don't know when, or how this will occur, but one thing is absolutely for certain: my sister is going to die if no intervention occurs. I am desperate.

If you are interested in giving the most informed advice that you are able, it's important that you read all the facts first. The TLDR of the situation is my sister has been involved with a man who is a literal criminal for around 7 years now, and there is plentiful fact to indicate that she could be killed as a result.

Here's a YouTube video showing him on  ""Most Wanted Wednesdays"", and his fugitive page on the district attorney's web page.  


 [https://www.eldoradosmostwanted.com/captured/index.html?NewsID=46148](https://www.eldoradosmostwanted.com/captured/index.html?NewsID=46148) 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6bDO2QNbz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6bDO2QNbz8)  


I'll give you a step-by-step of how things have spiraled completely out-of-control in to the current situation that has just gone beyond my ability to reasonably come to an effective solution. It isn't just me either, it is a combined effort by my father, my mother, and me, and we haven't been able to group-think our way out of this. My sister is 25 years old, and the man in question is \~29-30 (I'm not 100% sure but his 2017 warrant for arrest says he was 27).  


The first thing to keep in mind when reading this, is he has her under his complete control. She is wrapped around his finger. We have video evidence of him forcing her to do things with aggressive physical force, and we've seen just plain IRL the way he speaks to her verbally. Screams at her, calls her all manner of words to control what she says in our presence. Here's a bullet list of the major facts.  


1. From 2012-2017 They were completely supported by my father to live in several different locations. Three different apartments and a condominium. My father knows that he enabled whatever life style they lived by providing this support, and he feels deep regret but he also wanted to provide for his daughter, so I don't hold it against him (I for one was against him supporting them). My sister did work a few jobs, but this criminal did not. He is the definition of a deadbeat.
2. Evicted from all aforementioned places of living. The first 3 apartments, due to constant noise and police being called due to screaming and fighting. There have been countless third party testimonies that assert that he most assuredly is abusing her in some form, at the very least verbally, at the most...physically. They were eventually evicted from the condominium for a whole slew of reasons. Along with similar complaints to the reasons they were evicted from the first 3 apartments, they completely trashed the place. They covered the floor with cigarette butts, they would just put ciggs out on the carpet no joke. They completely ruined the water system beneath the home by flushing dangerous chemicals down the toilet in an effort to hide things from police when they both got arrested for...well, here...  [http://inedc.com/14/international-forged-pill-supplier-leads-cameron-park-arrests](http://inedc.com/14/international-forged-pill-supplier-leads-cameron-park-arrests). They destroyed the place. Altogether, it came to around $20,000 in damages, which my father had to dip in to his retirement fund to pay. He co-signed each and every one of these living spaces.
3. My sister has been given a total of 3 cars from my father, which were totaled by this man. The most recent one was totaled after he drove it right in to the condominium (on drugs obviously), which contributed to the huge $20,000 in damages.
4. Recently things have been coming to a bit of a climax. My father vowed to not support their lifestyle any longer and would not help a dime until she decided to come either live with my mom or him, get back in school, get off the drugs (she's on methadone now but apparently she's addicted now), and forget about this guy. They started to run dry of money, and it got to the point that they had nowhere to go, so my parents offered him $2,000 if he would put her on a plane to us, and he would fuck off. He took the bribe. Huge mistake was made here though, he said he wanted the money upfront, and can you guess what happened? She didn't get on the plane (after the ticket was bought). So yeah, they scammed him out of another 2,000 bucks for drugs, or whatever the hell they are doing.
5. They have been spotted pan-handling near freeway exits. They live in a car that is not street legal due to parts of it that are not working, but apparently he drives it. He has no license, registration, or insurance. They are I guess being careful about driving it so they don't get caught.
6. My mom pays for her phone bill for her to keep a cell phone. The reason we feel this is important is we need some kind of method to contact her in case she comes to her god damned senses and wants out. The problem? He controls her phone. He will often text in response when we try to reach her. Very rarely do we get communication from her that we can trust is actually her.
7. He has threatened to kill at the very least, both me and our father if we try to take her from him. One of those times is on recording, while he was noticeably ""under the influence"".
8. During a drug deal gone wrong my sister was attacked and suffered an injury to her leg (from a kick, as we understand it) that burst a blood vessel. She ended up calling mom about it and mom went to go get her to go to the hospital. When our mom got there, he refused to let her leave. Going as far as to curse at her and call her horrible names right in front of my mom's face, that if she went to the hospital he would kill himself or do something horrible. She didn't go. She actually ended up going the next day because the pain had become unbearable, while he was away on ""business"" (dealing drugs), and it turns out that she had a blood infection that, if it had gone untreated, she probably would have lost her leg or maybe could have died (according to the doctor himself). The reason he was so unwilling to let her go to the hospital is unknown.
9. They have had a dog for the past 2 years. That dog is actually still living with them. In the broken car. Yes, I'm serious.
10. My father has contemplated almost every possible scenario he can think of. Thought about abducting her even, or killing him. The darkest shit you can imagine.
11. This guys' ""wanted"" status apparently was retracted due to unknown circumstances (to us). He is constantly doing illegal shit obviously but as far as the actual law is concerned he is not currently a wanted man for some reason. We know because we tried calling these numbers at the links I provided and reporting him, but according to the departments he's not wanted anymore.  


The biggest problem is \*her\* and we know that. She needs to want to leave him, and she has been given plenty of opportunities to leave, even if he were threatening her, but she always resigns to ""You just don't know him well enough, he's a great guy"" etc. It's inexplicable and downright insanity.  


The most recent $2,000 scam on my father was painful, and it for sure extended the shelf life of this pan handling broken car living lifestyle shit they are currently doing, but they're gonna burn through that quickly, either for drugs or whatever the heck.  


When that happens, the thought of what they will turn to is harrowing. Crime. Robbery. Murder. Who even fucking knows, but one thing is for certain, if I haven't made it absolutely clear, she is not safe, and she seems to be completely oblivious to it.  


I'm aware of all the psycho-analytical shit you're going to probably bring up first. She has to want to leave, yes. She's an adult, yes. She probably fears him, yes. She might have some kind of abused wife syndrome type shit, yes. We have obviously come to these conclusions a million times over in our discussions as a family on how to get her split up from this asshole, and in to rehab, and on the right track.  


What I'm hoping for, and I know it's a long shot, is any, and I mean \*\*any\*\* kind of advice, legal, or otherwise, that can open some kind of portal to a solution to this issue that we haven't thought of. I am desperate. Waiting on our hands for her to just ""come to her senses"" feels like we are just waiting for the article to show up that she turned up dead in a shootout after a bad drug deal. This is an emergency situation, and it feels like we have literally nothing we can do to save her.",25Aug2019,1
70,"my dad is in jail and has been for 2 days. He committed a felony. My aunt bails him out every time.

78,"So here‚Äôs some background info. Today, I did some community service where I pretty much waited on some chalk artists who painted on the street. I would make rounds, where I offered them water, fruit, and other snacks. Some of them were so sweet, and they would always thank me and my partner genuinely for helping them.

I really want all of them to have good lives. There‚Äôs a feeling of anxiety in me since I don‚Äôt know if these artists are truly happy with their relationships, careers, etc.

81,"This might be a very long and boring post but I am frustrated and wanted to ask Redditor‚Äôs thoughts on this.

My team is in a very shitty situation, we were supposed to be about 5 people total to operate normally without drowning in work but a series of unfortunate events kept our team operating just with my boss and I. I am a manager who has been working there for 5 years+.

My job is definitely high-stress, fast-paced and not for everyone but it has decent benefits, so if you can handle it, it‚Äôs not too terrible (for me at least). 
All the new hires (about 5-6 people so far) either quit or got fired before their probation ended because they couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure. And we had 2 other people moving away so they simply quit.

Me and my boss were so frustrated already and they hired this girl, fresh out of college, about 4 months ago. 
We had high hopes for her because she seemed smart and sweet at the interview. AND we were obviously desperate.

Unfortunately she does not seem to be the one.

She is EXTREMELY anti-social, I‚Äôm not talking about being a little shy or just introverted. I am introverted too but I always try to interact with co-workers. 

Sorry to be judgmental but...
This girl does not understand any social cues and has no filter when she rarely opens her mouth so she comes off as rude and very random.
She is only passionate about what she cares about and does not give a shit about what others have to say. She has 0 reactions when others share their stories or small talks. Maybe she does not know how to react so she just shuts off.

When she makes mistakes at work and when we point it out, write her up or whenever, she shows 0 emotions. She just stands there and says nothing.
And her mistakes are very difficult to fathom because she does not follow the rules. Her only excuse is saying ‚ÄúI forgot‚Äù when there are email threads with very clear directions. 

I‚Äôm saying, most mistakes new hires make are understandable or (kind of) predictable, but this girl makes mistakes out of nowhere and it‚Äôs very very hard for us to understand why or how it happened.

While her performance is not great, she demanded for a better desk, a better spot, a brand new computer and printer. I may be old fashioned but I do not understand how a new hire under probation, not even a permanent employee, can think to ask for that...

So I have decided that she might help us right now but we cannot work with her long-term. I am sorry to say this but I think she is not a good fit. It is a job that constantly communicates with other people and she does not seem to understand what might offend/appease them. She does not seem to understand the social skills we are trying to teach her at all.

I have told my boss multiple times we should let her go when her probation runs out, but she is very hesitant because desperately need help and we have to repeat the ‚Äúhiring-training-hoping for the best‚Äù process. She told the girl multiple times that she must improve to keep the job but I do not really see any improvements and the time is running out.

So, if you were my boss, what would you do? What should I do? Any thoughts?",25Aug2019,1
82,"Hello, I am a sixteen year old male and I have...family issues.  See a previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ala9mq/needadvice_parents_are_negatively_affecting_my/) for backstory.

Long story short, I have well-meaning, loving parents that are also toxic addicts who do not wish to improve themselves in any shape, way, or form.  Also, most of my family members (that I am aware of) live the complacent and lazy drug abuse lifestyle, as well.

Anyways, I have devised a way to proceed in my own life, whilst discovering myself and the world around me.

Wonderful, right?  It is, but there is one problem:  I have a sister I care deeply about and she is rather young and impressionable.  Let's call her Jane.  Jane is a intelligent and hard-working sibling that I am HIGHLY proud of and each day, I try to teach her as mush knowledge as I can and embrace good habits as much as I can, ranging from simplicity like brushing teeth to exercising and eating right every day.

To accomplish my own goals and to achieve my own life, I must leave my family behind to go abroad and learn from experience.  I have already looked into emancipation and it is looking very promising.

Jane has so, so much potential to live a wonderful life and I want to assist her as much as I can.  
The problem occurs when I am literally the only positive influence in her life.  I am the only one that cares enough what she eats, how much she sleeps, how much playtime she has had, how much she has learned, etc.  Everyone else around her encourages her to be lazy, to always blame and accuse others (for trivial or for large things alike), to eat junk, to stay up all night, and actively discourages her from going outside, brushing her teeth, or doing literally anything that will make her life actually worthwhile.

I am beyond stressed out knowing that if I leave now at Jane's most impressionable time, she will develop the worst habits humanly possible and will fall into the rut of laziness and complacency like all my other family members.  This is absolutely guaranteed to destroy Jane's life.  I have already lost one of my sisters to the toxicity, what do I do?  I so want to improve myself, but I refuse to sacrifice Jane to live the good life.",25Aug2019,0

91,"Im an 18 year old college freshman. I live with my grandpa in the college town most of the time. I work 24-32 hours a week for $11 an hour and and I do an on campus job for books and tuition. 

My problem is that I'm terrified of the future. I want to major in psychology because I really enjoyed the subject in high school. I still do now. I wanted to go into business and minor in foreign language but i had NO idea what i wanted to do specifically, plus I am seriously so bad at math, my angle with psychology was that I needed to pick a subject with minimal mathematics because I'm just so bad at it. 

But I don't know what i want to do specifically in psychology either. I thought social work, but another fear is a low paying job. I don't want a life like the one i had growing up, I want to eventually be able to make enough on my salary to have wiggle room, like travel and vacations and nicer ish things. Other than the 2 majors I listed, I'm lost. I dont know how to decide what to major in. I don't know what college i'm going to after this JuCo. I don't know what the job outlook will be. I'm terrified of picking a major and then hating it the rest of my life. Or picking something too difficult and having it lead to my downfall. I only get one of these lives, and I've got a CRAZY fear of missing out on things because i don't have money or i spend my life working jobs I hate. How did you decide your major? your job?

92,"For all of my tweenage to teenage life I‚Äôve been really interested in music, specifically rock/alt/grunge/punk and various subgenres.

What types of venues do mosh pits form in? Is it a general admission type deal? What tickets should I buy if I would like to mosh at a concert?

93,"Alright so, I've never asked anything relating to my personal life online, so here goes nothing:

My parents are muslim. They're very religious. (Like, very.) Also, they're very strict.  
I'm 19 but I'm still not allowed to do most things. I can't really move out, I live in a third world country where you can't really get proper jobs before having a bachelor's degree. No, I am not being lazy. But when working all day in labour 7 days a week gets less money than my current allowance, it's not helpful. Besides, if I do get one of those terrible jobs, I won't be given allowance anymore, so I would be getting even less money.  


My parents have raised me to be very dependent. They don't let me do anything on my own. I'm pretty sure I can handle a lot of things on my own but I was never given the chance to, even when I want to. I'm not allowed to leave the house unless I tell them where I'm going and when I'm coming back and I have to provide a valid reason, etc.  


My family is going on holiday to Turkey soon. See, it happens to be during my stay there, that my online girlfriend will be in Turkey for a very short time.  


I want to meet her in person. She wants to meet me too.  
We really need to make this happen.  
If we don't meet this time, we won't be able to meet for several years.  


The thing is, I'm not allowed to go anywhere on my own when we're in Turkey.  
If I tell my parents that I have a girlfriend, I'll be in massive trouble.  
There is nothing I can lie and say because there is nothing they would allow me to go out on my own and do.  
I don't know what to do.  
If I don't think of anything, I guess I'm just going to have to go out of the hotel we'll stay in and ignore them trying to stop me, and deal with all the consquences later when I'm back. But this doesn't seem like the best outcome. They might get more suspicious and I might be in serious trouble. Besides, I'm not sure how expensive the taxis are so I might not even have the money to go to the airport that way.  


This is the only chance we're gonna get in a long time.

94,"Kinda a long story.¬† Basically I just graduated college, and moved back in with my family in a residential neighborhood while I start my new job. Earlier this summer, the woman across the street told us that her¬† next door neighbor (50 year old man)¬† sexually assaulted a really young girl (probably 5 or 6 years old) who lives on the other side of the street. We were shocked when she told us this, but then we googled his name and saw the details of the charges pressed against him. They were extremely graphic including sodomy and other horrible details. Somehow, he was never convicted, most likely because there was not enough evidence, but that was all just rumors at this point.¬†

But now, he‚Äôs starting to be a bully in the neighborhood, and it‚Äôs making me want to do something. Earlier this summer, my 12 year old brother said he was walking down the street and a man in a tan truck threw an empty beer can at him. This dude drives a big tan truck that is very distinct. Then, my sister was pulling out of our driveway when the same tan truck cut her off, honked, and flipped her off. These situations were enough to make me want to confront this dude. Then, the same neighbor that lives next to him said she woke up in the middle of the night to see this guy banging on her windows and trying to break into her house. The next day, she said she went and confronted this dude‚Äôs wife like ‚Äúwhy the fuck was was your husband doing this crazy shit in the middle of the night‚Äù. She said ‚ÄúOh that wasn‚Äôt James‚Äù and just denied everything (the same way she did with the pedofile shit).¬†

Ever since then, every single morning I see at least one empty beer can in her lawn, clearly thrown by him, just like he did to my little brother, as some form of petty ass revenge for tattling to his wife . These stories made me so mad, I‚Äôm not the type of person that can stand bullies in any sense. And the fact that he‚Äôs terrorizing our street, on top of being a fucking pedofile, just fuels my anger even more. So, I printed out the case report I found online of the young girl‚Äôs case against him I found on google. I‚Äôm planning on putting these in every mailbox on our street, along with a note explaining how he‚Äôs been fucking with everyone.¬†

I know these charges are all ‚Äúalleged‚Äù but the details of the case were so graphic and sounded too explicit to be fake. Knowing his character, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all to be true. Would I be an asshole for distributing this? He also has 2 young daughters, which not only scares me for them, but also makes me feel bad for fucking with their family. Would I be an asshole for doing this? Please let me know before I do this deed lol Reddit please give me your opinions.",25Aug2019,1
95,"My internal struggle comprises mostly of battling a narcissistic prick who lives inside of me. 

I don‚Äôt catch myself being negative, I‚Äôm incessantly aware of it. Maybe this is a good first step? What kills me is the fact that my awareness of my shitty attitude doesn‚Äôt change anything. 

I often complain about anything I get the chance to complain about, I talk shit about people behind their back constantly, I get jealous over even the most minor perceived ‚Äúinjustice‚Äù, I‚Äôm short and cross during normal interactions. Somebody could be perfectly excited around me and I‚Äôll still sit there and sulk like someone pissed on my dog. 

This is not who I am in essence. I have a light heart and want to show that side of myself, not bring people down or repulse them through being a miserable cunt. 

I think part of it stems from some pretty bad social anxiety, I‚Äôm already fairly reserved and it‚Äôs almost easier to be a negative than put the effort into a joyful aura. This is not an excuse, however. I don‚Äôt want to be that guy, the world doesn‚Äôt need anymore of that sort of thing.

102,"Hey Everyone--I could use your insight. I live in the American SE and am a minority (religiously, ethnically, and racially). I try to spend some time every month supporting a national organization that does great work for the community. For example, I spent my Saturday morning getting sunburned and exhausted installing smoke alarms in a neighborhood that recently suffered a house-fire fatality. My fellow volunteers and I were out there trying to make people's homes safe and secure. But dannnnng! Along the way, people kept making comments about me. They would ask my volunteer buddies, ""where is *she* from?"", ""does *she* have to come inside?"", ""can *she* understand me?"", ""is *she even* American?"", etc. These are not good comments to say about someone with my intersectionality--especially when I'm standing right there, am well spoken (I speak English ""real good"" ;D), and frankly, am just trying to be helpful to my community. One of the most hurtful comments (not from today) came from a head volunteer who made out-and-out racist comments about a demographic group with which I affiliate. It was disgraceful (and yes, senior leadership addressed it with the leader).

Reddit, weigh-in for me: should I stop volunteering, or keep trying to share my time? This group works across multiple counties in my state and at various events, so it's a rarity to run-into the same people...but someone always leaves me with a hurtful comment that makes me want to hermit in my apartment.

I told my parents at around age 13, and they asked if I wanted to press charges, I was a scared child and still had the mentality that I should always look out for family members, even if they spent my childhood years molesting and assaulting me. So I told my parents I didn‚Äôt want to press charges. That was the last time that any of us brought it up, until I was 15 and started to develop what I believe is depression, anxiety and some form of PTSD. I began to become addicted to drugs and alcohol. I wouldn‚Äôt shower for days or would lay in bed and not even get up to get water. I would burst into tears anytime someone yelled at me, etc.  I was becoming sex repulsed and would have flashbacks of the things that happened when I was younger. I told my parents I wanted therapy and they just shrugged it off. I kept asking them for therapy of just for some sort of acknowledgement that I needed help. At age 16 I tried to kill myself by over dosing but failed, and that when I wanted to get my shit together. I quit doing drugs and drinking, but my mental health was still at an all time low. I started having nightmares of me being helpless and getting molested. I still asked for therapy but my parents just said that they‚Äôre buying me new clothes or food or I have a beautiful house over my head, why can‚Äôt I be happy? My parents also said that it was to expensive for them or they had no time to take me. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt believe me, they do it‚Äôs just that they won‚Äôt pay for therapy for me and I feel as if it would really help. Still they denied or ignored my request.

106," 

I've been studying in the same small school for 5,5 years and I am ultra tired by it, I can't be myself because my 7 classmates are totally oposite than me, I dont like them, and I cant find other people because my class is super small, so all of them have to adjust at each other and form an identity, so I cant find different groups, the topics between them are mostly political and social which are my least favorite ones and I cant stand them. I really want to socialize with people of my age but my classmates are the only ones which make part of my life, so I only stay on computer ( this has been my entire life actually) because it is the only thing that I like to do in my life and that makes me happy. The problem is that I have these pessimistic and wrong thoughts in my head that I will never make friends because everyone is like my classmates, so I will be alone forever.

I am not a hyper complicated problematic antisocial introvert that my family thinks I am, I am a very interesting person who develops a lot a conversation and a nice talker, who have much social potential, I have revolutionary theories and ideas that myself created and I never ever seen something like it, I am a person that can let someone interesting of what I am about, but I never show it to anyone, because my life doesnt let me and I cant find situations that let me open more. I act kinda gloomy in the school ( I actually talk to two of them but just to talk to someone) not because I am, but because I cant stand them, I am not quiet and problematic, I act this way because I never had a chance to prove who I am really are, and this has been almost my entire life, I want to meet new people, but life doesnt let me.

The worst part is that when I was at 5th and 6th grade, I was in another school with much cooler people, but I was super weird, childlike, disgusting and ankward socially, and I blamed the others to treat me badly but it was actually my fault, now that I am in much better, I dont have cool people, and I act weird and quietly because I am frustrated and unstable.

109,"I posted this to another reddit, but once again- I was told it was a toxic relationship and I really need as many outside opinions.. hopefully it‚Äôs enough to make me distance myself. 

For a near year I‚Äôve been in a really close relationship with someone. At first I considered just being friends and maintained it for a long time. Then I gave in and started to gradually trust and like him. It was going strong, but then he.. well cheated on me. He left for a long time and came back, was upset I moved on, and then won my heart back. The problem stands as is- over the last eight or so months he‚Äôs gotten me to trust him, and I particularly fell for him hard since then. Like bad. He‚Äôd talk about the future and how much he loved me, and all these things.  And I got used to it. Normally I‚Äôm uncomfortable with that, but I‚Äôve since gotten used to him and accepted what life would be like. and I loved that life because I felt secure and had something to essentially look forward to in the future.

A few days ago he shut me down really hard. Saying I was perfect for him but too far to hold and give him comfort. That I was perfect but ‚Äòtoo far out of his grasp.‚Äô I understand, he‚Äôs been going through a lot of shit and has been miserable but.. I did nothing wrong to warrant a break up. That‚Äôs his legitimate reason.

Now he doesn‚Äôt treat me like anything. Doesn‚Äôt even seem like he wants to text me. Not a best friend, not a friend, nothing. It hurts to see him talk to others so warmly and other girls like that. I obviously still care for him, and he‚Äôs the only boy I‚Äôve ever genuinely loved. Thinking about the situation makes me sick, stressed, and like a gut to the stomach thinking about the details of the situation. Even worse, watching him text on discord and otherwise he seems just fine like I was nothing to him. Or perhaps he won‚Äôt text me again and slowly forget about me or move on. Or see me talking and figure I don‚Äôt need him- truthfully: I don‚Äôt have any friends. Especially in real life. Over the last two years I came to realize I haven‚Äôt had a best friend in my lifetime, never hung out. He has things he can do. I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have friends, I don‚Äôt know what to do. And I definitely don‚Äôt have anyone I can talk to or hang out with or any group of friends.

It kind of hurts to see him talk to everyone just find, like he can move on and have a life and all. It makes me wonder if he‚Äôs thinking about me, or if he‚Äôs wanted to leave for a while, or if he may by a miracle shot text me first.. or if it‚Äôll take a while. What has me stuck on him now is if he‚Äôll move on that quick.. and it‚Äôs making me look at all of his texts which has my heart sinking lower. I want to move on, or as some are saying.. give myself space and time. 


My question essentially is.. how do I move on or get over it until he comes back? If he does?

110,"To start off I'm a 22F. And for some background my childhood was very rough. I was abused from the time I was 7, to the time I was 18. By my father. Physically, emotionally, and mentally. To put a gist on it he's a abusive alcoholic asshole. Very shallow minded.
Anyways, my mother and I went shopping. Since I came to visit for a week. (My father is still in the picture unfortunately) 
In the way home my mother informed me that my sister (14) told my mother that my sister feels like she's a boy. She's in the wrong body and she thinks about a lot that she should be a boy. And I was like,""Okay, cool."" And my mother informed me that if my sister was to ever come out to the rest of the family that my father (of course) would disown her as his child.
So when we got back from shopping. I asked my sister if I could talk to her. So we went outside away from everyone and sat down. And the first thing I told this is what I told her,""I support you. Fully. Mom informed me that you feel like you should be a man. And I just want you to know, I'm not disappointed, angry, or resentful at you for feeling this way."" Then I proceeded to ask her some questions like ""Have you thought of a new name, how long have you thought about this, would you prefer to be called him, are you attracted to male/female, have you always felt this way?"" She answered all my questions. And I told her,""I can't tell you how you can deal with these emotions, because I've never felt this way. But this is my advice; wait until you graduate. You need to get your diploma. And after that if you feel like you need to come out. Do it. And if our Dad gets angry, physical, and tells you to get out. Call me. Seriously call me I will call the police, I will be there for you. I will come get you, (even though I live a little more than an hour away) help you get your things, and you can come stay with me and my family ( I have a boyfriend of 3 years and two kids) the house will be a tight squeeze. But we will make it work. You can get a job, take a bus to and from. And you can even go to college if you'd like. But I will never let you be homeless and have no where to go. And always remember, there will be people out there who won't, or can't understand this. But just because that fucking asshole won't understand, doesn't me that you don't have people who love you. I love you.""
She started to cry, and we just sat there until she composed herself. And we went about our day. My mother caught her crying. And now my mom is upset with me because now she feels like my sister will never tell her anything again. I told her,""That's not true. And I'm sorry you're upset. But you have to see it from her side. She's going through so many feelings and emotions going through this. I felt like it was my place as a big sister to tell her that I love and support her that no matter what she decides to do with her life. And if shit goes down hill, she can call me and I will be there."" And we left it at that.
Was I in wrong talking to my sister about this? Should I have just pretended I didn't know? I feel like I did the right thing. But with my Mom being upset at me makes me feel like I'm in the wrong.
Sorry for the long post. Thank you to anyone who reads and helps me out.",25Aug2019,1

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there‚Äô in a smiley way I didn‚Äôt Say anything. she‚Äôs started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly.

114,"Some times I think I‚Äôm a sociopath, but I really don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs that or something else. 

I feel emotions mostly all the time while I‚Äôm doing everyday things, I  feel things just like everyone else, ( I heard that sociopaths don‚Äôt feel emotions and just pretend to) 
 
I didn‚Äôt do much research,mostly because I wouldn‚Äôt know where to start, but if anyone here could help me I‚Äôd be so so great full.  

Here are the reasons I think something might be wrong with me:

When ever I hold I knife of any kind, (mostly sharp ones) I get this...weird blood rush, Then my hand starts to shake and I just can not stop looking at the point of the knife. You should know I‚Äôm not scared in this moment, then while all this is happing while I‚Äôm walking i feel this urge to.. do something with the knife? It‚Äôs very hard to explain but if I‚Äôm around someone (like my family) I uncontrollably imagine what it would look like if i stabbed them and how I would do it. If I‚Äôm alone it‚Äôs the same thing but I would imagine doing it to my self. All this lasts within 5-15 seconds. While I‚Äôm ‚Äúimagining‚Äù it I don‚Äôt feel any emotions and by the time it‚Äôs over I‚Äôm scared, scared that I would ever even think of hurting another person and I feel even more scared at the fact that in that short moment I felt absolutely nothing. 
The same thing happens when I‚Äôm around fire. (Not a camp fire) if there‚Äôs I lighter, I light it. For some odd reason in the summer when I was a kid I decided that it would be ‚Äòfun‚Äô to tie an elastic band on a lighter to make it stay lit, and throw it over into my neighbors yard where they kept their plant waste. Thankfully it didn‚Äôt work. Later I kept asking myself why I did it,even I thought that was strange. 

Ive always had dreams as a kid of someone in a bad situation ,(normaly they are very specific )such as a girl being a victim to human trafficking and being forced to take her life. And things like that. I think I was 11 or 12.  they never seemed like they were nightmares. I should also tell you that I wasn‚Äôt aloud to watch horror movies and had no interest in the news.  

I‚Äôm trying to give as much information as I can but I really don‚Äôt know what to give so I‚Äôd love it if you asked my questions to better understand my situation and help me.",25Aug2019,0

118,"whats up guys. ive had some really weird and dodgy experiences with christianity and wanted to get those off my chest in a joking manner.

i made a satirical christian account on some social media sites recently with some friends as a joke. im spouting some weird shit on there (e.g. satan is coming for you, you better repent etc)

im basically putting on a persona and messing with everybody, posting the shit that comes from weird facebook mom groups, but im worried that people are taking it too seriously when it was intended to be satire. people are getting mad that im disrespecting them or trying to force christianity on them.

the account is a lot of fun to run, but i dont want to hurt people. are there methods to make it clearly satire? or should i just ditch it?",25Aug2019,3
119,"This is my first time writing a reddit post so I'm kinda nervous, please pardon any grammatical errors I make :(
So my close friend, I'll call her Friend A, has a dark secret. She told me about it (a few months ago, around February I believe) and ever since I've completely shut my mouth about it. I never brought it up to her and I never told anyone else (which obviously I shouldn't), in fact I was terrified of even bringing up topics related to that secret because I knew it was a really sensitive topic for her.
Fast forward to last month (Or 2 weeks ago, I don't remember the exact date). Three of my classmates have the same free period as me, so the four of us went to the library to chill. Two of them did not know anything about this secret. One doesn't really talk to Friend A at all, while the other whom I shall call Friend B is in the same tuition class as Friend A and they are somewhat close as well. The last classmate, whom I shall just call Friend C, is really close to Friend A. Friend A and Friend C have been friends for 4 years and they're sort of best friends, but they're kind of on and off as well. They've fought quite a lot. Friend A doesn't open up to Friend C as much because she feels that he wouldn't understand, Friend C is frustrated that Friend A ""treats him like a child"" even though he tries to understand her. So towards the end of the free period, Friend B brought up a topic that's related to Friend A's dark secret. I don't remember the details very clearly, but Friend C brought up Friend A's secret. On instinct, I denied Friend C's claim to try and stop the secret getting out, but Friend C then said ""You mean she didn't tell you about it?"" 
And that was it, the secret was out. He spilled the secret and I asked if Friend A told him. He said that Friend A didn't tell him, but he was with another friend whom Friend A told her secret to. He looked over at that friend's phone and read a chat where Friend A was talking about her secret. I told all of them that everything that was said should be kept confidential among all four of us. Friend B agreed and we both said that this shouldn't be spread at all. When we left the library, I felt nothing but guilt.
Fast forward to the present, Friend B felt guilty and messaged Friend A to tell her that someone had told on her dark secret. Initially, Friend B just wanted to tell Friend A this and not mention any names because he just wanted Friend A to know that it might spread. Friend A was extremely angry. She wanted to know the details. So Friend B told her it happened during that free period and said that Friend C told the secret, as well as how Friend C knew of the secret. Friend B, C and I are following Friend A's private account on instagram. She immediately removed friend C from it. She posted on her story that next week she would be removing more. She posted posts vaguely calling Friend C out. I guessed that it was about the dark secret, and I was right. Friend B texted me and explained to me that he told Friend A. 
As of now, I know that Friend A is really angry at Friend C. She's also angry at me. ""She knew about the secret, so why didn't she say anything?"" (What she told Friend B about me)
I made a pathetic attempt to stop Friend C from saying the secret and I couldn't stop him. Friend B and the other classmate from free period didn't bring up the secret since then at all, but what's done is done. The secret is out, and it can never be taken back. Friend B did the right thing to tell Friend A about what happened, and to be honest I'm a little relieved. Someone had to tell Friend A. And I'm personally disappointed in myself for not telling her about it immediately. Instead, I tried to do damage control, I just told them not to spread anything believing that no one else would know. I'm a shitty friend, I know. She trusted me but I still let this happen. I'm a coward for not telling her from the start. Now Friend B feels that it's all his fault as well because he brought up the topic during free period, he also told Friend A and at the worst time (We literally have Preliminary Examinations tomorrow). He apologized to me, and I told him it was my fault as well. Now the both of us don't know what to do. We're probably gonna be the next two to be removed from her private account next week, which essentially means she's probably going to cut us off.
I'm planning to message her and apologize today. But I'm unsure of what to tell her. I'm a coward, I don't know how she'll react. I'm at fault. As someone she trusted, I didn't do or say anything to help. I didn't tell her afterwards but instead chose to bury the secret. Now it's been dug up, and I will face the consequences. Friend A is a friend that means the world to me, she's important to me and I don't want to apologize to her just for damage control, I want to apologize for hurting her. 
But I don't know how to apologize to her without coming off as you know, only saying sorry because I got caught. I mean I kind of am because she called us out indirectly, but I really am sincerely apologetic and I really don't have any excuses for what happened. I hate to do it via text message, but at the same time I'm a coward (sorry for repeating myself). I don't know if I have it in me to say everything that's on my mind to her in person. That's always been a problem for me, I can never say everything I want to say in person. Sometimes it even happens via text. Every time i say something, there's always more. Always something I missed out. I've never really been good with words. I know I have to just suck it up and face the music. I have to overcome my fears etc but I don't know how I'm going to do it. Because of examinations starting this week, I might not even get the chance to talk to her. I don't even know if she'll want to talk to me. I don't even know if she'll read my messages if I message her. In fact I'm not very sure what I need advice on. Maybe I need it for multiple things. All I know is I really need advice right now. I'm bad at getting straight to the point and I apologize for the very lengthy post and repetitive points. I'm just so lost right now. What should I tell her?",25Aug2019,1
120,"This may seem weird, probably because it is. I‚Äôm 17 and have pretty bad depression &amp; anxiety so I stay at home almost every day. I get overwhelmed by noises and stimuli quite easily, which makes being with others a nightmare at times. 

Cats are absolutely fantastic for helping me. They‚Äôre often very quiet (and the sounds they do make are fine for me), they‚Äôre relaxing to be around, purring makes me feel so calm etc. Basically they‚Äôre perfect support animals for me.

I have 2 dogs, whom I love very much. However they can‚Äôt come upstairs so if I want to spend time with them I have to be downstairs which is much less enjoyable for me. They‚Äôre lovely and I adore them but they don‚Äôt aid my anxiety anywhere near as much as the cats I‚Äôve looked after have.

127,"TL;DR: I have the worst case of eternally wanting what I can't have and I one of these days I am going to really hurt someone's feelings.

A little background that might be relevant- I was physically (on and off, not since I was \~10) and emotionally (constant and still happening) abused through my childhood, have struggled with depression and since I was 11 ish but for 2 years now have been on anti-depressants that have made me really stable and healthy. I was in a relationship for just over a year, but it ended at the end of 2017.

My 2017 relationship was pretty good (ended because she moved away), and I did love her very, very much. However even then there were moments, particularly towards the end, where I felt stifled by love and attention and even started to catch feelings again for my previous girlfriend at times simply because she had rejected me and obviously had no lingering feelings for me.

Since I started uni in 2018, I've had crushes on a few people, we flirt a lot and I get butterflies and excited when they message me and all that cute stuff. But the second they start to become attached, or constantly message me, or develop serious feelings, I lose all interest and feel 'icky' and get this weird feeling in my stomach and just want to be alone. BUT if they then start to pull away, I regain interest?

My best friend (19F) and I have been best friends for 6 years now, and for the first 2 years I was IN LOVE with her. Two weeks ago we had sex three times while I was staying with her (we were both drunk and insisted that it was just casual/platonic). We'd always joked about it and then it just happened. Honestly it was great and we spooned afterwards and all that. As I was falling asleep I even felt some of my old romantic feelings for her coming back, but the next morning she was acting kinda odd. I perceived this as romantic feelings and straight away felt that weird feeling in my stomach, felt smothered and afraid and came home straight away after stating with her for a whole week. (Since then we've talked, she has no feelings for me and saw the sex as platonic, which was a big relief.)

I recently also got introduced through friends to someone new. I instantly felt a connection and we've been talking non-stop since we met. However, just like always, I am starting to feel them gaining interest and becoming attached and I feel smothered and afraid and I want them to stop messaging me. But when they do disappear for a day or so, of course I start to want them again.

What's wrong with me? This time I'm terrified because they are so soft and sensitive and I want to stop whatever is going on before they get seriously hurt. They've never dated anyone before and I couldn't bear hurting them. I do like them, and care for them a whole lot, and we have so much in common and a real connection. But I also don't want them to like me too much. It's not like I'm just one of those people who needs space, because the second they disappear I feel rejected and want them more than ever.

However even then there were moments, particularly towards the end, where I felt stifled by love and attention and even started to catch feelings again for a previous girlfriend at times simply because she had rejected me and obviously had no lingering feelings for me.

Since I started college in 2018, I've had crushes on a few people, we flirt a lot and I get butterflies and excited when they message me and all that cute stuff. But the second they start to become attached, or constantly message me, or develop serious feelings, I lose all interest and feel 'icky' and get this weird feeling in my stomach and just want to be alone. BUT if they then start to pull away, I regain interest?

My best friend (20F) and I have been best friends for \~9 years now, and for 2 years in high school I was IN LOVE with her. A few months ago we had sex three times over the space of one nigh- we'd always joked about it and then it just happened. Honestly it was great, but the next morning she was acting kinda odd. I perceived this as romantic feelings and straight away felt that weird feeling in my stomach, felt smothered and afraid and came home straight away. (Since then we've talked, she has no feelings for me and saw the sex as platonic, which was a big relief.)

I recently also got introduced through friends to someone new (20F). I instantly felt a connection and we've been talking non-stop since we met. However, I am starting to feel her gaining interest and becoming attached and the more she messages me and wants to hang out, the more I feel smothered and afraid want her to stop messaging me at all. But when she does disappear for a day or so to study/work of course I start to want her again.

What the fuck is wrong with me? This time I'm terrified because this girl is so soft and sensitive and I want to stop whatever is going on before she gets seriously hurt. She's never dated anyone before and I couldn't bear hurting her. I do like her, and care for her a whole lot, and we have so much in common and a real connection. But I also don't want her to like me TOO much. It's not like I'm just one of those people who needs space, because the second anyone disappears or stops replying or I perceive some change in behaviour I feel rejected and want them more than ever. Is this some sick need for attention? Am I just really manipulative? Is this all somehow to do with my mom? Please help, I want to find love and I do really crave love and intimacy, I just seem to hate it when it's given to me.",25Aug2019,0
142,"Hey guys, tomorrow is my first day of senior year, I still don‚Äôt know what I want to major in in college.

143,"flirting is in quotations because i don't want to even call it that, but can't think of another word for it.

i'm mobile so i'll try my best to format. also using throwaway because i'm not ready to mention to my girlfriend.

just looking for help with what to do. extremely stressed about it and i can't sleep because of it.

so, this all starts a little while ago, a couple years maybe. i just turned 15 recently and this guy who we'll call Steve has always been a nice friendly guy. Steve likes to joke around a lot about selling drugs, offering me drugs, etc. it's more of a family joke at this point.

lately he's seemed a bit too friendly. i talked to my mum a few months back about how uncomfortable it is to be near him. he looks at me weird and flirts on the lowkey with me (i'm male btw). even my dad said that Steve seems kind of gay. i never said anything about him ""lowkey flirting"" because that's just awkward. he just makes me feel uncomfortable and says creepy things and usually snuggles up to me a bit when near me in a joking way. my mum mentioned to me that Steve once slapped or touched her ass and my dad didn't talk to him for a year or two. she also feels off about him.

well, basically i haven't been near him or anything. but this summer my dad has been nagging me to get a job, but i was unsure of where to work. he suggested i work for my uncle doing physical labour, he owns a landscaping business, but my uncle never got back to me. so, my dad finally landed on me working at his company for a bit. 

i started working there and everything was normal. Steve is quite grumpy in the morning so he will cuss you out if you offend him slightly. but, after a week or so he started cheering up in the morning and overall seeming a lot better. i mentioned it to my dad and he agreed, but he also said some snooty joke that went,
""yeah, i bet he's happy because you're here. he sure likes little boys."" this is obviously a joke and i passed it off as such because he hadn't done anything off putting as of yet.

now, me and Steve get on alright. i had completely forgotten about everything in the past and buried it in my mind. but on friday he was a lot more, well, he was very weird and on a high note flirty. i can recall a couple of times where he called me ""babe"", or ""baby"", or said something like ""i love you, babe/baby."", he also blew a kiss at me while i was going up the stairs and he was going down. he said something like,
""oh hey babe *blows kiss*, not gonna give me one back?"" i said no and sat in my dads office for the rest of the day.

i just want to know what you think this occurance means, he's like 50-60 now. i feel like he's trying to come on me. i just want to know what you think before i do something over the top and ruin his life by accident.",25Aug2019,4

158," I dont use reddit often, but I'm really confused right now and I need a second opinion. My best friend has been dating a girl for a little under a year, and her and I have been growing closer together- for reference we are all females. My best friend is the one thay pushed us to be close in the first place, but she's been getting upset about it recently. I hang out with them a lot, one on one and all together. However, I really try not to see her girlfriend more than her so she doesn't feel left out, and her and her girlfriend are together everyday so that's not a problem. There is nothing romantic/sexual between me and her girlfriend and my best friend is aware of that. 
    I feel like she's being overly possessive over both of us, but I'm not entirely sure since I've never seen it before. She's been lashing out at me and saying I'm in the wrong and selfish for befriend her girlfriend. We recently had a fight, that was mostly her crying and yelling, because I invited her girlfriend to stay over when she wanted to stay over. She says that since I'm her friend and she's her girlfriend it's not fair. I do see how it can be a little weird, but I don't want to stop being friends with her.

161,"Hi, my sister's visiting soon with her second baby, and she's a painfully huge advocate for breastfeeding. She used to cover up when she fed her baby, but then she found a breastfeeding Facebook group and has been shoving it in our faces ever since.

When she visited our home some time ago with her first baby, she would pull her top up in the middle of family conversations (which included her brother, her step grandmother, and me, her at-the-time underage sister) to breastfeed her child without warning us, and when she was done she would leave her breast exposed for several minutes before bothering to cover up. We often had to leave the room if we didn't want to see her boobs every half an hour (she had no feeding schedule and just pulled her shirt up whenever the baby pawed at her chest, still without warning us). She would even pull up her shirt in public and wouldn't turn away from strangers on the street. Even when she left and went back home, she would breastfeed her baby during FaceTime with us

As much as we all support breastfeeding, none of us want to see our sister's/daughter's/granddaughter's nipples. However, she is very confrontational and stubborn; if we ask her to stop, cover up, or go somewhere else and tell her it makes us uncomfortable, she will just argue and yell and do it more so she can get a reaction out of us. It was so bad the last time that we *dread* her coming over now with her second baby, but I feel sad I feel that way because of course I want to spend time with my sister...preferably without having to see her nipples all the time.

 We have thought about all leaving the room when she exposes herself to give her the hint we don't like it, but I'm not sure. How do we deal with a confrontational breastfeeder who has a chip on her shoulder?

Note: We are all adults now, so the only children who will be around are her own.",25Aug2019,1

166,"So I realized I was in a toxic friendship a few months ago.  I've tried inviting her to hang out a couple of times since the summer break started but they kept cancelling on me, saying that they were busy. And yet, not once did they bother to message me back to reschedule or reach out to hang at any point. Since this wasn't the first time these last-minute cancellations have happened, I just decided to give up on the friendship altogether because I deemed it not worth my time or energy anymore; especially since that wasn't the only thing that has been bothering me during the duration of the friendship. It had gotten to the point I practically hated that I ever trusted the person enough to be my friend.
I haven't talked to them or have seen them since then but when I went to school the other day to meet a professor, I thought I spotted them on campus. I realized later that I had mistaken the person for someone else but I felt super nauseous after having thought I saw them. I thought that, if I were to see them again when the new school year starts, I will know exactly what I would say to them and yet, I panicked and I felt myself about to have an anxiety attack that day. That's when I realized that, no matter how many times I've rehearsed what I was going to tell this person, I'm still not as ready to face them as I thought I would be.

167,"Background:
I am 23, grew up with Social Communications Disorder, and was raised by physically and emotionally abusive parents. They have always hated me due to my disorder, and my entire childhood they made me feel worthless and like I'd never amount to anything. When I became 17 and graduated high school in 2014, I got my first job and my own income(I wasn't allowed to have a job as a teen), and they still sought to exercise absolute control over my life.

 I was saving up what money I could, from my paychecks so I could rent an apartment, and finally get away from them, but when they lost their last house they demanded I give them all the money in my savings, so that they could buy a new one. I only agreed to this because my little sister is still a child who needs a roof over her head, and I care about my sister's well being. Majority of my check went to rent the rest went to groceries. About a year after this I was able to get into college in 2015, despite the constant discouragement, and being told how much of a retard I am, by my mother.

Neither of my parents finished college, and my father dropped out, when he was younger, to become a church pastor. Which he still is to this day. Since I couldn't afford to live in the student dorms, and my parents refused to pay for that, they demanded I live with my grandmother. My grandmother is a toxic religious fanatic who mocks the poor, and is racist towards anyone of Hispanic, Asian, European, or Middle Eastern Heritage.

She demanded that I obey her rules if I wanted to stay. Those rules being:

1. Attend and participate in every single church service(2 services every Sunday each lasting 6 to 7 hours long), prayer meeting, and bible study(Wednesday and Friday evenings).

2. Never leave the house without her permission.(She used this to prevent me from getting a job, so I could move out and get my own apartment. This was so her and my parents could keep me from being independent, thus maintaining control over me. This also kept me from doing after school meet ups with classmates for paired assigments, which caused me to fail important school work.)

3. Do whatever she tells me to, without question or objection. 

Break any one of these rules and I'd get kicked out and sent back to my parents. I broke rule 1, because it got in the way of my education. My grandmother kicked me out as she didn't want a godless heathen who put education over religion, living in her house. I was forced to move back in with my abusive parents in 2016. I have been drowning in student loan debt ever since, but have been struggling with suicidal depression since high school and made an attempt in college but got the measurements wrong for the substance I was using, and ended up failing. After I told them how I felt, and about the suicide attempts(like a dumbass, I actually thought they'd have any humanity in them)my father got angry as usual and told me to get out, and my mother never looked happier to see her retard son finally exiting her life.

I was about to sleep next to a train track in a wooded area, as homeless people aren't allowed anywhere else. I had also contemplated using a razor I brought with me, to slit my wrists. A suicide attempt I know I can't fuck up, as science was one of my strengths growing up, and I know human biology and anatomy like the back of my hand.",25Aug2019,13
168,"Hey r/advice! I'm going to keep this pretty brief because I know some of my family members use Reddit.  

Basically my dad (60s) is exhibiting pretty serious signs of mental instability. He's had an alcohol problem since before I was born, and mental health issues are common on his side of the family. He's become extremely paranoid about his safety, and believes that people (including the authorities) are trying to harm him. 

He has been in trouble with the law recently and I am worried that it's getting to the point of him potentially harming a person/himself due to his level of paranoia. 

He has a group of ""people he is working with"" who appear to be feeding into his delusions, for an unknown reason (I don't think money is involved in this transaction). He seems to trust them over anyone else, so I'm worried about their motives. 

I have a great support system and am in no immediate danger, I just want to get him the help he needs but I'm not sure how to approach it without him growing mistrustful of me too. He is abusing alcohol regularly and I don't believe he's in great physical health due to this, but doesn't trust the medical system either. 

I have spoken to mental health hotlines for advice, but beyond telling me to report him to the police for a mental health assessment, nothing has been super helpful. 

I am not close with him and never really have been, he has lost everyone he loves in life due to his substance abuse and refusal to get help, so he's very alone except for these mystery people who conspire with him.

If anyone has experience dealing with a family member in a similar position, or advice on resources available I'd really appreciate it, I'd like to avoid reporting him to authorities if I can help it so that he doesn't think I am an enemy.",25Aug2019,3

170,"Alright Reddit, I got some good advice here once and I hope you can give me some more.

I (M18) have a friend (F17) I met about 2 months ago on a school trip to Germany. Going on the trip I kind of knew one person who was a friend of a friend that I hung out with at lunch. This friend turned out to have changed into a completely different person so I knew no one. Now my Mom &amp; Dad just told me ""What do you have to lose? It's your last year and you might not see these people ever again. Have fun and don't worry about it"" so I took their advice.

On the trip I made a whole new group of friends to the point where we all got drunk in a hotel room in Berlin. These people gave me my best memory my entire life to the point where I left my other friends and started to enjoy the popular life. 6 days into the trip I had a peanut reaction, nothing too bad just stomach pain and vomiting about an hour later. The whole time my new friends we comforting me and asking if I needed anything; I was the happiest person ever even thought I was in excruciating pain. The best part was how even after I explained I was fine and I just needed to find a bathroom quick, the hottest girl there like a 9/10, was crying for me like I was dying.

Now onto the girl trouble part. The girl who was crying for me... let's call her Megan. Megan texted me asking if I wanted to get frozen yogurt  with her at like 8 pm and I was so excited that she asked me to join her. I was under the impression that there would be others there like some of her friends. I was wrong, it was just us. When we went in we both got the same everything. We talked and had some much fun, I thought it was going great and that she also enjoyed herself.

Now a week later of talking on Snapchat I asked if she wanted to get some frozen yogurt with me again over the weekend this time. She agreed and I went to bed ecstatic and overjoyed for that weekend like more than I ever have been. It comes and round and I shoot her another snap and ask if she was coming my way or I'm going her way. She said she would pick me up at 3 pm and to wait outside. She never came and stopped answering my snaps all together. I started to get worried to the point where 7 PM comes and I get a text of ""sorry I fell asleep, we'll have to reschedule""

I don't know what to do now and I'm so sorry for making this long. Half of this probably isn't needed but I don't know what to do, I really like her like REALLY like her. Anything helps please and thank you!!!",25Aug2019,1
171,"Oh yeah. I'm (m18) so cool. I drive fast.

Well. Not necessarily what you think of when you hear some one say ""street race"". No that's not me at 3 am revving my engine down your neighborhood road. No that's not me swerving around on the interstate. I refuse to race on any highways or roads where there could be kids. 

It started when I had just gotten my license. I was now the driver of the family's 2013 Ford Fiesta Se (automatic ;) ) I thought I was the ish. While trying to impress a friend I went around a 90¬∞ corner, understeered and ate curb #1. This curb was next to a chain link fence. Cheese grated 4 panels. Insurance totaled it. Sold it for more than what my parents owed on it (win win?) 

I needed a car to get to work and school. After enough prodding my parents helped me get my current car. My 2000 Honda Civic DX. Did I want a civic. Hell no. I just wanted something manual at the least. So I took it anyways. The condition of the car, led me to learn how to do repairs myself, and over the course of two years led me to become a mechanic and I'm aiming for an education in power train design. 

That's besides the point.

Lower ball joint shears.
New ball joint!

About a year ago, in the pursuit of a nice make out spot (as an angsty teenager with a car does), I found the curviest roads in my area, that are very secluded, it's rare I see other cars. I live in a pretty flat area so this was a big deal for me. Fast forward two highschool relationships (like 6 months max) a friend tells me about an anime called **Initial D** 

I became consumed.

I didn't have the money to make my car faster. So I did the next best thing. I worked on my suspension. I perfect my alignment every other week. Get the ride height to the perfect ""scrapes just a little but not too much to cause damage"" I get polyurethane bushings. Strut bar in the front. Rear strut bar.

Replace inner tie rods. Mixed up the sides. Causes a rack and pinion leak. 

Think about a manual rack swap.
Inner tie rod threads strip. 
Guess it's time to get a new rack and pinion anyways.

This is where it went all down hill. Every other night I had been driving out to this road. I practiced one or two runs. Its a pretty long course. I spent $20 on gas every week. I have the entire course memorized. I've taken fellow car friends out, but none of them want to race me. They know I'm super good at the road, they know they will lose. 

I have no one to race. I race myself. Get a 16 minute course on Google maps down to 6 minutes. The road is full of hair pin turns and hills. 

When the rack and pinion blew I already had side work that I needed to finish. I had a vacation coming up and paid a co worker to finish my side work for the customer. My car would have to wait after my vacation. When I return I have to wait another week for pay day to buy a new rack. We are 3 weeks in, no car. Part gets here a week later. Find out the input shaft on the rack and pinion is the wrong diameter. Order the right one. Another week. Part gets here. I'm burnt out on working on cars. I need to have someone else do it. Another week to wait for pay day to pay my co worker to do it. 5 weeks in. He doesn't have time to do it until another week. Finally 6 weeks in I get my car back. 

During this time, I became very angsty and fell in to a depression. I had built a relationship with my car. It was a part of my routine. I could no longer perfect my skills. I was miserable. I was miserable to be around. I became an asshole. I ruined my relationship with the girl I love. I said dumb things. On top of that, her mom does not think I should date her daughter. Don't get me started on that. It hurts to be with someone whose mom doesn't think you're very smart. Maybe shes right. 

I have my car back now. Everyone is gone to college. I plan on going in two semesters, but now it's just my car and I. Part of me is ok with that. But I know that I can't be that one guy with the red Miata.

So I sit here. In my car by myself. Listening to angsty songs. I have mastered all the roads in my area. No one challenges me. No one wants to challenge me. The few that have in recent times I haven't let them because I know they will crash because they are too eager, don't know the road and I am not willing to take that risk and be responsible for somebody's death. Nobody cares about mastering their cornering techniques. To become the very best. I'm lonely. No one to sit in my passenger seat. I am stuck as a ""Master lube tech"" (means I am ASE Certified and could do your piston rings or diagnose your electrical issues, but instead my boss wants me doing oil and rotates all day and I'm stuck at this job)

Everyone always asks would you rather have a civic full of friends or cry by yourself in a Lamborghini. I somehow ended up with Cry in a Civic. 

Anyways. Ive managed to keep the ""street racing"" on the down low with my parents. They think that my girlfriend and I broke up for just normal reasons. Not that my relationship with my car was more important to me than with the one girl who loved me and could've been the love of my life but I screwed it up.

I'm getting my wisdom teeth out on Wednesday.
I've only been high twice in my life. Once when I was little for dental work. The other with my dad when we didn't ventilate a room we were painting and using silicone to renovate. During that time I spilled my 14 year old guts about my pornography addiction and how I needed help.

So I guess wish me luck. I know it's coming. I'm going to tell my parents everything and they're going to be disappointed. They really liked my ex. She was really good for me. Made me a much better and happier person. I really liked my ex too. Infact I still do. Wish I wasn't retarded.

So what do I do. That whole advice about find a hobby and you'll meet like minded people and or or girls is terrible. Especially if your hobby is cars. So how do I get back in the dating scene. Or do I try to right my wrongs with my ex. What do I do about no longer being challenged on the only roads that I like to drive on. I don't have any friends and don't get along with many car enthusiasts. Most of them (at least where I live) are druggies and insecure idiots (like I'm not insecure or an idiot) 
 
Tl;Dr Help. I'm so stuck. I'm sad, lonely, disappointed. I want to professionaly race one day. I want someone who cares for me. I want to be respected at my job. I feel like I can only choose one.",25Aug2019,1
172,"So me (20f) and my boyfriend (24m) have been together for a year and a half now. We have a serious and good relationship. I love him very much and he loves me. 

He was with his ex for 3 years. They had a kid together. Ever since I found her Facebook like 5 months into our relationship I‚Äôve had some internal problems. 

I go through her pictures all the time. And I try to look like her. I try to do my makeup like her, my hair like hers, and dress like her. And I don‚Äôt feel satisfied with the way I look unless I see myself as looking like her. I feel SO ugly. And even worse, my bf and I have their daughter on weekends and I have to see her in person every week when she comes to pick her up. I take mental notes of how she looks so I can try to emulate. And I feel like absolute shit after I see her. I just feel like she‚Äôs so much prettier than me, why would my bf ever want me. I‚Äôve never had the greatest self confidence but it‚Äôs been rock bottom lately because of this. Every time I do my makeup or pick out an outfit I think of how to look like her more. I‚Äôve had people tell me I look like her, and I don‚Äôt know if that makes it worse or not. 

Its just getting to the point where it kills me. I feel disgusting because I don‚Äôt look like her. It‚Äôs embarrassing. I‚Äôve never spoken to my bf about this and I won‚Äôt. I just rant to my mom about it. She just says I‚Äôm beautiful in my own way but that just makes me feel worse. 

I don‚Äôt know how to get over this and just accept myself. All I think about when it comes to my appearance is how to look like her. I cut my hair and dyed it until it‚Äôs very very damaged in an effort to look like her. I just can‚Äôt stop.",25Aug2019,1

183,"I was wondering if it was okay to curse in a college essay. I have had problems with suicidal ideation and tendencies in my past, and I want to authentically capture my struggles (as well as some exact quotes from my rather strict father and my thoughts), which means my essay is going to be an absolute Tarantino movie. However, I figure since I'm already writing about putting a noose around my neck and swallowing pills in a ""testing the waters"" sort of way as a young teen, I would find it weird if they found my cursing offensive. Reading many college essays, none of them have cursed, and merely reflected positive values the authors possess, as well as hold the stereotypical ""OMG I'm so quirky"" sense of humor that seems popular with my generation. When reading something like The Things They Carried, the author created an air of authenticity by cursing-- though I'm not sure what he and I are doing are comparable in quality or tastefulness. I believe with my more serious tone and subject matter, my essay will really stand out amongst all the essays that talk about that one time some guy was slightly sad when a family member they never truly knew died. Also, do you think I could insert drawings in between the paragraphs or at the bottom of pages, Roald Dahl style? I think this is another factor that could really make my essay *pop*, as I am told I have a unique drawing style that really displays how I feel in my darkest moments -- it is important to note that I am submitting to many colleges, some of them liberal arts, though I will major in music composition and will also study piano performance seriously, rather than any visual arts. Given the ""artsy"" nature of some of these colleges, I figure they would be more open to cursing and illustrations-- though perhaps I'm wrong? I truly believe my struggles are best exemplified in cursing and art-- it's how I dealt with my struggles as a teen, and these elements are deeply intwined with who I was, which helped me to become who I am. My story is one about perseverance, and not the typical kind where it's like ""Oh, I just have to do this thing and work harder at it, and the truth was inside me all along and I never had to change who I was as a person and everything's better now"" typical bullshit I keep seeing in all these so-called ""great"" college essays. With depression in particular, long mood swings are typical-- after a few months of everything seeming normal, one can slink into a slump and suicidal ideation. Given the fact that my struggle is an ongoing one, and that I had no in-person role models to help me through my depression until a couple years after I found out I had it, I believe that my story will resonate with those who read it on a human level. The final line of my essay (as of now) is ""Is life worth living? I guess I'll have to stick around to find out."" I truly feel as if the way I described my story to you, in earnest detail, shows I'm constantly going through shit while not being vulnerable in a sea of essays where the trouble seems to be behind the author, will show that I'm willing to stick through anything to find happiness, even if my parents tell me the music I make is ""children's music no one would ever listen to"" while my piano teacher tells me that this particular piece is the greatest piece I have ever written. How I would keep arguing with my father at the risk of being hit, giving quotations, sources, and counterpoints to his arguments, only for him to end arguments with shit he doesn't know about with ""I'm not convinced,"" no matter how fucking wrong he is. How my grades were higher than the other students, despite these circumstances. I bÃ∂eÃ∂lÃ∂iÃ∂eÃ∂vÃ∂eÃ∂  *KNOW* that each and every part of these interactions, including how it has permanently altered my personality both for the worst and the better, how I stopped giving a fuck what people think if they don't know what they're talking about, how I had to undergo hypocrisy from those who *should* have been my role models, and how I learned to connect with others despite this treatment and be a best friend to many. Sorry about the rant (and the cursing-- I won't curse in my actual essays unless it's something someone actually said or I thought), but I feel I had to rant, because I'm fucked up for the rest of my life, and will almost inevitably have future suicidal episodes due to how I was treated. Again, I think the fact that my struggle is ongoing is going to stand out from the other essays. Also, my father won't be reading these essays, so no need to worry about that in the comments -- reddit's community has been so good to me, I knew people would worry!",25Aug2019,1

I think I‚Äôm a pedophile. 

The earliest memory I have of this is when I was very young probably 10. I touched my younger sibling. I only did it once and since then it‚Äôs haunted me. I didnt hurt them or make them do anything. And they never told our parents or mentioned it to me. I think they were just too young to care and have forgotten about it. 

There was one more instance. I was 13 and she must have been half my age I don‚Äôt remember. Nothing happened but looking back at it, I now realize that it was a small crush. 

Fast forward to now and I think it‚Äôs starting over again. It‚Äôs about one of my younger siblings friends that I always get nervous around. I steer clear of them everytime they come around. When I start to think of them, I stop and occupy myself with something else as I know it is wrong. 

I‚Äôm well aware and understand who I am and I believe that I could never hurt a person but what about the constant feeling I get when this younger person is around me? What if I move on only to find someone else who has replaced them? 

I am very close to my family, a religious one, and believe that if I told them about this they would abandon me in a second.

189,"Recently, two of my old friends and my mother passed away. I took the time off I thought I needed and now I'm back at work and starting a new position to go along side my old one. This is just for backstory so I don't seem like a complete fool for getting so upset over something small for others.

We were busy on and off throughout the day so I understand we were both stressed out. There were only two baggers working and one was outside helping a customer, the other one being myself. I asked a couple of months ago to be trained on registers to help out when we get busy cause I didn't like not being able to help out a whole lot. My supervisor told me to hope on a register and check but I was in the middle of bagging up a big order and when I looked around there was only two people in line, the one we were helping and the one she was helping. I told her there was only one person in line to which she replied ""well there was three a minute ago"". Which is fair cause again we'd been busy on and off.

I assume that was the end and I quickly rush back to finish bagging for our customer. I haven't even finished bagging one sack when she calls me over and pulls the good card. ""Don't you ever condescend me in front of a customer again"". I will add that she was done with her customer and another one walked up so a different employee had to start checking.

I was honestly shocked I've worked here for over a year and I've never once been hurtful or disrespectful to anyone there manager, supervisor or associate. I've never given attitude. The only thing I ever have pride for myself is my polite nature. This supervisor is always gossiping to others about people that work under her. But anyway, in my shock and rush to do my job I don't really think about what I say but I said that I wasn't condescending her but I was telling her there was only one person in line. I don't do well with confrontation and maybe I shouldn't have but I walk away again and just start doing my job for the rest of the day and not really talk to anyone and even maybe sorta cried a little.

Again I know this doesn't seem like a big deal and if I remove myself from the situation, even I know it isn't. But afterwards I hear her tell our boss about my disrespect. And then she is telling all my coworkers this too. Feels like I'm in highschool and I honestly do believe I'm above it and am worth more than it. I almost walked out cause I work my butt of and am nice everyday. I do know that I work in 5 different departments in this store and I'm told I'm valuable to the company but...

I don't know. Like how to I respect someone and continue to work with someone so childish? I'm a 19F so tell me if I'm overreacting or not I just feel like her pulling me away from my job to chew me out in front of the customers (sound familiar?) was just a completely wrong move and I wish we just could have talked or laughed it off. I forgive pretty easily but ever since I figured out I have a strong work ethic and focus I know I deserve at least the respect of you pinky finger you know.

In November I matched with this guy. He was the perfect match. We texted all day every day. The only weird thing was he would flake any time it was suggested we meet up. He would at the last second come up with an excuse, even if he were the one who suggested hanging out. I figured he was nervous because we are both kind of shy.

After thanksgiving break we were finally able to meet up and I fell for him instantly. It seemed like Brandon and I wanted the same things. Immediately after I left he texted to see if I would want to meet up with him again.

Fast forward to December and nothing has really happened. We live a 5 minute walk from each other but have only met up twice. We still text almost every day, but his replies have become significantly less involved. I‚Äôm lucky if there is more than one sentence. After Christmas break, I only received texts once or twice a week.

 In the proceeding months, the only times we would actually hang out was by eating at the same place coincidentally a couple times a week. We‚Äôd eat for a half hour and then he‚Äôd peace out. 

In March I found out he had gotten back with his ex. He never bothered to tell me and it left me quite hurt because I still had a huge crush on him. I ghosted him (I know, jerk move) soon after because I realized I deserved better. After 3 weeks he texted me asking where I was. I started talking to him again because I couldn‚Äôt hold back.

This summer he broke up with his girlfriend. Again, he never mentioned it. One night we got somewhat deep in conversation and he said that I was one of 3 friends in his life. The only thing that went through my mind was that if I was his friend, why was he treating me like shit?

I currently have a bit of a ‚Äòretro‚Äô look. A mo and hair that‚Äôs a centre part and curtains (so a shortish undercut and long hair that sits to about the bottom of my ears). Should I suck it up and change my look to get a more professional look, or could I get away with my hair being up in a man-bun as sort of a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô kind of look that a lot of guys do? The mo I definitely believe would have to go, right? There isn‚Äôt really a positive reception around the by the public these days.

###**Behaviour:**
Are there any tips on how I should: speak, present myself and my presence, physical movements and stature, hand gestures etc.? Should I generally be as concise as possibly when speaking, or would some evidence of good chat ability (being a very people-person driven job) potentially do some good? 


I think that‚Äôs all for now, thank you anyone and everyone for anything you might have for me. I appreciate it all :)",25Aug2019,1
205,"I'm 18, and I live with my grandparents. I have three sisters, but I don't live with them and was raised an only child. 

When I was a kid, I was never made to do chores or anything like that. My grandma just wanted to spoil me, and she's told me things like ""I just want my kids to have a life I've never had."" 

But it's like she forgot I was a kid, or it's almost like she expected me to stay young forever. I've always tried to be a good kid, but as I've grown and matured she would continue to treat me like I was 5. She does everything for me, even when I've asked her to let me help. She just goes back to doing what she's always done. 

And I'm not sure what's happened over the years, but even my grandpa will treat me like I'm 5 and then turn around and expect me to know how to do things. They've never taught me how to cook, how to clean,  ect. 

My grandpa is the kind of man who, when it's not done the way he wants it to be, it's not the ""right"" way and this used to piss me off as a kid and I wouldn't even want to learn new things, because if I did them wrong it meant I was stupid or dumb. 

But I'm also different in general. My grandpa is traditional, even though he's never taught me any of his traditions. I am quiet. I don't like small talk, and when around my grandparents all they want to do is talk about things that aren't interesting to me. If I try to talk about something that interests me, it gets called weird or they give me weird looks and judge me. I eventually just stopped trying to talk to them at all. 

All throughout highschool, even middle school, I tried telling them I had depression and anxiety, even got them to take me to the doctor finally, but they still refused to believe even my doctor's diagnosis and when my condition would start to get bad, like when I would start feeling so bad I didn't even want to go to school, they would threaten to call the cops on me because they weren't going to jail because of me. I mean I remember trying to explain what was wrong, but all I got was, ""School is more important than how you feel."" 

And now that I'm 18, I'm starting to feel like I'm going nuts. Everyone at work likes me, they all think I'm a sweet person and most like working with me because they say I know what I'm doing and am fun to be around. And I guess it's worse because I'm working night shift, so nobody is ever awake by the time I get home except my grandpa.

But at home and around family I just feel so different and alone. I didn't mention it, but both my biological parents are substance abusers, and my entire life my grandpa has been comparing me to my mom, and blaming me for all the problems he has today since I am a product of ""the family."" I am my mom's second kid, and I guess they felt like they had no choice, but they did take me in and when I eventually dropped out of high school, my grandpa went on a tangent about how he did all those nice things for me and spent so much money only for me to end up like the rest of the trash. 

 But I just feel so hated and like I can't fix my relationship with them. My grandpa is actually afraid of me at times, and I think it's because when I was younger, he would go on long rants about my grandma, and it was always in front of my grandma, so my first instinct was to tell him to shut up because it hurt me to see her so hurt. Then sometimes he'd rant to me, and I was like 12, and no matter what I did or said he would not leave me alone about whatever was pissing him off. But the things he would say would hurt my feelings, and he wouldn't even stop talking if i started crying. So a few times I acted out by trying to hit him, just to get to him to shut the fuck up. It wasn't okay, or right, but I was a kid and I didn't know how else to handle that situation, because there are no locks on any of the doors in the house.

237,"Hi all,

I'm so tired of all this. All I ever seem to do is change my mind. I don't think I've had any sense of certainty in anything I do for ages now. I just can't seem to make my mind up. I will choose something, and absolutely obsess about it for a while, then go and do the complete polar opposite. It's usually things that are pretty defining to your character too, like political alignment. I'll switch from one end to the complete other in a matter of minutes. What?? Have other people done this too? I've made so many different reddit accounts and end up throwing them all away because I'm just not the person I've made out to be online.

I've changed my mind about gender, sexuality, political alignment, philosophical outlooks, mental health, relationships with other people. It's exhausting. I tell people one thing, then go on to change my mind and boom - what I told them isn't true any more.

It's like I just have no sense of self. I feel lost.

I will constantly fluctuate between states of happiness and depression. I saw a doctor about my anxiety and depression, who suggested that I was, in fact demonstrating indicators of both conditions, but then - before my first appointment - I completely change my mind about the situation. No unhealthy levels of anxiety, and no depression. I feel like I'm faking it all. This doesn't make sense, those sort of things don't just go away overnight, so I must be faking it.

I have a turbulent relationship with my parents, going between loving them immensely, to hating them. I don't like that at all. They've given me so much, and they deserve all the love in the world.

I've read up online about all this stuff, and borderline personality disorder comes up. Naturally, I'm tentative to take a Google diagnosis, because that's just immature, but I can't help relating a bit. I have convinced myself in the past that I do have certain mental illnesses, which is so stupid. Maybe I'm just a selfish person. Maybe I'm an attention seeker. Regardless, with BPD, I'm unsure because I've had a fine life. This is what leads me to believe that I'm just a selfish person who's making all this stuff up for attention.

I just want to be a normal person, live a normal life and be happy. If I don't know who I really am, I think I could have some trouble with that.

240,"Hi I'm Carl (16yoM). I initially met my friends in 7th grade band and we've had our ups and downs.

Even though I dropped school band in freshman year, we still had weekly D&amp;d sessions or played videogames together.

I was the 'dumb' one of the group. I was never in any AP classes, but I always passed my regular courses with A's, B's or C's. It didn't help that I have a speech impediment making me sound like Ed from ed, ed, and eddy.

Despite that, I was proficient at drawing, played the guitar rather well, and skateboarded at a base level. I knew a lot about videogames because of the time I spent alone with myself.

This past sophomore year, we drifted apart. Crush#1 started dating Friend#1. But, we still had our weekly D&amp;d session, except Crush#1 would show up. The blow that knocked me down was when Crush#2 dumped me to date Friend#2. I cried when that happened.

Now this current year (junior year), I finally thought we were all friends again, apparently not. I started taking AP classes, and even had some classes with my friends of the inner circle. I even joined theatre because of them. But, Friend#3's birthday rolls around and I don't get an invite.

(Friend#3 has been around since preschool. We've had our laughs and tears, but never drifted too far apart. Despite him coming from a poor family, his work ethic is something to be admired. He's one of the reasons I joined theatre. He's kinda the person who's friends with everybody, but his best friends were in the inner circle)

Thinking nothing of it, I was happy because I could get to spend some time with my cousins from out of town. I remembered what fun me and my friends had at the arcade, so I take them there.

When I get there, I see all Friends from the inner circle with Friend#3's girlfriend and Acquaintance#1. I walk up to them with a ""What the hell?"", but proceed into the arcade with my cousins.

I shakily spend the evening trying not to think too deep of what's going on, but now I'm deep within the void. Can someone please give me advice?

242,"I really need some outside eyes to look into my situation and tell me the best next move or how to deal with the what if. 

TL;DR: I was emotionally abused and manipulated by my best friend in middle school only for my boyfriend to dump me and get together with them in high school. I've learned he wishes we were still in contact, and he misses me. I miss him too. How do I deal with my uncertainity? How do I weed out what's BS and what's actually true? Is what she did really as serious as I think or am I being overdramatic?

So when I was in middle school, I became really good friends with someone who I'd known for a very long time, but had never connected with until this point. They seemed cool and everything up until I started noticing paterns in their behavior and how it would really bring me down. I didn't really understand what was going on, and even now I have a hard time really defining what was happening. Basically, they would get upset over something, and demand my full attention to it in subtle ways. However whenever I was dealing with something, they would simply compare it to something they'd gone through that was worse and leave it at that (please note: the thing that was ""worse"" was typically an exaggeration of what was really going on, and they were just being whiny). They'd belittle me, get jealous and put me down, and so much more. The best way I sum up how that friendship worked is through one conversation I had with them that I remember as if it happened yesterday: They were upset over something (something so small and meaningless, I get second-hand embarrassment just knowing what it was), and I didn't know what to say. For whatever reason, I thought that if I showed them I was going through something pretty serious, maybe they'd feel less alone in their struggles. I told them about the fact that I'd had suicidal thoughts for a very long time, and they, without looking at me or hesitating, said ""That's where you and I are different; you've never attempted it."" That was our entire friendship. Constant comparison and what I believe were lies used to manipulate and control. They would also twist the truth to make me look like a bad person. We stopped being friends for a period of time in seventh grade, and they told everyone it was because they were an atheist. I'm religious, but that's not even remotely close to the reason I stopped being friends with them. I was exhausted with their antics, and the way they dumped all their problems on me without taking advice or anything. Not to mention they never helped me with my problems and made it seem like my life was so easy, and I had absolutely no reason to be upset about anything. They did subtle things to copy me as well. And they got upset when anything good happened to me. I've been calling it abuse since I don't have a better way of explaining it. 

Now, I stopped being friends or associating with them before my freshman year of high school began. I thought I was done with them. My boyfriend at the time ended up breaking up with me about a week or two before homecoming. Only for him to start hanging out with them a lot. That seriously hurt me especially because he wanted to stay friends, and he knew I had issues with them. I took advice from my sister and started ignoring him and completely cut him off. A few months later, they started dating. I was so upset over it, I lost my appetite and couldn't make myself eat for about a week. I ended up cutting ties with all my friends at the time (again following my sister's advice), and I finished the year feeling very broken. From my perspective, it was like no one would listen to my experience with this person. I had told someone before about what happened, and she just shrugged it off like it was no big deal. Everyone loved them. Everyone. And when they got together with my ex, I was told that I was wrong for being upset over it. In fact, I felt like everyone hated me and considered me the ""villain"" of this story. Another time when I tried telling someone what happened between this person and I, he told me he already knew. I asked what exactly he knew, but he wouldn't tell me. He told me it was a secret he promised to keep. What could that even mean?  I went into the summer feeling so broken and angry. I had to work on rebuilding myself with the help of some very close friends of mine who knew about the situation, and my experience with this person.

A few years later, I'm now homeschooled, and I have rebuilt myself. I'm more confident and stronger than I've ever been. However, recently I've learned that my ex really regrets how he hurt me, and he wishes we could still be friends. He misses me a lot. And I miss him a lot. We were really really good friends before we even started a relationship. I miss that friendship, but now I'm faced with the opportunity to be able to start that up again. I believe my mental state is in a good enough place that I could handle seeing him, and talking to him again. And I really want to give him another chance. 

I'm seeking advice in how to handle this, really. And whether or not what that person did was as serious as I've always thought. I'm afraid of being lied to again, and having my uncertainty about what really happened return. I'm willing to accept that my perspective could be inaccurate due to how emotional I was at the time, but how do I know whats BS and whats real when/if I hear it?  How do I deal with unpleasant truths? And when the time comes, how do I tell him what happened to me? Would he listen to me or believe me? Should I just shut him out completely even though I want to give him a second chance? Am I making a mistake?",25Aug2019,1

247,"Hi, I'm a 17 year old guy in 12th grade. Last year I volunteered to DJ my old elementary school's Saturday-night Halloween and Christmas dances they always put on every year, playing for a crowd of kids in kindergarten through 6th grade.

My strategy last year was to borrow one of the teacher's laptops in order to access the school's wi-fi and download a VPN onto it in order to access YouTube, then play like 90% radio edits of old school rap songs with the other 10% being reggae songs (it's very popular here in Hawaii, we got lots of local reggae artists) and requests from the kids. The kids all seemed to think I was pretty good, but not the best DJ they ever had.

I'm trying to adopt a new strategy this year to be better than the last. I'll have to download the songs onto my laptop because the school's wi-fi was kinda unreliable and kept conking out on me during the last half-hour of the dance. My new ideas for this year's playlist strategy are as follows, which one should I go with?

1. Look at that week's Billboard Hot 100 and download the top 40 songs, then download 93.1 FM's top 10 local and reggae songs, and just play those same songs all night.
2. Ask all the young kids I know to recommend me songs to download, and mix them in with a lineup of my personal favorite songs (maybe 70% kids-recommended/30% personal favorites).
3. Just play some of my favorite reggae and old school rap songs all night, with maybe the top 4 songs from the Billboard Hot 100 sprinkled in once every hour.",25Aug2019,1

252,"Hey everyone, first reddit post here (but longtime lurker).

I need some career advice.

I have an opportunity to leave my ‚Äúdream job‚Äù for a 44% pay raise. Should I do it? 

Quick numbers:

Current job I make  $49,700, make my own schedule, free housing provided (in California), full benefits, can take my dog with me wherever I go, and I get 2 weeks vacation. Not much room for growth though, I will probably cap out around $65k. This is a non-profit company of about 50 employees and they only service California - so relocation back to the east coast where my family is from isn‚Äôt an option. If I want to move back, I‚Äôll have to start at a new company from scratch.

New job is offering $72,020 with a ton of room for growth. I would be getting over $100k within 5 years. No housing. Fixed schedule. Longer hours. Start with 4 weeks PTO. Large corporation, over 1,000 employees, full benefits with stock options in 4 years. Possibility to relocate closer to family when the time comes. 

I‚Äôm 28, male, single, 1 dog, and no debt other than student loans. 

Has anyone else left their dream job for money? Was it worth it? I can‚Äôt help but think I should take the better paying job and set my future self up a little better financially. 

Any feed back is welcome, thank you!

TL; DR : $49k for fun job or $70k for normal job",25Aug2019,2

277,"I'll give you all the facts as objectively as I can. My parents and I are at a real loss on how to help my sis and her kids. Here's the rundown, it's long, but context is important:

\- A few years ago, when their first child was 3 months old, Husband attempted suicide.

\- When instructed by authorities to look for a suicide note, Sister found a 50+ page document that detailed how much Husband hates her. An additional \~20 page ""suicide note"" was written as a letter to their 3 month old, detailing why death was such an attractive option, and also, the ""truth"" about what a terrible person his mother is.

\- Sister also discovered that Husband had been cheating on her with another woman until the day they got engaged. When Husband called Sister to let her know he had OD'ed on pills &amp; booze and asked her to call an ambulance, she later discovered he'd texted and called the woman he'd cheated on her with before he called her for help.

\- Husband had two DWIs we knew about well before this. Our family always thought Husband occasionally overdid it with the drinking, and would benefit from cutting back, but the suicide attempt shined a light on the problem he had with alcohol ... we're talking full blown alcoholic.

\- Husband is forced to go on antidepressants when being treated at the hospital.

\- Sister doesn't leave. She makes his attending sessions with a therapist a condition for her staying. He goes for one year before stopping. Unclear when he stopped taking meds to help with depression.

\- Sister gets pregnant with their second kid.

\- The general vibe with their marriage for the last couple years has been that they're in it for the kids and divorcing when they're out of high school. So, not good by any means, but they'd achieved a balance that seemed to work for them regardless of how healthy it is.

\- He relapses with the drinking and comes home pissed from time to time, but he's an alcoholic not getting the help he needs ... so, not 100% shocking.

\- Following the suicide attempt, Sister doesn't really talk about Husband or their relationship. She's retreated into herself more and more. We want to support her as much as possible, but she's very reluctant to share much at all.

\- During the past few years, I'd receive letters from Husband. Nothing THAT out of the ordinary. Just his usual weird stuff. Example: I send them big boxes of my kid's clothes so the cousins can wear hand-me-downs. Husband sends thank you note, as if written by Niece ... quirky, but kind ... only the note details how Niece is so thankful because Sister doesn't go out and buy clothes, is a shut-in ... etc. Lots of disparaging crap about Sister. I tell Husband to cut it out. He doesn't send any more after that.

\- A few months ago, I was talking to my mom and she mentions ""something happened"" with Sister and Husband, but she doesn't want to tell me because she knows it will upset me.

\- This week, my mom calls me. The same thing has happened again and now she wants my opinion on how to handle. So, what happened: Husband sent her &amp; my dad a 15 page letter - with footnotes (?!?! WTF) - detailing why Husband hates sister, she's a terrible person, he's keeping a journal about everything she does (like watches too much TV &amp; doesn't exercise enough ... literally the examples he gives of terrible things she does) so that when the kids are old enough, they can learn what a terrible mother and person she really is. This over and over. And the previous letter is exactly the same type of thing.

\- What's maybe the most bizarre and upsetting thing is just how passive aggressive Husband is. Examples:

\- Sister wanted a destination wedding. Husband tells her ""whatever you want, whatever makes you happy."" But, husband tells his family he does not want to have a destination wedding. Sister is making him do this. She's isolating him. Husband talks about this a lot in the first letter to my parents ... how much he didn't want that to happen, what a terrible idea it was ... 

\- Sister currently wants to move to a new state. She's applying for jobs there. She's planning a trip in a couple weeks to look at houses there. Husband tells her, ""yeah, I'm finally ready to move ... I think this is a good idea."" Husband says he's applied to jobs there. Says he reached out to a family member who lives there to see if they can stay at her house during their upcoming visit, but she just hasn't emailed back yet."" The letters to my parents say, ""he's given up, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em ... Sister can isolate him and the kids further, he doesn't want to go."" etc. etc.

\- So ... that's the deal with Husband. Sister, on the other hand, isn't the picture of perfection. She has crippling anxiety issues that she refuses to address. She's seen many therapists in the past. Tried many medications, but has always stopped. Despite our encouragement, she always says she doesn't have enough time or money to go to therapy and ultimately, she doesn't think it works. She's borderline agoraphobic (IMO), but she holds down a full time job that she cares a lot about and she's doing such an amazing job raising her kids.

&amp;#x200B;

After all that background, here are the things I'd really love advice on:

\- My mom doesn't want to show Sister the letters. She says they will devastate her. I don't disagree, but I'm legitimately afraid Husband is a Family Annihilator type and I want her to get the eff out of that marriage. Won't solve all her problems, but it'll take care of one big one. Should my mom show her the letters? And shouldn't it be sooner rather than later?

\- How can I help Sister get help? She rejects any and all support I offer. Or even, how can I get my sister talking to me more about her relationship again? We talk multiple times a week ... she never talks about it, even when I ask.

\- IMO, Husband is unhinged. If Sister is unwilling to leave, should I think about ways to get the kids out of there? I don't know if I'd even have any legal grounds, but I know it's not the best environment with him around and the two of them as an example of what's supposed to be a loving relationship. And if I have the means to help them, shouldn't I?",25Aug2019,2

280,"**(TLDR at bottom)** 
My brother likes this chick at our job. The problem is they both had interests in each other, until they hung out more. Then my brother felt like she didn't share the same feelings that he had for her. So he got upset and said ""What did I do wrong."" I was there for him, told him to move on. Dont blame himself.  
He said he would move on, stop chasing her. Stop beating himself up.  
  
He didnt. He chased her again. He wanted to be with her all the time, texted her every day. Then boom. Again they had the same problem. He got upset, we talked about it again. Same thing, ""I'm getting over her, I'm done with her"".  
  
THEN AGAIN were at work and hes all over her. Follows her around. Texts her. AND AGAIN the same thing happens. She even talked about going to another guy's house that night. (One of her ex's)  
He was upset again, same thing happened. We talked about it again, I repeated what I kept saying. She isnt worth it. Get over her. Stop falling back into the same dumb shit. Stop obsessing over her.  
  
Now finally when we were all at work, she was hanging with another guy. She basically completely ignored my brother. Followed the other guy around all day. And then my brother saw her laying on his chest while sitting down. Both holding hands and other nonsense.  
So after he saw this, he was upset again. This time when I said for him to move on, he said hes done with her.  
But I said I doubt it. And that with his history, hes going to fall for the same shit again and he'll be back at square one. He said for me to not be so negative, and that he was being honest this time. This time was different, he said. I told him that I like to hear that. And just wish he was being honest.  
  
So come the next day, were at work. Shes there. And what do you know, he goes to her. Waits around with her. Hanging around her all day. As if absolutely nothing happened. He just pretends *(or maybe actually thinks)* that everything is perfectly fine.  
 
  
So I'm done trying to give advice to someone who doesn't listen and doesnt care what I have to say. He will inevitably end up sad again, blame himself and say he's gonna get over her. Rinse and repeat.  
  
How can I tell him that if he wants to keep doing this dumb shit, that I want absolutely no part in it.  
I want to be there for him, because we're brothers. But I cant keep giving advise to someone who doesnt listen.  
  
How in the nicest way can I tell him that I dont care about this problem, if he doesn't care about my advice? But with him knowing that I still care about him, and want to be there.  
  
*TLDR:* Brother likes a woman at our job. They had a ""thing"" for each other. She distanced herself from him, after some time. He got upset. I told him move on. He said he would. He chased her again. Same thing happened, he got upset. Repeat. Shes hanging with a different guy. She goes to different guys houses. He said hes done with her. Back at work, hes chasing her again.  
How do I tell him that I dont care about that situation any more, if he doesnt care about my advice. But in the nicest way. I still want him to know I'm there for him.",25Aug2019,1

This one freshman and I were chatting it up, and turns out he was pretty chill and he ended up being pretty hilarious to the point where nearly anything he‚Äôd say made me laugh. We were both into the same things, such as competitive pokemon and anime and such, and I had a fun time with him. 

The thing that made it uncomfortable as fuck was the fact that I, as a 21 year old senior could possibly be 4 years older than this guy, and the fact that my friend was trying to hook me up with someone (on the same day, mind you) who could possibly be underage was weird as hell to me. 

To give some context, I‚Äôve never been in a relstionship, and ever since i‚Äôve expressed my interest in entering one to them, it‚Äôs been a tad irritating listening to ‚ÄúThis is your chance!‚Äù conversations.

284,"Been on a trip to a foreign county with my gf. 6 days in out of a month.

She suffers from anxiety and is medicated. When she gets anxious, she yells at me and is overall incredibly mean, no matter how calm I remain. If I tell her something like she‚Äôs being mean or hurtful, she says that I‚Äôm doing the same (because I‚Äôm telling her that, it hurts her and is me being mean. I say this in a calm tone).

She also gets incredibly irritated by little things. For example, if I have allergies and sniffle, she gets mad at me. If I silently move my lis a certain way, she gets mad at me. It feels like she‚Äôs watching for every micro movement I make just for the sole purpose of getting mad at me.

Whenever I try to resolve issues and hug her (this is how she says she wants issues to be resolved), she just pulls away and yells at me. If I stop hugging her while I‚Äôm being yelled at, she yells at me for that.

Her therapist told her that it‚Äôs not her fault that she has these angry outbursts at people, so she expects me to comfort her when she‚Äôs yelling at me.

Yesterday was an all day issue. She was mad as soon as we got on the subway because I looked at the map and nodded in the direction we needed to walk. She started yelling at me telling me we‚Äôre not a team. I hugged her and she just snapped at me. I pulled back and she just got more mad. She just had this terrible attitude all day after that.

I was in the shower the day prior and she opened the door, starred at me, said in an angry tone ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù I just said ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, then she closed the door.

Today, we slept in and she got mad at me that we slept in.

This is apparently how every relationship she‚Äôs ever had has ended.

I knew she had these issues, and I had seen them a bit before, but I never realized just how extreme they were.

I've not lived in the same city for a couple years but have moved back. Recently things have been hectic and changing in both our lives. And the relationship has become increasingly toxic, him sending me angry abusive messages accusing me of things I haven't done, me getting frustrated with my friend and snapping at him in front of other friends and embarrassing him. 

We had a reconciliation chat after a big fight that just left me feeling exhausted. I sent a message asking for some space while I sort my life out. 

But he's been messaging me all the time still after five days no contact, inviting me to hang out. I don't want to see him though, I'm busy with my new job and he lives so far from me it's not practical all the time. 

Last time he messaged me about 25 messages in a row while I was out with friends and I got freaked out. It was over nothing, just a family argument. I told him sorry, I need to get up for work.

 It was 2am by this point and he knew I was up early but he wouldn't stop messaging me. I confronted him, tried to put him on ignore but I was so worked up I couldn't sleep. 

Tl;dr: 

Big fight with best friend. I asked for space. He's not respecting it and trying to see me when I don't want to meet.

It wasnt too bad but she wasnt too nice about it, just said she couldnt. I liked her until mid 7th grade and then we drifted. In 8th grade she tried to talk to me, and i just didnt wannna get back into it and i knew she would never like me because i wasnt hot enough for her. (Im a guy if u canf tell) She had everything, personality, the best looks, funny, smart. Everything! When freshman year started, we started talking again. And I learned through a mutual friend that she had a crush on me. Maybe because although my looks didnt get much better, i became a way cooler person and had popular friends. Well, it didnt turn out well, she also liked a hotter guy with a dumb personality. but obviously he had the charisma so she got with him. and we kept talking because i was in love again and we became best friends. she said i was like her brother. at a party she said i was cute because i was stupid then and she thought i wasnt paying attention, but laughed as she said it, as if it was funny she thought i was cute.

293,"I am in a quasi-position of authority (think shift-supervisor). 

Marijuana use is prohibited while clocked in and working at my job.

Two employees took a quick break together. Both cam back glassy eyed, and behaving differently.

I noticed the change, pulled them aside, and accused them both, at the same time, of being under the influence.

One of them admitted it, the other feigned allergies.

I have no personal stake in either of these employees losing or keeping their jobs. They are both great workers, and I rely on them daily without fail. 

However, if it were to somehow get out that I knew of the situation, and did nothing, I could easily be in trouble, but I'm unsure to what degree.

I'm afraid that the person who denied it has leverage on me for knowing and doing nothing. I'm also afraid that other co-workers could have noticed and may bring it up, and thus cause the gossip train to begin.

Nothing has been recorded so far, and I could easily deny ever accusing them, if pressed.

301,"So I joined a meetup group ([meetup.com](https://meetup.com)) awhile back that was for making friends and socialising. I attended two of the meetups, and there was this girl who sat next to me. Through the activities of the meetup I found out that we both had quite a lot in common (a friend who came with me and is a girl even said we seemed really similar), I never actually had a proper conversation with her though, but the meetups were very personal discussion heavy where we'd talk about ourselves and ask each other questions, so we had some interaction and I think I learned a lot about her just from those two meetups.

I was interested in talking to her more, but the group hasn't had any meetups since then, and I can't find her profile on the group anymore meaning she has left the group. So out of curiosity I went on Facebook and searched her name up (she didn't have a surname in the group) and considered maybe sending her a message, but she has a really common first name and I couldn't find anyone who looked like her, so I just left it for a month.

So just yesterday I looked up her name again and somewhere not too far along the line I found a profile without a profile picture, so I clicked on it, and I looked at the page with her 'likes' and knew straight away from things she said that this was her profile (I have an unusually good memory for facts about people that they've shared.)

I guess the issue here is that I'd like to contact her and ask if she wants to chat, but I don't know if this would be the wrong thing to do and make her uncomfortable, especially considering the circumstances, that I haven't had a whole lot of interaction with her, and the way I found her on facebook was a bit stalkerish since she doesn't have any photos of herself.

I'm also aware of how women face a lot of bullshit in terms of harassment and improper behaviour from guys, and that some guys use meetup groups to ""pick up women"", I feel like for me the gender isn't important here, if it were a guy I felt a strong connection/commonality with I'd probably have stalked them too and wanted to be friends.

My issue is I dont want to come out of the closet while still living with them because by that night I'll either be living under a bridge or thrown off one. I feel trapped because i cant express myself at all and its driving me insane. I would move away for college, or live out of a car for the time being but with the disability I cant really drive. I'm at my the end of my wits with living with them because I feel attacked anytime we go out and they go on a 15 minute rant anytime they see something pride related.

314,"Me, (17M) recently went back to my BF (15M) that I broke up with a month or so ago because I felt that he was too clingy, but then realized I was just being stupid. I've definitely changed, and he thinks I did too but he needs more time to see it. Multiple things scare me about getting back together with him though. Even though we get along super well and even act like a couple again sometimes, I feel like he still doesn't love me again and I worry he never will. Also, I know that his parents, his mom specifically, hate me. That's understandable but either way, even if things do work out in the upcoming months I feel like they'll still hate me no matter what I do. 

I'm beginning to have second thoughts about everything, but I know if I leave him now again it'll not only be for good, but I'll be back to feeling completely unloved. Another reason I went back to him was I felt like after that, no one liked or cared about me and I felt so alone.

316,"Cw: i talk about weight and body issues!!! Also its three in the morning rn and im writing this on my phone in the dark so formatting and spelling might not be top notch. Sorry!! 





Hi all! I was fat in high school. Not like morbidly obese, but a solid large in straight sizes. Im still a little chub chub, but ever since I moved away from home I lost some pounds and Im now a size small. It took me a year, and Im still trying to loose a couple of vanity pounds but I did it relatively healthily and I assure you I do not have an eating disorder. I went home for the first time in a while, but boy did everyone else think diffrent. Ive gotten a whole spectrum of reactions and all of them make my awkward ass fucking uncomfortable!!!!!


For excample, theres my friends who I havent seen in literally a year. We usually shoot the shit with and tease; thats normal. But one of them has been pressing on my weight loss and seriously insinuating that im anorexic and trying to be cool now. I laugh and play along, but like he mentions it alot and idk why it bugs me.


My dad has been pretty supportiveish, hes on the heavier side and also trying to loose weight. But now hes like, a fucking nutritionist and constantly checking out what I eat and making sure I get enough protien,oils,minerals etc etc since Im also mainly vegan now. Im also quizzed alot on what I normally eat, how often, and other dietary things. He also gets sus when I dont eat alot with him. The truth of the matter is; the reason I dont eat alot of his food is because, while delicious and pretty healthy, is loaded with so much olive oil that I get very bad diarrhea everytime I eat too much and I dont have the heart to tell him. 


My mother however is the worst. Shes a petite Korean woman, and a big part korean culture is centered around looks. When I came back over the summer, she was estatic. She kept on taking pictures of me to send to her friends, telling me how pretty I was now (minus my eyes which look like my dads), and just like being hype in general that I could now fit into smaller clothes. I dont like how the photos she now takes of me no longer use those weird asian filter apps or how she now is somehow cool with me pulling up to her old workplace (an h-mart) to be seen by former co-workers when before she made me wait outisde or go in at seperate times. Shes also weirdly very unsupportive of the fact that I dont wanna eat animal products anymore and in this week living with her Ive had to go lacto ovo pescatarian or I str8 up would not be able to eat. My stomach is a mess now because of this sudden diet change lol. 


Im only in my hometown for another week, but this fucking sucks. I dont want every other comment about me to be on my weight, i just wanna spend time with friends and family. I cant just ask people not to approach the subject, because then it deadass looks like I have an eating disorder. I just wanna go home and eat my normal shit and hang out with my other friends who arent anal about this type of stuff. What do I do?",25Aug2019,1
317," Bare with me since reddit is the only thing I thought of to ask advice from, I‚Äôm also shit at writing. I have a close friend who I‚Äôve know for maybe 2 years now. He‚Äôs hilarious and kind, not 100% corrupt with dark/inappropriate humour but still has his share of history memes and slightly offensive humour. I‚Äôve recently been catching myself thinking about him without realizing it, is this a sign I like him? I really enjoy his company and whenever we‚Äôre together I notice myself staring at him or at least glancing from time to time. I‚Äôm kind of an impulsive person, I make rash decisions that range from thinking it‚Äôs the right thing to do at work, to saying something random to try to appeal to whoever I‚Äôm with. This has given me a title known by my peers as the ‚ÄúAutistic lying loser‚Äù and I honestly don‚Äôt have much motivation to change it. So I‚Äôm used to people not liking me.

But recently he has been doing things I don‚Äôt really expect him to do. You see, I go to school with him but I have to leave next year (this September) to another school and possibly another country. He‚Äôs expressed his disapproval and says things will be boring without me and now he‚Äôll have to actually pay attention. See, I left school before it officially ended, I‚Äôd say maybe February or April was when I had just stopped going. I‚Äôve been going through some things that required me to go to a couple hospitals and therapy programs. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about my leave since I didn‚Äôt really expect it either, and from what I heard the teachers I have class with told my classmates that I would be leaving due to ‚ÄúHealth problems‚Äù. This kind of concerned friends about me but none really ask since we normally keep to ourselves, and it isn‚Äôt the type of group to share personal problems. So when he reached out to me to ask me what happens and if I was ok gave me an amazing feeling, the feeling of the weight for pressure and the thought of people not caring about me lifted off. He‚Äôs the innocent-ish one in the group so I passed it off as just concern. 

But at the same time I want it to be more. And when I think about it he‚Äôs the kind of guy I like. I don‚Äôt have a preference for looks nor height because the ones I liked before all were, named by my siblings, as either short, ugly, or average. So I guess I don‚Äôt have the highest standards, because the most I care about is their humour, if they have one similar to mine they‚Äôre already a potential crush I have in mind. And he‚Äôs someone who fits it well, not 100% corrupt nor does he get offended often. He likes offensive and history jokes which in my mind is a jackpot. But the reason I‚Äôm confused now is when he sent me messages saying that he wouldn‚Äôt be that concerned if the world was ending today, yeah he‚Äôs be scared to death but he wouldn‚Äôt show it. He told me one of his final wishes would be to talk to me in person, and catch. This is what sent me to reddit. Is this just rambling or could it be something more? And is me thinking about him in such a high place a sign that I like him?",25Aug2019,1

325,"(This is a long one boys buckle up, I'm also typing this at 2:30 in the morning so there will be typos, I might come back and clean this up tomorrow)

This is driving me completely crazy so any advice is appreciated.

I love my job. I'm a college student and have been working aftercare in a nursery school for the past five years, which is longer then most of the teachers (makes poor hiring choices but that's another issue entirely) . I attend classes 9am-2pm and work 2pm-5:30pm five days a week, on my days off from school I'm normally subbing, I've given up my past three summers to work the schools summer camp, and I do this because I really do love it. There's something so magically about watching and aiding in a child's development and seeing that child grow makes every inconvenience worth it. I work with kids 0-2 y/o which means I'm always on the move. My kids are learning to walk, and talk, some a potty training, some are still in diapers, some need naps in the afternoon and bottles at specific times, we're an allergy free school so I need to know what allergies any child has and what to do if that allergy is triggered, all this while keeping a gaggle of 10+ toddlers on a schedule and making sure each is happy and feels loved.

I kick ass at my job. I know every child in that schools name, I know the names of the parents I work with, I'm friends with almost every teacher in the school. I'm contently being told how good I am at my job so at some point I  stopped trying to be humble about it, I'm good at what I do. I'm on top of shit.

The one and only problem is my boss. She's entitled, incompetent, and above all an ignoramus. Everyone who's ever worked for her knows this.

Tonight (a Saturday) she sent me an email that makes me sick to think about even hours after reading it. I wont post the email word for word but I will be going over the main points:

1. ""Several"" of the teachers have come to her because of comments I gave the parents during aftercare not matching the child's reported behavior during school. I think this is a flat out lie, I can buy a parent coming to her but I don't know of a single teacher I work with who wouldn't just shoot me a test or tell me to my face something like that. The new school year started two weeks ago and so none of my kids have been so bad I would bring it up to their parents. She didn't give me any examples of what I've said so I have no clue what she could be referring to, as a whole, my kids are super chill. My boss has put me in charge of napping the youngest children this year so most days I don't have the opportunity to talk to their parents because I'm in a room with 4 sleeping babies who I don't want to wake up, the most I can manage most days are basics like 'she fell asleep at 4' or 'I put his bottles in his backpack already'. Lastly even if I did mention bad behavior so what! Babies do this funny thing where they feel multiple emotions in one day! sometimes multiple emotions in one minute! Just because a child was happy during the day doesn't mean they can't come to me in a mood and be mad all afternoon for no apparent reason!
2. ""Reportedly"" I've been giving bottles to kids who don't need them. This one fucks with me because I don't make the bottles, the teachers and parents do. I only give a kid a bottle when I'm handed a bottle with there name on it by the teachers! So I'm not the person she needs to be taking this issue up with. The sentence she wrote for this point is grammatically atrocious I wish I could just copy paste it word for word, you run a school run your emails through spell check before sending them.
3. She wants to me check with her before telling the parents anything. This one I kind of get if I had had any major issues with children be guess what! I haven't! So I don't know what the fuck shes on about.

I feel like my boss is never on my side and whenever I'm around her I feel heavy and my afternoon becomes tense.

I am the only after care worker she has hired across two groups of children, and she regularly makes me work by myself with 10 toddlers which she works by herself with the 15ish children ages 3-5. She leaves these children alone for periods of time which she does who knows what in her office or takes a phone call or opens the door for parents.

My old coworker (who I became close friends with while working together so I may have a bias) was fired 1 hour before they were supposed to come into work with zero notice and vague reasoning (I read the emails between the two of them) and was not replaced for the rest of the year. Our boss openly disliked them because they were gender nonconforming and had dyed hair and literally the first opportunity they saw to fire them they did without hesitation, my friend asked is they could come in and talk this out in person so they could better understand why it was they were being fired but my boss refused. I cannot be mad at my boss for firing my friend, but I sure as hell can be mad at the manner in which she did so because it was sketchy as fuck.

She almost killed a child with a life threatening allergy because she left her alone in a room with said allergen. 

These are just a feel of examples of her inability to think things through...

I want more then anything to tell her fuck you and walk out of the school and never see her again. But then I think about my kids, I have such great kids and I would really miss them. I have such great coworkers. I get paid well and it helps pay for my tuition. Then again my degree isn't in teaching or anything so maybe I could go find a part time job in my field. I'm so conflicted and my head is all mixed up. 

I could really use some advice. Thank you for sticking around if you read the whole thing.",25Aug2019,1
326,"I apologize as this is going to be a bit all over the place, but I need advice so please bare with me. TLDR at bottom. 

I am currently in the beginning of my sophomore year of college.  I go to an out of state college my mom convinced me to apply to and then eventually convinced me to go. The school is a good school, a lot of opportunities and is practically free for me to attend (one of the reasons my mom liked it). The school is not a traditional university, rather a private college, and comes with a lot of rules. It almost feels like a boarding school, and I‚Äôve come to basically despise every waking moment here. 

When I moved in last year, I tried to be excited about college and make the most of it. As time went on I began getting more and more depressed to the point where I‚Äôd cry every day at my job (yes it was embarrassing). I began seeing the counseling services here, hoping it would help, and I still see the same amazing therapist I did a year ago. However, I still don‚Äôt feel any better. Actually, I feel about 1000x worse than I ever have and have began to self harm again. 

After first semester of my freshmen year, my therapist lightly suggested I look into other colleges after seeing how much I was struggling here. I did, and was accepted. However when the estimated financial statements came back, my mom told me there was no way I‚Äôd ever be able to begin paying that off and I may as well kiss ever owning a house goodbye, as well as berating me for even thinking about throwing away such my opportunity at my school. This was despite her telling me (after I broke down and confessed I disliked the school) if I completed one year at the school I‚Äôm currently at, I could transfer. The transfer never happened. I know I am an adult and can‚Äôt rely on my parents to pay for school and don‚Äôt have to listen to where she wants me to go. I know this, but months ago I did not feel that way. I felt tied to my mom in a lot of unhealthy ways which I am now coming to terms with and reconsidering this options. 

I have a 4.0 GPA as of right now, and did well at my job  last year and have a new one this year as a teaching assistant. (We are required to work as part of the deal for going somewhere so cheap, I don‚Äôt mind this). I have about one friend here, but she is my best friend in the entire world and I don‚Äôt know how I would have made it through last year. But this is not how I want to live what people consider the best years of their life. I lived under my mom‚Äôs authority for years (my sister moved hours away the day she turned 18 and my younger brother is planning to do the same), and was excited to go to college for a taste of freedom (even if it was of her choosing). But this is not the college experience I want to look back on. I am miserable.  I want to be able to have friends over past midnight or visit me (we have visitation hours, freshmen year we didn‚Äôt have visitation with the other gender), I want to be able to have the option to live off campus at any point (you are only allowed to if you‚Äôre 23, married, or have kids, or you can apply as a senior, but few get approved), I want places to eat open later than 5pm and on weekends, I want to be able to leave my door open and not feel totally isolated from the community (we get in trouble if we prop a single door, but my friends at universities are encouraged to leave their doors open to make friends), I want to not be required to go to talks 7 times a semester, and hell, I want to go to a party every once in a while (it‚Äôs a dry campus and if caught with alcohol, there‚Äôs a good chance you could be kicked off the campus after being reviewed by the judiciary committee). I want to not be so far from home and have to rely on my mom to be able to visit on weekends and breaks (I currently have a car on campus as it‚Äôs a parking grace period, but as a sophomore I will most likely have to bring it back home after the period ends). I also miss my grandmother and my siblings, who are a huge part of my life and younger than me and can not visit on their own accord. I miss my friends. It hurts to see them making new friends and enjoying college and actually MISSING it during the summer while I had a full on mental breakdown the day I moved back. 

In addition to this, I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for 5 years now. I tried to kill myself twice in my teen years, and I feel so much worse now than I did then. I feel out of control of my own life, and like I have no options in my control. I can‚Äôt afford to go to a university and pay for it myself. My aunt offered to co-sign on loans for me last year though, so that might be an option. But who can even pay back loans in this economy. I‚Äôm not sure how much weight this fact holds- but in my last therapy session I was told it is very likely I am also suffering from ptsd due to family related issues (involving my mother) I have dealt with for years and continue to deal with even though I didn‚Äôt think they were that bad. 

I know some of these probably seem like trivial things that don‚Äôt correlate at all, which is why I am asking for advice.  Obviously I haven‚Äôt included every tidbit about my life or situation but I am willing to answer any questions. 

I feel ungrateful, I go to a good college for a very, very small amount of money. But I am miserable and I would never have chosen this college by myself. I am here because my mom wanted me to be here and told me I had no other option. I feel alone, isolated, confused. 

So what I am asking is: is my mental health now worth being in debt later?",25Aug2019,1
327,"i'm going to stay anonymous and i'll keep everything mentioned apart from the scenario anonymous. i play a competitive online game, it's basically my main hobby. i live in a small country, and the population of our server is very small, this results in everyone knowing eachother, and it's very easy to get into games with eachother, compared to a big country such as north america. i play a role in this game that is hated a lot by the community, but any harrassment that comes with that is easily avoidable, and isnt anything to get upset about. for the last 4 months, i've dealt with harrassment, not necessarily on the game but on social media/other websites. any trash talking or threats i get within the game are usually laughed off by me, but im now in a situation where blocking people, changing my username for all platforms i own etc is not protecting me from these bullies. im not interested in quitting the game i play, as i'm striving to improve and since i don't do sport, this is the competitive activity i choose to do, it's also one of my main passions, so quitting the game is out of the question, that isnt really the main issue anyways.   


so it started on feb 8, i was playing said video game, and i met 3 people, which later became my friends. we played the game together often using voice chat/voice calls. (not naming the platform)  and in these voice calls were their other friends. their other friends were pretty mean, they talked a lot of trash to me, and since i was pretty new to the high ranks of the game, i felt a little left out as they didn't respect me due to not being relevant within the community, or as good as them. (these guys are all older than me, but are childish and their priorities such as coolness, and skill, and also being mean to others are distasteful and sucky) one of my friends out of the 3, which i'll call 0, sometimes would just play with me, or with the other 2 friends to avoid dramas. i became pretty close with them, especially 0, we got along very well and they were great company and friends. as time passed, the others started getting increasingly toxic, claiming i was stealing 0 from them and being greedy, even though i usually was the one asked by 0 if i wanted to play with them. im not sure if it was out of jealousy, but also the fact that i was a newer friend, younger than them, play a hated role in the community and im a female (not trying to be political or left, but girls are sometimes disrespected blatantly for that reason) im not exactly sure, after around 3-4 months, the others which we'll now refer to as the bullies, would say really terrible things, and make me look like a bad person. as someone who hadnt dealt with bullying ever before, i didn't know how to act or what to say, this allowed the bullies to take advantage of me so yeah. they found my social medias/accounts for websites and stalked a lot of them basically, at one point i was threatened by them that they had found all this information, and they said they were going to leak/expose it. all of that stuff has been deleted by myself, but it didnt end there, an old, goofy photo of me got into their hands, they all currently have it btw. they made around 2-4 instagram accounts, pretending to be me, they also made fake DM screenshots etc. a lot of this fake info was shown around to other players, which gave me a bad rep, and made the game a lot less fun as it was sometimes thrown just because i was on their team, or people would instantly give up etc. instagram, even though it has a rule about impersonation and about posting photos of others without other peoples permission, they were not much help, after blocking them, and changing my username over 15 times, which is something i currently still have to do, they keep finding my account. instagram required me to fill out forms, provide ID etc to get these accounts removed, but it took a long time and it was very time consuming, and extremely stressful. theyve also found my youtube, and subscribed so they can get notifications when i post. today i posted a video, which i had to delete as the comments were sabotaged and so was like like/dislike ratio. on top of all this, the dehumanizing words said towards me by them, and feeling useless as ive spent so much time trying to prevent this, but ive had no luck has really burned me out. its been 4 months. 4 whole months, and it wont go away, it wont leave me alone. also note for the last 4 months im no longer friends with my 3 mates, they were convinced by the bullies to join in on the harrassment of me. so on top of that my self esteem has been further damaged to losing some really cool friends, who i miss a lot. i feel regret and angry because maybe there was something i could have done to make the bullies like and respect me, and maybe i could have saved my friendships and my mental well being. many things around me are a constant reminder of all this. i just don't know what to do. this isnt to a level of where i need to contact police or anything, theres no point over reacting, i dont want justice, i just want it to stop. a lot of them have irl struggles, drug problems and mental illness. i feel pity for them but if my pity is not being considered, and instead im being their punching bag, i'd prefer them to just bully someone else at this point, because i feel stuck. as said before, over reacting or making it seem more dramatic is something i'm trying to avoid, this hasn't made me depressed, or suicidal, i dont have social anxiety. but socializing, which was already hard for me is increasingly more difficult, my self esteem is crappy and i cant be myself anymore. hardly anyone understands, not even my irl friends how much of a passion this game is, and im not going to let them win by forcing me to quit, but i want to stop this. im really sorry this is long but this is info all the way since feb. thx",25Aug2019,1

I (23 F) live with my grandpa while I attend college. Im dealing with an issue that's made me supremely uncomfortable for kind of a long time now. 

Sometimes at night I can hear my grandpa masturbating. Yuck. I know it's natural but he sleeps with his door open and so do I because the temperature in my room gets too hot if I don't. I've even taken to getting up sometimes and loudly closing the door. I've even SIGHED loudly, said ""oh my god"" and closed the door before. I don't know what to do at this point.

This is really gross for me to describe but I know what he's doing because I can hear the squelching (I'm gonna barf) and his breathing. It does sound like he's making an attempt to be quiet but... I dont understand why he wouldnt close the fucking door... it's common sense?? I've gotten up in the middle of the night before and I could smell the lotion he used and it makes me gag. 

I've worried that maybe he's a sicko and he wants me to hear but that would be out of character for him as he's never been inappropriate with me and I do love my grandpa. I just dont get why he wouldnt close the door especially when I've tried to send hints that I can definitely hear what's going on.

What do I even do at this point? The thought of confronting him extremely embarrassing I dont think I could do it. I do have to suffer through sleeping in a disgustingly hot room sometimes and close the door just so I won't hear it, but I really can't sleep like that.",25Aug2019,3

I'm usually a straight-A student but lately I just can't study at home. I get so distracted‚ÄîI go off to read a book, eat, play piano, bake, or take a bath. I just can't sit down at my desk and focus on studying, I don't know why. The only place I can study at is outside‚Äîthe library or at a cafe. But the thing is, the usual cafe I go to (it's a study cafe) is kind of costly. And other issues also come up‚Äîfor say, there is a huge storm today so I can't go out to a cafe, and I have a test tomorrow.

347,"So tl;dr, we broke up on Tuesday mainly cause of her parents not approving and her saying she didn‚Äôt love me as much. And whatever I‚Äôm relatively over it, it hurts but it be like that. Later on she went on to say it was pretty much all her parents but I honestly don‚Äôt know what to believe so i‚Äôm just gonna move on.

Something important you need to know is that she‚Äôs not in a great spot mentally. Since the 6th grade, she‚Äôs been treating herself like an object and basically sending nudes to everyone she could. It got really bad in 8th where they got leaked and she was incredibly depressed and was self harming. Us getting together did a good job of getting her out of this spot and as ‚Äúthe first guy to genuinely love her‚Äù I helped her in every way I could.

She broke up with me, and in the 5 days we‚Äôve been split, she‚Äôs found someone new (random guy on Twitter, split once mom found out) and sent nudes to 2 random people she‚Äôs never met. This is really scary for me and other friends and I suspect she‚Äôs gonna fall back into what she was struggling with before we were together.

It wasn‚Äôt easy dating her, though. She put her life in my hands more than once and it was really fuckung scary. She relapsed twice which kills me to admit I couldn‚Äôt stop it from happening, despite my best efforts. I loved her and continued to support her to the best of my abilities.

Something in me feels like she relied on me more than she realized. When she was sad a lot of the time she‚Äôd tell me she‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. I‚Äôd do my best to reassure her she was perfect and I wouldn‚Äôt do a thing to change her even if I could and most of the time I was effective. She doesn‚Äôt have that anymore and that makes me worry for her safety.

Me and some of her friends figured we should warn her mother. She‚Äôs aware of her past and she can help more than we can. We did it and we were all blocked almost immediately. Do I owe her an explanation after how she turned on me so hurtfully? I don‚Äôt know what to do going forwards, about this situation and about her in general. Go into this assuming she hates me just to be safe.

I don‚Äôt want to feel like her safety is in my hands but it was for our relationship and I took on that role and worked really fuckin hard to do it right. Sorry if this is poorly written it‚Äôs late and i‚Äôm tired

So I‚Äôm about to graduate with an honors degree in chemical engineering from a top 10 US public university.  ( Just have 1 class left) Sounds great, right?

Well, here‚Äôs the thing- I don‚Äôt want to be a chemical engineer.  I don‚Äôt want to work in a factory somewhere, or in the oil industry.  I don‚Äôt want to do research and development. I don‚Äôt want to do any of that.  I hate it.  I only choose my major because everyone said it was a good degree to have for employment. While this may be true, it‚Äôs not the kind of employment I want. 

I admire science and engineering, it‚Äôs the language we use to build the world and everything in it.  I appreciate it greatly.  I understand it very, very well compared to most people.  But I hate actually doing any of it, though.   I hate solving differential equations, I hate the stress involved with process flow diagrams, chemical reactors, process safety, temperature, pressure, enthalpy, entropy, free energy, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, phase equilibrium.... I could go on about all the shit I know that I‚Äôm never going to use.  It stresses me out greatly.

So here‚Äôs the interesting part about me.  What do I wanna do with my life? Well, most of you are gunna probably be shocked here, but honest to god:

I want to be a professional MMA fighter. 

Yeah.  

I‚Äôm not even kidding.

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù, have long arms and legs and have practiced martial arts in the past.  I have recently picked up karate and kickboxing and I am falling in love with it.  I enjoy it so, so much.  It‚Äôs like a fire lights up inside me- something that I have never felt before.  It‚Äôs a rush so amazing I feel like I can conquer anything.  I love the adrenaline of fighting someone- it‚Äôs both a physical and mind game like no other.

I know my analytical engineering mind could be of great use in the MMA realm; studying the physics of the human body, biomechanics, diet and nutrition, maneuvers and counter maneuvers, fighting stances, blocking, striking, kicking... I can go on.  all analyzed and perfected to win fights.  Developing strategies to win, studying my opponent...I know I have the mind for this kind of work. I just know.  When you know, you just ... well, you know.

I don‚Äôt know where to begin.  I don‚Äôt know if I should go through with this... should I just get a boring job somewhere? I absolutely could, given my credentials.  I could get a decent job and just ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù like everyone else.  I‚Äôm very conflicted.  

I don‚Äôt want to be like everyone else.  I want to be... me

I learn things very quickly and I am great at teaching myself new talents... I know I can do this.  

Advice? What do I do? Where do I even begin?  I‚Äôm having a crisis with what to do with my life and I‚Äôm 22.  Many MMA fighters are significantly older than this, so I am not that worried about me being too old to fight. But I know I have to decide soon.

I am from the US and have a girlfriend that I‚Äôve been with for a couple years that lives abroad in Europe, where I am currently. She works at a small convenient store in a shitty part of town. Most people that come through are generally friendly and don‚Äôt give her an issue but there is one guy in particular and who keeps giving her trouble and it‚Äôs hard for her to say anything to him because she‚Äôs a bit shy and introverted. Mind you she‚Äôs also a small girl and just generally doesn‚Äôt want to get mixed up in any conflict. The guy is in his early 20‚Äôs and when he comes in to the shop he always makes her feel uncomfortable, blurting out sexual remarks and is just always being a creep. Christmas time last year he had come in and said to her ‚ÄúMan you‚Äôre working, I had wished that you‚Äôd be under my tree completely naked with only ribbons covering your tits and pussy‚Äù with a filthy smirk on his face and that‚Äôs what set me off. The altercation for her was awkward and she didn‚Äôt know what to do because she was so uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt really say anything to him and he walks off. She recounts the story to me almost in tears and I can‚Äôt do anything about it because I‚Äôm abroad. Since that incident she‚Äôs made it clear to him that she has a boyfriend and has been distant and not making eye contact towards him but he really hasn‚Äôt gotten the hint and has even said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you have a boyfriend, what‚Äôs he gonna do?‚Äù

I get the pleasure of visiting her maybe every six months out of year if I‚Äôm lucky, and now I am here and I‚Äôm hearing the he‚Äôs being weird towards her again. Her boss allows me to come in and hang out with her while she‚Äôs at work, so I‚Äôm usually in the back on my laptop doing work. I‚Äôve never seen the guy but while I was busy doing work he had come in briefly exchanged unpleasantries again and left and she quickly came and told me but I was too late to catch him. Now, every fiber in my body wants to break his bones because of how he‚Äôs treated my girl but I won‚Äôt. I want to handle this situation in a calm and civil manner if possible and confront the guy. My girlfriend tells me that from the encounters that he seems to be the asshole type to get violent quick. I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble while I‚Äôm here.

363,"Hello,

Last March I started as a manager at a small company of 10 people, including the owner and another manager. While I have strong relationships with my team, recently I've had difficulty with an employee (we'll call her Marissa) that functions as my assistant. We do not have formal titles but Marissa knows I am manager and she works under me.

Everything was fine with Marissa but recently I noticed she rolls her eyes when I need her attention. After confronting her she explained I sometimes interrupt her mid work, rather than asking if it is a good moment to talk or to speak as soon as she can. Her point is valid but does not validate the eye rolling.

During a closed door meeting with the other manager and owner, Marissa called me out for a project that ""was not moving fast enough"" because of me. In reality this was inaccurate, and the project moved quickly and was completed above our expectations and ahead of schedule. I explained this to her and she conceded she made incorrect assumptions. Her belief something was wrong does not bother me because it is important to spotlight potential issues. However, if there is an issue she needs to come to me first and as soon as possible so we can identify and solve it. Shaming me in front of company leadership is not respectful or productive.

As you can probably surmise I did not have the courage or wherewithal to say this at the time. 

More recently my boss was upset with an amateur-ish Marissa sent to a client. The message was sent without my knowledge or consent, even though we usually discuss these things beforehand. I taught her how to improve her messages which is great, but I made the mistake of not telling her the fundamental problem was not telling me about the email. Since then she has sent a couple other emails without telling me.

Now to make matters worse she is sucking up to my boss and trying to step over and outshine me. I would never do this to a superior and always understood my role to be making my company, team and boss (in this case the owner I report to) look good. 

Worse still, last week we had a disagreement and she raised her voice at me in front of other employees.

I am first time manager and obviously I have lost control of the situation. Since feeling undermined it was been difficult to regain my footing and confidence and now she is acting like MY BOSS. My anxiety (not grave but present) is feeding back into the respect issue.

Tomorrow is the start of a new work week and an important opportunity to turn this situation around. For now, I plan to more direct and stern with her, and to call out problems immediately and succinctly.

If anyone has advice or resources they can direct me to I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thank you",25Aug2019,1

365,"Hello! Throwaway account here for reasons. 

I would like to ask for advice for a dilemma that I have regarding my mom and dad. You see, my dad goes to the lottery everyday, so he‚Äôs been asking my mom for money everyday when I was in college. Now that I‚Äôm working, he asks from me and my mother. 

Yesterday, my dad offered to pay for my cellphone bill, and to save money for myself. In exchange, he‚Äôs been asking me for bigger pots of money for the lottery. He claims that he uses up his pension to pay for my cellphone bill. He also said not to tell my mom about him still paying for my cellphone bill for this month, even when I‚Äôm working. 

My mom asked me to pay her for the cellphone bill today. Instead of saying that it was already paid, I said that I will (out of honesty).  She claims that the cellphone bill money comes from her (but I always sent the bill to my dad in college). She even said that she‚Äôll use my cellphone bill payment to ‚Äúsave more money for herself‚Äù, because it will be paid. She also told me not to tell my dad about this. 

The problem is, I don‚Äôt want my parents to drain my finances, as I am saving a lot of my money by being prudent with my spending habits. Furthermore, I always had a great relationship with them ‚Äî but their fatal flaw is that I handle my money better then they do (even if I was well taken care of as a kid), because of lotteries and loans. 

I don‚Äôt want to lose more than my cellphone bill, and break my budget. I want my dad to stop asking me for lots of lottery money. I don‚Äôt know who to confide with anymore. I want to set healthy boundaries with finances, but I still live with them (because I don‚Äôt earn a lot).

My mom already broke my college saving habits (by spending my savings from Christmas gifts or part-tome gigs), so I felt that it is right by her that she partly helps me with my finances (by still living in her house).

My maternal grandparents and my mom‚Äôs entire side of the family, as well as the majority of my father‚Äôs side of the family all live there. 

My dad and his brothers moved away when they were around my age because the town is wasting down to nothing, quickly. There are three major employers: 

The prison

The Railroad

The Highway

Recently my maternal grandfather, who owns the family farm and has always wanted me to have it and work in it, who I love deeply, has become sick.

My younger half sisters have grown into their early teens and miss me

And the rest of my family seems to genuinely love when I‚Äôm around.

I applied and received a job at the prison, it pays well

I don‚Äôt start for a while, and I still have time to deny it.

I have already made plans to move back to my desolate roots, and my father resents my choice.

So I ask you, people of reddit, unbiased and uncaring to my position: 

&gt;Should I go back to my nothing hometown, or should I stay here and go to the college down the street?",25Aug2019,1
368,"I'm currently out of town right now, but from what I'm hearing, my brother has not been doing well. My brother has just graduated college with a bachelor's hoping to become a doctor, but he's recently decided that he's going to quit trying to be a doctor and focus on being a teacher instead. I fully support him on this, but when he tells it to our family (which I wasn't there for, but heard about it from others), they weren't supportive of it. My family is very old school Hispanic, just to understand the background. He tells my grandma (who only speaks Spanish) and she tells him something along the lines of being a teacher is for people who are gay and that you shouldn't do that and that my other grandma, who passed away last year wouldn't want him to do that either (yikes, but as someone who can only speak English, it would be hard for me to communicate to her, and I'm also afraid of confrontation). He also tells my other family members hoping to get support from them, but instead they complain about him stopping and encouraging him to keep on going toward being a doctor. My brother, probably still heated from having this conversation with my grandma, curses everyone out, gets angry, and leaves. 

Fast forward to a week later, he goes to a different city with his friend to visit another friend. He has a talk with his one friend Stacy (not her real name) about her plans on dating some guy, they all went to the same high school, and my brother warns her that the guy she was planning on going on a date with was known for being an abuser, however she didnt listen to him and goes on the date anyway, which rubs my brother the wrong way. He feels like she didnt take his words into account.

Different friend Rebecca (not her name), is the friend that they are visiting in this city and both him and Stacy are crashing at her place, some sort of remark was made while she was driving about weed (he doesn't like it) and she stops the car, tells him to get out, and drives away. His phone is dead, his stuff is at her place and he essentially walks until he finds a hotel and then ubers back to get his stuff from her. At this point he is basically thinking fuck Rebecca and Stacy, I'm not going to be their friend anymore. I'm not sure what Stacy had to say about Rebecca kicking him out in a city hours away from home with no family or anyone to help him out, but he will be ubering to a bus stop to go back home.

After these incidents my brother feels like he has no one in his corner and honestly I'm not sure what I can do or say to help him. And I want to go see my grandparents and aunt, but I dont support the way that they have treated my brother and again, I'm absolutely terrified of confrontation and don't know what to do about it. I want my brother to be happy and for him to know no matter what that I will be there in his corner. The answer, might be simple, but at the angle I'm looking at this right now I don't have any idea what to do or say to well... Anybody. Got any advice?

Extra info: my brother is gay, most people outside of my myself, mom, dad, some uncles and a few others are accepting of it so no, he isn't trying to date any of his friends. He also is very sensitive about it since most of lives we have heard our family not be happy about them.",25Aug2019,1
369,"I think my mom has been mentally and emotionally abusing me my whole life and I never noticed. 

When I was little, my mom was dating a guy who left a lot. When he would try to leave, she would tell me to put my toys against the door so he physically couldn‚Äôt go. I vividly remember, I let him leave one time without trying to stop him and she told me how much it was my fault that she was crying. I was 6. Flash forward to when I turned 9, she started dating this new guy and eventually became pregnant. The guy was really physically abusive toward my mom and he eventually abused me as well. When I turned 14 the guy started to sexually abuse me. He never raped me or anything, but he talked about doing it a lot. I told my mom and friends and eventually CPS came and she told me that if I told them the truth, they would take my little brother away. So I told them I made it up. She always told me that what I was wearing was too revealing and that I was ‚Äúasking for it‚Äù. She broke up with him after 10 years of abuse because he cheated on her with another women. 

Flash forward to me being an adult and living with her. She judges everything and anything I do and when I have AN OUNCE of criticism about anything from ‚Äúhey can you keep it down‚Äù to ‚Äúhey can you take out the trash‚Äù, she flips it on me. At one point I was being bullied in school and when she got mad at me she would say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt have any friends‚Äù. 

Tonight my brother is having a birthday party with a bunch of friends who are spending the night. So there‚Äôs like 8 kids in my house (which is small) and they are being super loud. They were playing video games (on my console) and running around and it was like 1:30am so I told them to start keeping it down. My mom came in immediately saying how loud I am and how when my friends, who are adults, come over they are super loud so I need to let them be happy and be quiet. I was taken sooo far aback. 

We have had a history of getting into physical fights in the past sooo I chose to leave the room. We‚Äôre texting back and forth and as I‚Äôm messaging her I‚Äôm realizing we‚Äôre just going through this loop. Like it‚Äôs the same conversation we always have. Where I‚Äôm this horrible person for having a feeling or opinion and she‚Äôs going to explain why. I always thought I was only abused by that guy in the past because it was physical and I could see the impact, but I‚Äôm realizing how worthless she has always made me feel and how unhealthy that probably is. 

I mean I don‚Äôt really know what to do. I always fold and feel sorry or guilty and I love her and I have to live with her until I have enough money to move out. I‚Äôve tried to get her to go to therapy with me, but she always says she‚Äôs‚Äúnot crazy‚Äù. I just wanted to share and see if anyone had any similar experiences and what they have done to try and mend the relationship or how they have separated themselves.",25Aug2019,1

371,"So about an hour and a half ago, I was asleep, and I heard my door open, and a girl walked in and got in bed with me, pulled the blanket over themselves, and passed out. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, because I have a friend who will occasionally just climb into my bed if she was out drinking with my roommates or whatever, so I just assumed it was her. 
I fell asleep for a bit, then woke up again and I could see this girls back, and she had a tattoo that I knew my friend didn‚Äôt have. I also saw that she isn‚Äôt wearing any pants or undergarments. 
So now I have a bare butted total stranger in bed with me and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I live in a college town, and school is starting up again very soon, lots of people were partying tonight and I‚Äôm concerned that this is some wasted freshman girl or something like that, or maybe she‚Äôs been drugged.

372,"Following my previous posts  about meeting a guy to try cock for the first time before I settle down and get married. I weighed up the pros and cons and I‚Äôm an over thinker who was being driven mad by it so I went just to easier myself that I‚Äôm not being true to my self. 

Met a couple of guys and went back to their hotel room. Got in their bed, they were either side of me. I thought I‚Äôd be really into very quickly but was shocked that I felt alward, I wasn‚Äôt even erect. They gave me some porn in their phone to watch. But still I was let even properly hard, they got their cocks and out and tried to get hard while they watched me try. I would look over at then but was more focused on the porn. 

Then the one guy started sucking the other and still not a flinch if anything I was going soft. The dudes cock was fucking huge though like uncomfortable to look out 9.5‚Äù huge! 

So left happy not doing anything, said sorry it obv wasn‚Äôt for me. 

But now the next day I feel regret that I didn‚Äôt just try touching or maybe. Ahandjob. I know in the moment I didn‚Äôt want too so is my brain just enjoying the idea of it rather than reallly wanting to do it? Very confused",25Aug2019,0
373,"This is prompted by the break up with my bf of one year yesterday, while I know that we weren‚Äôt compatible enough as a couple and I‚Äôm happy for us to stay friends, i feel like I‚Äôm falling apart because I haven‚Äôt been single since I was raped.

It happened a few months before I turned 17 and not long after I got into a relationship that lasted 3 years. I was only single for a few weeks before I met my last bf and I was with him for a year until yesterday. I started to realise this a few months ago but it is very clear to me now that we‚Äôre broken up, that I need to have a boyfriend in my life to feel safe. Everyday I think about what happened to me, i constantly feel scared and insecure and I think that I‚Äôve been inadvertently medicating my issues by using men to provide me with a feeling of safety and affection.

Basically I need advice on any part of this that anyone can help with. Advice on how to manage trauma/ptsd (I am trying to work myself up to seeing a therapist as my country provides public health so it is an option, but I am just not comfortable doing so yet), but mainly I am seeking advice on how to manage being on my own. How to find happiness and validation that comes from myself rather than a partner.

375,"i have no idea what to do.

for a little backstory, my friend chris has been dating a girl for the last 6 months or so. she goes to a different school, but it is still in our school district. this means that we hang out a lot as a group, because it is so convenient for him to pick her up on his way to get one of the boys. she also plays games like minecraft and overwatch with us on discord.

since i am pretty much always on discord when im not with friends or at practice, we talk a lot. so much so, that she told me im her favorite one of chris' friends. i love chris, but i also cant stand hanging out with such a great girl that i cant date. i feel like a piece of shit, and i know that i am, but i dont plan to act on these feelings, but i just want some advice to make it less painful. its just the first time ive had a crush in a while, ive usually had such low self confidence i would give up on crushes as i was developing them as i didnt think they were acheivable, but i am pretty confident as of recent. im just worried this will hurt my relationship with my friend.",25Aug2019,2

I have to learn a framework basically, I am completely new at it though I have knowledge and comfortable using the vanilla version. I understand that I won't immediately be good at it, I understand the basics so far, but I feel like I am very slow at learning it. i know the answer is to allot extra time for it out of work hours and practice until you're fluent at it but the problem is I am getting demotivated instead? To the point that I'm not even going to start doing it. I know it doesn't make sense, but do you guys have suggestions? My previous technique involved cutting myself because pain seems to help remember things but I don't really want to do that anymore.

379,"I've, got up in really strange family situation last mouth. I week, after my 14 birthday I found out I was switched into the hospital as baby, and that my parents where actually biological dads.

380,"Found out a few months ago that i was adopted. It was an ""in-family adoption."" Which in my case; my biological father is my adopted father's older brother. There was a funeral and so a bunch of family came from out of town. Took one of my cousin out to eat and what do you know? She spilled the beans. Later that night i just couldn't hold it in anymore after sending her back to the funeral home. I drove off and just started crying my eyes out. Never cried like that my whole life. 

I am just so angry and i hate it. To learn about my true identity when im almost 23.. my entire childhood and adolescence years is something i can never get back. I just feel; lost, disconnected and so angry at everyone involved who conspired to lie to me. Like really? Not 1 person in my family thought i deserved to know the truth? Not my adopted parents, biological parents, biological siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandpas and grandmas? Even if they did think so, their actions spoke louder because no one told me anything. 

I‚Äôm angry at my birth parents for putting me up for adoption and denying me the opportunity to know my siblings when I've always wanted siblings. (My adopted mother is infertile so i always thought i was the lucky one she was able to have)  same goes for my adoptive parents for denying me the opportunity. I think any adoption (voluntary, private/closed, baby,) can really just be a permanently damaging decision to an adoptee when the truth about them is hidden. And I just feel like it‚Äôs this decision that was made for me without my consent and now I am the one who has to live it and to just ""suck it up."" 

If I look at my life altogether, things are good and positive. Compared to many others in life, i'm doing quite well. But when it come down to my issues about being adopted, I just have so much anger and resentment that i cant seen to shake. Especially when i get triggered by something at any time during the day. It‚Äôs not a great feeling and i doubt many can imagine feeling this way unless they were in the same exact position. It's a toxic never ending cycle. I feel so angry  because in the grand scheme of things it‚Äôs not a big deal like many others say, but it is at the same time. I'm grieving over my loss of identity, loss of time, loss of bonding with my biological siblings, loss of trust and i dont think i will ever be able to get CLOSURE. My biological mother for whatever reason; doesn't want to tell me my story for like another 20 years which is ridiculous. I've yet to talk to my bio father if he's willing to tell me my story. But from what everyone says, they were only a couple days away from aborting me after scheduling the procedure. This might be the truth they dont want to tell me. 

You know what really gets me? Is that i'm not allowed to be angry or sad because it's like i'm throwing the efforts of my adoptive parents and everyone else in the trash. It makes me feel so TRAPPED. It's such an outrageous backward logic. Everyone expects me to just see how ""privileged"" i am even though i never asked for any of this (and in turn imply that i'm ungrateful if i express differently.) 

Anyone is welcome to comment and share some insight; maybe you too will learn a thing from reading my story or others.",25Aug2019,1

384,"I don't really know where else I can post this, but, for a while now one of my close friends (J) has been telling me their experiences with their parents. The relationship J has with them is definitely not normal in my eyes, but J tells me they're fine and they see everything as normal. 

Here's some notes I took on them and their family:

\-J's older brother drinks every day, 4-6 cans

\-J's mother drinks every day, 1-2 cans

\-J is yelled at and/or put down once or twice a week

\-J's mother and father are very regularly high

\-J's Younger brother hits them daily

\-J's father isn‚Äôt around much

\-J's older brother ""crosses a line' (aka mild sexual harassment) once every month or so

\-J spends most days in their room avoiding family

\-J skips school once or twice a week

\-J doesn‚Äôt eat three full meals a day, rarely eats two 

\-J is most likely scared of family, definitely scared of some family members

\-J's regular mood is sad/possibly depressed 

\-J gets 4-6 hours of sleep

\-J only feels safe in room and with friends

\-J doesn‚Äôt feel safe around older brother or alone with adults

\-J thinks they are exaggerating/are fine 

Some of this information seems unnecessary, but i wanted to include everything I know about their home life. They've told me all of this with a straight face and insists it's completely normal. I'm very concerned for their wellbeing.

What can I do? Both of us are still high school age and there's not much I can really do for them. I tried talking to my therapist about this, and then my parents, and both told me there wasn't a lot that could be done. I don't really want to get the police involved because there's always a possibility there's a misunderstanding or exaggeration on J's part, and I don't actually know how serious this is, but J's mental health is getting increasingly worse and sometimes I fear it'll get too much for them.",25Aug2019,1
386,"Little background: I live in a third-world country, one of the British colonies. The local education system is really bad so private schools offer GCSE and A-levels. I belong to the upper middle class bracket. 

So, basically I just got done with my GCSEs. Now I applied to the two best colleges in the city and I got in both of them. What‚Äôs different in the two is that one is an expensive elitist institution offering A-levels and the other is a not so expensive institution offering the local board. 

The main problem or decision I have to make is whethe to go to the elitist institution or not. Its a British School, established in the colonial times and the local elite attend that institution. Kids who attend this institution come from very wealthy families, I mean owning property in London, USA, Dubai, being able to afford designer like Gucci, Versace even with our struggling currency. I hope you get the general picture. The students of this school are notorious for being snobby and spoiled and having a major superiority complex. 

Obviously, people from not so rich families come too but a lot elite kids attend too. Now I have always wanted to attend that school bcs it gives a lot of opportunities to its students but I am scared of the social aspect. 

I am an ambivert. I have a small group of friends. I can start conversations but I can‚Äôt really maintain them. I think of myself as confident but when the time comes, I become silent as a mouse. I hate it. I know I am capable of being confident and making friends but I get so anxious and nervous that I freeze.  

People like me who go there have bad experiences and good experiences. I will attend that school for two years. Its scary thinking about the social pressure, having to deal w snobby kids. I will be going all alone, none of my friends are going there. I don‚Äôt know anybody. 

I need advice on whether I should go there or go to the other option in which I know won‚Äôt have problems socially bcs I have friends there. A-levels is much harder than the local board but I know its better for my future. I hope that is enough information for you guys to base your advice upon. I know that its very normal to feel like this when going to a new place but I just don‚Äôt want to put in so much money, time and effort and then regretting it.",25Aug2019,1

391,"Thanks ahead of time for reading this if you do. I appreciate it. I know I ramble. 


So I'm currently (M24) and I recently moved back home with my parents per their request. Parents are getting a bit old (60's) and can't do much around the house due to medical reasons. When I turned 17 and graduated high school, I got a leased car that was jointed with my mom because I had no credit. Once that was done I started a job with an electrical company and was making far more money than I knew what to do with. At the age of 23 I co-signed with my mom on my dream car (it's around $45,000). We needed to co-sign because the original company I was supposed to be signed onto the leased car with never actually put me on the lease so I never gained any personal credit by making my payments on schedule. Now after about a year I decided the job just wasn't for me and so I decided to quit and move back to my hometown (I moved 24/7 for work and lived out of hotels) and decided to start going to college to go into teaching (what I really wanted to do with my life). My problem now is that I'm working 55hrs a week while going to school and paying for everything out of pocket. I'm very fortunate that I can live with my parents and don't have to pay rent, but paying 650$ a month for my car while paying out of pocket for classes makes it a very slow and tiresome process, especially while only making about 9$ an hour. I'd like to go to college full-time and just have a beater car if possible. I've tried convincing my mother to allow me to sell-back the car but she tells me there's no possible way that she'd let me do that (it's currently worth 27k and we owe 37k on it.. even though I see others of my car being sold at dealerships for almost ‚Äúnew‚Äù price when they‚Äôre sitting around 10‚Äôs of thousands of miles). At first my Mom said no because she thought of me going to college as just ""a fad"" that I was going to drop out of, but after taking a semester of classes and getting upper 90's in them, I'm pretty dedicated and feel good about it. My problem now is that I want to sell the car but don‚Äôt know how to go about it, and if taking a huge hit on it would be worth it or not, or if I should just try selling it privately. I understand the overall problem is just because I made a very irresponsible decision when I was making good money, but I‚Äôm just not sure how to tackle this.",25Aug2019,1

So we don't have much to talk about, and for some reason, she always wants to talk with me, and tell me the things that I already know or that I know are totally wrong. This annoys me and I basically just ignore it to not be rude and tell her to shut up (because she doesn't have a fault that she has limited cognitive capacity).

Then since she is talking to a wall and doesn't get feedback, she changes strategy to get my engagement, by asking dumb questions. She doesn't think they are dumb, but I think they are dumb. 

Example: ""I never understood why boats are so heavy and don't sink"" or ""I never understood how internet companies make money"" or ""I never understood why internet companies need to hire people"". Even though I explained this 10 times she keeps asking the same questions.

This pisses me off.

I think it's not her fault.

For me it is very important to be a good son, and pay back to her since she was a good mother while I grew up.

She then punched me in the face multiple times until i saw stars. Someone pulled her off and as she was walking away she was screaming ‚Äúracist!‚Äù Im not entirely sure why. As im laying crumpled on the ground she tries to come back for more but the bouncer got a hold of her and she left. 

I‚Äôve never been in a fight or been attacked before. Insult to injury, my two ‚Äúfriends‚Äù went inside, stayed there for the whole night and left without saying anything...this is of course AFTER one of them tried to convince me not to go to the police. So naturally i went to the police, filed a report yada yada. I spent all day today in bed. Im sore as hell, humiliated and depressed as fuck. I decided i will never talk to those ‚Äúfriends‚Äù again because of their total disregard for my happiness or wellbeing.

Now my other good friend is telling me that my ‚Äúmother‚Äù called her and is totally concerned for my safety...well that would be fine except for the fact that i haven‚Äôt talked to my mother in a decade because she does crack, and doesn‚Äôt have any way of knowing that friend or anything like that. So now im pretty sure someone is impersonating my mother to try and get information about me.

What in the fuck am i supposed to do with all of this? I feel like dropping off the earth",25Aug2019,21
398,"   I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and as I slowly walked in a girl I work with thats kinda new to the left of me who I haven‚Äôt talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm tightly (around my upper arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery on the chest high cabinet  she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the  cabinet and  said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",25Aug2019,0
399,"The other day I was in a restaurant and the waiter made some error. I alerted for the error, and instead of apologizing and fixing, he started trying to argue with me. I was quite relaxed with some friends and with this I got pissed off. 

Basically, for context, we ordered 2 + 1 coffees, total of 3 coffees for 4 people. The guy brought 5 coffees because he understood 3 + 2, which would be 5 coffees for 4 people. 

When the bill came he charged for 5 coffees so I asked him to remove 2. At this point I was already pissed. He went away for a long time and when he returned he asked me how many butters we ate. It seems we ate butters and he didn't charge them. I blurted ""IDK"" and he left again for a long time. During this time I was fuming and my face must shown how angry I was, that he would remove the coffees and then charge for butters (which we consumed and should've been charged in the first place).

Then the guy came and said he wouldn't charge for the butters but this did not diminish my wrath.

I think it is ridiculous to lose tranquillity over such minor thing. Getting angry because of butters?

I shouldn't place my tranquillity on other people (external locus of control). 

I'd like to always be cool and be unaffected by things.

400,"Though my family and my partner always knew that there is something strange in the way I think, I was never properly diagnosed, until recently.

Main issues that have been there since childhood include:
- no sense of attachment to people unless the relationship is useful
- no remorse after doing something bad/not moral unless there is punishment involved
- no joy from family events or spending time with people unless we are doing something that I would have enjoyed even when alone (ex. cinema, playing games, drinking on bars, doing art)
- a constant desire to overpower whoever is in charge (parent figure, teacher, supervisor at work, etc.)
- obsessive behaviours over specific types of recreation that make me unable to focus on work and relationships (video games, books, doing drugs)
And the list goes on, but these are the main issues.

Recently I went to jail for drug possesion charges. Before trial in court, I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist and he concluded that I have a severe case of dyssocial personality disorder and possibly ADHD. I was let go after 3 months in jail with a fine. I went to see another psychiatrist to confirm the diagnosis and it was confirmed.

The short time I spent in jail enabled violent behaviours that were suppressed during my childhood. I feel prone to aggression towards strangers, I feel even more irritated by my job (which when looked upon rationally is amazing), and find myself to pretend to care about my wife and child while in reality all I want is be alone in a room, by myself, where nobody can tell me that I am sick, weird, awful or bad.

But that is not what I truly want. I want to feel and understand the world as normal people do. I want to care for my lovely child and I want peace of mind. I know that therapy might be the solution, but I can barely afford it and I'd rather hear your thoughts on this first.

My flat mate has been a friend of mine since high school. We aren‚Äôt extremely close but in the same friend circle and we of course, live together.

She has some bad hygiene habits. 

She has a habit of doing her laundry and leaving it in the tub and not touching it again for days and a few times, weeks. My partner and I went on holiday for a night and when we came home she had wet washing in the tub, since I needed to do laundry I took her stuff out and placed it in her basket, next to her other basket full with damp clothes. so that‚Äôs two baskets of clothes! She leaves this in the laundry for 6days. 

Last night I moved it into the hallway while I was vacuuming and mopping the laundry floor. She came out of her room and grabbed her damp washing and went into her room and hung them up to dry üò©

The hallway and her side of the house now smells absolutely disgusting. The smell of damp washing. 

I don‚Äôt know how to approach her about this? She is my friend and I don‚Äôt want to embarrass her but this is my house and she shouldn‚Äôt be drying her clothes in there because it will make my house damp but also hanging up 6day old washing and stink up my house at the same time ?

408,"I‚Äôm currently in a role defined as a junior but it has no average salary information anywhere I‚Äôve looked online for such as Glassdoors, Linkedin or Payscale. 

When I asked my manager how they came up with the average for my role, they said it was based on the salary range I gave to them during my interview. 

In the past year + I‚Äôve been here, I‚Äôve done consistently more than what a Junior does and beyond the scope of my role, I have also done technical training prior to this role as well and now i‚Äôm doing tasks comparable to the role that is above mine. 

If there isn‚Äôt an average I can compare against for my current role, what can i compare it against as i‚Äôve been told that even though i‚Äôm doing things above my current role, i‚Äôm still a junior because of my time in the industry but my over all relevant experience stands at 2-3 years.

The role above mine pays on average 40% above what I am on, which of course i know i won‚Äôt be on but the starting salary of it pays around 25% more than mine so it makes me believe that I am being underpaid currently.

409,"Last November I applied to transfer to two of the best universities in the nation (think top 25) during the first few months of my first school year. If you‚Äôre familiar with the subject, usually only junior-level transfers are admitted but I had enough AP credits to skip a level, so I entered my freshman year as a sophomore-level student. Jump a few months to June and I got notified that I actually got in! I was straight up ecstatic. I did have great grades but I honestly did not think that I would have a chance (due to certain circumstances). But here‚Äôs the catch. Before my first year of college started, I kept talking with a girl that I met through the college Facebook group and eventually we got along, and I confessed over phone since we didn‚Äôt physically meet up yet. Honestly this might‚Äôve been the screw up that led to more later. Back in middle school I wasn‚Äôt the most popular one, but I did find myself belonging in a few friend groups. During summer after graduating middle school, I was hit with my best friend of three years confessing that he hated me the entire time in a group skype chat and I was totally devastated. I honestly felt screwed since I thought I was good going into high school, having a group of friends to always hang out with, eat lunch, etc. I‚Äôve always had these worries of not having friends since my sister was a loner when she went to high school, and that scared me. I didn‚Äôt want to become her. But in the end it happened anyways. I started my freshmen year as a lonely kid. I had no friends to  hang out with during breaks or lunch time. It wasn‚Äôt until second semester where I finally made a true friend that I would stick with through the rest of high school. Over the years, he was literally the only person that really stuck with me, but after we graduated we still didn‚Äôt keep in contact. Our relationship was an OK one, but just not the type where it was gonna last forever. In summary, I just never really made any friends in high school and that led to depression and stuff like that. During my senior year, I started to give up on making my high school life better as it‚Äôs the final year anyways, so I focused on rebuilding myself in preparation for college. I couldn‚Äôt really make friends right now so I put that idea away for now. But for some reason I got the crazy idea of trying to get a girlfriend. I downloaded Tinder and matched with a few girls, nothing really happened but I just got some of them on Instagram and Snapchat, where till this day I still talk to some of them. Going back to the girl I talked to before college started, I tried my best to try to make her my girlfriend as I saw she showed interest in me and well, unfortunately I decided to take advantage of that. Also during this time, I added a lot of strangers on social media as they kept posting their handles to ‚Äúget to know each other‚Äù. As a lot of people know, girls use social media more so I added more girls than guys. But another reason is just I wanted to have more girls on social media because it just felt like an esteem booster. This was a huge issue because apparently her dorm had a lot of girls that I happen to add and they kept accusing me of being over flirtatious with a lot of girls. My girlfriend kept defending me saying I just wanted to build my network and meet more people (which was kinda true). I felt horrible, because she thought I was a total good guy when I wasn‚Äôt. I talked with a few girls on social media and I was kinda flirty with them and my girlfriend just got pissed at me every time which was totally reasonable. Over my first year in college, she definitely put in more effort in the relationship than I did. In the beginning before I submitted the applications to transfer I tried to treat her well, but I just sort of stopped after that, as my mind was always focused on leaving and going to a better college (my current one was top 50). It just pains me that I kinda used her to my own benefit and it makes me so mad that I actually did this. She kept defending me throughout all the bad things I did. While I didn‚Äôt even treat her that well. On dates we would always go 50/50, because she felt it was only fair for her to pay her own share, and unfortunately again I did take advantage of this. Eventually everything was 50/50 in our relationship metaphorically, not only talking about money. I‚Äôm the type of guy that only gives as much as he receives and I know this is a bad part of my personality, while she literally dedicated her life to me because I‚Äôm the first guy she ever loved so much. When I told her I was accepted to _______, she started breaking down and begged me for days to not go and leave her (she didn‚Äôt make any close friends during the year, so she spent all her time with me) since I was basically her everything. I didn‚Äôt budge a bit because I knew I was gonna goto the new university as it had a better ranking (I come from a family that holds academic pride really high), more opportunities, and I just always wanted to go there, and I just didn‚Äôt want her to change my mind so I accepted the offer without telling/talking it over with her. Over a month or two, she‚Äôs been more accepting of this and we decided to do LDR. But recently these past couple weeks she‚Äôs been losing feelings for me since you know a lot of stuff happened and she‚Äôs come to terms with them. She‚Äôs having thoughts of just breaking things while they‚Äôre still ok but she decided not to. We‚Äôre currently thinking about just seeing how the next school year goes and we‚Äôre gonna go with the flow. Is this a good idea?

414,"Context: I'm 18 years old I have an online business based around cheats for video games bringing me an income anywhere from $1k-4k CAD per month depending on the month and how hard I'm grinding. I was able to save up a lot of money from a few months that brought me thousands and I comfortably bought an 2010 Audi S5 for $12k after taxes (rare deal because it was high milage). There was no problems except 1 fuel pump going bad which was around a grand to repair and the gas consumption was terribly bad because the car was modded, it was bad but worth it and I could afford it.

The car was lots and lots of fun but long story short I totaled it and got $10k CAD from the insurance which is 77% of what I could have received if I was on the insurance.

Right now I want to buy a Subaru BRZ but they are around $15k before tax and I would be left with roughly around $5k in savings if I bought one. I still live with my parents with no serious intention to move out in near future and I usually spend a bit more than $1k monthly.

This leaves me thinking that I can afford to buy that car however the insurance is freaking me out a little bit. After I totaled the car which was labeled as a responsible accident my mom's insurance for her car went from $30 per month to $150 per month. She then called the insurance and they made sure I wasn't gonna touch her car and then lowered it to $17. I have the option to register the car on my name and pay bands for the insurance or to register it on my moms name and put myself as the second driver like I was supposed to do with the Audi (my mom never bothered to call to add me to the insurance after I got my license hence why I only got paid 77%).

430,"I know that there is a difference in experience level due to age, but we both have 3 years food service experience which is the field we are supervising. Is this normal for a company to do? When I ask my employer about it, should I just ask for a raise because of my credentials or do I mention how frustrating it is that my subordinate is earning the same base wage as I am? To my understanding they offered her this wage because it was likely the most they could offer with her acceptance without going over my wage. 
My yearly review isn't for 6 months but I don't think I deserve to wait 6 months only to find out the answer is no. Do I ask now for a raise?

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when‚Äôs our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‚Äòmines 21st‚Äô and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‚Äòoh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?‚Äô Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‚Äòooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don‚Äôt think my bf would like that, I don‚Äôt think my bf would like that‚Äô  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn‚Äôt even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here?

I dont know when it started, but she hasn‚Äôt been able to sleep well at night, she wakes up every 1 hour or something and has a hard time falling back asleep.

She says everything stresses her, absolutely everything, but nothing specific. She always has this uneasy feeling that she can‚Äôt describe, she doesn‚Äôt know where the source is coming from. So whenever I ask her if she is sad she says she doesn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs in that mood. 

I‚Äôve tried my best to support her, talk to her, care for her but the problem is still there. Also because of the lack of sleep, she is always a bit tired and sleepy and kind of negative?

She is usually a caring and loving person but right now she‚Äôs kind of the opposite, I‚Äôm pretty sure there hasn‚Äôt been any event like family member‚Äôs death or anything like that, it just suddenly happened. Or not completely suddenly, it kind of grew bigger and bigger up until this point.

439,"My (23F) best friend (23F) just started dating her long distance boyfriend (24M) in June (went on their first date in June). This weekend she had a house warming party where a lot of her friends and her sister were meeting him for the first time. I met him for the first time last week and the PDA was A LOT. I figured I wouldn‚Äôt say anything because I didn‚Äôt want to jump the gun and have criticism the first time I met him. He‚Äôs a very nice kid and treats her well which is most important. 

She had her house warming party and the PDA was off the charts, so much worse than the week before. All ass grabbing, ass slapping, but her boob in front of everyone, put his hands down her shirt,non stop making out, wouldn‚Äôt stop touching her, excessive hugging, making sex comments, etc. everyone was extremely uncomfortable. I had multiple people make comments to me about it and how it was a huge turn off towards her and her boyfriend because it was very unclassy. Some PDA is to be expected but this was just very excessive.

Another thing that people were upset about was her friends from work drove 5 hours to the city she just moved to, to be there for her house warming and she ditched them at the bar to go bang her boyfriend at home. One of my friends ran up to me and told me her friends were very confused and honestly upset because they drove all this way to be with her, for her to bail unannounced. At this point it was 1:00AM and I wanted to go home but made sure I stayed out with them to show them more bars and we got food and I walked them back to her house to make sure they were ok. If I wasn‚Äôt there and no one told me her two friends would have been roaming this huge city in bars they‚Äôre unfamiliar with for who knows how long and she didn‚Äôt even take that in to consideration. When she left she didn‚Äôt even know I was still there. 

SO reddit, not sure how I should talk to her without it seeming like I‚Äôm coming at her throat. I know she cares about this kid and she takes other peoples opinions about her relationships to heart. I‚Äôm not the hugest fan of him, her roommates don‚Äôt like him, nor do our other friends at this point. I feel like I owe her the courtesy of saying that they made people uncomfortable to the point where they don‚Äôt want to be around them, and they should just tone it down next time. Also I want to talk to her about bailing on her friends because it was shitty and they were upset. She gets very defensive though and will definitely yell at me so I‚Äôm trying to proceed with caution.

440,"Firstly let me start off by saying, I'm not saying all women are s.l.u.t.s (I spelt it that way because this community doesn't allow the S word to be used)
Whoever it seems that girls will have sex with any guy as long as they manage to display attractive traits such as confidence and use the proper body language and have a good conversation with them. I always hear stories from online on Reddit and other sites about people and their stories about sex. I also have met women online who are very perverted in fact MORE PERVERTED than me and im a guy! They also tell talk about sex and the types of guys they like, their favorite positions etc. But what happened to monogamous relationships? 
Anyways, after hearing all of this I had some thoughts. All these women... Where are their parents? Their family? Why are these women so dirty? 
It seems that a lot of girls in society are promiscious. 
And now I'm starting to worry about my little sister.  She's 10 years old. What if she ends up like those girls? Whenever I hear guys talking about their sex life and how they pick up girls, I always think ""what if that girl was my sister?"" Being used by those guys for their sexual fulfilment. This has really been bothering me a lot more lately to the point where Everytime I fantasize about girls or hear about a girl having sex I always wonder ""what if that was my sister?"" It fucking bothers me so much. I even had a thought that worries me. I feel that someday i might even stalk my own sister when she's older and stop any guy from making a move on her. 

I want to know what goes wrong in the life of promiscious women? What leads girls to have sex with different guys without having to be in a relationship with them. How can I stop my sister from sleeping around? 
I don't mind if my sister has a boyfriend she has sex with but I don't want her to sleep with multiple guys.

449,"TL; DR @ the bottom.

So for a little background, I (24F) dated a guy, we'll call him C (29M) a little under 5 YEARS ago for around 3 or 4 months. It was a very faced paced relationship that was both mentally and emotionally damaging and exhausting. It ended in very poor terms as I had him arrested. A few weeks after we ended he started dating another woman (24F), we'll call her B. 

Now during this 5 year period, I have had little to know contact with C as seeing him terrifys me and if I do see him I will immediately leave where I am to get away. B on the other hand will constantly message me on all sorts of social media accounts (all of which I block) 

Lately, she's taken to messaging me everyday, either through a friend's Facebook or making a new account for herself or through instagram. She's throwing all sorts of allegations and names around and has even had C message me once or twice causing me unneeded amounts of stress. 

I have screenshots of all of this and I'm just wondering if I should just continue blocking her and ignoring as much as I can or do I file a police report stating I'm being harassed? 

I'm just unsure as to why it's continuing when they've been together for 4 years now and have 2 kids, I don't talk about them or do any of the things she's saying so it seems silly to me that she's been harrassing me for going on 5 years now. 

TL;DR: Woman has been harrassing me for 5 years through different forms of social media because I dated her fiance 5 years ago for 3 months. Should I file a police report?",25Aug2019,2

I thought living at uni I would find so many new friends but my roommates and I don‚Äôt really talk anymore than saying hello. My course is fairly small (about 60 people in my year), and I‚Äôve got a few friends there but not real friends. Yeah we go to class together, walk home, sometimes go out and drink but that‚Äôs about it. I don‚Äôt talk to them about anything serious, and sometimes they go out and do stuff without me. It sucks but it‚Äôs better than having no one at all. At the end of semester I‚Äôll be going home for a few months for uni holidays, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do next year. 

I‚Äôm thinking I could transfer to the campus in Brisbane, an hour closer to home, and the student accomodation is about $100 a week cheaper. But I‚Äôm worried that starting fresh could make life at uni even worse, if I don‚Äôt make friends in my course since it‚Äôs second year and there isn‚Äôt as many orientation things it could be harder. But it could be the best thing I do, as I‚Äôm really struggling at the moment not having to anyone except my boyfriend. 

If I don‚Äôt move to Brisbane I‚Äôll probably stay at a private student accomodation, hopefully I would make good friends there with roommates and neighbours, but I would still be stuck with the same girls at uni.

469," Help me.. I just killed my classmate and I am typing this with blood on my hands.

I will tell you why I did this...

Charlie was an annoying cunt for the whole year.. He always swore at me, always made fun of me and always stole my food and put it in the bin. I tried telling a teacher but he always said, ""Snitchers get stitches,"" this made me very anxious as he wasn't someone that you mess with.

One day, I came to school and as I entered the school gates, I saw Charlie and his friends beating up one of my best friends, Ben. I ran over (if was before school started, no teachers were on duty) and found that my best friend, Ben was in fact laughing. He was paid by Charlie to pretend to be being beaten up so that I would come to the alley. Ben had straight-up betrayed me. The one friend that I had in this terrible world.

Ben grabbed me and threw me on the floor. Thankfully, my bag was there to make the fall not as painful as it would have been. Charlie and his friends came over and started kicking me over and over and over and over and over. I closed my eyes and prayed that this torture would end.

Now, you would all be thinking, how did they get away with it? Well, long story short, they didn't. After about 3 minutes of them absolutely beating the living **shit** out of me, my Science teacher came to the rescue. At first he didn't do anything. He just stared. I was actually worried that he might beat me up as well. But after about 5 seconds of staring. He shouted with the ferocity of a lion. He shooed Charlie away and came over to me. He lifted me up and took me to the nurse's wing. The nurse gasped at first but she quickly started operating on me. I was sent home early and Charlie, his friends and my once best friend Ben had all been expelled.

I came back home around a week after this incident. My parents was still out working so I would be home alone. I entered the home using the side gate after entering the password. I put my bag down and took out my computer. I had finished all my work at school so I knew that I could chill in my room and watch PewDiePie's Minecraft LetsPlay. However, someone was in my room. It was Charlie.

I thought that it wasn't him.. It couldn't be! What was Charlie doing in **MY ROOM? MY HOUSE?** We stared at each other for a brief time. I thought that he might have come to apologise but I was wondering how he got in. I asked him with a raspy voice, ""How did you get in?"" He didn't reply. I jumped at me and tackled me onto the floor. I knew that this time, there wouldn't be my Science teacher rescuing me. Charlie knew it as well. I wasn't thinking properly. But in that moment I wanted to kill him. I wanted to end his life to end my suffering. I grabbed the scissors that were on my desk. I plunged the sharp side inside his stomach. He grunted in pain as he doubled over, falling on my old clothes. Blood was running from his stomach and it was running down my hand. I watched him as he struggled breathing and stopped breathing all together. I had killed him.

Soon after, as I was wondering what I would do, I heard a voice. ""Ryan! Ryan! Daddy's home!""  
I locked the door and said, ""Dad, welcome home, I'm working on my assignment! Please don't distract me!""  
And here I am writing this as my dad takes a shower. Blood smeared on my keyboard and Charlie's blood all over me. I hear the shower water stop and a minute later, I hear a rattling on my door knob. ""Ryan, let me give you a hug, I know you've had a tough day!""

I freeze, what should I do?!?!

She also does the same thing when watching tv shows.... constantly talking during them.

I've brought this up to her several times, to please stop talking so we can hear the show, to ignoring her and focusing on the show, to saying ""shh let's listen."" None of them work for very long if at all. 

When it happens outside of tv shows, I've said ""Hang on, I'm in the middle of a story"" or ""Can I finish what I'm saying?"" or recently I've started getting snippy and saying ""You keep interrupting me!"" and then I just say as little as possible since I'm tired of being interrupted.

I can't think of any other ideas to get the message across to her. I realize I painted her as a selfish douche, but she's not like that AT ALL. She's very caring and polite, so it surprises me she does this.

( please excuse my grammar English isn't my mother-tongue) i am a male 19 years old and currently   around ‚Ç¨2.500 in debt to some American students  that might not sound alot ( i feel bad for you guys :(  ) the only reason i am so much in debt is because of my mothers ex drug addiction it all started when i was around 16 years old she started stealing my money and savings that i saved up my whole live it was about  ‚Ç¨ 3.000 euro's in total it went on and of till now and still has major effects on my daily life. not only did she use the money to buy her drugs but i also used my money to pay the rent a few times and other bills (no one else in the family knew about it because i was terribly ashamed and still am but they know about it now and some support us sometimes + family relations aren't that good between my aunt and my mum and my aunt is my grandma's favorite + a lot of other things  ) while this drained my bank account my dad (parents are split up since ages ) decided to cut my allowance which resulted in me not able to pay my insurance which caused a major part of my current debt and in the area where i live there aren't many places which hire unskilled high school grads so it took me a while to find a job ( i got one now recently but it doesn't even pay  ‚Ç¨ 1000 euro's a month full time most of which i still use to pay for short comings as: groceries/ bills and school supplies ) so the debt has been building up i tried to pay it off but i just can't do that currently because i got accepted to go to college. but i am still really stressed about this whole situation my mum has  welfare  and a government organ handles her financial aspects now but its not enough for us both so i am currently thinking about not going to college and just keep working full time and keep paying of my debts or going to college and work part time and earn even less and possible get in more trouble. so can anyone give me any advice on this situation? thank you,25Aug2019,1
477,"Lets start from the beginning.

My dad is with another woman.
He owed her something and now she won't let him go.
He's trapped.

That's old news.
My mom knows. My mom is the crazy and emotional type of mom.
I found out at an early age while eavesdropping on one of the fights my mom and dad occasionally have.

They've been fighting, screaming, shouting, and cursing at each other for as long as I can remember.
5 years actually.

They still haven't solved it. They choose to ignore it.
My dad lives in another country for business purposes.

He visits frequently.
Like 1-2 months later.
He visits for 4 days or a week at best.
And when he visits, they always fight.

I have a little sister too.
My family (including all my cousins) is considerably large.

But I have close cousins.
I love them as if they were my siblings.
They live in another country.

My mom, my sister and I visit my cousins in the holidays.

My cousins' family consists of a mom, a brother, and a sister (their father left at an early age)
They are a happy family, despite of their minor financial problems.

This month, I visited them. Alone. Without my mom and my sister.
I ended up having the greatest time, and for once in my life I felt free.

During my visit my mom called frequently, she asked about me, if I was sad, and if I wanted to come back early, and that she misses me a lot.

During my visit my father happened to visit my mom. 
They fought. 
While my little sister was there.

They never went out. 
They were miserable.

While I was out having fun.
I felt guilty, so I called my mom and told her to have fun for once in her life, go out, eat, take my sister to an arcade or something.

But she didn't listen.

Now, at some point in my visit I thought of moving in with my cousins and leave my mom.
But I couldn't do that to her.

A few months ago, she asked me if I wanted to move in the country in which my cousins were living in.
I said no, but I didn't know I would want to later on.

So I came back home, my mom told me she would never allow me to go alone again.
She also told me she wouldn't know what to do when I'd get a job and move away.
She expects me to stay with her forever.

I love her, I am thankful for all the things she has done for me, but this was too much.
I asked her if we could move in with my cousins, she said no.

And when I asked her why, she told me that living with people who aren't your close family causes problems.

She told me staying far from them is good.

For reasons I haven't mentioned, my mom has issues, everyone suggests for her to go to a therapist.
But she doesn't listen.

Help would be greatly appreciated.

481,"A while ago i read a quote on a bullshit motivational page on instagram. It said something like:
""Once you set a standard for how people should treat you, a lot of 'friends' will walk out of your life. Don't let anyone treat you like shit""
I don't remember the exact words, but it was something like that. So lately I've been going by that rule, because I'm tired of people using me or talking to me just when they need something. 
I've met a lot of people here, and I've ended up cutting off a lot of them for a lot of reasons, for example:

- Showing no interest whatsoever in conversations or putting zero effort to keep them going 
- Taking literally 4, 5, 6+ hours to reply to a message even though they're constantly online, either posting on reddit, playing games, posting snapchat stories, posting on Instagram, etc.
- Our only fluent conversations are when they need advice or help on something. 

Those are just a few examples of reasons why I've cut people off without any notice or explanation, i just remove them without telling them anything, because i started seeing those kinds of behaviors as 'disrespectful' towards me.

But almost everyone i meet on here, on subreddits made for meeting people, do that kind of stuff, meaning I've cut off almost every single person I've met, and I've been feeling really lonely.
 
So, i don't know if I'm an asshole for expecting to be treated a certain way, more specifically, to be treated the same way i treat people (not taking too long to reply, making efforts to keep the conversation going, texting them first sometimes, showing interest in the friendship, etc....) or is it ok for me to do that?",25Aug2019,1

483,"Hi Reddit,

I recently landed a very stable job at a good company/organization. I definitely want retire here (as do most people) eventually because of the great benefits, pension, and room for growth. 


Here's the deal: I want to explore the world before I ""settle down"" and live abroad for a few years. I do travel a lot, but it is not the same. If that means working as a waitress then so be it. Issue is, this would be a huge risk as I am not guaranteed a job when I come back since my resume is average. I don't want to regret the decision. If I do this, now is the best time because I don't have kids or a partner to worry about. 


I would look for a job related to what I am doing now abroad, but I'm somewhat entry level in business/finance, which means my choices are very limited since the company would have to sponsor me.

485,"Help me.. I just killed my classmate and I am typing this with blood on my hands.

I will tell you why I did this...

Charlie was an annoying cunt for the whole year.. He always swore at me, always made fun of me and always stole my food and put it in the bin. I tried telling a teacher but he always said, ""Snitchers get stitches,"" this made me very anxious as he wasn't someone that you mess with.

One day, I came to school and as I entered the school gates, I saw Charlie and his friends beating up one of my best friends, Ben. I ran over (if was before school started, no teachers were on duty) and found that my best friend, Ben was in fact laughing. He was paid by Charlie to pretend to be being beaten up so that I would come to the alley. Ben had straight-up betrayed me. The one friend that I had in this terrible world.

Ben grabbed me and threw me on the floor. Thankfully, my bag was there to make the fall not as painful as it would have been. Charlie and his friends came over and started kicking me over and over and over and over and over. I closed my eyes and prayed that this torture would end.

Now, you would all be thinking, how did they get away with it? Well, long story short, they didn't. After about 3 minutes of them absolutely beating the living **shit** out of me, my Science teacher came to the rescue. At first he didn't do anything. He just stared. I was actually worried that he might beat me up as well. But after about 5 seconds of staring. He shouted with the ferocity of a lion. He shooed Charlie away and came over to me. He lifted me up and took me to the nurse's wing. The nurse gasped at first but she quickly started operating on me. I was sent home early and Charlie, his friends and my once best friend Ben had all been expelled.

I came back home around a week after this incident. My parents was still out working so I would be home alone. I entered the home using the side gate after entering the password. I put my bag down and took out my computer. I had finished all my work at school so I knew that I could chill in my room and watch PewDiePie's Minecraft LetsPlay. However, someone was in my room. It was Charlie.

I thought that it wasn't him.. It couldn't be! What was Charlie doing in **MY ROOM? MY HOUSE?** We stared at each other for a brief time. I thought that he might have come to apologise but I was wondering how he got in. I asked him with a raspy voice, ""How did you get in?"" He didn't reply. I jumped at me and tackled me onto the floor. I knew that this time, there wouldn't be my Science teacher rescuing me. Charlie knew it as well. I wasn't thinking properly. But in that moment I wanted to kill him. I wanted to end his life to end my suffering. I grabbed the scissors that were on my desk. I plunged the sharp side inside his stomach. He grunted in pain as he doubled over, falling on my old clothes. Blood was running from his stomach and it was running down my hand. I watched him as he struggled breathing and stopped breathing all together. I had killed him.

Soon after, as I was wondering what I would do, I heard a voice. ""Ryan! Ryan! Daddy's home!""I locked the door and said, ""Dad, welcome home, I'm working on my assignment! Please don't distract me!""And here I am writing this as my dad takes a shower. Blood smeared on my keyboard and Charlie's blood all over me. I hear the shower water stop and a minute later, I hear a rattling on my door knob. ""Ryan, let me give you a hug, I know you've had a tough day!""

I freeze, what should I do?!?!

I jumped at me and tackled me onto the floor. I knew that this time, there wouldn't be my Science teacher rescuing me. Charlie knew it as well. I wasn't thinking properly. But in that moment I wanted to kill him. I wanted to end his life to end my suffering. I grabbed the scissors that were on my desk. I plunged the sharp side inside his stomach. He grunted in pain as he doubled over, falling on my old clothes. Blood was running from his stomach and it was running down my hand. I watched him as he struggled breathing and stopped breathing all together. I had killed him.

Soon after, as I was wondering what I would do, I heard a voice. ""Ryan! Ryan! Daddy's home!""I locked the door and said, ""Dad, welcome home, I'm working on my assignment! Please don't distract me!""And here I am writing this as my dad takes a shower. Blood smeared on my keyboard and Charlie's blood all over me. I hear the shower water stop and a minute later, I hear a rattling on my door knob. ""Ryan, let me give you a hug, I know you've had a tough day!""

I freeze, what should I do?!?!

499,"Hi all

We have a noisy neighbour who both of our bedrooms share a wall with (cleaning the house, occasionally the tv moving furniture and doors) from like 10.30pm-1am some mornings. I sleep through it (I could sleep through most things) by my partner is at whits end and has taken to going to her parents house some evenings if it‚Äôs been several nights in a row of massively disturbed sleep.

We‚Äôve asked twice (months apart) if they could be a little more considerate and just got verbal abuse that we were being unreasonable, they‚Äôre not even doing anything at that time so it‚Äôs not them, anyway they‚Äôre allowed to make noise if they want, the walls are too thick to hear anything...they put up with our noise at 6am when we get up (there‚Äôs a lot of logical contradictions in their shouting...but I‚Äôm not dwelling on that).

So looks like we have to try more ‚Äòin house‚Äô solutions. Do you helpful people have any good advice about how to cut the noise down from neighbours (particularly banging) because asking nicely hasn‚Äôt really helped or helping my partner sleep through/go to sleep during it like I do?",25Aug2019,1
500,So i‚Äôve been bi-curious (questioning if i‚Äôm bisexual) for a little bit now and I‚Äôm more attracted to men than women but I could never imagine myself doing anything sexual with a girl? Like i‚Äôm more than happy to be sexual with a guy but it makes me a little uncomfortable to think about going any further with a girl. Any advice with how I should proceed with this? üòî,25Aug2019,1
501,"ok so this guy who i have a somewhat crush on texted me he kinda likes me and wants to hangout&amp;amp;get to know me better. but after he confessed, he hasn‚Äôt started the conversation at all? like it‚Äôs always me doing the talking first.. i hate doing it because i feel like i‚Äôm coming off clingy and annoying. what do i do?",25Aug2019,1
503,"So we‚Äôre both freshman in college at the same school. The college is 7+ hours away for both of us and we come from neighboring states. We met online like 2 months ago and have been talking a lot and we just moved in to school a few days ago. we met in person 2 nights ago when I invited her over to play uno with some other friends I met. i‚Äôve invited her to other group events to which she either said that maybe she‚Äôd show up later or she had something else going on. I haven‚Äôt asked her to hang out just the 2 of us yet. I like her but she doesn‚Äôt know that, and I can‚Äôt tell if she likes me. we‚Äôll be snap chatting and she‚Äôll send selfies that she‚Äôs clearly trying in then other times just send a pic of the wall or something so it‚Äôs kinda confusing. how do i make it clear to her that I like her and want to be more than friends? do I just straight up say it and see how she responds or what?",25Aug2019,1
504,"I‚Äôve been liking/ thinking about the same guy for the last three years. We went to the same school together and practically have known each other our whole lives. We became friends middle school and grew close around that time; we‚Äôd hang out together in groups a couple of times and always text and joke around. I never really liked him as more than a friend but I always thought he was cute and he said ( not to my face ) that I was the prettiest girl in our grade. After that we went to high school together for the first two years. Freshman Year I did not have classes with him so I never got to see or talk to him as often as I‚Äôd like. Though I never wanted to admit it to myself, I always felt attracted to him in some way. The next year we had a couple classes together. For some reason he was so hard to talk to, and , he would never come up to talk to me. There would be moments where while everyone else is talking and waiting for the bell to ring, him and I would just stand in the hall next which other and not say anything; he‚Äôd be messing with the lockers and I‚Äôd just not be able to think of something to say so I kept my head down. I never understood this. Why was he never willing to talk to me like he was with other girls who haven‚Äôt been his friend his whole life? Though all this was true, i‚Äôd sometimes catch him looking in my direction while in class or while in group conversations but I was not a part of. This made me confused bc I started to think that he may like me back. But If he was my friend why wouldnt he talk to me ? So I stopped snap chatting him back ‚Äústreaks‚Äù (which he started and I hated )- a pathetic excuse for a way of ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù ( I was obviously more upset because I liked him.) I am always  the first one to say hi. It just became so weird. I didn‚Äôt get what was happening. Again he was always generally shy, but I felt as though he treated me differently than other girls. I never had the courage to talk to him as much as I wanted but it‚Äôs because he was so hard to communicate with. I would try to be as casual as possible And ask if he wanted to hang out; he‚Äôd say yes in person and then completely avoid my texts  until the day passed or just come up with BS excuses. More recently I tried asking him if you wanted to hang out and he lied about being busy ( I know this for sure) and he didn‚Äôt even suggest another time which shows no interest at all. Id get so hurt and wouldn‚Äôt  stop thinking about his rejecting me. While we talk he‚Äôs always thinking about his guy friends trying to call them so he can find out where they were at school (and therefore leave me, again being rude to me). I‚Äôd always be the one making the effort to talk to him but he‚Äôd always push me away. He goes to a different school now so I rarely ever see him. When I do see him it‚Äôs somewhat awkward and he still acts the same. 

Anyway, if I get a good opportunity, I was thinking of telling him that I had feelings for him, and that I couldn‚Äôt leave the college without getting it off my chest? Though I still have those butterflies whenever I see them in person, I think it‚Äôs safest to say that I liked him rather than like him present tense. This definitely had never happened to him and as u can tell I‚Äôve never told the guy I liked him before. And also in regards to his behavior around me, does he like, me hate me or is he indifferent? 

***Side note : anytime a guy has ever liked me I would always hear it from their friends and never from them. Some people say that this is because guys may find a girl intimidating. By the way he is acting around me, is this the case?",25Aug2019,0

So I (19f) ended my 2 year long relationship with my now ex boyfriend (24m) 3 months ago
He suffers from borderline personality disorder and a narcissistic personality disorder (he says at least)
It all started of really friendly, we were really in love and he treated me like a princess
It was a long distance relationship (4 hour drive) but we made it work and I visited him almost every weekend or paid for his trips here (he didn't have a job our entire relationship)
It all went down hill when like 4 months in when I told him that my coworker was sexually harassing me and he accused me of cheating on him with him, his whole persona suddenly changed and he started heavily insulting me, physically assaulting me and he slammed a door in my mother's face
We somehow made up but it only got worse from then on
I had to be careful with every word I said, he was controlling me with my friends, my Internet use and the clothes I wore (calling me a slut for wearing acrylic nails or fake lashes, accusing me of cheating on him when I was talking to male friends or when I didn't double text him when I was online on WhatsApp and he didn't answer my message yet)
He would yell at me on the phone or threaten to kill himself when I didn't do what he wanted me to, he would yell at me for not having sex with him and he would heavily insult me at least once a week
I really loved him and I tried anything to make it work but by the end it almost killed me and I broke up with him
AITA for doing so? I mean obviously it was toxic and all but at the same time he has mental problems and was clear about it from the start and I promised to stay with him through good and bad times and I feel like he really loved me and I feel guilty for leaving him, I know I hurt him so much doing it but I also had to think of my own health?

515,"Bit of background. My son had the most amazing pre-school teacher last year. My wife and I were sad to switch schools, but my work relocated and we had to move to a neighboring area. The commute wasn‚Äôt going to be feasible.

Teacher politely asked us on our son‚Äôs last day of school if she could keep in contact with us because she‚Äôd love to take our son out on play dates- something she can do, now that she‚Äôs not longer his teacher.

I assumed one of us would go with our son, but she‚Äôs never invited us and although we‚Äôd offer to come along, she would assure us it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary. I do trust her and know she‚Äôs quite capable of looking after him. They‚Äôve since gone on 4 full day trips and I‚Äôve offered to compensate her for her time and she‚Äôs politely declined each time.

Outside of our interactions with her as our son‚Äôs teacher, we don‚Äôt know too much about her.  We‚Äôve met her fianc√© once and have offered to treat them both to lunch but she‚Äôs always found a excuse to not go. It feels very much like she has zero interest in hanging out with us.

525,"TL;DR: My roommate eats only around 500-800 calories a day and is super proud of that. A rare genetic disease makes it even more important for her to eat healthy and exercise, but she won‚Äôt listen to me when I tell her that I am worried. 

My roommate is driving me insane with her eating patterns, or lack thereof.

My roommate is not only 9 years older than me, she also weighs 9 kg less than me. She is 27 and weighs 50 kg (110lbs). Yes, she is a bit shorter, but she also has close to no muscles. That is mainly due to a rare genetic disease that influences the connection between the nerves. She can‚Äôt carry any heavy goods, sometimes her legs just give out and she sleeps at least 12 hours a day.

As far as I have understood it from her mother, all these facts make it especially important for her to eat enough and exercise (aka go to physical therapy) so she can at least regain some strength.

However, she proudly told me that she has only eaten around 500 calories today and doesn‚Äôt plan on eating any more. (For reference: A healthy person needs around 1300 calories a day just for the basic body functions like keeping the brain running and the body warm.) She asked me how much calories the cheese has, which she was eating while I was walking into the kitchen, and as I said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know..150 maybe?‚Äù She literally looked at me in shock and said ‚Äúthen I‚Äôd better stop eating it.‚Äù 

I feel like...Idk. If she would start to eat a normal amount of calories she would feel a lot better, and I told her I am worried about her. I first noticed this as I was/am literally the only one eating anything out of our fridge. Her mum told me she refused to eat at all right after getting her diagnoses and as I talked to her about it she just brushed it off as: ‚Äúyeah the doctors were worried, but well, I just have shitty eating patterns.‚Äù Wtf am I supposed to do about this? 

She obviously suffers (also mentally) because of her disease, but sometimes I feel like she has just ‚Äúgiven up‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt want to get any better anymore. She also repeatedly says she is fat, which is just not true. And I tell her that. As I just now reminded her that she should take in at least 1300 calories, she just rolled her eyes on me.",25Aug2019,1

The guy is a rugby player with autism. He is really sexist but is a loyal good friend. He tried to make out with my my freshman year, which I declined. His gf knows that. He is very good looking and projects what he finds attractive in a woman into me. Has been telling me to get a bigger butt since freshman year, despite all of my attempts to tell him I‚Äôm happy with my body.
The girl is a friend of mine who is really insecure. She is a nutrition major, so she analyzed what I eat and she asked me if she can nutrition counsel me for a class project.

In reality, our family lives in a shitty rented house, barely able to afford a car, and my dad is unemployed because he is too lazy to get a job. My dad buys expensive stuff for me even though I don‚Äôt want it. I keep telling him that he needs to spend money on our car and paying our rent (paid rent 5 times in 2 years but the landlords are nice) but he refuses to listen to a gullible fuck like me because I‚Äôm 14. He also flexes on how he was formerly Illinois top 50 students and he has an IQ of 162. Fucking laughable. My dad acts like the nicest person in public and he is very persuasive. In reality he is an abusive fuck who screams at his wife and his little shits. 

So one day I politely told him to stop flexing on my friends. He said shut up because it will all happen. I told him that he has been saying that for a decade straight (not even joking). Also I told him my friends call me a lying hypocrite and I told him that he shouldn‚Äôt flex on other people but with our family it‚Äôs fine. Instead of saying okay, he tells me that this is his house and I shouldn‚Äôt have friends in the first place. He says that he‚Äôll never meet my friends ever again and I am never allowed to hang out with them. He has the right to flex whenever he wants. It‚Äôs embarrassing and if we question him he‚Äôll kick us out of the house. 

The funny thing to this all is that my dad won‚Äôt let my mom leave the house unless she has his permission. He also ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù money from his in laws and they are broke and one of my mom‚Äôs brother is divorced because of him. He stole money from multiple people and we have to live a life as a scammer because my dad is a lazy fuck. Sometimes my dad made me convince other people.

530,"So I just realized this is a problem. To use the situation I'm in as an example:

I (24F) moved in with roommates (27F, 29F) about three months ago. I found them on Craigslist. It's okay and they're nice... They're just really messy and social. I'm not the cleanest person and I begrudgingly admit I have an anxiety disorder, but I try not to let it hold me back from communicating with my roommates. We're all busy, so 90% of our communication is through text. But I'm usually the only one texting, which means I'm the only one bringing up problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent example: They never take the trash out and sometimes they put trash in with the recyclables (plastic wrappers, used paper towels). I texted to make sure I was correct in thinking the little can (we have two garbage cans in the kitchen) was for recyclables. 27F texted me back and said yes, then claimed she didn't notice trash in with the recyclables (this has been going on for weeks.)

&amp;#x200B;

I admit that I judge this roommate harshly. She buys cases of bottled water, drives everywhere (even to the store a 5 minute walk away) though we live in the middle of one of the top 5 biggest cities in the US, and is a social worker (!) who doesn't read the news. She's latina and she doesn't watch anything other than telenovelas and award shows. She just seems so shallow and it makes me angry to see someone with her job act like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

She and the other roommate don't notice little things like I do. I know I have a problem with hyperawareness so I'm often on edge. They both stomp when they walk (which doesn't help my anxiety. This is one thing I haven't talked to them about because it's so nitpicky), one of them chipped my bowl when doing the dishes and didn't apologize, and they both leave messes (food in the kitchen, puddles of water on the bathroom floor) everywhere. It mainly just pisses me off that they can waltz through life so carefree when I literally tiptoe around, worry about the consequences of my smallest actions, and feel a social responsibility to make things better (in this case, through recycling correctly.) I'm younger than both of them and I feel like I'm living with college students who have never been on their own before.

They have started showing signs of dimentia in the past few years, it started with forgetting names, then how to do simple math, then forgetting where they‚Äôve placed things to now having the same conversation multiple times a day and then being sure I haven‚Äôt had the same conversation with them 20 minutes ago.

The problem is, they were crying to me the other day about how they don‚Äôt want to forget me and other loved ones. I‚Äôm very social I‚Äôm almost never home and this family member doesn‚Äôt have any friends as they all moved years and years ago and I feel sorry for them being alone so much and it made me try spend more time at home. Disaster.

They‚Äôve always been a stressful person, every conversation turns into complaining about one thing or another or an argument they had with a stranger while out shopping or reminding me of simple things 24/7 such as don‚Äôt put my hand in the oven cause it‚Äôs hot (when I‚Äôve just cooked and switched it off) or telling me to look before I cross a road every time we go out together. I can‚Äôt do anything without a warning of what could happen and it feels very belittling. I‚Äôve begged and pleaded for them to stop but it just doesn‚Äôt happen it‚Äôs how they are. It‚Äôs very stressful to me trying to have a nice conversation and it just being turned into nothing but one of those things. It‚Äôs always been that way and they won‚Äôt stop even when asked nicely.

I‚Äôve found myself distancing myself more and more so I don‚Äôt get treated like a child or have every conversation turn into complaining or a full scale argument within minutes.

As you can see I‚Äôm conflicted into do I just keep myself stressed by having to deal with these conversations that almost 100% turn into arguments on they‚Äôre part or keep myself distanced, very hard as I‚Äôve lived with them my whole life and I don‚Äôt want to know they‚Äôve forgot me and I‚Äôve not spent that much time with them while they‚Äôre memory is still somewhat there. Any advice appreciated",25Aug2019,1
534,"This whole situation has been pretty devastating for everyone involved so I'll get right to the point.

My friend (F18) moved in with me (F20) a couple of weeks ago, and it's already been a serious disaster.

The second day she was here she invited someone over who she had never met or spoken to before that very day, even though this was against the agreed upon rules. They had an argument and he threatened to assault her, so she kicked him out. After he left I reminded her of the rules but she just laughed it off (I am seriously uncomfortable with anyone having random men over because none of the bedroom doors have locks).

Anyway, she ignored me, and the next weekend she got black out drunk and brought her 'friend' home (I don't actually know if she knew this guy or not). She was unconscious from the alcohol and eventually woke up to being raped. While this was happening, I was in the room next door asleep. She came into my room crying the next morning so I paid for an uber and we went to the hospital together. I sat with her and comforted her for 6 hours. Eventually she decided not to file a police report, but she had to stay at the hospital for a few more hours and I was exhausted (I have chronic pain) so I called my parents to pick me up. We went home to clean up since my roommate had vomited and pooped everywhere in the bathroom. I didn't feel safe to stay in the house, knowing there were multiple dangerous men out there who now knew our address, so I'm staying with my parents right now.

Of course I don't blame my roommate in any way for what happened to her. I'm just concerned about the bigger picture here, and her pattern of behaviour. She drinks every single night, and gets black-out drunk every weekend. She doesn't respect the precautions I have put in place for the benefit of our own safety. She's always struggled a lot with serious mental health issues and I really don't think she's ready to move out. She needs more support than I can provide.

I really don't want to kick her out because I know I'll not only be losing my roommate, but my friend, but I just don't know what to do.",25Aug2019,2

536,"I will try to keep it short. I have realized my quality of life is not par with where it should be but circumstance unfortunately holds the cards in a lot of my options. I fear things are only getting worse and I will be homeless worst case scenario should I crumble under. 

I am chronically ill. I struggle day to day with fatigue, tachycardia (controlled mostly with beta blockers), hormone problems from a non-cancerous growth on my pituitary gland (I take a scary drug that causes severe drowsiness and heart problems just so I have a period each month). With that said working can be a challenge. I currently work 37 hours per week and make $11 an hour as a bookkeeper. My paycheck each week is anything from $260-$330 on average.

 I put away $250 each week from that check to my bill box for rent, and put back $20 for rides to work via Uber (I don't drive and couldn't afford to even if I had a license) and the rest goes to food. I know that sounds like enough but I also have two cats that I have to buy cat litter weekly and cat food, and sometimes they get sick and need a vet. And there is household necessities like soap, toilet paper, trash bags, clothes detergent and those things aren't always cheap. 

I do not have any money left over to see a doctor and I currently see a endocrinologist for my pituitary tumor. I also just lost my health insurance because I turned 26 and I was denied Medicaid because I don't have children (how messed up is that?) I am in the process of buying Marketplace insurance but I don't even know if I can afford it depending on what plans I can choose. I am waiting for the end of month for Cigna to mail me a letter of discontinuation of service so I can send that to them to prove I am no longer on my dad's plan. 

I have a friend who suggests I get rid of my cats because they are a financial burden. I understand that, but the truth is I love them so much and I don't really want to part with them. But if it helps I will have to make that choice. I have looked and contacted cat rescue groups because I am NOT taking them to the shelter where they will be euthanized. I am torn. I do not know what to follow, my brain or my heart. My cats are all I have. I have no friends or partner and these cats have been there for me from day one. 

My expenses:

Studio apartment $823-$830 depending on water usage (water is split between tenants). 

Electric (TXU Energy) normally $95-$160 a month

Uber/Lyft rides to work $140 a month

Groceries $160 a month , sometimes a little more if family helps me 

I have been rejected for food stamps three times and applied again this month and they said they ""may"" be able to help me but I have to send them paystubs of my checks which I did this week and I am calling again tomorrow to see if I am approved. If I am rejected again I will be very upset. 

I really need new clothes. Some of my clothes smell like mildew and most of my pajama pants are ripped and I re-wear a lot of my clothes to work sometimes and it is embarrassing. But I can't afford it right now even though I want to say fuck it and break my small savings and just go get a few things. I haven't been shopping in forever. I miss it. I could really use a day out. 

Living by myself on $11 is tough.  I hate how my life has become a game of trying to keep my head above water. I am constantly thinking about money. How I am gonna eat this week? How am I going to see the doctor? Am I going to have to reschedule again? 

I know the obvious answer is work more or find a new job. But like I mentioned above my health is not 100% and I feel like shit everyday and my days off are spent recovering. I literally cannot force my body to work more. I will crash. I made that mistake last year when I took on a second job. I didn't even last a week. 

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions of how I can make my living situation better? Should I get rid of my cats? I have thought about getting a roommate but since it is a studio apartment and I have misophonia I don't think it would be a great idea. 

I'm trying really hard to adult and get better at life. But I feel all alone and it is hard.",25Aug2019,0
538,"My 40 year old sibling lives with our aging parents, at parents' expense, and my parents are too old to take care of my sibling anymore. 

My sibling drives, and works part-time, but his room is in second degree squalor. He don't participate in many activities of daily living such as cooking, showering regularly, putting on clean clothes, chatting, grocery shopping, housework. He eats poorly, doesn't exercise, stay indoors alone in their bedroom most of them time, gradually regressing over the years. He has squandered his savings on tchotchkes, and electronics.

When family members try to help my sibling, he rarely co-operates. Six family members separately have tried to intervene over the years, only to be overwhelmed and exhausted. 

My parents want him to move out, and are probably kicking him out within the year. My fellow siblings and I are afraid he will die and/or be homeless.  He moved out on his own a few years ago, when in better health, and nearly starved from self-neglect. 

What I would like is to have him go to the doctor, and get treated for whatever is causing these depressive symptoms. I want him to live and be okay. Trying to even bring this up, is met with such resistance that I am left exhausted and in tears.

I have my own children to take care of.  

I don't know what is the ethical thing to do (or not do) here. The phrases ""You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink"" and ""You are not required to set yourself on fire to keep other people warm"" come to mind.

540,"Firstly, I feel it important to establish the fact that I'm currently 18M as perhaps my youthful naivety is preventing me from understanding and approaching my situation in a different way. 

TLDR: I broke up with my ex-girlfriend but I still miss her deeply, why is this so and how do I get over her. 

Full Read: Anyway for some backstory; I'd met this girl online a good two years or so ago (I was 16 at the time). I thought she was great, similar interests, funny, cute, and I genuinely enjoyed having phone calls and conversations with her. After we'd been talking for a couple of months, I began to develop feelings for this girl, and not long after I'd 'asked her out' (it was a long distance thing at that point in time). We remained friends and didn't become official until we finally met in person; and I have to say that I'd never felt the emotions I did the day I finally got to meet her in person. We spent a fair bit of time together until she had to return home to a different state. Initially after her departure, we spoke just as frequently as we used to, but as time went on, we started speaking less and less, and it ultimately got to the point where it lead to out break up. I was somewhat blind (perhaps blindly in love) at the time, and didn't pick up little clues that we were drifting apart, but as the weeks passed afterwards, I began to feel even worse about it. Unbeknownst to me at the time, she had started seeing someone less than a few weeks after our split. I'd only found this out through inference and then confirmation through a friend of hers only a few months. Apart from that, many other things have been constantly on my mind  for quite some time now. For the entirety of this past year, I have had her on my mind almost every day, and it brings me to verge of tears on some days, and mental breakdowns on others. How come I still miss her so deeply and how can I move on?

541,"This is more of a rant. Someone on my friends list posted a picture of an extremely malnourished abused dog she and someone found on a dirt road. Dog was close to death.

All I could do was tell her to not feed it a lot. Offered to share it on an animal group asking for any advice and tag her in it so any questions could be directed to her. That was my only plan, to post on her behalf.

People were getting the assumption that I knew her personally and was personally involved in it and I received blame for not being able to get in contact with her. For commenting on her post and posting Screenshots of the people telling her to message her. 

Note: I have extreme social anxiety. This was very overwhelming to me.

Some of the rescuers from that group
were able to get in contact with her and the dog was transported to a hospital out of town. The dog survived the trip and was able to get a blood transfusion. I'm so thankful for that and it's why I have no regrets posting to that group.

Why the fuck do people in animal groups think it's a good idea to humiliate someone trying to help and scare them off from helping in them future? That poor dog got help and those rescuers wouldn't have known about it unless I shared it. Fucking stupid. I love the rescuers because they are the heros in this story and they were updating me in pm. But I won't be posting in that group again unless it's anonymous.

A few years ago they had the cops at one woman's house after she posted about a cat she found in the road and didn't reply to the messages because she was at work. The silence created accusations of her stealing the cat and everyone talking shit about her, she was in the dark about the shit storm until she got home and the house was surrounded by cops. She later posted and said she would not be helping any animals in the future because of that.

This won't stop me from helping in the future because fuck the toxic people of Facebook, the animal is more important. It just rubs me the wrong way.",25Aug2019,1

550,"A bit of a long ride, so buckle up for safety.

At the beginning of the year, I (27/F) met the most amazing human being (35/M) to have graced my life. He is the most genuine, kind, and incredible person whose soul spoke to mine from the moment we met. There are a lot of feelings and factors involved since our meeting that has become one of the most beautifully fostered relationships I've ever been in. I thought for a while that I was crazy for feeling the intensity that I do, but I've learned when your soul speaks to another, a connection through lifetimes doesn't require a time limit. Certain things don't translate from soul to spoken word.

To form some background, he moved alone to Boston last Fall. While originally born in the states, he lived in Israel for most of his life and has spent the last several years traveling, most of which he does alone. He works remotely, and in recent months it has become very hard for him to be here. The lack of family and friend support, needing more time to work on himself, working tirelessly to the bone with no end, feelings trapped, alone, and missing freedoms; a various amount of factors. A lot has gone on in his life laden very heavily with trauma (and he's still so fucking amazing) and after some serious thinking, he has decided he needs to move on and work more on fully exploring, fixing, and finding himself. There's a lot more to it and his situation, but I wanted to lay a basic groundwork while also not airing everything.

I absolutely understand this. I don't harbor any ill-will, I am not angry, and I'm not hurt. I'm just very, very, deeply sad. We discussed the possibility of me going with him or making it work here, but it's an adamant decision that he needs to do this alone and I fully respect that. I think where I am lost is what I will need to do after he is gone. I already feel very unsure and the only thing I am necessarily sure about is that I would like to continue seeing him until he leaves. He leaves the end of September (-insert Greenday quote here-). It's also hard to swallow because it's not a break-up, nothing is ending badly, he's just - leaving. It weirdly makes it harder. I guess what I am asking is what would you do in my shoes to both prepare prior to him leaving and after? Has anyone been in a situation similar in their own way, and how did you process it? Even if you haven't, I am appreciative of any thoughts on the situation. Part of me wants to run towards this and embrace it and the other wants to curl up and shrivel away. I want to give myself time away and alone. Self-care has never been my strong suit.

555,"Considering I was *actually* hopeless about five years ago, I'm actually pretty proud of myself! I've had a *lot* of help getting to this point, but I'm honestly super excited about finally having my own place. This feels like a huge benchmark in my life, I honestly feel like this is going to really turn things around for me.

Right now, I basically have no furniture. I have a bed, and a power-rack (and no idea where the power-rack is going to go). It's only a one-bedroom apartment, but oddly enough it has *two* bathrooms (only one with bath/shower), which is going to be awesome to have a bathroom reserved for people visiting.

I really want my apartment to be a place that feels welcoming and inviting to people. My only real ""requirement"" is at some point, getting a couch and a TV, so after getting home, I can just fall into a comfy couch and place some video-games, which it feels like it's been *years* since I've been able to do that.

But like... what sort of things make a place feel ""welcoming""?

My friend's already made comments like ""you can put the weight rack *anywhere*, the place is going to be a bachelor pad"", and I just thought... I don't *want* my place to feel like a ""bachelor pad"". It's one of the reasons I'm thinking about trying to fit the power rack in my bedroom, so that the main ""living room"" area feels a little more mature and put-together (I *just* bought the thing this year, and got an amazing deal on everything, so I'm extremely hesitant to get rid of it).

The other thing is... considering my furniture budget is -- at *best* -- ""minimal"", what advice might you guys offer on that point? For example, is it better to just piecemeal used furniture together as you go along? Or is it better to take your time, and get furniture you *actually* like, one piece at a time, even if it takes a bit longer?

And what things are worth getting new, versus just finding used? My mom says she feels strongly that a couch (or anything with a cushion/mattress) should be brand-new, but to go used on anything like tables and chairs, stuff like that. Is that something you guys would agree with?

Oh, and I suppose I'll just throw one more question in here. A number of people have already (I think jokingly) asked when I'm going to throw a house-warming party. I feel like it would be kind of a sad event, though, if the apartment is *literally* empty, save for my bed and weight rack. Should I wait to have a housewarming party until I at least have some basics, like a table and chairs? Or *anything* to do? (I don't even have a TV, all I have is a laptop, so it would be hard to even listen to music or anything).",25Aug2019,1

However, I want to stay there is this sweet little girl who puts a smile on my face every time I see her, she enjoy coming to my class every time which makes my day.

But all the negative stuff that I think this company tact on is brutal, it's almost what I would dare say would be considered exploitative. I wouldn't be so upset if I had maybe 1.5hr or 2 hr long break give me adequate time to relax and maybe give me sometime to get something to eat. And maybe do instead of 3 classes doing 2. But I know deep down thats wishful thinking.

I should also note, I did the math, every hour i'm there I'm getting paid $9.30 which is almost as much as a Wal-mart worker.

I was so happy. but fact I didn't continue it is too hard and I don't like classical song. I prefer play the song I know and interesting that are hits song in youtube. my parent also worry I gone crazy afterward and mental cracked gone insane if pressured too much.

The pressure is intense when I taking guitar class. As it is not my own money who pay the class.  I stress until cannot concentrate because I am good kid. I feel tremendous pressure if I don't done well in class I think going to disappoint my parent bring shame to them. But my parent says its ok we don't pressure u much if it is difficult just stop attend class. past few years I go book store and purchase modern guitar fingerstyle book. I enjoy very much. I loved it when I try to play it, I feel meaningful and having fun. I believe listener also having fun too when listen to u play. I wanna post at youtube but I scare insult and flame. I scare shamed myself if the playing not good. People would say ""omg fat ass try play guitar lol"" or"" look at this pig, he try play guitar"" or ""fuck,  he is an idiot"" or ""he is a clown""

when I think my life I just wanna gone insane and feel stressful. local town ppl don't want hire me to work. it because the past my body weak I keep quit a job they accepted. they think I am lazy incapable function like normal human being.

talk back to reason why I learn guitar. it is because a girl I miss so much from the past highschool. but now I get over it already and move on. she now grown fat already.i feel she casted spell on me make me dream of her. but I really dream of her a lot of time during sleep. but nvm last last she said I am idiot. broke my heart. I cried because I put so much effort on the song I played just for her. I feel like total idiot. I know it is time to move on. but the annoying dream keep bugging me and keep dream of her. how should I forget her by then. I am so stupid.

563,"Hello. For seven years, I had a friend over the Internet that I used to talk to a lot. We met first as Roleplayers but then we grew closer as we started talking more, although we did continue to roleplay for the years we kept contact. I was so involved in this friend and the roleplay that I would go out of my way at times to connect with them, even skipping classes or cancelling some plans. I know it sounds stupid now, but at the time, I just preferred to talk to them than to live my real life.

However, at the beginning of the year, they stopped replying to me and I started getting worried. They had dealt with suicidal thoughts before and I was afraid that something had happened. I messaged them everyday tho I was careful to never spam. They finally reply to me after a week, telling me that they are annoyed by my messages, that they are busy and are trying to balance lots of things out and that I am probably only messaging them because I want to keep roleplaying, which wasn't true. This was a sudden change in their attitude and I tried my best to explain myself by telling them about the time they had to be put under psychiatric care and how worried I had been during that time and tried to do everything to contact them. The mention of this upset them and understandably so. They told me I was being toxic and manipulative, and although I understand why they would think that, those weren't my intentions. Before I could explain myself, they blocked me everywhere.

Since then I have been trying my best to get over it, after all, it's just a long distance friend, we never even met in real life. Yet the fact that I couldn't explain myself or give any closure to the situation is eating me from the inside out. I have been having recurring dreams in which I get to talk to them and explain myself. I frequently wonder how are they doing and can't stop myself from reminiscing on good memories from our interactions. It's causing me a lot of anguish and I just want to get over it yet I don't know how. We talked for 7 years and they were a huge part of my life and the sudden block shocked me so much that I wasn't even able to react properly.

I just wanna forget about it and close that chapter for good but I can't seem to do it. I have tried to distract myself and look for other people to talk to and I still can't get over it. What do I do?",25Aug2019,5
564,"Well, I just posted that I'm getting my own apartment soon (yay!), and one of the things I'm considering is whether or not I'm going to keep my weight rack or not (boo!).

I *hate* the idea of selling it, because I got an *insanely* good deal on everything (it's a power rack, olympic barbell, and 300 lbs of plates). However, something I would be a *lot* more open to, is giving it away to my friends, who have a bunch of kids, including two boys in the 10-13 age range.

The older boy... for some reason, I've always kind of related to. He's overweight, his mother doesn't really push him to do anything, but he's a really good kid (annoying, maybe, but a good kid all the same). I remember *my* teenage years, and... yeah, it can be *really* rough when you're overweight. For me, it was a vicious, downward spiral, where you feel insecure, that makes it harder to talk to girls, which makes you less successful when you *do* try, which lead to emotional eating, which lead to *more* insecurity...

As such, I've always kind of made subtle suggestions to their boys to do things that were healthy. They love video games, so I told them that if either of them can to 10 pull-ups, I'd buy them a game, stuff like that. The dad said he *tries* to get them to be active, but he feels like his wife undermines him, and lets them get out of doing anything as soon as they start to complain.

Alright... I know that was long-winded, but I wanted to provide a bit of context.

So part of me is thinking about calling the dad up, and saying ""Hey man, I have a brand-new, *really* nice set of weights and stuff. I'd be more than happy to give this to you guys, if you're willing to push your sons into using the stuff.""

Would that, like... be overstepping? I consider them friends, but we're definitely not like *close* friends. I see them probably three or four times a year, though the husband has been *incredibly* helpful any time I've ever need help (which is why I'm *not* asking him to help me move; I don't want him to think I only reach out when I need help).

I dunno. What do you guys think?",25Aug2019,1
565,"Hey guys, first time poster here. 

I started my job two years ago, and I loved it. Due to a company takeover, things have gotten overwhelming and over complicated. We started mandatory overtime almost a year ago and we are just now starting to see our work paying off with the exception of new management.

Our new supervisor, I feel, relies too heavily on me. I was forced into a position a couple months ago where I should have gotten a raise, but didn't, and the position required me to have a computer, which was not provided to me until AFTER I was able to step down due to a family member falling fatally ill.

I have recently been forced into another position that I did not want for multiple reasons: chaos, the stress of already working six days a week for almost a year, and a preexisting problem with my lower back. The new supervisor refused to listen, and had me put there anyways. Low and behold, I experienced pain in my lower back which is slowing me down in the new position. The team lead came to me after catching wind of this and knowing that the supervisor didn't care, kindly offered to speak with him. The only answer I got was ""we need a doctor's note."" 

Now I know this is a bit winded, but here is the short and skinny of it: the new supervisor does not ask anyone else. If anything happens, if he needs anything done, he dumps it on me and thusly slows down our production even though my team and I have been top producers of accurate and good quality work that we do with great pride. 

Since exacerbating the previous back problem, I had a hard time getting out of bed, called into work, finally was able to make my way to the walk-in so that I could receive my doctor's note, and WSIB was notified; I'm assuming just in case I have to take time off even though I plan to return immediately. 

My new supervisor has always been known for being a bully, and I know if I hand in the doctor's note along with my two weeks notice, he's going to make my life hell for those two weeks. I don't want to leave my job. I love working with machines and I love producing quality product. There's not one person in my life that I can turn to for advice as I am always met with no sympathy and almost always anger. My mental health is plummeting, and I now take pills to help manage my emotions even though I've never had to before. I would not have hurt my back again had I been listened to  and it seems as though if you're bad at your job, you not only get to keep it, but you get to stay where you are.

So my question is this:

If I hand in my doctor's note along with my two weeks notice, can they keep me in the job that caused my pain, and can they fire me? (Yes I can be accommodated but the supervisor is a petty bully).

Thank you for reading.",25Aug2019,1
566,"Longish story, me and two other girls (I‚Äôll call them A and B) worked together for 18 months and were very close friends. Very active group chat, plans outside work etc. 

B got a new job about 5 months ago and we all kept in touch but we‚Äôve only seen her once since she left when the 3 of us went for dinner as she dropped out of any other plans we made either as a trio or as a larger group of friends, but always had an excuse and always kept in touch on messages. 

We had plans to go to A‚Äôs house yesterday (Saturday) and we discussed with B earlier in the week what we‚Äôd do with the day and how we‚Äôd get there/back etc (A lives around a 45 min drive away from the town me and B live in). I also checked that the 3 of us were definitely still good for it as my dad had invited me to a small housewarming party (he‚Äôs finally got a new house after divorcing my mom) and A‚Äôs boyfriend was away so she‚Äôd need to make other plans as she gets really anxious being on her own and it was all confirmed. 

Friday night, we popped up in the group chat and got nothing back. I‚Äôd seen on Instagram that B was out with friends but she was on WhatsApp throughout the night but never opened our messages. We didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd just bail without a word especially as she knew I‚Äôd have missed my dad‚Äôs housewarming (it was on the Friday) and A would have a really rough weekend alone. Saturday morning comes round and nothing, we eventually had to cancel the day (I couldn‚Äôt just go anyway as a taxi back home would have cost way too much on my own) and we‚Äôve still not heard anything from her. We‚Äôve both text her separately checking she‚Äôs okay and again, she‚Äôs been on WhatsApp but not opened our messages. 

I don‚Äôt know if she straight up doesn‚Äôt wanna hang out with us any more but why make plans and confirm them literally days before? I think she might have known that she didn‚Äôt wanna come for whatever reason and bailing would piss us off because it fucked up both of our weekends, and doesn‚Äôt wanna deal with that. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know how to deal with the situation - if she doesn‚Äôt want to be friends with us any more then cool we can‚Äôt do a lot about it but we feel really shit about it as we just don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôve done.",25Aug2019,1

569,I‚Äôve been working for the state of Oregon for 11 years. The director of my department for meany years has been telling my coworkers to not converse with me or the people I converse with for over 6 years. I was with my son when he was sick in the hospital for 2 weeks right after my wife gave birth to my daughter which she became sick at 7 days old  so me and my wife had to take 2 weeks off.It brings me to tears when I remember what happened because I thought my son was going to die but thank God he recovered gracefully. Upon my return to work I was given a supreme guilt trip for not being at work and he also told me why didn‚Äôt my wife take care of it.  He doesn‚Äôt coach us when we do things wrong he goes Straight to punishment and has also told the other supervisors that he loves punishing his workers. But the most recent Doesn‚Äôt pertain to me but it boils my blood. So to start we had a survey at work to voice our concerns and opinions and a lot of us wrote about this behavior and voiced our concerns and allot of people said he is severely narcissistic my problem is i tried to explain everything without making it obvious who I was because it was confidential so I had to leave out allot of key points Because I was scared of retaliation. It seemed like he must‚Äôve gotten in trouble for it because he‚Äôs been nothing but nice in the recent couple months. But one of my coworkers slipped and fell and hit their head at work and was checked out by a nurse here and was confirmed that he was concussed I‚Äôm not sure how he found out but he found out that my coworker does judo on the weekends I‚Äôm sure he found out from social media But is now trying to get him in trouble and blaming something he does on his own time outside of work when it was proven the accident happened at work. so now I‚Äôm paranoid that he‚Äôs looking at everybody‚Äôs social media and using it as a tool for punishment because it sounds like something he would do. I hold him to such a high standard because of the position he‚Äôs in I can‚Äôt fathom why anybody would deem fit for him to run a whole department. But I have also sought medical help for stress medication and I had to see a Shrink to get it. Why would anybody hire somebody that treated people so poorly is there anything I could do because seriously I stress so much I‚Äôm starting to worry for my own health and my coworkers as well.

571,"I'm looking at a slight minor dilemma atm regarding time for the fall semester

At the moment I'm taking 18 hrs worth of classes (four 3 hr courses and one 6 hr course), am working part time (20 hrs) and am on the verge of starting up an internship with a political group that requires me to work at least 10 hrs a week.

I'm iffy on whether or not I should stick with that internship. It might be nice to have an extra internship on the resume, and it seems like my easiest shortcut towards getting politically involved in a way beyond voting... but I'll already be taking on a university required internship next semester that won't have the extra 18 hrs of classes piling on it. On top of that, I feel like the ""resume fodder"" thing would only be useful if I actually knew what it is I wanted to do after I get out of university ~~which I should probably figure out soon considering that I am going to graduate in May~~

If I knew of any benefits from sticking with that internship, I'd go for it...but since I see none, I'm leaning heavily towards dropping it",25Aug2019,2

We both live roughly an hour away and commuting isn‚Äôt a great idea. So they‚Äôve been tirelessly searching for apartments and applying everywhere they can.  They recently found a place that costs almost 2 thousand a month and decided that it would be a good pick since it‚Äôs right in front of campus. I‚Äôd be paying half of that, working 2 jobs and going to school full time. Which I don‚Äôt believe is fair considering it‚Äôs a one bedroom and there‚Äôs 2 of them and 1 of me. But they signed the lease and paid the down payment without even seeing the place inside. I‚Äôve talked it over with a few of my friends and SO and mother. They all agree I would be way better off crashing somewhere near campus a few nights during the week and commuting the rest. Also $950 dollars is a lot that I can be using for savings or even a new car. What I need advice on is how to tell them I don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt want to move out anymore.

573,"I vented to one of my co workers after one shift about one of the aides. I complained that she refused to do tasks I gave to her and gave an attitude.  When I came back to work that night my coworker told me she told my boss. My boss came to me and told me she went off on the rude co worker and demanded she apologize to me. I told my boss I was just upset that I felt she was being rude to me and I didn‚Äôt want any big issue out of it. I felt the tension between me and the reported aide all night. Later, the personnel who got reported came to me. She was very upset and she didn‚Äôt understand what she did wrong. We talked it out and I told her I felt she was being rude that night and not a team player. However, I realized I was wrong as well. For example, I wanted her to get a wheelchair downstairs and she said no. She has a phobia of elevators which I forgot about.  She apologized and so did I. Then she blamed another nurse who worked that night for reporting her. I didn‚Äôt want an innocent party to get mixed up in the drama. I told her I was responsible and I was sorry. I did not mention the other co worker who reported her. I badmouthed her and I am responsible. I know she holds grudges, and our work relationship won‚Äôt be the same. I texted my boss and told her it was a misunderstanding and I apologize for my actions. She never replied back. I also felt tension with the rest of the aides. For example, I went into a room and they acted busy and would not acknowledge me. I know the word about the situation spread. I am off for a few days, but now I am having  anxiety about returning to work. Before this I had a good repertoire with the aides. Now I am sure they all will mistrust me and think I will get them in trouble for any little misgiving. I am not the type of person who indulges in workplace drama or reporting people behind their backs. I regret what I did and I feel ashamed. How do I handle the tension moving forward?",25Aug2019,1
574,"Hi there,

I'm a senior at an Ivy League school and we are being encouraged to buy class rings. I am proud of my alma mater for a lot of reasons, but I'm from a working class background, so I'm especially proud to go here and my family is proud of me. The style I like (1cm across the face and silver) I can buy for a little over $100. I am able to afford it.

I like rings. I wear one or two every day. As a woman, wearing jewelry isn't as unusual and whatever I wear won't stand out as much. 

The thing is, I want to have something wearable. I don't want people to look at me and think, ""what a tool, wanting all of us to know that she's an Ivy League graduate."" I don't bring up where I go to school unless people ask, although I'll wear a hoodie or something with the school name on it sometimes.

My big question is: should I get a ring? I am proud of my school and sacrificed a lot for the degree I will be receiving, but I don't want to look pretentious. I would get a small and subtle design, but don't want that to be too much either.",25Aug2019,1
575,"I got run through the mill on AITA on this, so I get I'm in the wrong just to start off. Here is the situation.

I took a ""job""/ am doing a favor for a neighbor. Its early morning (which I already hate as u have medical issues) and being paid about 2$ an hour. I was told make myself and home, help myself to the beer, etc. 

I misconstrued, when beer was never there (dude kills his 12 packs daily) that having a couple cocktails would be okay. I kept some track, and know I didn't drink much from their bar, and intended to get them a nice bottle at the end of the  week. That was what I always did when these kind of situations happen, which was never asked of me I did it cuz I do these jobs for people I like (when I have taken them). 

He came at me like I stole, and is taking all my pay for a week, enough to buy two bottles.  We talked, he admitted it was a miscommunication (i think when he remembered what he said, he is perpetually drunk).  Now, i told him that's fair. We shook hands, he said no hard feelings and we can move on.

The problem is, i don't want to do favors for someone who is disproportionately punishing me (I feel) while taking advantage of my doing him a favor. So while he gave me a ""2nd"" chance, I feel like he is doing this because he knows its in his best interest. He will have to pay per day what he pays me per week to get lower quality work. 


Mind you, dude blamed his son for being the one mad, said a bunch of things like that, I don't really know wtf, but I get the vibe i cant trust him to speak truthfully either.

He is a neighbor. I want minimum fallout, and honestly been planning on quitting cuz of the early morning thing for a week. I was gonna give them 2 more weeks, but I just can't. I don't want to, and I have enough depression and anxiety enough.

I'm quitting today, so he has a few days to replace me. Any advice on how or what to text? 

I was thinking
""So and so, thank you for the opportunity but this job just hasnt been a good match. The early mornings are to hard on my health so I'll be discontinuing our arrangement immediately
 All the best""

Ps. We are square on the pay, if anyone is wondering. It is being taken for last weeks work, I never have people pay me in advance for work. But this isn't an official job, its a favor (IMO or its illegal, under minimum and no taxes) or I would feel very strongly about giving a 2 weeks. I get it, people have said it is a job, I'm unprofessional, and I get it. I'll do better. But not for these people, they have screwed other neighbors on similar bs. So how do I quit today?",25Aug2019,2

(17,F) My dad has been a pretty heavy alcoholic for a long long time, he had problems well before i was born, but he quit for a while once i was born, and didn‚Äôt drink for about 3 years. then he started to party again here and there, i have a lot of memories of him being belligerent when i was a little kid, but the good outweighs the bad back then. well when i was like 10 or 11 or something he moved away to work and separated from my mom and i never heard from him much for a while, i guess he was living in hotels and doing cocaine at the time. well some years go by and he never fully stopped drinking, he has always had a good smooth patch and then he‚Äôll always go straight back into drinking, it‚Äôs not like a couple times a week. it‚Äôs like everyday after work. he doesn‚Äôt go to the bar, he will just sit on the couch and pound back a 12 pack and just get s h i t f a c e d. he goes through girlfriends ( i don‚Äôt think he ever got over my mom, who left him because of his drinking) well my mom lives in a super small isolated place, and my dad lives in the city, so i decided i wanted to finish my high school years here, and i came here in grade 10, i ended up moving in with my aunt in grade 10 because of his drinking. tried to live with him again in grade 11, didn‚Äôt work and i was living with my aunt but me and my boyfriend have recently gotten a suite together. i do stay in my dads life and try to be there for him but i make it clear i do not want to be around him or hear from him that he‚Äôs drunk. well last summer he hit somebody while driving drunk, a person on the road, not even a car, and he drove away. and luckily an undercover cop saw it all happen and followed him and he was arrested. well my dad started to do a little better while he was going to a court, a lot better actually. i really thought he was gonna go to jail, well he got REALLY lucky (the person he hit did not die, regardless jt is absolutely horrible) but my dad did not go to jail for that. so i thought my dad was doing better, thought he had hit rock bottom. but no he is drinking heavily again. he had a dinner planned for a few days a couple weeks ago, so me and my boyfriend went to his house, and he was shit faced, he told me he hadn‚Äôt been drinking and he just had to have some tonight to relax, well we got into an argument obviously and i left. So yesterday we had plans to have brunch and i messaged him at 10Am, he then went on a rant about how i wasted his entire day waiting for me and basically just freaked out at me for not messaging him earlier in the day. So then later in the night he called me absolutely hammered demanding i take him out fr brunch and pay (I‚Äôm still in the process of moving in with my boyfriend and pretty broke) or that i just come to his house and make breakfast with him and saying other things and screaming at me over the phone. so i agreed i would come over this morning. 
Well it‚Äôs that morning and i texted him and told him i want to wait a few days before we hangout because he really upset me last night. but i feel really bad, like really bad for him. i want to be there for him more as his daughter, i have this hope that he might get better but i really have also lost most hope. so my question basically is should i try and be there for him more or am I setting the appropriate boundaries? would it just be better to cut him out all together. sorry i know this is a giant read so if you even bothered to stuck through thanks. i‚Äôll probably delete this after like an hour i just wanna see what a few people say.... it‚Äôs stressing me out a lot, sorry for any spelling or bad grammar, i‚Äôm flustered",25Aug2019,1

Lately I've been thinking of how to remedy my situation, and one way I've found is to get the people of my life (family and the few friends I have, maybe even aquainteces) to not care about me anymore, even if it makes them hate me, It'd help myself and themselves in the near future (as none of us would need to worry about the other)

This would also help in the sense that, if I were to do something that I believe would help how I feel (and they, now disagree with), they wouldn't feel betrayed or bad, like something fundamental changed",25Aug2019,1
581,"So about a week ago I matched with 'C' on Tinder. We messaged for a bit during those days and we eventually planned to meet up and hang out which was last night.

We went to a Mexican restaurant and I had a blast talking to her. She had just about every single interest I did: video games, recreations, same major, etc. During our hang out she informed me that she just moved to our college town and didn't know anyone so she was feeling extremely lonely being alone in a new city so she told me she was only looking for a friend; I didn't mind at all since she was so cool and having a new friend is something I needed 

At the end of the night I walked her to her car, she gave me a hug and told me she had a fun time and was happy to finally have her first friend in college.

This morning I noticed she had unmatched me or deleted her account. She took my phone number last night but I haven't heard anything from her.

I guess I'm just a little worried that maybe I did or said something weird last night. This isn't the first time this has happened where someone tells me I'm a nice person and that they want to see me again only for them to ghost me the next day. It makes me feel like there's something wrong with me that I can't identify. Has this happened to anyone else?",25Aug2019,1

I have been chatting to this person for about 5 months. I start conversations and we chat and she also starts them sometimes. I like her but I can‚Äôt tell if she likes me. Also the conversation just dries up and I don‚Äôt know what to talk about. So just some advice would be great.

Was it wrong of me to accept the ride? Can he get in big trouble for what he did if anyone where to find out? Should I accept any future rides if I happen to stumble upon him in the future? Was it unprofessional of him to even offer a ride to a student? Thanks y‚Äôall.",25Aug2019,1

At about 1 or so, max barked twice, (they sleep in the living room). Max is typically the most quiet one, in fact he only barks when someone is walking past the house and it goes on for longer then two barks and the others bark too, they‚Äôre usually the ones who start it and he goes after them, and they usually go outside when they hear someone walking by (they have a doggy door that leads to the back yard). Then at about 2:30 or so, he did it again. (By this time i was ether asleep or in limbo between asleep and awake but i had woken up when i heard the barking). Again it was only 1 or 2 barks and stopped. He did it again at 6 or so, i got up, checked almost all the rooms and went back to bed. At this time i‚Äôm not sure if i was in limbo again or asleep, but i had heard a voice. It was right next to me (in my left ear, my girlfriend was sleeping on the right side).

596,"Hi, ok I don‚Äôt even know where to start. Basically I need advice.¬†

I met my best (and only) friend about 9 years ago. We get on well, whatever it‚Äôs ok. The thing is all she does is complain about the same thing over and over again. How she has anxiety, how she‚Äôs failed exams multiple times, how she has symptoms of depression. Now atm you probably think I‚Äôm a bitch but let me explain.¬†

We left school 5 years ago, and since then we have texted EVERY SINGLE DAY. I have problems too, I don‚Äôt really branch out and make more friends because I know I have her but at the same time she isn‚Äôt a proper friend.¬†

I‚Äôm digressing, anyway when I say she complains about the same things everyday. I mean it!!!!!! For 5 years it‚Äôs ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so stressed I failed my exams‚Äô, I would say ‚Äòok retake them, you can do it‚Äô etc. If she says she‚Äôs showing symptoms of depression- I comfort her obviously, and suggest she goes to the doctors to try and find a therapist.¬†

But she doesn‚Äôt listen! She‚Äôll say ‚Äòno what‚Äôs the point taking the exams again, I‚Äôll just fail‚Äô, and ‚Äògoing to a therapist isn‚Äôt for me‚Äô. It‚Äôs the same cycle every week- her complaining about the SAME thing, me giving her all the options she has to fix her problems- and her ignoring my advice.¬†

And honestly over the past couple of years her ranting has been giving ME so much stress I can‚Äôt explain it. To this day she will complain about the exams she failed 5 years ago.¬†

And obviously everyone has problems, and you‚Äôre meant to tell ur friends for comfort, but the thing is whenever I have been rly sad and in a low mood, as she is my only friend, I obviously tell her. And when I do she‚Äôll literally read the message and be like ‚Äòok but at least you didn‚Äôt fail this exam like me‚Äô- she‚Äôll literally disregard any problem I have. This is how I basically know she isn‚Äôt a good friend.¬†

I feel so mean for even telling this to the internet. But the only way I can describe her is an ‚Äòenergy vampire‚Äô. I saw the term on twitter once and it reminded me of her.¬†

Basically what I‚Äôm asking is, what do I do?¬†

I don‚Äôt wanna say ‚Äòstop complaining to me‚Äô because I know she has no one else as well. Another thing that really scares me is that over the years I find myself becoming more like her. I never used to care about how I look (she complains about that too- she‚Äôs the type to call herself ugly but then still take a million selfies), I used to be such an optimistic person, but I see my thoughts going more and more negative over time. I‚Äôve also never told anyone this EVER so it feels good to rant lol.

What triggered me asking for help about this is this quote I saw on twitter lmao ""We should avoid people who are always complaining about things that they are not willing to change"". Just imagine someone complaining to you about the same thing for FIVE YEARS. EVERY SINGLE DAY. But, we've been friends for so long and she's my only friend so yeah.

Anyway, someone please help, idk what to do.¬†If you have any further questions before you wanna advise me, please ask!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- (pls read though for a better understanding)- but basically my best friend who I speak to (she texts me) EVERYDAY complains and has been complaining about the same things for 5 YEARS, in every conversation. I've given her advice etc, which she ignores. It honestly drains ME, and just looking at her texts stress me out. What do I do?",25Aug2019,1

600,"So for years, I have been doing art in my parent's basement or in the living room. They are generally better off than average so the tables I have been painting on aren't super cheap. About two years ago my art got moved into the basement onto a nicer table but one that they weren't using. I destroyed it with paint and everything else, because I was told don't worry about it. Then they started to renovate the basement and the table got taken away and I got moved upstairs. Part of using the expensive table is I had to always have garbage bags under my art. But accidents happen and I spilled some acrylic paint on the leather chair. Just a small bit.

 So then they really started cracking down on me. So yesterday after getting into a major argument with my dad about my art stuff, I got my own table. Well I just overhead them say, ""She never listens."" They had offered to lend me a folding table but those are not stable and the paint would stick to it if I spilled any, plus my mom uses it for her camper. I don't know what to do. I'm torn because im tired of the arguements but now they are pissed I got my own table to destroy?

I moved 2 years ago and have had difficulties with being social ever since.

They‚Äôre your typical 13 year olds: Instagram, music, group hangouts, very tightly connected (though they do let most new kids in their giant group). They‚Äôre very social and love attention.

603,"Okay so story time: 3 years ago I was best friends with Dani, Emily, and Ollie. Like best friends in the whole fucking world and we were all 17-20 around the time. We all ended meeting this girl Patience and everything was fine and dandy at first but me and her ended up getting really close and she was everything I wanted to be, she was confident, she smoked and drank, she had sex all the time and had no problem talking to people. All my friends and I were all little anime nerds that didn‚Äôt do any of that stuff and at the the time I was 17 and had never dated or kissed anyone before so I felt like shit naturally. 
Anyways Patience and I got close, I started drinking and smoking weed and I even got a girlfriend. Everything was cool but eventually I started treating Dani, Emily, and Ollie like shit and ditching them to hangout and drink with Patience and my girlfriend and letting Patience treat them like shit because they weren‚Äôt interested in alcohol or weed. She would also explicitly talk about her sex life around them which made everyone uncomfortable and I remember Ollie asked her to stop once time and she literally told him to fuck off and that she was going to do whatever she wanted. Really peachy person. 
Some other shit happened, and eventually Dani, Emily, and Ollie told Patience that they weren‚Äôt going to put up with that anymore and left the friends group and I just like kinda sided with Patience? Eventually I ended up living with this girl for a year, she tries to control me and turn me into a little version of herself. We only did shit she wanted to do, I couldn‚Äôt watch anime anymore or watch things I wanted to watch because that shit was labeled stupid and embarrassing to her. We ate frozen pizza 4 days a week, I‚Äôm pretty sure I didn‚Äôt eat a single vegetable for a whole fucking year, I literally dropped down to 100 lbs. It got to the point where when she was at work and I was home alone I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I didn‚Äôt know what I liked to do for fun anymore that wasn‚Äôt one of her interests. I had no fucking clue who I was. 
I just recently got out of that at the end of May, it ended with her trashing my room and posting a whole smear thread on twitter on how terrible of a person I was because I wouldn‚Äôt hang out with her every day and my boyfriend is dirty and stupid because he didn‚Äôt go to college. Since then I‚Äôve had some time to work on myself as a person, I feel a lot more human and myself again. I‚Äôm taking some time off school to get myself together before going back to be a vet assistant.
It‚Äôs been 3 years now since I‚Äôve talked to Dani, Emily, and Ollie and there isn‚Äôt a day that goes by that I feel like shit for the way I treated them and the way I fell under the allure of someone so fucked up. The last time I spoke to Dani was a few months after we had stopped talking and I had asked her if she wanted to sit down and have lunch with me so we could talk and she told me she wasn‚Äôt interested at all. I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot lately and I want to apologize to them  because I was genuinely a fucked up person and I don‚Äôt think I will ever have better friends than them for the rest of my life but at the same time time it‚Äôs been 3 years. We have all changed a lot and I don‚Äôt know if it would be right of me to reopen old wounds like that.  I saw them all together at a convention like  a little over a year ago and they avoided me like the plague. 
I just want to let them know that genuinely did not deserve the way I treated them and that I‚Äôm sorry for letting Patience control me like that. I was just young and desperate to feel like an adult.

When we were cleaning out our lockers for the end of the year, I found that some of my coffee from my bottle that I would drink in the morning and leave in my locker until the end of the day dripped onto the textbook and I never noticed. I freaked out and took it home with me instead of telling her because I was too scared to let her know at the time. I kept it at my house, dreading the beginning of this school year because I knew that I‚Äôd have to tell her once school started. It‚Äôs already been a week since the beginning of the school year and she still hasn‚Äôt mentioned it yet, but she probably will when the club starts up again soon. I also have her in class now so I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôll expose me to the rest of the junior class if I told her about the book, which scares me the most since I don‚Äôt usually mess up this badly and everyone knows it too. I really don‚Äôt want to wait until she realizes I never turned in my ruined textbook and figure out that I‚Äôve been hiding it for awhile. It feels really shitty to try to use an excuse, but I don‚Äôt want the way she sees me to change and it sounds so stupid of me to get coffee all over it.

She‚Äôs never in her classroom in the mornings and I feel sick at the idea of telling her in front of her advisory class in the afternoon.

626,"I made a post a few days ago about something that happened to me. 


You can read them on my profile for more detail. 


While I was walking home from work, dozens of people were working together to mess with me. They were clapping (while not visible), yelling from behind houses, doing repetitive and illogical actions (like wheeling a garbage bin in circles), flashing flashlights from bushes, and *everyone* was fake talking (making noises like ‚Äúbuh buh buh‚Äù in the tempo of real conversation).


I‚Äôm not crazy, it was actually happening. I still know what happened, but I don‚Äôt know why, and I‚Äôm on alert to be honest. There are a lot of residual things I‚Äôm noticing. The people around me might be in on it, or maybe in on something else, because they keep trying to ‚Äúpoison‚Äù me or expose me to different things to view my reactions. My coworkers are doing something similar, too. I think some of my coworkers were in on the street harassment, too. 


Everyone on the internet is basically all saying that I imagined all of this somehow. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs possible when it was actually happening with no indication that it wasn‚Äôt real.


A lot of people said I was being ‚Äúgangstalked‚Äù. I thought that could be a perfect explanation but reading about it on forums seems to be people trying to recruit each other into believing they‚Äôre being gangstalked. I‚Äôm still not ruling it out, because it describes what happened to me perfectly, but it seems fake.


I keep getting told to ‚Äúget help‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt know what that is. I don‚Äôt want to be held in a facility and be forced to take medicine. I don‚Äôt want to explain this happening and just be ruled out as delusional. To be honest, I don‚Äôt trust psych doctors anymore. I‚Äôm not aggressive, self harming, or irrational, either. 


What is ‚Äúhelp‚Äù? Who do I call and what do I say? Will anyone believe me or will everyone keep messing with me, lying, or ruling me out as insane? I know if I call the cops they will just think I‚Äôm crazy.",25Aug2019,3
627,"There are a few moving parts to this one - my relationship with my SO, my ""career"", my location and my remaining biological family. I'll try my best to pare it down.

Relationship: Married a long time, but she's become emotionally abusive to the point where I'm constantly walking on eggshells around her, waiting for the next insult or power play. We do nothing together in a typical week, and due to the location I'm essentially living alone (I go days without seeing another person). I feel shame over being in this position.

Location: Very beautiful but very isolated rural area. I love to hike and explore wild places, run, cycle - fitness and the natural world are important parts of my life, but at the moment it feels like it comes at a very high price.

Career: I left a decent career in a city when my wife wanted to take early retirement. We didn't save as much as I would have liked, and now we have the usual bills covered but not much more. The career move I tried was artistic rather than math-based, and I've enjoyed it but I see now that it doesn't fulfill me. What I do now should be a hobby, and I am sick of being broke when I'm perfectly capable of earning a good living, albeit in a city.

Family/friends: I left them behind in my home country several years ago to be with my SO. At the time we were visiting at least every 2 years, but now my wife has no interest in doing that, and of course she controls most of the finances. We had talked of moving to a rural area back home one day, but when a golden opportunity arose she shut that down pretty quickly.

Location (country): Because I moved here with my SO, I feel even more alone when she's abusive. The person who was my guide is now the one I have to be wary of, so I guess it's natural to want to go 'home'. I miss my culture, and the places I used to visit as a kid and as a young man.

The crossroads: Decent work would be at least an hour or more commute in summer (and dangerous in winter). Even if I had a better job, I'd still be in this almost unbearable situation with my SO. I'd be able to do more on my own, but I don't want to be utterly alone in a relationship. I can't live like this. It isn't a problem I can just throw money at. My current idea is to just go back to my own country after finding a job and start again, where I'm not so isolated and vulnerable. I'd get to see the people I left behind, enjoy my homeland, have a decent career again. Of course I'd be leaving my SO, but I can't see the person I loved when I'm with her. I would miss the mountains terribly. I know that. There are mountains in my home country, but probably a 2-3 hour drive away rather than 10-20 minutes. I'd be rolling the dice essentially. I could be in a new life in 4-6 weeks. Boom. Will I come out ahead? Will the positives outweigh the negatives?",25Aug2019,1

I'm also scared of doing ""wrong"" decisions over and over. I just cannot trust myself making decisions that affect my future positively.",25Aug2019,1
629,"I have been kicked out by my abusive parents shortly after I became 18 and ended up on the streets for a considerable amount of time until I was miraculously offered a job and a place to stay. I made a post about the situation a while ago and here is the link for more details:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cjx0tz/im\_struggling\_with\_keeping\_it\_together\_because\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cjx0tz/im_struggling_with_keeping_it_together_because_of/) 

(I know, the sad and tipsy me didn't post it in the best place for such a thing, but oh well.)

I still have to work at this current place for a bit over a year (agreed to work there for at least 2 years, long story). I started saving, but since minimum wage in my country isn't much and I make just a bit over it, I haven't saved that much, but I want to continue saving. Anyway, after I am done with this place I want to move on to better things, but for that I need to save much more to give me a headstart.

I could easily get into an uni, but I'd have to move to a different town and while tuition is either cheap or free here, I'd have to fork over a lot of money for accomodation and living costs. I'd obviously get a job, but I need a considerable headstart because moves like this kind of require an initial investment here because of various reasons. So, some advice in this direction would mean a lot.

And as for the other side, I could use a lot of advice on the emotional side as well. The period of time that I talked about in the post linked above meant a lot of trauma and the complete loneliness that came after and persists until now is not easy to bear. So, if you could tell me what to do to find someone (other than my coworkers, which are mostly older and I barely interact with them outside of work) that I could talk to and who I could do...pretty much anything with, because for 2 years I have had literally 0 social life.

43  F   5‚Äù8   204lbs  Caucasian 

Meds: Vicodin, muscle relaxers, Motrin, aleve 

Issue: extreme pain in hip and leg, could be sciatica

Duration: 3 weeks

Other medical issues: high blood pressure 

My mother has been having extreme pain for the past 3 weeks she has a hard time sleeping she can‚Äôt walk for very long and she says the pain is worse than childbirth. The pain is in her hip and she said something about sciatica. Her hip went out and this pain first started happening from her sneezing. She went to the doctor and had extremely high blood pressure .
She has a pretty unhealthy lifestyle she doesn‚Äôt eat very healthy stuff, is an alcohol, sleeps on the couch every night, smokes, and doesn‚Äôt do a lot exercise without complaining of pain in her hip. She has gone to physical therapy, the chiropractor, takes ibuprofen, and also drinks and smokes pot to treat her symptoms. This isn‚Äôt working so now she has gone to the doctor and was prescribed Vicodin and muscle relaxers. 
I‚Äôm worried about her going on highly addictive pain relievers because she has a very addictive personality (is an alcoholic and smokes) I don‚Äôt remember a single week that she has gone without alcohol and she always drinks until she plastered. I really don‚Äôt want prescription pain relievers added to this but she claims she won‚Äôt get addicted.

Lily: ex friend

John: boyfriend

Lily  was coming onto John and he said no. That had been happening for months  when I wasn't with them and he still went to visit her. Lily's an  alcoholic and John wouldn't buy her vodka so she started attacking him  and saying he was lifting up her top and squeezing her breasts and  nipples while she was passing out, yet she couldn't remember attacking  him afterwards, which I have physical evidence of.

A  few days later lily threatens to tell johns very ill parents that he's  dealing drugs and that he assulted her unless he calls her so he calls  and her friend gets aggressive towards him and me. She says she wants to  give us a letter so he goes to pick it up. When he gets there she  alledgedly jumps on his lap in the car with no underwear on and tries to  kiss him. The letter is just a suicide note that blames us and makes me  feel guilty.

A few weeks ago lily  calls the police saying john made a reddit to message her and tell her  to kill herself so he got a piece of paper telling him what happened to  to stop doing it, if he was doing it. John wasn't messaging her. We had  to call the police the night it happened cause she threatened to come to  my house with her friends and attack john.

This all started on the 4th of July this year.

Lily  has been a very triggering person to be around cause she's smaller than  me and mentally worse than me and it's like a sick competition in my  own head yet i miss her and can't just message her because of this rift.

I  can't trust either cause i have questions. Did he assault her? Were  they sleeping together? Did she attack him out of self defence or not?

649,"I posted about asking for help about them botha couple of day ago but the same background applies for this post as well, but it‚Äôs more about her best friend (45/f)

I‚Äôm 27m she‚Äôs 41f. She dumped me, we had been in a relationship for 4years ( her first long term, second was 6 months) we left on good terms but then I kept talking, didn‚Äôt give her space. She became angry. ( she did just copy paste a generic text twice hence my frustration). But then she became business like (just about things, like her post or taxes) or short responses. Then I went NC, for three weeks, broke it by sending a link to some lotion. And saying this might be handy for [horses name]. She didn‚Äôt reply, so I‚Äôm back in NC. She‚Äôs posting on FB that her life is going well, that she‚Äôs overcoming her issues or things to that effect. Liking post and publicly talking to another guy. I‚Äôm sure she isn‚Äôt doing as well as she makes out/trying to make me jealous. (Not wishing that on her). 

Her best friend 45/f (friendship around 5-6 years?)(who lives next door), who seems pushing this as well/ looks to be doing the same, posting photos of either just her or both of them having fun. I get the sense she‚Äôs being an echo chamber, yes man, pushing her to move on. 

What I‚Äôve noticed and had been aware/sense of was that I was in a love triangle. Her best friend has always had a soft spot I say in love with my ex (my ex told me about it her bff being bi possibly lesbian, along with why my ex couldn‚Äôt date her, as she is high maintenance/drama and being unreliable/flakey). The friend Didn‚Äôt really date anyone. So when we moved up to be near her best friend. She could have more of a physical presence, especially living next door. Usually if there was an issue between me and me ex, we would talk about it (or she‚Äôd chat to my mum, who was neutral on things, didn‚Äôt try to convince her to do things but just a person to listen) and move on, but I‚Äôm sure that this time around when I was 600miles away, her best friend would of ‚Äúcomforted‚Äù her but would of see her chance to move in. said you can do better, and rather than trying to help us, she went and said things and planted negative stuff. (Like id hit her if she broke up in person instead of over the phone, bear in mind we‚Äôve only had 2-3 augments over 4 years and we just talk it out. It was quite hurtful that she thought that) . 


TL:DR
I‚Äôm sure My Ex‚Äôs best friend helped break us up and is trying to fill my place and make me jealous by posting photos of just my ex or both of them doing things on (FB feed is just about my ex, nothing else) And that it‚Äôs some sort of Rebound relationship? My ex probably thinks of her as a friend but I‚Äôm sure her friend wants more than friendship/to replace me.

656,"Hey. Here's my situation: 

I have a Bachelor's degree in philosophy. I'm from Oregon originally. I recently took a road trip with some friends at the end of which I spent about six months living in a commune in northern California, from which I went to Oakland and worked on a demolition job; then I ended up in Santa Rosa working at a farm. I made about 600/mo plus room and board at this place. I bought a car after about four months.

Then I spent a month away and was requested back (I said yes) and have been caretaking this farm property for about a month with my former coworkers while the boss vacationed in Europe with his family. 

Now the boss is back, and he's basically left it up to me to continue working here. I really like the place and all, but honestly, it feels like a situation I'd burn out in if I worked too long here. However, I really need the income - have my car, and have about 160 dollars saved up. 

My options are:

1. Just hit the road and continue this bizarre trip
2. Return to my family and find a normal job, live under my father's roof and pay off my student loans (altogether, about ten grand); and then make my way into the city life (I'm from a small-ish Oregon town on the freeway)
3. Go to another internship type situation - at least one being a Buddhist retreat center down in Berkeley that would offer me 250/month....

I am hoping that I can be less indigent on my student loans, and have a decent income sometime soonish‚Ä¶. Sometimes, I hope for that. On the other hand, part of me wants to continue road-ratting it and just get better at saving money and hold onto it, especially because that would allow me to travel. The only problem being that I could pretty much only travel to other states and to Canada, which is alright, except that I also have academic goals.

See, whenever I try to think about this stuff I always come down to advice. Is there a better way to make life decisions than to just say, ""follow your heart,"" and so on, i.e. can somebody here give me some helpful hints on how to make this decision so that I can walk into something that I want to be walking into?

After I moved I came across a sub reddit which allows you to post photos of 'girls you know'. It also had a link to a discord chatroom where you could share images. To my deep shame I shared some images of my friend. I thought she will never know so there's no harm done.

All of the images were publicly available, taken from her Instagram. None of the images were intimate or anything like that. I also never gave any information people could identify her with.

Some people contacted me and made sexually explicit comments about her. Some of the comments were very degrading, sexually violent and misogynistic. I went along with this and I even joined in. It was just a fantasy to me. I never would have mistreated her nor do I *actually* want to.

Eventually the guilt caught up with me and I put a stop to it all. 

After this happened my friend got back in touch and we've become a lot closer. I wish we hadn't but I didn't know how to stop it. I've also been helping her through some stuff. Nothing too serious, but she wanted my help and I wanted to be there for her.

This puts me in a difficult situation. I don't want to let her down but I feel like a fraud and like every day I keep my secret from her I am actively abusing her. As I see it I have three options:

1. Don't tell her and carry on being the best friend I can be. 

2. Break off the friendship by just not being there for her as much until she takes the hint. She has other friends and I'm not her best friend or anything, it would upset her but it wouldn't crush her or anything like that.

3. Confess. Ask her to forgive if she wants to, respect her decision. I doubt she would forgive me but I think she may have a right to know. 

I just want to do the right thing by her. Advice appreciated

Tl;dr I shared (non-intimate) photos of a female friend online and made disgusting sexual comments about her.  I feel ashamed and want to do the right thing. Do I keep it secret, end the friendship or tell her.",25Aug2019,0
658,"In college, my ex and I dated for 1 year and 1 month (although it felt closer to 2 years). I was a senior, he was a junior. We were both each other's first relationships and first loves. We loved each other early on in the relationship, but we fought a lot, and broke up like 6 times (for like 5 hours each time). He initiated most of the ""break ups."" So, after our ""real"" break up in November 2017, I was devastated. It was a pretty messy break-up. He said it was because he didn't feel in love with me anymore and he wasn't happy. 

I texted him after 3 months of no contact, and we started talking pretty regularly again. It was as if we never broke up. Once summer came and we got closer, I confessed that I thought I still loved him. He said he didn't want me to put my life on hold for him. A couple weeks later he said he wasn't ""ready"" to be friends at that point, but maybe in the future. 

I initiated contact once again last October to wish him a happy birthday, and from then on we continued to talk and met up in January to spend the day together in the city. We got food, drinks, shared an ice cream sundae, and he hugged me when we parted ways. I asked him how he felt about seeing each other for the first time in a while, and he said it felt a little weird. This was also the time when he met his now girlfriend (on Tinder). 

In March I honestly started going a little ""crazy."" I told him I still loved him, that I changed, and that I would do anything to be with him. He completely wrote me off and basically said theres too much distance between us (we live 3.5 hours apart), and he wants to focus on his new girlfriend. He basically wanted to cut ties with me after I told him that, but I begged him not to. In April I went a little crazier and drove to his city (twice) in order to get closure. The first time he said he didn't have time to talk, so I just drove home. The second time I didn't get a response from him for a while and I was basically having a mental breakdown, so I told him I would kill myself if he didn't come talk to me. Which is really shitty to do, I know, and I apologized profusely for it. We had a short conversation, he told me that was the last time we would ever talk again, and he hugged me closely and left. 

Since then I couldn't help myself but to reach out, and he's ignored most of my texts. A couple weeks ago I told him that I hope we never cross paths again. A week ago I said that I never loved him (which wasn't true). I sent him a few more texts this past week and he said he didn't see the point of still talking. 2 days ago, I told him that I was going to completely cut contact and never talk to him again, not even in 10 years. He responded with a long text (he seemed a little mad) and said that it's healthier that we don't talk. I apologized for the drama I caused in his life, and retracted the statement about not loving him. I told him that I would always care for him, and I wished him well. Lastly, I asked him to just tell that we were never getting back together so I wouldn't hold on to false hope. He said ""no, we're not going to get back together"" and he said that he feels terrible that things went the way they did, and he wished the best for me moving forward. 

Is there any hope for us ever getting back together in the future? I know he denied that, but can things change between us?",25Aug2019,1
659,"Hi,
So I am a college student and last year I met this guy who lived in my building. We became best friends , but it was more than friendship. We spent 24/7 together. I basically lived at his dorm with him, even though I had my own. Since the first day we hung out, we were doing sexual things together. However, he claims to be ‚Äústraight.‚Äù I believe he is bisexual but prefers women. 
Anyways , he left college for 2 semesters and we stopped talking. Right after leaving campus, he got a girlfriend. Now ‚Äî a year later ‚Äî he has moved back and his girlfriend came with him! 
This is a nightmare for me. I was sooo obsessed with this guy - he was my best friend and my best sexual partner for months. I thought I was in love with him at the time but now realize it was just infatuation. When he left, I was extremely depressed. I‚Äôm over it now , other than nostalgia for what we used to have. The thing is , I am terrified of running into him. I saw him (and his GF) earlier but he didn‚Äôt see me, and I went the other direction to avoid him. But what should I do when I run into him?? Smile and wave? Pretend like he doesn‚Äôt exist? It will be sooo awkward and traumatizing. I am a very shy / awkward person naturally, so situations like this are very difficult for me. I feel like I will be really sad when he finds out I‚Äôm still here and doesn‚Äôt want to be my friend, but I guess I can‚Äôt really expect him to. (Because his girlfriend AND he‚Äôs closeted, she doesn‚Äôt know that he‚Äôs messed with guys. )",25Aug2019,2

661,"There was a post tittle like this before. I am the girlfriend and I do not like that my boyfriend smoke weed, because all the weed smokers I know, are not the smartest or success persons ever in life and its because the weed makes you feel OK in any situation you are. Also, my family is pretty conservative and my dad from the army, I was raised in the house with rules and high morality, where of course drugs were totally forbidden. We had a long distance relationship and my boyfriend hide this specific detail from me. I just discover it when I came to visit him to Europe (I am from South america and met him in Europe because of business trips I made here) and we were in an electronic party with his friends and saw him buying, I run away from the party and he went behind me and told me that he was hiding that from me because I would never give him the chance to meet me. Also he revel me that while in high school or after it, he was a dealer because his best friend (super best friend right? and still he is) introduce him to that. That was a short period but back then I think he smoked everyday because he lost his father so he might not have a bone pain but a heart yes. Then he reduced the consumption that was he told me and study and work. He had a technical degree and was doing a bachelor but drop it off, because he failed one semester. The thing is when we decide to live together this was the big topic. I agreed he smoke 4 times per year if smoking was so important to him and was just recreational (I still do not get why people could depend on something outside their body to control or relax themselves. Your control your brain, not your brain you.  But when I arrive to his place, he and his best friend had some weed plants hidden in the roommate room. Then when we decided to definetely live together that was in the kitchen and I notice it. I went out of the house and went to other country and cried a lot, meditate in front of the beach asking God why should I love someone that in the first place lie to me (because he hide the weed consumption from me) and after we agreed and I be flexible in letting him smoke 4 or 5 times per year like in his vacations or in parties I do not know, but in a working week not, he broke my trust and had that plant in his kitchen. He told me he was going to throurgh it away, that was also from his roomate, they wanted to take the first harvest and then trash it, and that is what He did. But the months pass and then I notice he started to come with red eyes from ""university"" because he signed up again at nights and work in the morning. That night I discover he was not at university and lied to me. The next day I went to his parents house to stay for somedays because they offer me if we have any problem anytime I could stay with them. He went there to tell me that he didnt know why I make such a drama if he just wanted to smoke and do not go to university, and he lied to me because I cried or be mad when he smokes. Then I realize he was smoking like twice or more per week. He told me it was not always. I told him I do not want to go further and think about a family with someone that thinks that weed must be in his life, definitely the father of my children will not tell them smoke week is possible in my house. He told me i was crazy, he wont ever allow their children to smoke or let them see him. (Would you believe him? did your parents smoke? need advice here too). Well now after 2 years and a half of relationship, I do not ask more about weed, only when it is super obvious and then I am just serious. Every single time he go to even a walk with this best friend, he smoke for sure.  Ans is this best friend who tells him, that I want to change him, that weed is his liberty. Also, i believe everytime he sees our old roommate, which is a close friend too. Actually, it might be that if we go to live in my country, with my normal friends and environment, he might forget the necessity of weed? What do you think? Is it their friends? that I do not think are bad persons. just maybe a little but dumb. And maybe my boyfriend as the lost he had when he was young, rely on his friends a lot. I really put my straight thoughts, sometimes I try to be diplomatic, I think here it might be a lot of smoking people but please do not take it personal is just exactly what I think, based on my personal experience. thank you!",25Aug2019,1

That person screams in the restaurant saying:‚ÄùWhy are you walking on my hand?? Are you blind? Cause of you I fell down!‚Äù. This made me mad so I said in a hard tone (I admit I screamed back): ‚ÄúHow the fuck could I know you were falling and this isn‚Äôt my fault, it‚Äôs your damn pants.‚Äù Cause she had really long pants on which covered her foot.

680,"Little back story: I graduated college last year and have been working for a small company for the past 18 months.  I can't help but feeling bored and anxious with my daily life, as well as my future.  I constantly get the feeling of wanting to work on something, to build something, create something (i.e. a company/business) yet I just don't know where to put that energy.

I've gotten terribly bored with day to day life of waking up, going to work, coming home, and repeating day after day so I decided to apply to graduate school and I got accepted.  I enrolled but I have until the 11th of Sept. (about 2 weeks from writing this) to withdraw from all classes with a 100% refund.  I'm not sure if I should go through with graduate school considering it's $37,000 dollars and I think I only want to go because of this boredom. 

I've saved up a lot of money over the years from being frugal and just generally money conscious so I wouldn't have to take out a loan to go, yet I would have to tap into my savings to fund it.

My biggest dilemmas:

1. Eventually I'd like to move out and buy a home but probably not for another year or two and if I go to grad school that's going to take out 37k of about \~150k, a decent chunk of change.
2. Deciding on whether I should go back to grad school or take some of that money and start a business.
3. Debating on taking some time off and just traveling to a few countries and seeing the world and hoping that will cure this lackluster feeling.

Regardless of if I go back to school/start a business I'm going to continue to work full time to help pay for these things.

I'm very much stuck and not sure what to do, if anyone has some feedback from personal experiences, I'd greatly appreciate hearing them.",25Aug2019,1

689,"I'm a high school junior and I'm taking AP Calc AB this year. I had been in Honors Algebra 2 the year before. During that year, I was behind pretty much everyone. I fell depressed for 90% of the year and would typically get 30 min - 3 hours of sleep each night and ate very little. I occasionally made myself puke as punishment and hated myself. I never studied or had any motivated to do any work. As a result, I was also incredibly stressed from all of my classes, etc. In Alg2 I got a high C first semester (This was the first C i had ever gotten in my life, which plummeted me to feel even worse about myself) and should have earned a C second semester as well, but my teacher rounded me to a B. My test averages were like Cs and Ds, occasionally Bs and rarely an A. I probably got an A on 3 tests total out of the whole year, those of which were very low A's. This year school started about 3-4 weeks ago and already I am struggling and everything that everyone else finds easy, I see as completely new material and stuff I've never known. My genuine level of mathematical understanding is basically stuck at high school geometry, mixed with a TINY bit of what I learned in algebra 2. Additionally, there is an accuplacer test that I had to take to see if I could get college credit for AP calculus (if i passed, all I had to do was pass the class and get college credit for the course), but of course, despite studying and reviewing the material and doing practice tests, I failed the accuplacer and now I have to magically pass in next weekend or have to get a 4 or 5 on the AP exam, which, trust me, is not going to happen, especially at this rate. I have done fine in my other AP and honors classes, including math before last year (geometry), but I feel like I have 100% screwed myself over. I was planning on going to med school, but now I think I am too far behind to accomplish such. I can barely complete my math homework each day because I am so confused from every single newly introduced concept. Asking others hasn't helped me much-- I remain fully confused and lost. Even if I understand one problem, I cannot figure out any others. I try watching youtube videos on the topics but, again, I fail to understand.

692,"Hi. As you can tell from the title, I‚Äôm fast approaching a pivotal point of my life, where I should be prepared for at least a sliver of the future. But the thing is, I‚Äôm not.

Since early this year, I‚Äôve lost my motivation to do anything drastically. I used to be very physically active, running and weight lifting every week. I was also diligent with my schoolwork, even though my results were mediocre. More on that soon.

But since the summer began, I started exercising less and less, to the point of completely skipping out any physical activity in favor of binge eating, which is my new activity now. All my typical summer work also, which is mostly from AP classes, I haven‚Äôt started yet whatsoever. School is in 3 days.

I feel ashamed of myself. I thought I was really changing for the better a few months ago, because, truth be told, my current situation is not new. This happened last year, while the year before that I was actually even more physically active and hardworking in school/life in general than I could ever imagine.

Now, everything‚Äôs just fallen apart again.

I haven‚Äôt been groped, or anything like that, but as someone who has been sexually assaulted, I get severely uncomfortable when people touch me, especially if they touch me from behind and I have no way of knowing. It puts me in a really bad state of mind and makes it hard for me to feel safe and happy.

698,"Sorry, this will be long  

So my mum has always been supportive of almost anything I do. She does her best for me and my sister no matter what. Recently we've been having money problems. She's in a job that doesn't pay a lot, but has just received an offer for a much higher salary which would ensure financial stability for the three of us (Me, my sister, and my mother). The issue is we own dogs and cats and this job would mean she's away four days a week. 

I've been at uni for the past three years and have just graduated. I recently applied for (and got accepted into) my dream course at my dream uni in Scotland. We live in England. If I go to Scotland for the Msc course for a year, I won't be able to help with the animals, so she won't be able to take the job. My sister is away at a different uni, so can't help either. I don't know if I can defer my place and simply work at home for a year (what the family wants), as I've already paid multiple deposits totalling over ¬£1K as well as for flights. 

So Reddit, what do I do? Stop being selfish and put my life on hold for a year? Probably. Thanks for any responses. 

Also, there is no way we will let go of our animals. They're our family.",25Aug2019,1

One day I got a wrong letter in my post box with a male name on it, I read the name on letter while I checked the names on the other post boxes incase it meant for one of neighbors or I might have to send it back.
It was actually for one of my neighbors, so next thing I did is put it in his box, unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt because it was full of letters, which I thought is weird. I went up and knocked on his so i can give it to him directly and tell him about the rest of the letters, unfortunately no one answered the door and I think I heard someone inside...

705,"-.1% because I truly love him and I don‚Äôt want to believe it. I apologize if this is scattered. I‚Äôm a fucking mess right now. Posting here because I couldn‚Äôt post to r/relationshipadvice 

My female ‚Äúfriend‚Äù moved in with us about a month ago. Ever since then, my boyfriend has been playfully hitting her and asking her if he‚Äôs sexy (he says he‚Äôs joking, but I don‚Äôt like it). He does a lot of nice things for her without her asking him to. When I confronted him about him touching her too much and not paying me any attention to me, I was told I was crazy. 

There was one time he was supposed to pick me up from work and supposedly he fell asleep and his phone died. Funny how the phone still rang every time I called even though it was dead? The friend wasn‚Äôt answering her phone either until 20 minutes later when she said ‚Äúhe‚Äôll be there in a bit.‚Äù Which is odd because according to him she was asleep and didn‚Äôt wake him up. He just woke up on his own. Huh. 

Well, they‚Äôve developed a habit of ‚Äúgoing for a walk‚Äù after getting drunk on a night I go to bed early for work. They don‚Äôt tell me when they go or where they go. When they go, neither of them answer their phone. They‚Äôre just alone together at night not answering the phone. 
 
Last night was one of those nights. They left at 4am for over an hour after he had told me he was going to come to bed in a few minutes. I didn‚Äôt know they left. I was really worried about him so I kept calling him and got no answer. Friend of course wasn‚Äôt answering her phone either. When they finally got home he again said his phone died. And she just wasn‚Äôt answering her phone. Phone kept ringing again. Weird. 

But alllll that time they were off doing whatever the fuck they were doing, I was talking with his friend who has been seeing my ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù He‚Äôs noticed their behavior towards each other too. He told me something very disturbing that I can‚Äôt get out of my head for the life of me. ‚ÄúOne of the nights I was over and the 3 of us were drinking he drunk mentioned outdoor sex a least 6 times, 3 of the times specifically mentioning getting grass pieces in the butt crack, (girl) acting weird towards these comments. Later that night when me and her got together she had 2 grass pieces on her down there.. that was the beginning of my suspensions. I'm sorry if I'm making it worse for you but I notice alot about people's attitudes and energy I dont forget it.‚Äù That‚Äôs not just a coincidence, right?? 

Anyway, when they got home I had that burning in my brain and I was furious. I went crazy. I shouldn‚Äôt have. I told him ‚ÄúI swear to god if you‚Äôre cheating on me we are done.‚Äù To which he replied by telling me I‚Äôm crazy for thinking he was doing that. I explained to him all of the weird things that have been happening that would make me think that and he still said I was crazy. Yet he had no explanation for why things didn‚Äôt add up. 

So I dumped him right then. And now I‚Äôm wishing I hadn‚Äôt done that when I was so emotional. After that, I left. But before that, I informed them both that ‚Äúif y‚Äôall are fucking around then one of you better come clean.‚Äù Again, I shouldn‚Äôt have done that. I don‚Äôt know 100% that they‚Äôre having an affair. I have no concrete evidence. But I have this gut feeling because of all these things that I cannot ignore. And I‚Äôm mad at myself for wanting to fix it. He‚Äôs blaming me for ruining our relationship, his and his friends relationship, and his friend and my friend‚Äôs relationship and I feel so bad. But like... I‚Äôm not crazy for thinking something isn‚Äôt right, right? I don‚Äôt know what to do. I fucked up. This is all fucked up. I‚Äôm sorry.",25Aug2019,28

He also had a decent sized 401k that was dispersed evenly to each of us.

After he passed away I began working my way through his paperwork, bank statements, tax documents etc. I was able to withdraw funds from 2 checking/savings accounts that I was aware he had, and went to all of the banks that had branches in the town in which we lived with his death certificate to check if there were any more accounts...there was not.

The title actually says it all. I often find myself agreeing to meet up with people just to cancel on the day of the meet up or just forgetting to go there completely.

I feel bad about it because I like all those people, some of them are good friends and some are best friends. It's just that I don't think I'm a best friend to them anymore. I know it's my fault.

The thing is, I mostly don't enjoy staying with them for longer periods of time. If I finally drag my ass over to a friend's house or a party of some sorts, I always make sure to drive by myself with my own car. Just to make sure I can leave whenever I want. 

It started about three or four years ago. I was in a bad mental state back then and I don't know if I figured that out already. Before that though, I was way more social.

Now to make things even more confusing, I love meeting new people. I'm not the best at it, but I enjoy it.
I recently got a new job and the team is a dream. Everyone is nice, funny, supportive and I would go as far as calling them friends over colleagues.
I enjoy sitting at the table after a hard day at work, chatting with everyone, but as soon as someone says we should go to a bar or a club, I make sure to make up a story why I can't go or just say I don't want to.


Why am I like this? And what do you think is the best thing to do in my situation?

Just my main medicine right now I get through IV infusion every month would cost 55,000 dollars per dose without my parents insurance, not to mention the five other meds I‚Äôm on. Because of this I‚Äôm pretty much stuck living with my parents and since they live in a rural area in a state that loves cutting education there are virtually no jobs in academia within reasonable driving distance. 

I‚Äôm extremely thankful that my parents are so understanding as within a month of not getting the IV medicine I would become too sick to work. I‚Äôm currently working two jobs that can‚Äôt even pay for an apartment for myself much less my other expenses. If the healthcare issue were fixed that would be no problem, I care more about the job than the other stuff and as much as I would hate to, one possible way to do that is to use another country‚Äôs healthcare. I had an idea but I don‚Äôt know anything about it and most information I found online had to do with earning a degree overseas, not becoming faculty. So I was wondering if anyone on reddit had any experience with this and what their perspective was.",25Aug2019,1

741,"For a year, I‚Äôve been working as a coffee barista (seasonally since I go to school in another city). After coming back again this summer, I realized how toxic the whole environment is...

All my coworkers dislike our manager and gossip about him when he‚Äôs not around. I just listen but don‚Äôt say anything and they repeatedly tell me that I never talk, and should talk more. The lead barista and I are the only ones who don‚Äôt kiss up to him when he‚Äôs around though, and he obviously dislikes us both even though we work hard doing the background stuff that no one else wants to do because they just want to make drinks in the front :/

One day I walked in at the beginning of my shift, and he was talking to one of my coworkers about some rude customer they just encountered. They both saw me come in, and he said something like ‚ÄúOh you know, there‚Äôs an art to the way you should speak to others that makes you more like-able.‚Äù Cue a pause, then they burst out laughing and say ‚ÄúOh heeey HyunCha how are you?‚Äù

It really pissed me off, because my manager doesn‚Äôt know how to do (or even try to learn) any basic tasks, schedules himself for the easiest shifts and STILL leaves 2 hours before his shift ends and gets paid for those hours (wtf), and has the audacity to do passive-aggressive stuff like above when I didn‚Äôt wrong/rebel against him.

The lead barista has told me that I‚Äôm one of the few competent people working there even though I had no prior work experience and work part-time instead of full, so I know he doesn‚Äôt dislike me for being incompetent at my job.

So basically I‚Äôm leaving again for school in a couple weeks so I just used that as an excuse to give a two-weeks notice. (Not sure if he will contact me again for future shifts like he did before). But even if he does, I‚Äôm done with this job, not coming back.

I wanted to list the work experience on my resume but now I know that even though I worked really hard for the customers and did develop a lot, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth listing. I‚Äôm paranoid he‚Äôll just trash talk me if I list him as a reference, and I don‚Äôt think I can list the lead barista as a reference? As a side note, I want to pursue engineering/research, so this job was mostly just for my soft skills, and I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôll help me on paper in the long run. 

Also I know I‚Äôm probably going to face other bad managers in future jobs, so if you guys have additional advice for how to deal with them, I‚Äôd appreciate it!

TLDR: I worked as a seasonal coffee barista for a year. When I returned this summer I found none of my coworkers like my manager, and he dislikes the lead barista and me even though we just do our jobs competently and haven‚Äôt been rude to him. Should I list this job on my resume even though it doesn‚Äôt align with my future career goals? Or should I list it and reference the lead barista if possible?",25Aug2019,2
742,"It's been a few years since I've actually finished a book, I'm trying to read one right now and my mind just keeps drifting off.

748,"To be clear, we have never been official. My (25m) best friends sister (23f) and I have been in this weird purgatory for about 3 years now. It started when we helped comfort each other through pretty horrific breakup. 

I was engaged for about a week when my ex‚Äôs family basically decided for us we weren‚Äôt gonna be together, and her ex cheated on her the day after he went off to college. 

During the recovery, we got super close, basically best friends. Even though she lived two hours away on campus and I was still in our home town, I couldn‚Äôt think of anyone I was closer with. That kinda sparked something, cuz once she was ready to start dating again, she started asking advice and other question that was all aimed at me. (What do YOU look for, what do YOU think about, if I was interested in YOU how would I) and after about two months of her asking these questions, I just asked if she wanted something more than friendship. She never said yes, but our conversations went from almost entirely ‚Äòbrother-sister‚Äô to ‚Äòbf-gf‚Äô. It was like that for a few months, then one day she just stopped talking. 

About a week later, she calls and basically tells me she wants help with a guy. Real guy this time, one of her classmates and after a few weeks, she is dating him, I gave my blessing and all, and I dated a few chicks after that too. 

After it fell through with that guy, we went right back to how we were. Like nothing changed. She‚Äôs never been in another relationship and I kinda stone walled her for a while cuz I felt like she was using me. I dated a handful of girls, one turned pretty serious but didn‚Äôt pan out. She hated every single girl I dated. Would point out how they weren‚Äôt good enough or too bitch or some other thing I never really cared about.

Over the next 3-4 years we would meet back up when she was home, the spark would return like it never left, and I‚Äôd fall for her every time I was with her. She‚Äôd head back to college, it would slowly fade and we‚Äôd basically repeat every two months or so. Eventually, I stopped dating cuz it all just got too weird. She would take me bra shopping, I‚Äôd run errands with her to beauty stores and go clothes shopping, she would just hang out at my house and we‚Äôd watch movies or she‚Äôs keep me company while i worked on shit. 

Last year some time, the infatuation stopped fading while she was back in college, and I was just smitten with her. It wasn‚Äôt a crush for sure, I know her faults. She wildly pisses me off sometimes, she‚Äôs not perfect by any stretch, wouldn‚Äôt be in the top five pretties girls I‚Äôve dated, but where every other woman just couldn‚Äôt stick, she‚Äôs now the only one I think about. Dream about her, think about her when I‚Äôm at work, all that lovey dovey shit.

At a New Years party this year, I told her everything. She responded by basically cutting me off, we didn‚Äôt talk or see each other for 7 months. She would check on me through her mom and brothers, and I‚Äôd hear from them how she was doing. She‚Äôs home now for her annual month home, we moved her back for her last year in about a week, and while she‚Äôs been home, once again, things seemed to pick up where they left off.

It came to a head last night. Fantasy football draft at my house, her brother is in the leauge, she shows up for no reason, wasn‚Äôt invited or anything, and shit you not, played ‚Äòthe perfect wife‚Äô. Made pizzas for us, got drinks, ran to the store once, basically acted like the host so I could just enjoy myself, and whenever she didn‚Äôt have any self appointed duties, she would sit next to me. Every time I got up, she would move a bit closer to where I was sitting, or would adjust so she was ‚Äòmore comfortable‚Äô. When the night was over, I thanked her for all her help and joked that if I had a ring, I‚Äôd propose to her then and there. She rolled her eyes and left with her brother, and this morning I got a long text from her that was basically a ‚ÄòI know you still have feelings for me but I don‚Äôt see you that way blah blah blah‚Äô. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm done with it all. I want to move on and she clearly has no interest in me past being her brothers friend, so I want to get over her. 

But how exactly do you force yourself to fall out of love with someone? Especially when you are basically adopted into their family and they seem to want to keep you in their life?

TL;DR: my best friends sister has my heart, and I don‚Äôt think it would ever become an actual relationship, so I want to fall out of love with her. How do I do that?",25Aug2019,0

750,"So here is the situation. I‚Äôm 21, and four years ago during the summer I entered college, I had a crush on my best friend‚Äôs roommate (both were guys) in a summer program prior to school beginning. We flirted over Facebook and in the short times I saw him when I was at my friend‚Äôs dorm room hanging out. We started texting about a week later and I started seeing him romantically. He‚Äôd invite me over to the dorm when my friend was away for the weekend, and we got to second base.

It was new and exhilarating, and we were into each other, but I wanted to date and he didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure what happened after this, because he began to ignore me and flirted with other girls in front of me. For instance, one girl he invited into his dorm room when I was hanging out in the common area, and she slept over. They made breakfast together, which I saw because I spent the night in the common area with friends. When school started, we had two classes together, and he completely dismissed my existence. He didn‚Äôt look at me, he‚Äôd look past me when we passed each other, and he didn‚Äôt acknowledge much when I‚Äôd text him to talk.

I think I became depressed after this, because it was hard to see someone I cared about in class each day, who pretended I didn‚Äôt exist. I was also depressed from toxic family. After two years in college, I took a gap year from school and cut ties with my parents. I had blocked and unblocked him over the years, and we briefly texted two years ago, but it didn‚Äôt amount to much. He doesn‚Äôt post on social media. I would have graduated in May of this year, and he would have as well if nothing unexpected happened.

This past Wednesday he messaged me on Facebook, just said, ‚ÄúHey how are you?‚Äù At 4:22am. I‚Äôm thinking maybe he did some drugs or got drunk or was just reflecting on college after graduating (presuming he did). Reading the message shook me. I think about him a lot, because he had ideals that were new to me, mainly wanting to be a millionaire and seeing many girls but dating none. I believe he had a girlfriend or something back home, and he had only posted on social media about her.

Finally, my question is, what should I do? I want to talk to him, but I feel like he‚Äôll dismiss me again seeing that I‚Äôm not graduated and making a lot of money. But who cares, because we wouldn‚Äôt be together anyway. I don‚Äôt even know if he wants to be friends. I don‚Äôt know what he wants. I‚Äôve just been hung up on him and I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt just snap out of it.

Recently I went onto my boyfriends computer to find a doc I needed, I came across his photos folder and thought I'd have a peak to see if there was pictures of me on there when I stumbled on maybe over 100 screenshots and downloads on other girl's. Some of them were Instagram model screenshots, screenshots of regular pretty girls smiling and posing (I don't know if he knows them) One I found a particularly worrying screenshot of a girl's tinder profile. The dates on these photographs are fairly recent. I know he watches porn and I'm not botherd about that, sometimes we watch it together.

 What upsets me is the fact that these pictures are of actual real fully clothed girls (in the sense that they are not porn related) and non of them look anything like me, In fact they sort of look like his ex! Hes into youngish skinny white girls with long hair, I'm skinny and young but I'm mixed raced and have short  hair. I feel like I'm not enough for him and that he feels like he's missing something.

763,"Buckle up, this is gonna be a long post. Also this is pretty fucked up so I‚Äôd really appreciate in negative comments be kept out of the comments section unless they‚Äôre constructive.

So a little exposition. Mom and grandma have been at odds forever. However it was their beef so I didn‚Äôt intervene. I figured they didn‚Äôt get along but they‚Äôd still have each others‚Äô backs.

Well six months ago, my aunt and my mom‚Äôs younger sister abandoned her child and went Colorado. (We‚Äôre in TN) She had always struggled with drug addiction and alcoholism and everyone speculates that some crackhead on Tinder led her down this path.

Now my cousin named Andy (not real name) would go to my Aunt‚Äôs ex husband Bruce. Grandma hates Bruce because he‚Äôs made some pretty dumb decisions in the past. Mom got close to Bruce so Andy could come see us again.

And this is where the bullshit starts. Grandma feels betrayed because mom told her that our aunt was a horrible person for what she did. She feels betrayed because mom is artfully goading Mark to keep in touch with Andy.

Despite mom trying to explain, grandma is flat out delusional. She threw a fit in court when Bruce won custody (Aunt didn‚Äôt even show) and when mom called her out, she went at her.

Now I‚Äôve kinda been in the middle when they fought m, but they were both ‚Äúhe said she said‚Äù arguments so all I could do was recommend family therapy. Well I just heard the latest and well after how grandma acted, I think mom has been right from the start.

What‚Äôs worse is mom called her out on not being concerned for her grandchildren (Me and my siblings) While I kept in touch, she rarely tried contact them ever. Instead, she dogmatically defends the aunt who just recently blocked everyone btw.

Grandma retorted with, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll understand once you stop controlling them‚Äù which made my mom cry. Reasonably I‚Äôm pissed off. Both at how she referred to me and how she made mon cry.

764,"since around mid june we wanted to go do a simple camping trip with our friend group and invite some other people but we didnt know who else the plan was us 4 and maybe some others. it already looked like we had to go the last week of the holiday(next week) because that is when everyone was home and had nothing planned because i told from before the holiday even started that i was home again in the last week of the holdiday and i even asked for vacation at my work for that week. so fast forward to last week and my friends were at a party while i was on vacation and they thought that planning the trip there was a brilliant idea so they did and instead of making sure that all 4 of us could be there they invited some other friends of us at that party to come and planned on a date that all of them could go and that was a data me and my other friend werent home. My friend that also wasnt home that date that also was at that party kept saying we werent home then but they didnt care at all and planned for that date. 

the next day i heard i was pretty mad so in our group whatsapp chat i asked why they would plan on that date and we eventually agreed to look at another date that week when i was back. 

But now the worst part, last night i was out with 2 of those 3 friends and one of them told me they were going to camp tommorow which is a date me and my other friend couldnt go and i was fking furious because they still went behind my back and planned the date i wasnt home with the reason ""its good weather now so we shouldnt let this chance go"" even tho its good weather the whole week. 

i am extremely furious that they just went to go camping with the other friends and im even more furious with one of those 3 friends because he is always the one that complains that he is tired, busy or doesnt want to hang out or says last minute he doesnt want to come so a lot of time i try to replan something so we all can be there but no the one time he has to think about 2 other friends that arent there he doesnt even ask me if its okay if they go when im not home.

im extremely mad and am texting with them but they keep coming up with stupid excuses and i need advice.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: my friends planned a camping trip that was the idea of all 4 of us behind my back on a date 2 of us 4 werent home with other friends.",25Aug2019,0

766,"I‚Äôm the middle child of 3 children and I feel like I get targeted the most. I also was diagnosed with anxiety by a therapist a few years ago after being recommended by my doctor. 

My parents always seem to bully or tease me about something. 
My mom has flat out called me fat, made fat jokes and made me insecure about my weight even though my weight is normal for someone my age (16). She has even made fun of me for going on diets or trying to lose weight. Also she claims I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo fat‚Äù for Brandy Melville despite owning a lot of clothes from Brandy. 

I told her to stop making fun of my weight and she said ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre fat what do you want me to do?‚Äù (I‚Äôm not fat in any way) and also bullys me about my clothes, my friends, my anxiety, pretty much anything, when I told her to stop she denied it saying ‚Äúwell i love you and I want whats best for you and I‚Äôm not intentionally bullying you‚Äù.

My dad is even worse. A few months ago, we were visiting LA with a bunch of family members. My dad started yelling at me in the middle of a restaurant we were in. The rest of the family was already outside and so I ran out. My dad starts following me continuing to yell about something stupid and starts cornering me. Later he got all offended that I wouldn‚Äôt sit by him at dinner. 

A few days ago, I was about to leave to go shoe shopping with my mom and younger sister. My dad goes on this rant about how I need to behave (?) and how my current shoes make me look poor. I‚Äôve been wearing the same pair of Converse for 3 years because my mom insists that Vans ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fit me‚Äù despite the fact she gave me the wrong size to try on a year ago. My dad makes me try on every pair of tennis shoes I own while screaming at me. Then asks me what is wrong with the pairs I own and makes fun of me for having an ‚Äúattitude‚Äù

A told B her feelings and he hasn't done much with them, he hasn't said he likes her but hasn't said no to her. I haven't payed a lot of attention to him until recently. A, B and I went out for lunch on Friday. We had a chill time, talked about school, he talked about his job and blah blah. Everything was totally fine until we were walking home. A had to leave B and I at the train station, he lives close to my house so we ended up talking the whole way. He was telling me that things with him and A are really akward because of her feelings and he doesn't want to ruin anything (understandable). We told each other things we'd both kept from A because she's kind of like a second mum sometimes. I thought it would be an akward walk home but it was actually kind of nice. When I got home he texted me later that night, everything was casual, he told me he was annoyed he couldn't get a girlfriend and I suggested A but he said no. He's going away on a trip next week and when I said I was jealous he suggested I should go with him. Like REALLY suggested. He sent me dates, times, cost, etc. I asked who else would be going and he told me it would only going to be us. We kept talking more, he kept telling me my laugh was really cute. That he loved my smile and cute things like that. It made me very giggly and smiley but I knew it was wrong. He kept saying he wanted to see my face and he was willing to come over to my house, this was nearly at midnight. We talked until like 3am but I felt so guilty because I knew A really liked him and I felt like I was doing something wrong. I'm starting to think he might like me, and I might like him.

772,"A little backstory first: 
I‚Äôm originally from Kentucky and moved to California with my boyfriend 3 years ago now and we‚Äôre living with his family. There‚Äôs anywhere from 8 to 11 people living in the house at all times including us and it‚Äôs hectic to say the least. Also his mother started some drama last year in October calling me a ‚Äòfat slob‚Äô to her daughter (who lives here as well) through text only it was accidentally sent to me, now causing a major rift between myself and his family as well as depression, anxiousness and being stressed out just being around them and never feeling like I truly fit in with them, even though I tried so hard up until that point.

So I‚Äôm moving back to Kentucky for awhile to work on my mental health and try to work while I‚Äôm over there as well to pay for bills and such for myself and our son. My boyfriend and I are in a great place in our relationship (I mean, yeah who couldn‚Äôt use more romance, sweet gestures and more time together (he works night shift, so it‚Äôs hard), but hey we‚Äôre great over all) and it‚Äôs looking to be at least 8 months to possibly even 2 years before we‚Äôd be reunited (he‚Äôd be moving over there as well due to it being way less expensive than California), and I don‚Äôt know if we should have an open relationship or not. 

He‚Äôs given the okay and even wants me to go on dates and hang out with girls and just over all explore my bisexual side more. However I don‚Äôt really see myself doing so even with his blessing because this is about focusing on me and my mental health as well as getting our own place for when he comes over there, I don‚Äôt see myself doing any of that because I am happy with him and I love him. He‚Äôs never mentioned wanting to be in one on his end, but I mentioned it this morning and he got almost embarrassed at the thought of being with someone else even if she‚Äôd be strictly a fwb and didn‚Äôt fall for one another or go out on dates, just hang out from time to time. 

With it being potentially so long of a time frame before we‚Äôre back together 100% (we will be flying to visit as frequently as possible as well), is it the right thing to do? I‚Äôm kinda a jealous person by nature and I‚Äôd worry he‚Äôd fall for her or fall out of love with me. I know those are my insecurities talking from feeling as though I was never enough growing up but I can‚Äôt shake them.

I really need advice :3

I've worked through it, and there's still stuff that's hard for me, but I understand it and it doesn't bother me much these days. That being said, it was a big part of my life and the trauma is a big part of who I am now, so I sometimes talk about details from that relationship with friends when it comes up. Problem is, whenever I do, the responses are ""oh that's awful, I'm so sorry that ever happened to you, that's awful, I feel sick hearing that"" etc etc and I don't want to make my friends feel like that. I don't need sympathy anymore, I'm over it. But I don't want to never talk about it because I can't just pretend it never happened. How do I foster a relationship with my friends where I can talk about these things without shocking them into feeling awful on my behalf? Or should I not try to do that? The things that happened *were* awful, and maybe thinking about them as if it's a standard part of my life is the bad thing? Who even knows. Do you know? Any and all thoughts welcome.",25Aug2019,1

He currently lives in the LA metropolitan area. My parents have lent him over the years a lot of money. I estimate around a total of $100,000 and he still currently owes them a little over two thirds of that, with no final repayment date in sight.

He was recently laid off from his work and had to borrow over $10,000 from my parents because he has not had any savings for the past decade or so. But he‚Äôs just landed a new position nearby where he lives.

Yesterday he got a new job offer from a company based in Las Vegas. This position pays a lot more (approx $30,000) but my parents don‚Äôt want him to go because of his history with gambling.

He doesn‚Äôt agree with their assessment and is wanting to take the offer to move to Nevada.

How best to handle this situation? Is there any point trying to convince him that being in a place like Vegas won‚Äôt be a good thing?

Or does the fact that he doesn‚Äôt think he has a serious gambling problem mean that any efforts we make are bound to be futile?

Well a few weeks ago, my mom mentioned she still had some shares of stock in his name that she was considering selling/cashing in; she mentioned this with the intention of helping my brother and me to use the money to pay into/pay off our student loans. The money would be more than enough to do it, but I can't help but feel so guilty for taking the money. 

I am completely aware of the magnificent opportunity that my life has afforded me, my mom has always been the type to take care of her kids in any way she could and would never be the kind of parent to ask for payback, and the burden that would be lifted would allow me to allocate the money I spend monthly currently to put towards my upcoming wedding or a house downpayment. 

But I can't help but feel a little shitty like I'm copping out and just taking the easy road like I can't take care of myself; idk it could be a pride thing.

Let me tell you a bit about my family and my situation. I'm 18, I don't know how to drive, I've never had a job. I've done some work for my grandmother before but that's about it. I've never driven before and my friends all learnt from drivers training but the thing is, they all had to pay like $400 for it and I thought that was dumb when you can just go practice in an empty parking lot late at night and that was my plan but no one in my family is whiling to help me. My grandma has offered to help me but she never gets back to me when I text her about it.

My mom died last year from cancer. I live with my dad and my 4 sisters. I'm decently close with my sisters but not my dad. I hate to say it but I really dislike my dad. He never did much when my mom was alive. He always yelling about something and it really stresses me out and brings down my mood. Hes usually insults me and my sisters, calling use stupid and idiots, etc. I can understand that when we do something wrong for him to be mad but the name calling seems unnecessary. He would always fight with my mom when she was alive. Their fights would include loud yelling, cussing, name calling, and on occasion my dad would throw stuff, like push stuff off shelf's, etc. He still fought with her when she was sick with cancer. I understand that couples fight but I don't think that's ok. 

I don't really do much. My only hobby is playing video games. I have several interests but I really lack the motivation to pursue them.  I'm pretty skinny and I've attempted working out but I learned that there is more to it than just lifting weights and I soon lost motivation because it felt like I was wasting my time if I wasn't meeting the correct requirements. (Those being, eating the right foods everyday, protein powder, etc) I don't really have anyone supporting me other than my friend who lives in a different state. I've tried to get my dad to support me in some things like weight lifting but the times I've talked to him about it the conversation usually ends in him getting mad, yelling and degrading me because he doesn't understand something. I had really bad anxiety when I was little, so bad that I would have to leave school several times a week. It went away somewhat when I got older but I can still feel it to a degree. 

Despite everything it feels like I always have to ask my dad for permission to do things. My half brother who started his own family asked if I wanted to hangout or do some yard work for some cash since I haven't seen him in awhile and my dad said no. I just don't understand. And it feels like if I disobey him hes going to kick me out and I have nowhere to go.

I‚Äôm not scared of doing it in the bathroom I‚Äôm scared of what happens after. I keep wiping but it doesn‚Äôt stop (poop stain)  and I don‚Äôt want to be there for 20min wiping. 

So I recently switched to cottonelle flushable wipes to help. I did it and had the process like wet wipe&gt;toilet paper then finish off with wet wipe but the process took a long time and it still wasn‚Äôt done so I gave up. 

My question for advice is do I just quit toilet paper and use the wet wipe only or what do I do",25Aug2019,1
806,"Hello guys. I am currently a 14 year old, recently I‚Äôve been recovering from depression and it has been much better slowly, I truly feel that I‚Äôll get over this soon which is great. However, the only thing stopping me is this. I have seen some traumatizing videos. In the sense that I was 12, and I watched a LiveLeak video of two men getting their heads executed (an actual execution), a man shooting himself, animals dying and even a horror movie makes me feel bad now, but the worst are the first 2 things. They give me such a deeply disturbing feeling. Just one days ago I literally felt great in the sense that I found that life really was worth it completely, I was just missing out. But the point is, I‚Äôve been recovering well, but those bad memories keep coming back. They are unimaginably disturbing to me. They make life feel like the opposite even when I know that nothing remotely similar will happen to me for sure. I know that I‚Äôm sensitive but they were probably the source of the depression for sure. If I could do anything it Leuko be completely erase them from my mind. I‚Äôve given up on almost everything (sports and etc) and meeting up with friends do to these videos. Any help is appreciated a lot.",25Aug2019,1
807,"Okay so this might be a TAD long winded, but I want to make sure that all the details are involved so I can get the proper advice that I need. 

So I (22F) met this girl (26F, let‚Äôs just call her ‚ÄúJane‚Äù) last year through one of my other friends, and we all would hang out and what not. She was a stud lesbian, but she was small. We ended up making out once, ONLY ONCE, and that was the furthest our ‚Äúinvolvement‚Äù went, and I was drunk as hell when it happened. We hung out on and off all of us together, I never really hung out when we were alone except once when I got pretty drunk and I spent the night in her bed but nothing happened. 

So she has a history of being slightly aggressive, especially when she‚Äôs fucked up- putting her hands around peoples throat as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù, being very grabby, etc. well I told her from the start I don‚Äôt play those games, keep your hands off me, you know. Fast forward to a few months ago, jane accused my best friend of stealing from her, which turned into a whole fiasco of Jane calling the cops, realizing my friend didn‚Äôt steal anything, and my friend cutting her off kinda. 

Well we hadn‚Äôt talked much over the last several months, but she randomly hit me up yesterday asking to hang out. We texted back and forth a bit and she told me she was taking testosterone to transition from female to male, and has been for about 5 months now. I had no idea. Anyways, so we hang out, she‚Äôs gained a bit of weight and it‚Äôs obvious that she‚Äôs been on T. We smoke a little green, I think she had been drinking but I‚Äôm not sure how much. She had only drank 2 beers while I was there. When I went to leave, Jane got hella rapey and almost wouldn‚Äôt let me. She blocked my way from the door on the other side of her bed, and was trying to insist that we make out, to which I CLEARLY told her no absolutely not, I had to go, and she was making me uncomfortable. 

She finally let me go, and as I was walking out, she asked me if I‚Äôd seen her wallet, to which I said no. And it was like a switch turned on in her brain. She immediately accused me of stealing it (I obviously didn‚Äôt, I knew that), and was trying to get me to let her search my purse. I told her to get lost pretty much, that I didn‚Äôt steal her shit, and tried to leave again. However, she followed me into the hallway (it was student housing), continuing to grab at me and my bag. I kept trying to push her away and tell her to stop, but this continued the entire way down the hall and down the stairs into the parking garage. I told her that if she didn‚Äôt get her hands off me, I would make a scene since we were about to be in more of a public area once we got out of the garage. She refused, i went outside and she followed, and still was grabbing on me and my things. I started to get scared at this point because she was much stronger than me, and she wouldn‚Äôt let me go. After a few seconds of struggle, I finally just instinctually reached around and clocked her right in the jaw. My intentions were purely for self defense. After I hit her, she let go for a second and I tried to run to my car. However, she managed to grab me again, and immediately swung at me 2 or 3 times, hitting me directly in the face, to which I finally gave her one last hit in her face, she finally let me go. I told her she was a fucking psychopath and that I was calling the cops. I had blood everywhere. It was running down my face and neck and chest, and it was all over my hands. I managed to stagger up to the front of the building, calling the police, and they showed up and took statements from both me and her. I said I don‚Äôt want to press charges, but that was only because I was flustered and scared and I have a lot going on with my life to where going and dealing with court would not be beneficial to my mental health. 

However, after giving it some thought (and seeing how my face looked this morning from her beating the shit out of me), I‚Äôve decided that I want to press charges. But I‚Äôm scared. We live in northwest FL, so I‚Äôm not sure how laws work here and such but just to give you an idea maybe. I BELIEVE there are cameras outside the parking garage, plus I have a witness as well. What are the chances of me being charged for something as well? Was hitting her because I was getting scared and defending myself the right choice? I didn‚Äôt know how it would escalate if I didn‚Äôt act quickly. Please help, any advice would be appreciated. 

BTW, she admitted to the cops she found her wallet in her car.",25Aug2019,0
808,"Hello, I‚Äôm (17F) and I graduated high school a few months ago. I recently blocked all of my high school friends mainly because I just didn‚Äôt feel like our friendship was beneficial and I felt like it changed a lot. For example one of my friends dropped out of high school senior year and they decided to work in stead of go to school. They haven‚Äôt gone back to school even when I tried to encourage them. When I mentioned that I‚Äôll be going to college soon and having roommates potentially they said ‚Äúcollege is dirty‚Äù and they said they‚Äôd never have roommates which made me kinda uncomfortable. And it made me feel like college and having roommates wasn‚Äôt as good as I thought it was. Whenever I would mention something bad happening to me they‚Äôd laugh or give strange advice. So I just stopped talking to them about my life and decided to eventually block them. 

My other friend would start up a conversation with me via text and just disappear out of nowhere and continue doing the same thing every few months. And whenever I would give him advice he would ignore me. Even when I talked to him I felt like he wasn‚Äôt really listening. So I decided to block him. 

I also had this one friend that I cut off because she told me her parents would steal from stores and scam phone companies. She tried to steal a lip gloss from target while I was with her. The worker had to confront her and she ended up paying. When we walked out she said ‚ÄúMy mother steals from this target all the time, I can‚Äôt believe I got caught.‚Äù She even called her girlfriend and talked to her like stealing was normal. So I had to block her. 

I probably should‚Äôve talked to them and communicated but I felt like they never really listened to me anyways. 

I‚Äôm not sure if these were just unhealthy friendships that deserved to end or I‚Äôm in the wrong. Am I sensitive and ‚Äújudging‚Äù them? I‚Äôm also in the house constantly now, I was homeschooled my senior year so is being isolated a reason why I‚Äôm pushing them away? My mother said that I shouldn‚Äôt have blocked them because people change. They were all good friends of mine at the beginning. Our good memories are still there but I just feel like our friendship did go bitter after awhile?",25Aug2019,5
810,"So, this year hasn‚Äôt been the best. In April I (F23) completed university and decided to end my 8 year relationship/engagement. At the time I knew it was the best thing to do, it was a very toxic and unhealthy codependent relationship. However, the other reason for this decision was I had been pinning and falling unintentionally in love with my best friend (M22). I had pushed these feelings down for a long time, as the guilt of leaving my ex was to much and how could I leave after all this time? I mean I thought, hey your not falling in love this is just some sort of crush. But it wasn‚Äôt. So I started dating my best friend very soon as the break up, nothing serious, just dates ect. By June we made it official, it all just seemed to fit perfectly as we are basically the same person (humor, games, books and the same academic aspirations).  Although, all of this amazing beautiful time we had I feel has been cracked, as in the middle of July I suffered a miscarriage. Both my SO and I had no idea I was pregnant, I was on the pill and took pregnancy tests. 

This is where my story gets complex, so my SO a couple of month prior actually conceived a baby with his ex. At the time myself and our other best friend supported him and her. However, his ex chose to not continue with the pregnancy and ghost my SO. He was very supportive ect but did mention he wasn‚Äôt ready to be a parent. Which is fine, but he did say that no matter what he would step up and become the best father he could.  After this happened, my SO (best friend at the time) was devastated and depressed. He has siblings who are young in age so it was heartbreaking for him. All our friends rallied around him and tried to get him out the house and out of bed. Over this time we spent a lot of time together, he really just needed the company and distraction from his thoughts.

Going back to myself, I had also suffered a loss of twins at 12 weeks when I was 17 with my ex (which I had no idea about). I remember my ex being the unpleasant being that he could be just shrugged me off whilst miscarrying and that he wasn‚Äôt going to leave work to take me to the hospital. So I‚Äôm the flat we had back then I went through it alone. And since that day it wasn‚Äôt a unsaid rule it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be talked about. Imagine a unemotional robot that was my ex‚Äôs reaction and he underplayed how devastated I was and called me attention seeking ect. Since this event I swore that I would always be cautious, be on birth control and never allow this situation to happen again... and if I ever got pregnant again I would do everything possible to prevent it happening. 

I had told my SO years back about the miscarriage ect so he knew the ache I still held in my heart. Fast forward to July when I miscarried, it was a shock and I shut down. He was upset and worried about me, but the first thing he said was I can never tell anyone about this, not again. I know that this wasn‚Äôt meant and he was just in as much shock as myself. But, since he said that and that was his reaction I immediately isolated him in my mind from the baby and how how going to grieve for his/hers passing. I did break down once and get very upset and angry as I was a mess and I did say to him words in anger about what I felt about him which were unkind. He was heart broken at my outburst. But I just feel this simmering anger inside me about him. His first words stuck with me, I felt like in that second he took my baby and it‚Äôs existence on this earth and took it away from me. As say ‚Äúnot again and I‚Äôm not telling anyone‚Äù, brought feelings of shame and I was like the babies life was somthing to forget about. Which I know from the bottom of my heart his words were not meant and he regrets it so very much. 

Now, I can‚Äôt talk to him about it... it‚Äôs awkward and detached. I feel like it has driven me apart from my best friend. I don‚Äôt know what to do now. I feel shame and embarrassment when the topic is broached. He loves me completely and I do too, but I just can‚Äôt even look him in the eyes when the subject is talked about. Has anyone experienced this? How can I talk about it and grieve? I feel like the sadness is eating away at my soul.",25Aug2019,1

812,I am 29 years old and up until the end of July 2019 I had lived in the same house in Phoenix my entire life. My grandma owned it and sold it to a Canadian buyer for 150 grand. Other houses on the same block are going for 220-230. This was a home built in the 1950's but in a state of decay. Saw a family picture and it still had the same fuse box from the 1950's. This guy who bought the house hires my uncle to do the HVAC for all his properties in Arizona. Through him is how I discovered it was a rent to own. Now I just started a new job at Costco that pays 1800 a month but I have the opportunity to work into full time and to a higher tier within the company and I plan on staying her for a long time. Basically I want my house back. The past month I have been sleeping on a yoga mat on my grandmas living room floor and I am going to be moving into an apartment next week. Losing my home has changed my life. Its my dream to buy the house back and I was wondering does a rent to own make sense? I heard the new owner is investing 30-40 grand in fixing it up. I also need to find a way to contact him. But before I do should I try this or is rent to own a scam? If I was worth $1 billion dollars I would be willing to pay $999 million for that home back. Thats how much it means to me and its my goal in life. It has so many memories and that is priceless.,25Aug2019,1

815,"I'm 18m btw. it's not as simple as the title suggests, last September, I started talking to this girl from my youth group, I'd had a crush on her for ages (let's call her A). so we started talking and the feelings were mutual, we went on a couple of dates and then I get scared and I broke things off. I got in a new relationship (we'll call B) and time went by, but I couldn't look at A or see A on Instagram or I would just feel this instant regret in my heart. I broke up with B in about march and then had this sort of breath of fresh air of the solidarity and then felt like I missed someone. I got back with B in about July but then slowly my mental health began to deteriate, I broke up with B again, deleted social media and just went ""cold turkey"".

 I cracked and get Snapchat again in August and I'm in a group chat with A on that as it's all our last year at the youth group and so I keep seeing pictures of her and it hurts me. I want to talk to her and tell her how much I fucked up. Tomorrow is our youth group week away, the last one that I can go on, seeing her everyday without her knowing how much I regret what I did would be torture but writing out a paragraph and telling her how much she means to me and how much I regret what I did and how much I care about her might just make it awkward for both of us.

817,"Today I finally had enough courage to tell my mom that I think she and my father should get a divorce or at least separate. My mom has had multiple sclerosis since her early 30‚Äôs, she‚Äôs now 60. She‚Äôs been slowly deteriorating over this period of time. She has severe numbness in her legs in addition to a buckling knee which often causes her to fall. She is extremely fatigued and can not stand, be out in the heat or in the cold for extended periods of time. Going up and down the stairs, showering and just walking from one room to another is a huge task for her. It has only become almost unbearable for her as of recently. 

My father is not a bad person but is not great at handling all of this. When my mom falls he sighs, irritated, as if to say ‚Äúyou should of been more careful‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy were you even doing that in the first place‚Äù. My mom has asked him to put railings in the house for her for years and he didn‚Äôt until his own mother got sick and was unable to walk.  

My mom now has to get back surgery and she said to me ‚ÄúI wonder if I‚Äôd be going through this if he would have just put up the railings for me all those years ago‚Äù. 

They are completely miserable together, my mom is constantly frustrated with my dad and talking to me about all of the things that frustrate her about him, and my dad is constantly in a bad mood whether it‚Äôs something to do with my mom or not, he is extremely irritable and gets very upset when things don‚Äôt go his way. He will sit and pout on the couch for hours even days if he‚Äôs upset about something. 

All of this has me miserable as well. I still live at home and absolutely dread walking through the door each evening when I come home from work. 

I told my mom that I think she and my father should separate because they would be happier and she just looked down and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre probably right‚Äù. I felt bad for saying it but I also don‚Äôt. My grandparents went through the same thing and my mother said she and her siblings said ‚Äúwhat took you so long‚Äù when they announced their separation. 

Part of me wants to say this to my father too but I don‚Äôt know how he would take it. He would either call me crazy or get very angry as he is a person that often dents things.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don‚Äôt say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

832,"This is going to be a long post, might be a little bit too long but I really need to share my situation with someone who will hear me out. Please excuse my spelling and grammar/punctuation too because it's not that good. But if you have a minute, please take a moment to read my post.

So, I'm going through a pretty hard time in school right now. I'm currently in high school and I had to switch schools in the past because I was bullied there. I expected things to be different at my new school, but not even on the second day into class,  someone decides to post pictures of me online to make fun of my looks. I would walk out the hallways and people will be pointing at me. Laughing, and making noises. In class, kids would be saying awful things about me. Now, I'm not as affected when people say awful things about me, but I don't understand how people could act so evil to me on the second day. I never treated anybody badly. I don't know anyone.

I felt terrible. How can something I tried to escape from, happen again on the second day of school? I spoke to the counselors/administrators, notifying them about the situation. But they couldn't do anything without concrete evidence. The only advice I got was to study and do my work. I told my parents, and they did not believe me at first (they believed me eventually). Instead, they gave me the same advice the counselors/admin gave. I understood both of them to a certain extent. When dealing with situations like that, you do need evidence to prove yourself. And since I guess its not a naked picture of me, I don't need to give a damn about what other people think of me. But I kind of felt dismissed. I'm one of those teens who don't have social media accounts other than Reddit and Youtube.  And If I did, I'm the new kid on the block. I don't know, or follow anybody at my school. I don't know names or teachers. It was only until someone came forward and gave names to two people who were part of it,  (I'm so thankful for that person btw). So at least now other people know that I'm not making this up in my head.

Although my parents were relieved. I knew that things were not over. Even though those people got handled (Not even 100 percent sure if they did), pictures spread and people get a hold of it. As days progressed, kids started sneaking pictures of me. In the hallways, in classrooms, literally everywhere. it was pure entertainment to them. My sister told me to to take pictures of the people who are doing it as they are doing it. And again, I told the counselors about what was happening, and they told me I couldn't take pictures. So what was I supposed to do? This is harassment. I focus and do my work in all of my classrooms, but I can't even look up at the board without someone sneaking pictures of me.

I kept my parents updated. But primarily my dad gets angry at me because my grades are suffering (physics). He tells me to focus focus focus. But It's difficult for me because I have to deal with constant harassment every day knowing that things won't stop anytime soon. I also kept most of my teachers informed about this, but there's so much that they can do. And a lot of teachers cant see everything that goes on in class. I keep my friends updated about this, but they aren't friends with any of the bullies and don't follow them online. They are there for me though, I won't discard that. And I'll definitely need them more than ever after the upcoming situation.

A new school week starts and somehow, someone or a group of people decide to ""expose"", me. Everything got terribly worse. People were reposting videos or pictures of me and I couldn't do anything about it. I caught someone sneaking in a picture of me and told an authority. Again, they told me they can't do anything until the picture is online. I felt so hopeless. Everybody knew what was going on. Nobody wanted to actually step up and tell me ""Hey, there's pictures of you online"". Instead, people are becoming more vocal about their hate towards me (how do teachers not see this). And I get so uncomfortable. They airdrop pictures of me (I have an android). And always make it a point to always get pictures of me on their group chats, and it hurts me so much. I'm starting to get headaches, and when I wake up from sleep I get excessive sweatiness. I went outside to a different county to get medication, (not because of my headaches) and someone noticed me. Its really hard you know. I have a stronger mind now so I make sure not to budge at my bullies, but I'm human. I have my bad days, and right now I'm getting more bad days.

I don't know what to do. I'm going to school tomorrow and I'm dreading it. I want to be homeschooled so much, but my parents won't allow me to, they want me to stick it out. I tried to join a club, but a lot of people were pointing me out and making fun of me. I skip lunch, and I don't ride the bus anymore, (Its overcrowded and people are literally sitting four to a seat). I don't know what to do.. I am so tired of everything. Very tired, I can't do this every single day. things will continue to get worse and I don't how low these kids will go to be entertained. Please, give me some feedback, or support. I don't think I'm being extra. I really don't know. Nobody knows that I'm going behind the scenes to handle my situation. Because if they did then, terrible wouldn't be the word to describe the future events. This is kind of too long but I really want to speak my truth to some platform without being interrupted.

835,"Hi all, I just found this sub and my wife and I are hoping for some advice! We rent in an almost quiet neighborhood near a small liberal arts college. Our road is 25 mph and connects directly to the college. It's the road we walk and run on and we have a 3 year old. Unfortunately there's no sidewalk and the shoulder isn't great. It shouldn't be a problem and in the summer it isn't.

I used to work for the college and tried reaching out to the local police to have them enforce speeding and stop signs on students, but no luck. Never got a call back or response. If people are driving in an unsafe way, I'll flip them off of I'm walking or running. Should I keep calling the police? Should I carry some water balloons on my runs to chuck at people speeding? Should in install a speed bump in the night?

If there is any advice or guidance I'd greatly appreciate it!",25Aug2019,1

Now I haven't played properly since January, I miss it and the endorphins. I suffer with depression anyway and it was a great help but the fact I can't exercise/ play is making my depression worse alongside missing the endorphins to help keep me going.

I have been struggling to do the physio due to the pain, all of these cause pain: stairs, sitting, standing, driving, walking (sometimes straight away, sometimes after like half hour) The only thing I have been doing is walking the dog but this still hurts most of the time but I can say that getting up before work and walking help lift my mood but it's obviously not the same.

She persisted so I told her ‚Äúthey why do you keep me around‚Äù she started to cry and told me to get out of her life forever again. So I stopped. 

The last was when we fought about her ex again. She threatened a breakup and I called her a ‚Äúwho** who is bad in bed‚Äù she broke up with me. When I tried to apologize a week later she rubbed it in my face how she‚Äôs sleeping with her co worker. Who she always told me was just a friend

840,"17 F. I am just very, very, very unintelligent. Here's a little bit about my life and situation in general: 

My borther is a genius, he is good at everything, 0 efford. He is going to the best school in my whole country and i have never seen him in front of a book. My sister is a sport champion, the best in whole Europe in her discipline. I know that i shouldn't compare myself to anyone, but you know, it's hard not to. It's a joke in my family that they have stolen all good genes from me, everyone always tells me to marry rich. 

I have good grades, but: 1. I put sooooooo much efford in that, 2. Grades aren't important anyways, im just (i don't know how to name it) 'life stupid'. I am this 'cute idiot' type of person, and i hate that, i hate myslef for that. 

Yes, i am kind and a nice person, but that's not enough for me. I want to be intelligent and i can't. I am born that way. My family always tells me that i was never interested in anything as a child, that i have never asked any questions.

This whole thing wouldn't be such a problem for me, but i have really high ambitions. I don't want to be a cleaning lady, or work in the kitchen. I don't want to work a normal, low salary desk work, even tho i am aware that this is a place for me. 

Oh i want to add that also i do not have any specific interests, i am not creative or talented in any way, and i am on autism spectrum.

I moved in in April, but I don't like it.

I spend most of my time at my boyfriend's house anyway because I hate the smell. The dog also goes into my room and since I only come home every couple days, it just sits there. I put a heavy basket in front of my door and that seems to help but the dog doesn't learn. She says she isn't home enough to let the dog out  so she lets her just the bathroom. Sometimes I can't even take showers!!!!!! 

I tried telling her a lot to potty train it and it's nasty but she doesn't listen. I even told her to get rid of the poor dog because she barely gets excersize! 

Well anyways, I am planning on moving back in with my boyfriend because it's less expensive to do that, but I pay rent a month ahead of time on the first of the month so if I move out in the next few days I won't have to pay for next months, but I feel like that would be shitty to do.

Also a guy she's talking to is always there. In the month he spends probably 29/30 nights. He doesn't even pay rent!! I feel like that's none of my business though, but it just gets annoying when I want to relax in the living room and he's there. I made remarks about him basically living there rent free and she doesn't see anything wrong with it.

I loved my trade school and the field I was doing all my instructors were incredible and the guys I was in school with were some of the most genuine down to earth people ive met and shortly after graduating I began to apply for work.

Come to find out the area I live in is really hard to into so I apply to a city about an hour away to a part of the trade I wasn't trained in and move with some help from my parents. first week is great since I was new they didnt have a permanent crew I would hop around day to day to wherever I was needed everyone I worked with was great, patient and all around fun to be around albeit wish I could help more but I'm still learning.

well a crewleader's helper quit which means I had a permanent crew to be on and lets call this guy bill.

I have worked with bill twice before I got put in a permanent spot with him first time was my 4th day there and got absolutely torn asunder verbally called every version of dumbass there was and all around chewed out which admitedly I probably deserved because I was doing stupid stuff but I gave him 100 percent the whole day and he apologized at the end of the day water under the bridge.

I worked with Bill all last week and got verbally berated every single day. Told I should quit and find another career, that he will call his boss and get me transferred away and its wearing down on me more than I thought it would and now the thought of going back to work which was usually exiting for me to be able to learn and meet cool people is giving me anxiety and I can't get to another crew because they're all full. Can't tell my boss or HR because in the trade I work in the last thing you want to be seen as is a whistleblower about someone hurting your feelings.

Sexual abuse and self-harm


So my ex who I am no longer in contact with has been sexually abused by her father since she was a child, she is now in her early 20s and was an adult when we met.

My ex made it very clear whenever I tried to encourage her to speak to the police or her mother that she was never going to do that and if I told she would never speak to me again and also threatened self-harm/suicide. I feel a lot of guilt and shame over not being able to help her when we were together despite my best efforts and still wonder on a regular basis if there is something I could do now. If I were to tell her mother it would be anonymously as our relationship was toxic and I don't want to reopen the lines of communication but still want her to be safe, happy and healthy.

Every year, my university has a super fun halloween party.

However, my new roommate's name just so happens to also be Harley Quinn.

I'd like to go as Harley, but feel like it might be awkward to dress up as her while I'm living with someone who's literally named after the character (I'm still not sure how I'm gonna ask her if she wants to see the Joker movie with me either).

854,"Before I start, let me just give a warning, this relationship was FULLY online, we've never met in real life.

So not long ago, late 2017, was the worst time of my life, for two big reasons: My older sister and father deceased in the span of 1 month (please let's not talk about this), with that said let me tell you everything that happened:

In mid-2017 I met this girl (let's call her Ann) through an online game and we'd chat alot, basically all day everyday and she was awesome, I remember clearly how good It felt. Back then It was more simple for us and I wasn't really as attached as I am now, but after 3 months some stuff happened, I felt like I wasn't getting much attention from Ann and I had a really close girl friend that wanted to date me, so me and Ann broke up and I started dating this other girl, which by the way It wasn't a good time at all, we broke up 1 month after. I wasn't very sad about the breakups then because both times I felt like they weren't really that important. Either way, after all that is when two of my family members sadly deceased and that gave me such bad anxiety/depression that I was suicidal. It was a very hard time for me, It was the worst. Not long after those suicidal thoughts, in like mid 2018, Ann messaged me again, out of nowhere. I was scared and skeptical, but we did talk normally and just as friends at the time. We started talking again. It was a really fun time for the both of us, we felt really good and there were times we'd both enjoy everything we did together alot. Then months later, October 1st, I still remember perfectly the day, Me and Ann decided to comeback, started dating again and I did a very rash promise that (keep this in mind) I would NEVER leave her again, no matter what. Then we did ALOT, we watched stuff we like together using the old ""rabb.it"" website, we played games from time to time but mostly important we talked alot with each other. Time passed, 6-7 months later we had some minor fights over a game, apparently she had been playing a game with a friend and I got really really jealous, we did solve these problems after a while she had told me I would always be her priority and we even played the same game together too and I was happy with it. More time passed, 2 months later we had more problems, I forgot about my own promise and I broke up with her because I felt like I wasn't getting enough attention, she would take 40mins-1hr to reply most of the time and I started thinking she was just done with me, and we came back right the next day because I love her very much. Not long later, 1 week possibly we broke up again because of the same reason but this time we did not comeback, even after weeks of begging Ann for us to comeback we didn't, I always asked her ""Why?"" and she always had the same reasonable answer: ""We're both not in good mental health, I don't want to keep hurting you like this and I don't want a relationship right now."" It was very harsh on me and I got suicidal again over it, but guess what? She helped me recover. I recovered from those suicidal thoughts and now we're just best friends. But the major problem is still there, I still love her INSANELY much and the idea of just being best friends hurts me alot and I seriously do not know what to do, I want to be more than just friends.

I‚Äôm the jealous type. Although I don‚Äôt like to admit it or say that I‚Äôm jealous, I really am. I‚Äôm not the type of person that likes to talk about my feelings with others because It always seems to start an argument or put in the middle of drama and I HATE it. I really do.
What should I do?
Every time I go near him and try to talk to him, he‚Äôs acts weird or is too busy talking to T. The only thing I could say about T to make this make sense without going into detail is that she took someone that I love away from me and I don‚Äôt want that to happen again.

S and I have been together for about a year and a half, it's a long distance relation ship so we only see each other in person 2 to 4 weeks a year. We've been fighting recently like really badly (He would lose his shit and scream at me and ended up breaking his phone because I said sorry and then told me he just wanted love and affection from me so he didn't freak out like that. Or how he pressure's me into sexual stuff even when I'm not in the mood and then gets super upset and sad because of me not wanting to) and we're on a break when I went to visit some older friends I haven't seen in a while.

872,"We live in a condo complex with a mix of rentals and owned places. My mother is the owner of her condo.

Our neighborhood used to be somewhat peaceful but after some of our good neighbors left some obnoxious trashy people moved in and they have about 10 people in their house.


Their kids leave food and wrappers everywhere and when ever I walk my dog I have to watch for old food or my dog will try to swallow it and choke. Especially chicken bones! They leave chicken bones in the neighborhood grass! 


The kids run all over the street and block the entry to the neighborhood with their bikes! The parents are almost never out there to watch them even though some of the kids look like they‚Äôre only 4. They let their kids play in the street and I always have to be extra cautious when driving because of that.



They have a guy that stays over there every weekend and he‚Äôs always going up and down the neighborhood. When I‚Äôm just trying to take my dog potty on the grass he constantly tries to get my attention by commenting on my appearance, asking me questions and telling me I dropped something.



We have a parking lot in our neighborhood so the people that live there can park. They take up most of the parking lot now due to how many people  are stuffed in one condo and I frequently had to park on the street.
A lot of their vehicles aren‚Äôt registered either so they are taking a lot of the parking spaces up with stolen/unregistered cars!



The kids play right by our door very often to play hide and seek in our bushes (and have crushed on of them) they also play ding dong ditch and try to look through our window to see into our house!


They park behind parked cars in the parking lot to smoke pot and block people from pulling out of their parking spots! One time my mom honked at them and they got mad at us just for wanting them to move!


They tore down signs, throw gravel everywhere, almost burned down our entire neighborhood during Fourth of July because they thought it would be fun to do a bunch of illegal fireworks near the trees while drunk!

(This is especially shitty because we have a nice elderly couple that lives near us and they have PTSD due to surviving a giant fire and lost their last home)



We try calling the cops but they usually are working on ‚Äúhigher priority cases‚Äù and don‚Äôt come by until hours later or not at all.



Oh and just recently another neighbor moved out of their condo and another of their 10 friends moved into it! So now we have even more obnoxious people to deal with!


Everyone‚Äôs basically moving out of this neighborhood and I suspect it‚Äôs because of them! 


I don‚Äôt even want to walk my dog anymore. I‚Äôm either afraid the man will hassle me or my dog will swallow something that will kill him or some kids will run up to my dog to try and pet him. (They do it anyway even after I say no)


I don‚Äôt even want to go outside to get the mail anymore. Especially because one time that guy followed me to my house to see what house I lived in and kept calling me beautiful.



I just cannot take it! I want them gone! I think they are even lowering the value of our property. Especially because they leave food everywhere and make a mess of the neighborhood..


There was even a point where my mother was forced to park in the street and got her license plate stolen! I‚Äôm suspecting it was them due to all the stolen/unregistered cars. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just want to not have to deal with their constant bullshit anymore.",25Aug2019,1

I've just been so fucking sad, I'm only 13 and it might just be puberty but it's so hard just acting happy. I don't wanna be the ""depressed edgy kid"". My brother has depression and I just don't want to. I've been losing interest in everything, I don't wanna get out of bed in the morning, I don't wanna go to school, I'm just so tired. Sorry for the rant but just... Idk you probably don't have to take me seriously cause I'm only a kid.",25Aug2019,1
874,"I've (M20) been trying to get myself to move out for a month now and in with my girlfriend (F19). Problem is my parents are pretty strict. My mom gives me a curfew of 9:00 PM and doesn't allow me out if it's too close to the hour. I get lectured on how irresponsible it is to come home late because of having work the next day. They give me attitude if I decide to go out more then one day in a row. I'm 20, an adult. I feel like I should be able to do as I want. But I have house rules. Which is fine, just let me move out then. I've been persistent in telling my mom that I intend to move out soon but she always instantly replies with a solid ""No your not. You need to focus on school and saving your money""

They don't want me leaving without proving to them that I can handle taking a college class. I've applied at a community college and starting to take an English class to start out. I paid for it on my own so yeah, I'm going to be doing everything in my power to succeed. The college has free tutoring I can take advantage of and my girlfriend is excellent in school so she would be able to assist me if I ever needed.

A couple of my parents other concerns:

Bills - They are worried that I will be paying for more living away from home. This is fair. I will probably be paying more in gas money. But where I am moving I won't be paying rent. I already currently pay for my school, car insurance, phone bill, and groceries for the week. And I am fully capable of saving for classes I take in the future.

My relationship - My girlfriend and I have known each other for 2 years and have been dating for 7 months. She has a baby with someone else. They've split and since then, we've been together. I know most will read 'baby' and say ""get out"" but I've been around him since he was born. I love her as well as her baby. Maybe its not what I wanted for myself a year ago but now that I'm here I'm very okay with it. Although my parents freak over it, ""Its not your child, not your responsibility."" . It's not my child but I'll definitely help her raise him. She already pays for all of his necessities and isn't expecting me to help pay for him. I really just help her handle him. And when her and I are busy or need someone to watch him her parents are glad to take him.

I want to leave here. I want to start fresh to balance work, school, and free time on my own schedule and not on my parents. I just feel like my quality of life and time spent will just be so much better. I also want to be there for my girlfriend. I'm currently only with her on weekends but that's not enough.

Lastly, I've seen advice given on here for similar situations. A popular reply is to just move out. Find a day your parents aren't home and just take what you can and leave. At the moment, it's what I plan to do. I plan to leave a note. It's a scary move especially when your parents are against it. I've had a relatively good relationship with my parents growing up. I've never really rebelled against them like this and I just hope that I don't mess up everything I know. Getting out of here is really something I want for myself though. I truly feel ready. I'm just stuck.",25Aug2019,1
875,"Question/full problem and thought process is in the last paragraph, the rest is background/situation info.

I'm in barber school at night working a full time job during the day. I almost have my tuition paid off (3 more paychecks to be exact,) and have plans to quit work at the end of October so I can go to school full time and graduate in February instead of next September. Work is a nightmare, loads of labor laws are broken like tampering with my time card, denying me meal breaks (my state requires it by law,) not having a bathroom I can use, etc., and the manager and assistant manager are absolutely awful. I'm the only one working besides those two. 

I get screamed at on the sales floor on an almost daily basis for something as simple as knocking over a bottle of shampoo or hairspray. The AM has hit me, the SM makes me do all of the work like planograms, daily paperwork, and store resets by myself while he talks about how hard he works to customers. The AM screws up the money every night and I'm forced to fix it off the clock every morning. She's 57 and can't count to 100. Loads of other things like this go on. Despite this I still have the best sales in the store by a 2 to 1 ratio bare minimum and have since my first day on the job. I work every other weekend alone 10 hours a shift with no breaks while the SM and AM work them together. 

Anyhow, I've made a plan to pay off school, have 2 extra paychecks in the bank by using vacation time so I don't physically have to be there for 2 weeks worth of the next 60 some days and quit on Halloween which is payday. My old job selling boots asks me to come back to work every time I come in the store to shop, will work around any schedule I have since my performance there was so good, and I can survive on the part time position for a few months in school until I'm licensed and able to cut hair full time. I don't know how much more I can mentally handle much more than working where I'm at much past Halloween, and my plan should work out perfectly if I follow it. However, I'm really second guessing myself about all of this and wondering if it's worth it to leave the steady, guaranteed paycheck I have now to finish school early and possibly have to survive on my savings for a month or two, or should I stay where I'm at, suffer through another year at this job and keep going to school part time, then go get licensed? I'm scared as shit, have no idea what to do, and would love some advice. My anxiety is through the roof and I've been a nervous wreck the last 2 days over it.",25Aug2019,1
876,"Hi,

My dad's girlfriend of two years broke up with him in July and she left tons of her three year old's toys at our house. My dad refuses to give them back.

Today, he went on a cleaning spree and, to be totally fair, I texted her and asked her if she wanted her son's toys back. She said yes and that she'd been texting my dad about it but had gotten no response. I told my dad and he said no, he will not give them back. And that he wants me to block her number.

I get being upset, but he's literally holding a toddler's toys hostage and is probably going to throw them all away. That's just not fair to the kid. Sure, some of them are toys that he bought, but still. The kid is freaking three years old and he's taking his toys away.

Is there anything that I can do? I'm honestly toying with going to the house when he's not there, getting everything, and driving over to her place to give it back myself. But then hell will be 100% unleashed on me when he finds out.

I'm stuck here, what should I do? She can't afford to replace whatever my dad is going to toss in the dumpster. It's just not fair to the kid.",25Aug2019,1
877,"First some back story: I let this girl at work and at the time she was dating a guy for 2 years. The moment I first laid eyes on her I instantly fell for her. First we became friends and then eventually her and the guy broke up. I tried to make some moves after a while and tried to make something happen between us but I wasn‚Äôt successful and we were just friends. I still flirted with her and after a while I asked her for a date and she said yes and then admitted she did have a crush on me. I was excited and happy and we went on that first date. The date went well and we were going to go on a second one. Going on a second date was hard to manage because we were both in college, worked full time, but also she suffers from Lyme disease and would be to sick to do anything at times. However, we always flirted with each other and we would even get kinda intimate and kiss each other on the neck a lot and hold hands. She would never let me kiss her lips though which was odd. 

After some time I asked her what was holding her back and she would say it‚Äôs complicated and she still has feelings for ex and she doesn‚Äôt know herself and also she didn‚Äôt want to put the burden of her illness on me. It was understandable even though her ex was a major asshole. More time passes and we get even closer. We hung out one night and it was amazing. After we left a restaurant we were texting and then suddenly she stopped. I was confused why she wasn‚Äôt answering and then she started texting me that we can only be friends and not to reply to her. I was super confused. The next day she called me and explained what happened. She explained to me that this whole entire time she has been in a relationship with a girl who I thought was just her friend because that‚Äôs what she said she was. She said they have been in an on and off again relationship for years and this is why she never kissed me and why things never progressed further and why it was complicated. She said the feeling she had for her ex was a lie and it was really her feelings for her girlfriend. 

After this we still continued to flirt and talk and she would tell me she loves me and she would message me anytime her gf wasn‚Äôt around and even though it was weird, I was happy because I feel so deeply for her. Then one day out of no where, she stops. She‚Äôs more distant, she doesn‚Äôt talk to me much, we never hang out, she doesn‚Äôt flirt with me anymore and so I ask why. She says she wants to focus on her relationship and just wants to be friends. 

Currently I don‚Äôt know how to move on from this, things were weird but nice and now it‚Äôs gone in the blink of an eye. She tells me to move on if that‚Äôs what I want which makes me think there‚Äôs still hope and she tells me if I was with another girl she would feel weird about it but she would be fine if I were happy. I find myself still trying to flirt and messaging her but she hardly ever replies. Sometimes she leaves me on read. She says she still wants to be my friend but she doesn‚Äôt act like much of a friend anymore either. How do I get over her when I truly feel like I fell in love with her the first time I seen her?

884,"Over the past 3 months my bf and I have been going through a rough patch. We are giving each other space at the moment because things got really heated at the beginning of the month. Individually we both have a lot going on and I have dealt with depression since I was a teen, I got a good grip on it years ago and recent events with me graduating university (feeling lost/whats my purpose thoughts), being unemployed, and living with family members who can be toxic has triggered a depressive state that I haven't experienced in YEARS. I finally admitted to my bf last month just how severely depressed I've been feeling and he was glad I told him. We have been arguing on and off for the past 3 months and while we both have been unreasonable and stubborn about some of our disagreements. I have displayed some very uncharacteristic behaviors such as getting extremely angry and mocking him in one argument and throwing out a few times I've helped him out financially in his face when he told me he'd send me money then retracted his offer in another argument. Obviously , this upset him, I apologized after and admitted that it was mean and wrong and that I shouldn't have taken my anger out on him. I have been struggling with basically dealing with the fact that that happened. Im not a mean person and those two instances dont speak of me as a whole and I feel like its tarnished his view of me. I know Im human and we all make mistakes and say things we don't mean but Im still somewhat struggling with shame and guilt. Although we are giving each other space, we talk like once every other day with brief check ins via text and sometimes phonecalls, it feels nice to be resetting ourselves like that with one another.

Yet, I need advice on how to go about forgiving myself for my rashness in anger.

885,"I don't know what to do. I want to go to college and become an occupational therapist, but I feel like I'm never going to be able to accomplish those dreams, because I'm never mentally stable enough. I've struggled with severe depression for 4 going on 5 years, with constant suicidal thoughts. I believe I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and OCD, but my current psychiatrist refuses to diagnose me. I have a really hard time managing my anger as well. I've never been physically violent, but I always say really hurtful things, and just meltdown with anger. On top of it all I'm also high functioning Autistic. I've been clean of self harm for 6 months, and haven't had an attempt of ending my life for over eight months (with ten attempts in total). I wish I could kill myself, but my sister died a month ago, and I can't put any more grief on my parents. I'm highly considering that if I'm still not better once my parents die (which is probably another 30 years away), but if I'm still miserable, I'll end my life then. We've tried everything to get me better to include two residential treatment centers, a number of acute centers, years of therapy and meds, Ketamine treatment, etc, but nothing has worked. 

Anyways, I want to go to college and become an OT like I mentioned about, but I fear that I'll never be stable enough for that to happen. That I'll try college, and then get to overwhelmed and have to drop out. Right now I'm online schooled for high school, and likely about to go to a different school, which will be my 4th school (3rd switch), and I'm a junior. I honestly don't know how I'm going to graduate high school and make a life for myself. I've considered just getting a GED many times, but I've decided that I'm going to stick to getting a diploma. I just never feel like I can accomplish my dreams because of how horrible my mental health is. I want more than anything to accomplish those dreams. I want to stay alive, but when I try to actually make a good life for myself it never goes right. I've been through so much trauma, and I just feel like no college or employer will want that. 

Any advice for me?   


Thank you so much.",25Aug2019,1

Met her again at a bar and got on well. I asked her for a date later on messenger and got no response again. I'm horrible at taking rejection but I'm playing it cool right now.

887,"So im a 17 year old male, living in canada, and i‚Äôm here asking for any advice on what kind of career path would be the best for me. I consider myself an extrovert, and I feel i could successfully go into any career if i applied myself enough, so my options are wide open. As for what i want to do, i would prefer a job that has me moving around and outside, (not stuck in an office all day) and one that has a decent amount of time off. I also would like an above average pay (wouldn‚Äôt we all). I‚Äôm really unsure about what i should do for the future. Schools starting up again soon and it‚Äôs getting to the point where i have to truly decide what i want to do before i head off to university/college.

888,"A little bit of background(probably some missing details): I'm a little bit over 21 guy, look like I'm 15, don't really have much job experience. I'm very insecure, have anxieites and depression. Whenever I tried to fight my fears and did something, It backfired. I've been getting worse. I rarely leave my house because I'm scared and hate dealing with the outside world. I spend my time playing the PC and watching TV, both of which I'm sick of.

Obviously, this hurts my parents as well, to see their son like this. But I just feel like whenever I try and fight I get dropped back to my knees. And it makes things worse for me.

So, I got that job interview offer from a mentor in an NLP course I used to go to(dropped after 3 classes because it was painfully boring, thus, couldn't concentrate and learned nothing, just wasn't for me). This is in the mediation field, some kind of a revolutionary start-up company according to her.   
Now, my last experience with a job interview in a similar field(perhaps same field, not sure how you might categorize that)was a sales job. I had my mom's BF's nephew vouch for me(despite having zero experience in said field)but the interview went terrible. That entire day was just awful as it is. An hour after I got back home sweating bullets(I also missed the bus back, and it was kinda far from my home), I got a message telling me I didn't get it. But I didn't expect anything else, I'm just not the type for this kind of job at all and with all honesty I think it would have easily broken me. 

I'm just not that type, but my mom is really pressuring me about taking it, practically guilt tripping me. But I get it, my mother's completely changed since her battle against breast cancer. It broke me seeing her like that, too. She's too scared I won't get to grow up and be somebody before she's gone. And I'm terrified of that, too. I don't want her to go, especially not before she gets to be proud of me, not before she gets to babysit her grandchildren, which I don't know if I'll ever be able to give her. But at this point I don't know what I can do about it.  
I know that my interview will probably fluke and it'll put me down even more...not sure how much I could take, I'm scarred enough for this to scare me and make me feel even more of a worthless disappointment.  
 I'm very low on hope, I feel lost and I just can't take this shit anymore. I can't find my place, I can't find anything I like, I suck at everything and I also feel super lonely(never had a girlfriend in my entire life, no experience with girls almost at all). But then again, what sane girl would be with a guy who's incapable of getting his shit together and make something of himself? Oh, and looks like he's been stuck in the puberty stage for the past 6 years. Even my body couldn't figure out what to do. Its as clueless as I am, apparently.  


I don't know where I'm headed, and I'm slowly starting to not care about it. I feel like I'm just waiting to die, waiting for this miserable life I'm leading to end, but still not gone too far enough to take them(something that I highly doubt I'll ever bring myself to do, but then again - I said the same thing about the state I'm currently in years ago). I feel like I was just meant to be that example of what NOT to be for everyone else, like a walking ""don't be that guy"" neon sign for children and teens. And I just can't figure out a way out, if there's even one for a guy like me.  


This was supposed to be just a ""should I go for it or not?"" thread, but I just couldn't. I had to vent. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm writing this thread out of desperation, and I fucking hate it. I don't know who to turn to anymore, therapy is bullshit(I've tried multiple things), I had a 2 hours long discussion with my parents(divorced on bad terms, wa hard bringing them together for that long)and it appears as if they've completely forgotten about it.   


I don't even know why I'm writing this. I expect nothing to come out of this because being the idiot that I am, I'll probably read your advice and still won't do anything to improve my life, because I'm just like that - too much of a coward and a mess to do anything anymore. All I can do is just vent online from half-way across the world(from most of you, at least).",25Aug2019,1

891,"What do you do when your first love who you've broken up with for almost 2 years ago is moving on but you are still stuck?

We still talk but the gab is getting longer and longer in communication. I just got off the phone with him after hearing he's met this girl. I'm happy for him but at the same time it means that we are really over. I have met people myself, but not for relationships but for cuddles because I miss his cuddles.

I still love him and I know I always will. He doesn't know how amazing he is and I hope she sees that too and treats him with everything he deserves.

When I cry about him, it just takes me back to our best moments. Like one time we got our new fridge and the guy who delivered it was not even out the door before we were air humping it. Of course he didn't see us. We were just the funny pair.

Yes I should move on, I know all that stuff but it's hard to move on when he was my first love. Before him, I didn't know I was capable of loving someone until him. Why was I unfortunately lucky to then be unlucky?

I've been working on myself a lot, moved to the big city, went to self building courses. I'm now on antidepressants, which has helped my anxiety issues a lot. But none has made me fall out of love with him. Ugh! It's just difficult to move on when he's the only person I could be completely myself with. It's difficult to move on too when your mother isn't over the whole break up as well and tries to tell you that he's the only one.

Anyway, I think I've written a book here. I just want to vent a bit, get my feelings out. Luckily I've stopped crying, that's a bonus. Thanks for reading and hoopity scoop",25Aug2019,1
892," Long story.

My dad is on his late 50s ( actually married to my mom for over 26 years) and he works in another city which is an 8 hour drive from where we live. He goes there at least once a month.
Last time, I went with him to help him with the work and also to be company.

Once there, we went to one of his associates house. His associate is a short blonde woman in his early 40s and I noticed they had a very close relationship which I thought was a bit weird but not suspicious at all.  We spent in that city about 2 weeks, and the woman pretty much sticked to us everyday when we were working.

The day before we left to our hometown my dad told me that his associate and her daughter were going with us because she has family here and didnt have a car. So they went with us the full 8 hour roadtrip and I met her daughter, who is around my age and I saved her number to make plans in my city  (she was pretty cute btw). We dropped off both girls in their family's house and went back home with my mother and brothers.

The next day my mom tells me that she wants to go to the beach with me and my brother, I thought I could invite the girl (associate's daughter) to come with us. So I told my mom about this girl and thats when she started acting really weird, apparently my dad didnt tell my mom about the whole roadtrip-company thing and my mom started asking me all sorts of questions about my dads associate and what did they do. (I realized that she was suspecting of my dad immediately). A few hours later my mom tells me that she didnt want the girl to come with us, I really didnt care and didnt ask her why, but I knew what was going on.

Next day in the morning I heard my parents arguing and my mom saying: ""I paid for our car and I dont think you should be having other women in there without even telling me"". It was obvious that my mom was jealous but I didnt think my dad was actually cheating, until the next day. My dad had just bought a new phone and I was helping him with all the apps and stuff when suddenly a message pops up and it was from his associate, I clicked the message and saw their chat, there were lots of heart emojis and kind of provoking texts from the woman. It was obvious at this point but I havent told anyone.

What should I do? Should I tell my mom, talk with my dad or just keep quiet?",25Aug2019,2

I work an office job, while it isn‚Äôt physically exhausting, it‚Äôs a mentally and emotionally draining job given the kind of work I do. I‚Äôve been here almost 2 years, the first year was fine. But in total this year I‚Äôve had 52 ‚Äúunplanned‚Äù days of leave (mostly due to constantly being sick) but some have been mental health days where I‚Äôve just broken down and told my boss ‚Äúsorry I can‚Äôt come in‚Äù. 

I had a meeting with my boss last week, and she‚Äôs sympathetic to my situation because she knows I‚Äôm trying. She recently gave me full time because she can‚Äôt afford for me to leave this job (her words).

My boss has suggested I look for another job, which I‚Äôve been trying to do however I‚Äôve had no luck. In the mean time however I really need to get my crap together until I manage to get other work.

895,"having a great friend. We talk every day, play games together, watch videos etc. We even fuck (anal) when he comes to my house. I really like this friendship and he knows I had a crush on him once. I don't know when but this every day messaging and talking thing started pretty early so I'm always worried when he doesn't write or talk to me. I'm getting used to it now, cause I know everyone needs space, but sometimes he gives me the feeling that he doesn't want to meet me or hang out with me. playing online games? alright. watching videos on watchtogether? sure, why not. Just talking over discord? Oh buddy, he even calls me sometimes without me saying something

but he doesn't want to hang out, at my place or somewhere different.
sometimes I think he is using me, but he even bought a game today, Overwatch, so he can play it with me. On the other hand, everytime we fucked doesn't really count for him. He was a virgin before he met me and he still claims he is one. Like, does he think fucking someone anal doesn't ""remove"" the virginity? Or does it have to do something with me? another thing that really made me insecure: he told me at the beginning that he likes me more than just as a friend, that's why I started developing feelings for him. Another buddy from me said he just tried to ""reserve"" me in some way, so I'll be an option B

our friendship is a little bit weird but I don't want to lose him. how can I know that he thinks the same way as I do? I know you won't probably know if he is using me, but I might be the problem and maybe to clingy? I'm confused right now cause it's 01:44 am and there are so many thoughts in my head",25Aug2019,1
896,"I know that sounds like an easy choice, but hear me out. 

I currently work as an analyst, making okay money, and amazing benefits. Really cheap really nice health insurance, free dental and vision, 401k matching up to 4%, paid holidays, Monday to Friday work schedule, and I work from home. I felt like I hit the jackpot with this job. But the actual work I do is very boring. It‚Äôs almost the same thing over and over again for 8 hours a day. 

I was just scrolling on Facebook last week and noticed the animal shelter near me that I support was hiring for a full time administrative position. I just sent off my resume, I honestly thought I was under qualified as they requested a bachelors and I do not have a college degree. (I worked my way up at a bank, which helped further my career into what I do now). They called me for an interview and I was shocked. I went in and they explained the job and honestly, I would love the work. They offered me the job on the spot. Doing something I love + supporting a cause I feel strongly about seems like an immediate yes, right? 

Here‚Äôs the conflict - the pay is a bit more than I make now, but zero benefits. ZERO. No insurance, 401k, holidays off, weekends will be hit and miss due to events that I will have to attend and the fact that they are open on the weekends. Now, the schedule doesn‚Äôt bother me much as I am in my mid 20‚Äôs, no kids, and my boyfriend works as a cook so he works mostly nights and weekends. My friends are telling me to take the non profit job, while my family are basically calling me an idiot for giving up my current job.

897,"Here's a long bit of backstory first. When I was a kid my dad used to fly over to Kauai to do drywall for a construction company over there and would also pick up freight for our neighborhood store twice a week over here on Molokai where we live. He provided great income for our family; we used to subscribe the $125 DirecTV package, go to California for spring break every year, and I had a whole lot of expensive clothes, toys, electronics, etc.

 In August 2011, when I was 9 years old and entering 4th grade, my dad lost his construction job and had to start doing odd jobs. My cousin came over from out of town to stay with us and work with my dad on weekend, and turned my dad on to smoking weed. Then he start growing pakalolo behind the tall grass in the back of our yard, and hanging out at his friends' houses a lot; usually they were just sitting around smoking and talking story, and if I was out with him he'd often stop by and let me hang out over there. I knew he smoked cigarettes all my life, but it took a while for me and my mom to find out about the weed until October 2011, when the pakalolo in our yard got bigger than the tall grass. 

By this point, he would go out on his pickup truck to sell his buds, and had one big shotgun on our back porch to guard the plants. My mother didn't approve of openly keeping guns at our house like that with me around, and she really didn't want someone to snitch on us for drugs and the cops to come arrest my parents and take me away. At first my dad tried to keep her happy by giving her big wads of money from his bud sales, but that only helped for a little while. 

Eventually he was also smoking ice with his friends, and he turned more and more irritable and mood-swingy at home, often fighting and yelling at my mom and throwing/slamming stuff around whenever they'd get into some kinda disagreement. They weren't all bad times though; he still took care of me and felt like the same old dad most of the time. But I knew about the drugs and I could tell something was different about him, I don't really know how to explain it.

In early December 2011, my mom moved into the studio outside her parents house. I lived with her on weekdays and would spend the weekends at our old house with my dad. By then he'd lost his freight delivery job, and our DirecTV service was shut off around this time. In January 2012, my dad was staying at his parents house and in the process of moving his stuff out from our old house. Most of our old stuff was at his house since he didn't let my mom take anything with her, and all of me and my mom's stuff that neither of us claimed, he sold (probably for more drugs). I lost a lot of my old childhood toys, books, and movies that way.

In February 2012, my dad left Molokai and moved to Oahu to spend a year in rehab. He was working and doing a lot better for himself now, but after a while he started calling me less and less, now I'm lucky if he calls every 3 months. And if I call him, he'll talk with me, but he never calls back, even though he always claims he will. He moved to the Big Island with his new girlfriend in May 2015, and they lived on her family lot in a tent, and he was working and such. He hasn't been back to Molokai since he left, and I've seen him in person 6 times since then, last time was the weekend of my 15th birthday in June 2017. He did promise me he'd come home next summer for my high school graduation though, so I'm looking forward to that.

Now here's what I found out. This past May, I called him and he told about his new job getting classic diesel cars and trucks ready to race with new custom parts at his friend's auto shop, and the new house he and his girlfriend had moved into. At first I thought he must be doing awesome, but then I got some more news not too long ago. My older brother (28), went to the Big Island to do solar work, and payed my dad a visit. When he got back home a couple weeks ago he told me and my mom that my dad's new job was for a big-time drug dealer, like as if he owed him his life or something. I really don't know what to think of this; my dad sounds like he's in a lot of real danger, and I don't even know if he'll even be able to make it home for my graduation, or if I even wanna come visit him anymore given the situation. But he's still my dad, and he's always taken great care of me. I hope somehow we can find a way out of this mess. Advice?",25Aug2019,2
