0,"My aunt’s boyfriend, living in another state, recently left his child to live with her. I’ve visited her here and there, over the span of 5 months, each time we’ve advanced to get to know each other slightly more. I spent the weekend at their house, and got to really connect with her. We’ve been through several traumas that seem to parallel each other, so much so that it’s almost fascinating. Since I’ve gotten away from toxicity — a year and a half ago — I haven’t made any close relationships. Ive spent this last year trying to resolve social anxiety, and I’ve looked to break down my emotional detachment and reservedness. Talking with this girl, and being able to reveal so much of myself and feel understood, prompted my feelings for her. I’m under the impression that she likes me as well, she has made an effort to be by my side at any moment I’m over, talking whenever possible, but I’m not going to rule out that she may simply be trying to comfort me. I’m 17 and I’m leaving to attend college in a few months, she’s 15. Im not certain about refraining from trying make something happen, or if Its best for me to keep my biological urges under control. It could just be my wanting of catharsis, or a gratuitous emotional response because I haven’t exposed myself to any similar opportunities. Also, my aunt would definitely discourage a relationship if she found out. I can’t help but feel strongly to proceed, I’ve wanted to develop this sort of connection more than anything. Advice, if possible?",23Jan2019,1
1,"Hi, 

I need advice I’ve been with my bf for more than a year and recently I’ve been having doubts about him doing something behind my back just cause I’ve seen questionable things like dms from girls on Instagram or a chat from fb messenger between him and a female so it really got me wondering and when I would try and ask about it he would get mad we’d argue and it always ends with him saying I don’t trust him . My curiosity was killing me I had to know I figured out his password on his phone and went snooping bad I know . I didn’t find anything suspicious in the dms they were just old friends and nothing in txt messages. But I did find on snap chat he is following a couple of premium accounts ( it’s like porn on snap I guess) I don’t have a prob with him looking but I did see some messages and some saved nudes. I don’t know how to feel and I don’t know if that is something I should be worried about and I don’t know if I should bring it up another thing how will I approach this he will be furious I went thru his phone please help ",23Jan2019,1

3,"Hi all. I [M, 20]  am currently trying to decide between accepting a job offer or to move back to the place i grew up.

The job is really nice and pays very good. I’ve been working there for almost to years now as an aprentice and was recently offered a permanent position. I have until this friday to decide.

The job is located on the other side of the country from where i grew up and i have been struggeling with making any new friends and i have no hobbies which is why i spend all of my free time alone, and it honestly sucks.

The alternative is moving back in with my mom to where i have all of my friends. There are no jobs back home in my field so i would have to find something else to do.

What would you do in my situation and why?
Any feedback would be appriciated :)

Sorry for any spelling mistakes, i’m really sleep deprived.

I don’t mean to be a downer, but I am very fearful of what is or isn’t there after death. Sorry if this post isn’t all that great. I grew up religious but am not so much anymore. I don’t believe or agree with a lot of things from my religion, but it gives me comfort when a happy life after death is promised. Suffering throughout life and ending up with the same nothingness as someone who had an easy life is a concept that makes me so afraid I don’t know what to do. A lot of times people mock religion (rightfully so in many cases) but it gives me sanity when I feel afraid.

10,"English is my second language. This is the first time I write about this, so; rant warning. I will give the nessesary backstory and the effects i have noticed by it to provide a fair basis to give advice.

I and my friends are 22 year old males. I have one friend (Oliver) that I have consistently hung out with since I was 6 years old to this day. The other one(Harry) had family issues that required him to move around the country for a bit, making hanging out difficult in periods, but the last year we have hung out quite a bit(drinking, gaming, eating). The names Oliver and Harry are aliases. There is another guy involved in the bullying part, but I never considered him my friend, so he is not part of the question I need advice for.

We went to a small school, and since first grade we hung out and had fun together every break at school. In wich these two characters became my best friends. Which is what i belive makes this hurt so much. We also hung out in our spare time if our parents allowed it.

From the age of about 11 to 14 they verbally abused me at every break at school, my three closest friends ganged up on me. Pointed out every flaw they could imagine, ridiculed me and my family, made fun of the way I looked, made song dedicated to make me feel bad. They rideculed everything that I said to the point that I litterally did not speak during the breakes, for years. I am a likable person, always have been.

You know when you are rideculed, you usually think about it later and think about some clever way to respond? Or you thing about some thing you could have done or said to come out on top of that situation? They had gotten me so low I didnt think those thoughts, I had no hope to ever come out on top, I didn't even dream about it. Every morning for 2 or 3 years I involentarely violently retched because I didn't want to go to school. Tl;Dr: I was in no position to stand up for myself in any way shape or form. I was young, unexperienced and probably depressed.

I was the good kid with no problems, stable home, good grades, so I did what i could to maintain that image. And to do that I supressed the living shit out of my emotions. I did not tell anyone, and I escaped reality at every possible opportunity by playing videogames and piano (still do)(good thing is that I learned piano well). I faked a smile at every comment my ""friends"" made, while all i wanted to do was cry.

I developed major trust issues and deep going doubts about my inherent value. I could by example not imagine by my wildes imagination that another being could actually enjoy my company, up uintill about 2 months ago (thanks to another set of friends). Next step is to try to imagine someone loving me. I have anxiety that makes studying almost impossible, but I honestly do not know if it is related to bullying or a life of escaping reality through medias on screen. Thankfully I was capable of getting through 1-13th grade without studying, but I'm failing hard at university.

I did not cry during this period or the following 7 years or so. I let one tear come out of my eyes when I first got the message that my sister got cancer and we didnt know if it was treatable or not (she is cancer free now, god bless). But the last 4 months i have cried more than I have done in my entire life because I finally am facing some of my demons.

I have naturally spent most of the following years supressing the memory of this period of my life, uintill the last 14 months or so.

So the bullying stopped once Harry moved to a home in another town. Oliver was left behind with me on school, and he acteually got teased for about a month by the third guy in our group, but he managed to stand up for himself after that month.

Since that time Oliver, Harry and I have had many merry times in our spare time. We do things and talk about things, to anyone but me (it seems) it is a normal friendship. But we have never talked about what happened. I never did tell them how I felt about the bullying and I honestly think that my acting somehow convinced them that I don't have a problem with the period. They share their most intimate secrets with me, but i don't share anything intimate with anyone.

I love Oliver, I have spent my whole life with him and he is a part of 80% of my stories. Harry is a charismatic person who loves to talk about how tough his life has been and every mental problem he has. In my mind he is delutional, always talking about goals everyone but him knows that he will never reach. Or he is a clever devil using other peoples wonder of his hardships and goals to gain social status. I thought I loved Harry too, but the more I think about the trouble he has caused me the more I get biased against him. Somehow I can't feel so betrayed by Oliver, even though I know I should.

If they knew how hard I took this bullying, they would probably think I am pathetic for still having a relationship with them. Am I pathetic for allowing people that cause me so much pain and missery to be a part of my life? Maybe breaking these life long relationship is a path for me to regain the faith in my inherent value. The fact that these relationships live on might convey to my subconcious that they were right, or that I can't rise above the bullying.

I briefly mentioned to Harry last month that I don't trust that he wishes me well, and he mentioned the option of not being friends any more. Something I had already thought of, but I didn't want to do a rash decision. Breaking with Harry would be much much easier than breaking with Oliver. But we are close friends (atleast they think we are) so Oliver would know.

I am so scared to talk to Oliver about this. Maybe I'm scared he doesn't understand, maybe I'm more scared that he might agree.

The thing is that even if we talked it out, I will never trust them. But maybe, in the long run, I learn to trust other people if I leave them. Advice wanted!  
Should I break our life long friendship? Should I try to talk to them about it in an attempt to fix the friendships? And if I am to end the friendships, how should I do it?",23Jan2019,1

13,"I am a 22 year old male. Fresh out of college. Working for a pretty decent company, and actually tasked with giving a presentation for new hires to everyone I work with.

Something like 200 people. I have to wear a full suit and tie even.

Last night, I dreamed I was giving the presentation. Everyone sounded impressed. Everything I was saying was on the money. Then, when I got to my key point, I heard snickering in the crowd.

The snickering turned into slight laughter. Then that grew into loud, uproarious laughter.

I felt air conditioning on my bare butt-cheeks.

I looked down and I was naked. But even worse, not even ""naked"". I was wearing nothing but a red tie and tube socks. You know the ones? The high white socks with red white and blue rings around the top?

My tie hanging over my bare, lily-white belly (not fat, but a rounded belly from snacking too much and never hitting the gym).

Everyone starts snapping cell phone pics as I desperately cover my penis and turn my plump white ""bubble butt"" towards the crowd and try to get out of the room, which is of course locked.

My boss, Ms. Silvan, gets up and says ""Next time I should hire a speaker who's dressed to impress!"" and SPANKS my naked ass as I woke up panting in cold sweats.

I know it's ridiculous, but the dream felt SO freaking real. I cringe when I think of that feeling of the air conditioning on my bare tush. I blush when I imagine looking down at my bare body. And the looks on the laughing faces of everyone in the crowd (especially Courtney in Finance ugh).

I confessed to my friend Ashley who laughed and said ""Well thanks now I'll never see you again without mentally stripping you down to your adorable tube socks. This is the funniest dream I've ever heard.""

Does anyone know why she finds this dream so hilarious? Why tube socks when I wouldn't even have that on for the presentation?? And why does it bother me so much if it's so impossible to happen???",23Jan2019,1

16,"Hey,

I have recently been thinking about moving out of my parents place and I can’t decide if it’s worth it.

Some background info:

I am 22 years old and when I was 18 years old I moved to a different city due to a job. So I lived alone there. (I’m from Germany btw)

While there, I wasn’t too good at taking care of myself. I often ordered food or bought frozen food. In a matter of 1.5 years I gained a TON of weight. Fitness and weight is extremely critical at my job.

Due to some circumstances I moved back to my parents place about 2 years ago and have lived here since.

Now I am thinking of moving to my own place again for the following two reasons:

-	I want to “socialize” more (I’ll elaborate on that point below)
-	get used to living alone again so that I can make sure I don’t fuck it up again. So this would basically be like a test drive.
 

The pro’s for this apartment are that it’s already furnished and literally 1 minute walk by foot from my parents place. So technically, if I ever decided to move back in with my parents again, I could do so within 30 minutes because all I’d have to move out would be some clothes, my computer and some personal stuff. Everything else is supplied there.

Now, what do I mean by socializing more? This apartment is sort of a place aimed for young people and students. I’ve always wanted to have the “student life” where I could meet some new people and be invited to parties etc. Right now, I’m always with the same group of friends and we never do anything or meet new people. And at work, everyone is like 30+ and has a family.

I’d hope to meet new people there that are more social. I always see them in a common room together when I’m walking home from work, partying, drinking, having fun in general. I really want this kind of life.

I earn about 2000€ per month and rent, plus all my bills, food etc. would run me about 1000-1200€ a month.

I’m not sure if it’s worth it. To be honest, the socializing thing is an even bigger reason than the getting used to living alone thing. But I don’t know if that is actually worth spending this much money?

My problem is just that I always feel like that I’m missing out. I’m missing out on experiences and fun and when I’m older I’ll be really frustrated and bitter about my wasted youth.

What do you guys think I should do?



Kind regards",23Jan2019,1

Not sure if I should post this in legalhelp, but trying to figure a few things out. 

Friend of mine has left an abusive relationship where her ex husband (divorced for 3 years) is paying her for child support (still has a lot of backpay) as she’s been out of a job for awhile (he actually always was making more money than her). I’m getting to a point where I’m helping her. Bought her a 2nd hand car (paid it outright) where both of us are on the title. I’m willing to also help her sign a lease even when I’m not going to be living with her to help her due to her bad credit (less security deposit, etc). 
She’s now worried the car with both our names will come up when she applies for foodstamps for her and her son (joint custody with her ex). Same if I would do sign a lease with her. She doesn’t want her ex to get out of paying what he owes her based on me just wanting to help her. She feels it’s better if I sign over the title to her and not sign for her next rental lease because of all of this. We live in Florida.

20,"I made a throwaway because if someone wants to they could identify me from my normal account.

This is going to be long so here's a TLTR:

I want a kid, I found a donor but there's a guy I potentially see a future with. He's half a world away chasing a career and I don't know if I should wait for him or go ahead and fulfill my dream to raise a child.

Okay, so where to begin... Maybe start with drawing the situation and go from there. I am 27 years old and I wanted to become a mother as long as I can remember. It was always something I could see happening as a normal evolution of life and never thought twice about it. Until five years ago. I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. Because I turned out to have a genetic factor and TN cancer almost always returns I decided to skip all the insecurity and have a bilateral mastectomy. I was lucky because it hadn't spread and therefore did not need chemo. A fact about chemo: it can potentially make you infertile.

During this time I was in a relationship with another woman. We were living together and had plans to start a family until the whole BC shit showed up. My choice to have both my breasts removed to be safe is something she couldn't live with and she ended the relationship. I moved out and recovered from my surgeries and break up at home with my mother.

Also at this same time I was in my second year of theaterschool. I had already finished an education on photography and was building my own business. It was going well and I wanted to do something new and exciting, the choice fell on theater and dance. It was tough and the year of surgeries (second school year) I couldn't really do anything but the school was fine with it and we agreed I would just do an extra year. I loved it, I flourished. It helped me through the hardest of times, it also handed me very hard times. I am actually still involved with the school to this day.

Anyway. This is where I met my ex girlfriend and also where I met The Guy. The Guy and I were in the same class. In our first year we didn't really hang out that much but there was always a fascination for each other. We both had our demons to tame. The year after we got closer. He made me feel strong and supported when the big BC had to be fought. We had a connection which only got stronger over time. It was not romantic but a deep level of knowing each other. Like we have known each other for many many many years. He was in a relationship at this point too so even if we wanted to, there was that. I could talk to him about anything and vice versa. This went on for three years. Our bond grew stronger and stronger. After we finished this school he decided to go overseas, all the way to New York where he got accepted in a well known acting school to pursue his dream to become an actor and theater maker. I had another year to go because of the lost second year. After that I decided to apply for another education once again. In the medical field this time. I am currently in my first year and loving it (but DANG it's hard!). He has been back a couple of times and every time I see him it feels like home.

So, to get to it. After the big BC was defeated I decided to freeze eggs just in case I would lose my fertility. I had come close once, whose to say it couldn't happen again? During this time the wish to raise a child only became stronger and even though I was single I felt like I can do this. I have been searching for a donor since the first IVF round to freeze eggs but wasn't able to find anyone. After that I started looking into fostering, but a couple of days ago finally someone said yes. Yes he wants to donate semen and help me have a child. He's willing to sign a donor contract but also open to the child to contact him if they want to. I was over the moon. And then it started nagging me... Is this really what I want? Or do I want it because I thought I can't have it?

For some reason I feel like The Guy and I have unfinished business but I do not know what kind of business. I am now scared that if I go this route I will lose every chance of us ever find out. I love him, I know that. I just don't know if I love him romantically. On the other hand I do potentially see a future together but then again I am afraid I only have some romantic image in my mind that's actually not based on reality. We have never talked about this and I don't want to talk about this over the phone (he won't be back until August). I also don't want to potentially keep him from pursuing his dreams. I feel like I'm on a three way and I need to choose between the life I envisioned as becoming a mom, likely losing The Guy I love deeply and a life where becoming a mother will never be certain but going after him and finding out about our unfinished business.

I feel like this post is all over the place. I hope it somehow makes sense. Please feel free to ask anything. I am looking for a little honest advice.",23Jan2019,1

31,"Im just gonna be completely honest here because I need help. I need a second opinion, a view from an unbiased stranger. This is going to be very unorganized as you could probably guess.

I have never excelled in school. Im smart enough to do so, and generally need to pay minimal attention in class to complete my work, yet my grades have been poor all my life. Its something that makes me very upset because my ability is not holding me back.

Lately however I have felt like shit and my grades have dropped into mostly failing range. My entire family expects me to go to college, and at this point im not sure if id even be accepted to any.

Here is my actual problem though, recently my brain had just felt off. Ive always had some anxiety but never to the point where my I worry about everything, overthink everything, EVERYTHING. My head has also just felt foggy and down. In the past few months Ive had a really bad habit with weed. Im not dependent on it, but very regularly use it, and im starting to realize how much its affecting me.

In the morning, i have recently struggled to get out of bed to go to school. Frequently I would skip days after not doing an assignment to try to do it at home to get it done 'on time' but I never end up doing anything. I have no discipline or motivation nor no how to build it effectively.

My dad divorced my mom a while ago, and their relationship is poor but could be worse. I have little to no relationship with my dad, often we dont speak more than hello to each other. He has some undisclosed mental problem that he has never talked to me about. (It could be nothing, but he is very antisocial, and has said to me that he has ""something wrong with him"")

She isnt very strict at all, and doesnt beat my ass like she should if I get frustrated and raise my voice or something. I feel really bad about treating her like this, but I continue to do it. Its not something she seems to care much about but I worry about our relationship in the future.

Im in high school, dont do shit with my life, so any advice given will probably be taken. Thank you if you bothered to read this. Im just lost and need a point in whatever direction is right. Mabye this is just snowball anxiety and im fine and normal, or mabye my brains just fried.

34,"My girlfriend and I decided to get a puppy back in may of last year. He’s had his fair share of problems already, worms, ear infections, coccidia, and now his bottom tooth is pushing through his gums on the top because of his overbite. We take him to this place that does a monthly plan type thing where you pay a certain amount and you get a couple visits and the vaccinations and other things. They have quoted us 550$ which I thought was ridiculous for one tooth on such a small dog (22 lbs). I told my girlfriend (who does most of the vet visits and scheduling because of our work schedules) that we should look around for other places to see what they quote. We call and go to this other place that said they never charge more than $150 and that is was ridiculous for them to have quoted that much. We went and paid a 40$ consultation fee just for them to tell us that they can’t remove the tooth because of how young he his and they don’t have the equipment to do the surgery so we are better off going to the people who quoted us $550. So here we are going in two weeks to clean the savings. I feel like there has to be a better way and I was hoping somebody on here might have some solid advice or insight. ",23Jan2019,1

My parents were somewhat strict with me as a child as I had some behavioral issues, but as I got older gave me a lot more independence as I was a very rule abiding teen and never got myself into trouble. My younger brother is 18 and a senior in high school. He has always been a bit wild but in the past year it has spiraled out of control. He constantly has all of his friends over, and they regularly drink and do drugs (marijuana, shrooms) in the house. My parents never know who is here as they enter and exit out the back door. After they leave, my brother leaves empty bottles of alcohol all over, as he knows there will be no consequences. He also has started letting them hangout at the house when he’s not even there without asking. Recently he and some friends dumped all of the furniture in my parents storage shed onto the lawn without permission so they could convert it into a second party room. My parents are mad but they don’t do anything to stop it, and whenever they confront him, he swears at them and is incredibly disrespectful, so they back down. My mom is afraid of conflict because her childhood was chaotic and my dad has been mentally checked out for awhile. He thinks it’s better they party here than elsewhere.

47,"Hi, so as the title says, how do you report a potential suicide if you don't know their name and/or address?

My online buddy S just recieved a suicide note over an app from their online friend T. These two are old friends who met in said app. S hasn't been on the app for a while due to personal troubles, so he and T hasn't talked in a while (assumably). So, S guessed that T has been dealing with this on their own.

S doesn't know T's real name or address (like their state or general area) because they never mentioned it. S only knows their username. S thinks that T mentioned that they live somewhere in America, but he can't recheck because they've been through multiple public roleplaying chatrooms and they're all old and deleted. S told our little online friends groupchat over Snapchat about this and we're all freaking out because we have no clue on who T really is and how to report it.

So far T isn't responding after they sent the suicide note. S keeps trying to message them but T isn't answering. We can't really offer any good advice other than to keep messaging because we don't know what to do/know T well. I tried looking up how to report these kind of things, but the results always leads to ""call the police, reach out, etc."" S is blaming himself for not being their and we're assuring him that it's not his fault.

So, again, how do you report a potential suicide if you don't know their name and address? If T ever comes out okay, I can at least have whatever piece of advice I get as future reference. Thank you.",23Jan2019,1
48,"I am a first year college student and come from a wealthy family. My parents (dad in particular) have always almost bragged about how I would not ever have to worry about paying for college. They encouraged me to throw away my state  school scholarships and attend a more expensive out of state school. 

Suddenly out of the blue, my dad informs me that he is tired of paying for me and how I will no longer be receiving any support from the family. I know someone may say I did something but unfortunately I have not as I was informed of this the night after he helped me move into college for second semester(he was ecstatic). 

I have no money saved up and am in the process of trying to get a job ASAP (applied for at least a dozen jobs). Other than this, I have no clue on what I am suppose to do and I am scared because all I want to be able to do is continue learning. 

The fortunate thing from this situation is that he payed for this semester so as of now I am fine, but this summer and the following years, I am on my own.

49,"So this is probably going to sound real messy, but please hang on.

So i started a new job a couple of months ago and after i got settle in and all i started noticing this pretty girl who was working there. She was a couple of years younger than me and absolutely the prettiest girl i have ever met. Since i know most companys dont accept flirts and all i didnt really think about it much, but later on i started feeling like she was checking me out. She was always glancing at me and whenever our eyes met she would keep looking and smile.

Soon after that i finally decided to talk to her, only to find out that she is moving to Australia in a few months. Even though these news really hit me hard, i continued to flirt with and it felt like it was going really well, i mean there were so many signs there. 
Fast forward to a couple of days before the christmas holidays. I finally get the courage to tell how i felt about her, telling her that she is indeed the prettiest girl i have ever met and that i really think that she is brave to move to Australia for over a years time, and that i would have really liked the chance to get to know her better. But instead of the answer i wanted, she told me that she actually liked another guy. I always knew there was a risk that she wouldnt be interested since she was moving away, but the fact that she liked another guy really makes no sence to me. I mean what was all the flirting for if she had feelings for another guy?

But the thing that really confuses me now is that it still feels like she wants my attention or something. She is always around and i can still see her looking over at me, even though i never really meet her eyes the same way anymore, i mean she rejected me? Surely i should respect her feelings and let her have her space at work? I havent really talked to her since i told her how i felt, a couple hello really. And at the end of todays shift i could see her looking over at me, and she looked really sad or something. It made me wonder if she really had feelings for another guy, or if she actually was interested in me but was too shy to admit it and was afraid cause she is moving away. 

I would really appreciate anyones thoughts about it, cause i am confused like hell.

51,"My brother is very morbidly obese. So much so that if he were to fall, he could not get back up without paramedics assistance. He won’t use the scooty cart things because he’s too embarrassed to look like “those people of Walmart”, but he has been insisting on going into stores after not doing so for a long time. What scares us (we’ve talked about it) is that his leg sometimes goes out completely at random, obviously because our bones and joints are not meant to carry that kind of weight. This has happened in public before and two very nice young guys working at the business we were going ran out and were able to help him. But it’s not a likely chance he will always be able to be helped without skilled assistance.

I asked what he would do if he fell. He said he would just roll into a corner out of the way and cover his face so nobody sees him. I’m so torn because I’m so glad to see him getting out and doing things for himself again, but we’re both really afraid of him falling. 

Does anyone have any advice on what can be done here? He has Medicaid and gets SSI and food stamps, but does not work and my sister in law doesn’t make very much so their income is right. 

And I know the obvious answer to many is “lose weight”, but he isn’t eligible nor can he afford bariatric surgery, and working out is very physically difficult as he suffers from severe nausea, panic attacks, and muscle weakness and also afraid of falling.

60," Well this is my first post on reddit, sorry if I make some grammar mistakes. Also I apologize for the mobile format? I don't how that works...

 First I gotta explain how I developed this fear. When I was a little kid, my parents were never home. They only showed up to lunch and to sleep, so I spent most of my days with my sister, who is 8 years older than me. But what happend was that my sister traumatized me by constantly abusing me (such as locking me up in the balcony for some hours, while we lived in the 13th floor and there was a clear view of the ground) until I was 11 or something. My mother treated this abuse as a joke, so my sister never got punished.

 That made me severely cautious and afraid of women, specially teen girls, cause my sister was one. So here I am now, a 17 years old dude that can't even approach girls without some friends nearby, and even if I do, I can't talk without being extremely nervous or rude.

 My parents believe that this is all puberty's fault so they won't take me to a professional psychologist or something and I can't go there by myself cause I'm still a minor. So, how can I get rid of this ""fear"" of women and finally make some female friends?

I'm (29) very worried about my mother. I live over 1,500 miles away from my family so there isn't much I can do, I'm also broke and can't afford to go out and be there for her. I always have to count on my sister (27) to keep me informed and to make sure my family is okay. 

Recently my sister gave me news about my mother needing a White Blood Cell Transfusion, and that mom will be needing them from here on out. My sister is very religious and asks me to keep my mother in my prayers, that she isn't doing so well (same scenario as my grandmother I lost a year and a half). 

Last time I spoke with my mom was on skype a few months ago, she hasn't been looking well and her MS has really gotten a handle on her. She looked like she was near death. My family doesn't live in the greatest environment either, as they're chain smokers and overall just don't practice good health habits.  


A year and a half ago I lost my grandmother, was given 2 months notice (once hospice got involved) about her health. Her health drastically declined within 6 months (before hospice). This was extremely hard on me.  


Now I'm faced with my mother and her declining health. I'm worried about her having to get a white blood cell transfusion. Isn't this a bad sign, am I overreacting? I'm worried I'm going to lose my mother just like I did my grandmother. I haven't seen my family for about 4 years now, I live in a different country and money is currently tight.

I also haven’t heard from my sister in a few days and I’m freaking out about it. I can’t reach my mom either. I’m wondering if she has had the transfusion already, if she is okay.

Recently though, I’ve been much more comfortable in wearing more traditional feminine clothes and whatnot.
Although I still don’t really concern myself with traditional male and feminine gender roles, I’ve found that any reference made towards gender (mine or anyone else’s) makes me weirdly uncomfortable and uneasy. I even actively avoid referring to myself or anyone else as a “girl” or “boy”, despite the fact that I am fully aware and recognize their biological sex.
For the longest I can remember as well I’ve been wishing my body could look less feminine - even going as far to purchase a binder for my chest - and feeling more comfortable using more gender neutral or masculine terms to describe myself.

Even with all this being said, I don’t think I’m exactly trans or anything like that - I don’t feel any more comfortable having people describe me as male instead of female.

70,"Okay, so I don’t really know how to put this into words and it’s all very confusing and embarrassing. Anyway, I’m currently in junior year and I had this purely physical crush on a guy in my class. I don’t know anything about his personality besides a few things and the only reason I “like” him is because I find him attractive. 

Anyway, nothing overly weird happened up until the beginning of this year when someone texted me pretending to be him. I asked him about it and he said it wasn’t him and then promptly threatened this guy and found out his IP address. So I was scared that it was one of my friends who knows about my crush (one is even really close with him) 

The week after that I notice him looking at me a lot but I assumed it was normal because of what happened. I tested my theory of him looking by looking at someone else. 5 seconds later, he looked at the exact same person. I did this another time with the same results. I also saw him pass notes to his friend sitting behind him and it made me very insecure. I told a lot of my friends about his looking and then the next day, he doesn’t look at me once. Not even a quick glance. A couple hours after school is over, he unfollowed my finsta. It was humiliating and I don’t know what I did. 

(It’s important to note that this guy is also an addict so that might explain his shifty behavior. My friend who is close with him also told me he was “bipolar.” (Not actually diagnosed, but more to emphasize his shifty nature))

And then after the weekend (which happens to be today) I check my finsta and I’m not following him. I have no recollection of me unfollowing him so it’s very strange (especially after the person  texted me pretended to be him) I checked my “likes” and the only photo I liked of his wasn’t in there.

I’m not the most popular student but I do have a good number of friends from all groups so it’s not like bullying is an issue for me. 

I don’t know what to do and it’s absolutely humiliating. I didn’t think a physical crush would cause all this drama and I really don’t want to see him in class tomorrow. I don’t even like him anymore after all this. What do you think? ",23Jan2019,1
71,"So im 15, and while this may seem like a moody teenager post, i asure you its not. For the past few years, my mother (dad does not fall into this category and is fine btw) has been really toxic in so many ways. She constantly puts me down and tries to humiliate me for my school results, hobbies, and other unecessary things. She is a really negative figure in my like, and partnered with how insecure i was about my body, a few years ago i was on the board of suicide. Luckily i got over my body issues by taking up weightlifting, but she is even more negative now. She even admits to making our house boring so i study more. Im not allowed to play video games, or watch tv, or use the computer for more than 1 hour, and if i do, i get force to do an extra of 2 hours of clarinet practice. I try to avoid staying in the house as much as possible, and i try to pretty much stay in my room all day doing nothing. She constantly calls me an idiot, loser, failure, that im lazy, arrogent, rude  and she does the same to my friends. Shes always talking about how they are stupid and i will never succeed in anything, even though my friends are good people. i How do i just avoid my mum.",23Jan2019,1
72,"A friend of mine, I'll name them Kia for this story. Kia had her phone recently taken away because they walked out of the classroom. and as far as i've been told, It was because she had to use the bathroom. After her parents looked through her phone they realized she had a boyfriend of whom she was forced to break up with as well. After this, the last message she sent before her mom broke her phone with a hammer was a photo she sent a photo of cuts close to her wrist. I came to school and saw her and I usually post my repaired Phones and sell the broken ones I repair for sell at a price around 100$ - 120$ or sometimes lower if I want to sell it quickly. Kia is aware I do this and pretty much begged me for an iPhone which I declined several times because I wanted to use the sold iPhone she wants from me to buy a PlayStation 4. To shorten the story it's turned in her trying to do several deeds for me and make me happy to give her one by giving me hugs saying she loves me and what not and trying to bargain her broken devices for one of my Iphones. She told me earlier today at school she's going to kill herself if I don't give her the phone which I shrugged off as some edgy joke but I was worried in the back of my head. Her nudes were leaked by her ex and perhaps it was inappropriate of me to tell her she should of probably stayed away from social media because of this.  


What should I do? I don't wanna give her my iPhone because i ""need"" the money and to even get her to stop bothering me I said yes and swore to god but I haven't  made up my mind yet and I'm 'lying' I guess.",23Jan2019,1

80,"I'll make this story as short and sweet as possible.

My best friend suffers from manic depression. I've accepted and adapted to their ways over the years - understanding things that bother them, how to talk to them during episodes, accepting their coping methods. We would stop talking for sometimes two or so weeks at a time while they worked out their emotions. I understood, having my own extreme anxieties that they in turn would also stand by me during panic attacks and my bouts of depression.

We have a long distance friendship; only see each other once a year. The rest of our time spent together is mainly online, watching streams or playing games. This year however I was going to have the means to pay them an extra visit, and we made some pretty huge plans for my 5 day trip.

They also had a long family vacation planned. I knew that talking to them during this time wasn't going to be very easy, and afterwards they would most likely cut themselves off again as they recovered from being away from home so long, having to ""give good face"" for extended periods - stuff like that. And this all played true. I did my usual thing for this situation,  spreading out text messages every few days to let them know I was still here and wasn't leaving, that they are amazing, and I appreciate them so much, and look forward to ""spending time"" with them.

Days became weeks, which was expected. Those weeks becoming months, however, was not. I finally broke my own rule and called (which they aren't fond of phone calls) and got what I thought was just instantly voicemailed. By the end of that day and a few more attempts later, I realized.... they blocked my phone number. And to add more insult to injury, I began to realize they blocked me from all social media outlets, and left our private chat server.

I was cut off. 

I inquired with other mutual friends, who said that they had not blocked them from anything but  was ignoring their messages to them. I waited, thinking they would resurface any day, but I couldnt let go of them BLOCKING me. I replayed all our last messages and conversations in my head, but i couldn't think of anything I had did wrong. I began to worry this was the road to ruin, and worried that they were hurting and in despair, and this was the only thing they knew to do. I had my own panic attacks worrying what they might do to themselves, or, dreading them never coming back. 

We sent them a Christmas card, signed from not just me but friends we shared. My significant other called them at work before the holiday and actually got to speak to them - they promised to call after work that day and never did.

My trip should have happened already. Best laid plans gone to waste, as I spent my vacation at home, crying that my best friend.. was gone.

I don't know what to do anymore. I am too afraid to call them at work - fearing further rejection I suppose. I want to know so desperately that they're okay, and know their reasons for this happening. On the flipside, I am terribly worried they are suffering more than I've ever experienced them to before and I shouldn't give up on reaching out - though my only methods are snail mail and contacting them at their place of business (which they own btw).

So the question is ultimately - do I give up trying to reassure them that our friendship is intact, or do I keep reaching out through the small means I have (work number or snail mail, or outside help) so they know I am here for them, and they are so deeply important to me?

When you are at your lowest, do you want people to keep trying, even if you have done the extreme, and ignored them so completely?

I miss my best friend. There are so many cracks and holes that they filled. I literally waited my whole life for a friend like them - the thought that they may have erased me from their life and I will never know why is truly breaking me.

86,"I have a friend that has supposedly liked me the past few months. We had been friends before that time. A few days after I found out I told him I wanted to send him something and offered to airdrop it, but he insisted on giving his phone number. I wasn't complaining at all, so I looked at him waiting for him to give me his number. He looked down at the ground, his face got kinda red and he started telling me. I couldn't hear so I just told him to put his number in my phone. I trusted him at this point as a friend. He is very popular ( and attractive) and I had heard he only exchanged phone numbers with people he was interested in. I just went with it. We didn't text too much, I knew he was busy and we kept stuff pretty work-related. Then one night he hadn't responded for 2 days... I checked the text conversation and it showed that he was typing. This was around 12 am. , which was strange. This continued for about 5 minutes but he never sent anything. By this time, I was interested in him and when we saw each other we would flirt. He wasn't the Casanova type he was rumored to be and in person, not much had changed.... until recently. He started acting more vulnerable and more annoyed around me specifically. He will go out of his way to hold the door and talk to me but he always looks sad or annoyed and doesn't accept my thanks. He texted me again recently, a conversation in which he said ""thank you"" 3 times for no reason. He was normal in person the next day,  but I still thought it was strange. On Sunday, I texted him on a work assignment and he hasn't gotten back to me, let alone checked the message and it is now Tuesday.

88,"So I’m a woman who recently started dating this guy, it’s been about 2 months or so. Everything has been going fantastically well until this week - we have lots of chemistry, attraction, things in common, etc. we really like each other. I’m starting to get “good morning beautiful” texts. It’s great.

Then on Saturday, my grandfather passed and I was a mess. My guy invited me over, we had a good time, but regrettably. I drank too much and accidentally broke an hourglass that was his sister’s birthday present to him. I apologized profusely, searched for the exact one his sister had given him, found it, and had it overnighted it to him, so he had it Monday (yesterday). He was grateful for that, although he seemed a little peeved still. 

Then, as I was leaving work yesterday, a friend of mine asked me for help. I hadn’t spoken to her in months, but apparently she had filed a restraining order against her ex husband for her and her son’s safety. Her ex communicated to her through a mutual friend’s Facebook account threatening to come and take his son, she couldn’t keep his son, etc. she didn’t think anything would actually happen and that this was his usual kind of attention seeking drama, but asked if I would hang out with her after work, just to have company and take her mind off things. 

Well unfortunately, the dude showed up like he had said he would, even though my friend had no idea he would actually follow through and had actually counted it. She underestimated him. We’re outside on the front porch, the baby is outside with us playing with his toys. We hear him yelling, so my friend picks up her baby and walks inside.  I stand in front of the door as he approaches. An extended verbal argument ensued between he and I while my friend called the police. Once he realized she had called 911, he became enraged, grabbed me, and threw me aside so as to get to his ex and his son in her arms. I got up from the ground and went at him to stop him, as he was violently trying to grab the baby. He and I got into a fist fight, and I endured quite a few punches to the face. Just as our fight was coming to a peak, the police showed up. 

They arrested him for violating his probation and the restraining order, took statements from us, but I decided not to do anything or press charges as I felt fine and he was going to jail, no blood or anything. It was only later when I realized I had serious bruises on my cheeks and felt like I had kind of a headache. I found out I have a mild concussion. 

Meanwhile in the midst of this, maybe arresting to the fact that I had a concussion and was in shock, i caked my guy to tell him what had just happened, and apparently I wasn’t making much sense and just being completely unlike myself. He seemed weirded out and didn’t know what to say. I know the concussion + adrenaline + shock didn’t help my case, but if I were him, I’d be worried of this kind of thing happening a lot or just wondering what this means about this person. 

I asked to talk to him tonight when he gets a chance, now that I’m not adrenaline-shock-panic-concussion infused of a thought. I don’t know how to explain to him that this was totally bizarre and has never happened to me before. How can he believe this? Like he knows it’s been the worst week of my life losing my grandfather so maybe that set me in a weird way, but honestly I don’t know how to make him trust me now. I have always told him the truth, all the way to this incident, but maybe I shouldn’t have? I don’t know. I just don’t want to lose him over bad timing or confusion. ",23Jan2019,1
89,"My neighbors behind my home have four pitbulls which they left out in extreme heat all summer, in the sun, no water. In winter they're often left out in the rain. They're normally kept in a 6x6 pen with no roof or shelter. They look fairly healthy but are left to the elements, kept in cages, chained to the tree, etc. One has (had?) An open wound on its side. Every so often the dogs barking with rouse the tenants who either knock on the window to silence them (doesn't work) or will sometimes come out to yell at or hit the dogs, sometimes accompanied by yelping.

We moved here in Aug. I called animal control in September due to the constant (literally constant!) barking and was told they already had an open case from before we moved on neglect calls. Nothing was done. Called the sherrif in October, they patched me to animal control. At least one a month I've called both the sherrif and animal control. Some point in December AC told me they sent someone to look at the dogs but they couldn't reach anyone at home and the dogs were too human aggressive to go near.

There is someone there and awake at almost all hours. I've heard people awake and talking out there at 5am. 

Earlier this month I booked a stay at a hotel just to get a full night's rest as I haven't been able to sleep more than 6 hours *at best* since being here. Ear plugs don't work. If I want to sleep I have to medicate heavily. Our exterior wall is glass and right by their property. 

My SO bought a dog bark high frequency device and after a month of use it hasn't seemed to have any effect at all. Both he and I work from home at this point and can't get anything done with the sharp, loud, constant barking.

AC finally told me to take the family to court and gave me a referral number. I really don't want to have to take them to court but will if needed. It will probably be a long and slow process, as it has been already. Is there anything else I can do at all? I'm terrified of talking to them (me: small female, them: huge guys who literally beat their dogs).

95,"This is a throw away account due to the nature of the subject. 

My oldest son sexual abused my youngest son. There was 12 years age difference. So when this was discovered the oldest was removed from the home and was prosecuted. He subsequently served time and went through intense counseling. 

The youngest child went through counseling as well. 

It has been 5 years and I have not allowed for there to be any contact between them. I never want the youngest to feel insecure or uncomfortable.  However, he has never said anything regarding the abuse.... even during counseling. 

I always wanted him to make the decision to have or not have a relationship with his oldest brother when he gets older. I never wanted to take his power. 

I am just wondering now if I should have put all of us in family counseling. I am wrong to completely keep him out of his life? I am worried that if he doesn’t remember the abuse he won’t understand why I kept his brother away. Or my other fear is when he finally sees him when he’s older the memory of the abuse will come back all the sudden and traumatize him. 

Thank you for reading. I know this is long. I have so much intrapersonal conflict trying to do what’s best for all my kids. I overthink the situation and I’m just never at peace. I believe in forgiveness but also believe that it’s not my place to forgive because I was not the one harmed.

 I am absolutely heartbroken. The story here is relevant so please read if you are going to offer any suggestions as to how to get over this. Me and my boyfriend have been together for only a year but when its true love you know. I was the happiest I had ever been. My other long term relationship I always knew was going to end, so when it did I wasn’t too bummed out. I got together with my boyfriend in January of 2018, in fact it was on NYE that he told me he loved me. We got together officially the end of January and our relationship was like any other young love. It was quick to spark but the spark never went out. I felt blessed almost, like I had found the one and I knew it in the bottom of my heart he was the one for me. It got even more serious when he started telling me about his life and his family. He came from Costa Rica when he was a baby and moved to the states, then moved back to CR for a few years and came back again when he was 16, so I met him at 17 appox 2 years after. We worked together so I knew him a year before we got together, he slowly became my best friend because we spent every night together closing our store. He had problems with his mom and one night he accidentally broke curfew and she kicked him out. He went back got all of his stuff and moved in with me. This happened in July and since then he had bonded with my family in unexplainable ways, my mom saw him as a son and my sisters as a brother. Seeing how well he gelled with my family made my heart race, I was so excited I found this love so young. I can live so much of my life happy next to this person. He lived in my room in my house for a few months, and during this time he was looking for an apartment because living with me wasn’t crazy ideal in my bedroom. Although my parents really didn’t mind, when i say they loved him I really mean that. He finally found a place 5 mns from where we work and 5 mns from my house which was awesome. He could walk to basically anywhere and he wasn’t too far and didn’t have to find new jobs. He ended up moving into his place in September so he was with me for 3 months, and during that time we rarely fought. If we argued, we would always sit down and talk it out. I loved him and I never wanted him to feel like he wasn’t being heard. He always listened to me. He wasn’t big on buying me stuff, he did what he could since I knew he had to save for rent. I want to make this clear I never pressured him to buy anything, I worked a lot but I lived at home so I didn’t mind spending for him and I. It was never expected of him to buy me anything ever. Due to this we really never went out on dates, but we spent every day together. By every day I mean maybe once a month we would sleep alone. We loved being together so much, I could feel it that I was his happiness just as he was mine. Was it wrong to put everything into one person? Probably. It came time he wanted to buy me a promise ring. We went to the mall cause he wanted me to pick one out and he got me one and I got him one. My ring came and he suddenly wanted to save it for our anniversary, and wanted me to wear it around my neck because he was scared of pressure (perfectly fine, I didn’t want to rush but I loved the symbolism). He has a lot of family and one of his sisters lives out of state. One day he comes up to me and he wants my help planning a trip to see her. I help him cover his shifts for work and he buys a bus ticket and leaves for the weekend. We don’t keep in contact as much since he is spending time with family and thats understandable. I wasn’t clingy even though during those days I missed him LOL. He is supposed to come back on Friday because he works at night so he would have come back on an 11:00 bus, and I dont get a text from him. I call him at 10am and then again at 11, he doesn’t answer and I assume he had missed the bus. Im annoyed because im helping him financially and he cant be responsible for work but I dont really make that known at this point. He texts me back at 2:30pm saying he wants to stay another day and he is going to find coverage, which is fine. This is when it gets really weird. I start to get upset just cause he had been ignoring me that day when I was trying to help, and I felt I made that too known to him so I apologized and he hits me with some bullshit. He tells me its fine I feel that way but it doesn’t matter. I get really confused and I text him to explain and he tells me its science and I wouldn’t understand. I call him and he seems really really high. He smokes weed regularly but I never had a problem with that. The first thing he says to me on the phone after I ask if he is okay is “we didn’t sleep together”. Now I wonder why I would even think that because thats something I would have never pegged him for- a cheater. I finally pull it out of him that he had made out with his sisters roommate and they slept in the same bed- I was heartbroken. I told him to get on a train and come home that night but he wouldn’t do it, he said he needed to wait until the morning. So I told him to get on the earliest one in the morning and he did. I picked him up from the train station and he hugged me but I was clearly upset, and most of the train ride was silence. He seemed completely out of it, and later had admitted he was high on ecstasy. He told me he was looking for a deeper connection and found it at his sisters house and I just didn’t know what to say. I asked him if he regretted it and he said no. I asked him if he loved me and he said yes. Then I asked him if he wanted me to trust him and he said I shouldnt. Why didn’t he want to earn back my trust? He sleeps over at my place that night, we hook up because at that point he was being a little more kind about it. He had went to work that night and came back and I was drinking and so I let him talk me down and half apologize. I dont know why I just let it go but I wasn’t angry about it. The next day he wakes up and gets ready for work at his other job and I drop him off. I told him he needs to think about how he wants to earn back my trust and he says okay and that he loves me. I pick him up 8 hours later and he is livid and telling me that him and I are done and he is moving to his sisters place. I was in absolute shock. We had been talking about mending this hurt and here he is wanting to leave. I take him back to his apartment to talk him down but he keeps telling me that the environment is toxic and he wont stay in my house because he suddenly hates my family (this happened overnight, there was no fight). I end up taking him to a hotel because he convinced himself his sister could hear him through the phone and she was controlling his thoughts, and he wouldn’t stay in a place he was familiar with because he would freak out and talk to himself. I took him to a local hotel and he made me sleep naked with the phone off because he wanted to be clean. We woke up and I took him to the train station with NOTHING- he refused to take his belongings because he believed they were dirty. He took a few changes of underwear and socks and a shirt and his important papers. I get on the train with him extremely upset, I didn’t understand this choice but I wanted to support him. He said he was running away from guilt because he felt I gave him so much and he didn’t deserve it. It is true I was giving him a life but I want to make it clear I NEVER held that over him, I loved him and I didn’t want to do that to him. We get to his sisters apartment and I meet the girl he cheated with, and I just ask her to keep him safe. I tell his sister that too. I have a breakdown because he is leaving his phone and apartment keys with me because its toxic. He says his energy with me is toxic but he loves me because I am pure he just hates who he is around me, which I dont understand. I Told him he had unconditional love, what more did he want. I let him leave and I leave and go back home. I am in pain and shock having to explain this to my family who are just as upset. My mother grieved a child. She told me it felt like he had died. I get in contact with his other sister who was his acting mother figure and her husband who are on their honeymoon and they are both destroyed. They are just as upset he left because they lived local as well. But they talk more to his family members and kept me updated. Its Wednesday (i brought him to his sisters Monday) night and I hadn’t heard anything about him. His sister he now lived with told me he was acting up and her and her roommate ended up leaving the apartment overnight and left him alone, they came back and he was gone. So now he is missing with no phone and oh I didn’t mention he had NO money. I gave him 300 dollars when I left him in at his sisters to help him get started and that was it. I get a call from someone I work with saying that he came back into the store. My heart leaps thinking he came back and came to his senses and he wasn’t going to run away. I get there and he is a cold person, like I had never seen before. He wont let me touch him and his eyes are dark. He tells me I lied to him about not telling him he was terrible, and that my voice was in his head the whole time. He was so angry at me and I couldn’t calm him down. I started crying and he was yelling at me, provoking me and telling me to take my own life. I felt my heart breaking inside my chest. He tells me he came back to get his things and that he hated that he had to see me, so I had to get in a car with him. Before we got in he tried to pull the promise ring off my neck he said he wanted to sell it, he pushed me when I refused. I got in the car with him and took him to my house to get the keys to his apartment and his phone. I run inside and get his phone and I call his brother in law, sobbing about what he said to me and seeing if he could try to calm my boyfriend down. He manages to calm down a little, but he was really cynical and cold with me. He would say something hurtful and laugh, look at me like he didn’t know me. I take him to his apartment and he is mocking me, telling me terrible things that make me nauseous. I took the plastic clock off of his wall and throw it at him, but it didn’t hit him and I wish it did. This person in front of me was NOT him. After this I felt like I was really going to shut down. Having a loved one spiritually die in front of you then their body continue to verbally abuse you is something I dont think most people have experience with. I call my friend who waits for me outside the store I work at (since my coworkers were there and saw us yelling). She took me to her house and from there my mom takes me to the hospital where im kept for 2 days because of suicidal thoughts. Granted the only reason I was there is because of what he said to me. My therapist there explained to me he was in a drug induced psychosis meaning he was having a psychotic breakdown and in the process he wasn’t himself. I used this as an excuse to boost myself back up- that wasn’t him. My mom ended up contacting his brother in law telling him what happened. He wished me well and all that BS. I saw these people as family but I felt so alone. When I got home I kept convincing myself it was his mental state and it wasn’t him. I called him today and he seemed better but he was in no way apologetic and does not seem to have any interest in me. I am so so so torn over this. I still love him, how can I heal from this. 

I have school. I cant focus on any of my assignments and my winter sessions is almost up. My whole world feels like it collapsed and I cant convince myself this won't be forever. I know I can never be with him again but honestly if he came to me tomorrow and said he wanted me I would take him back. I am so stupid and in love, please help. ",23Jan2019,1
102,"
A little backstory. I had some issues when I was 12 or 13 and had a lot of lower abdominal pain, and testicular pain when I had to go to the bathroom. This went on for a good while, and I honestly just thought it was a part of puberty until I asked my friends ""Don't you hate when you have to shit so bad your balls hurt?"" and they're like ""the fuck are you saying right now...?""  I went to the doctor and I guess they considered it a torsion or somethin' and I had surgery on both of the boys.


**Fast forward to now!**
Well, I'm 22 and I've had pretty bad anxiety/depression and fatigue for about 4 years. I developed gynecomastia over the 2 years after my surgery. I have almost no sex drive, maybe wanting to have sex twice a month. I've had some encounters where I don't want to have sex for about 6 weeks (I am not asexual by preference at all, just no ambition). Even when I do have sex I don't seem to ejaculate a lot, I have no idea how to quantify that though. I started going to the gym back in Dec of 2015 and lost a lot of weight from about 300 pounds down to 205 now. I have okay muscularity but I have to eat an extremely small diet (under 1600 net calories or I won't love weight) to cut. And the latest and WORST symptom started about 3 months ago. Erectile dysfunction has chosen that I only get to have my monthly sex for about 6 minutes before I have to focus like my dick is the goddamn bar exam just to pack a chub.

I got my testosterone processed back in October and it showed 448ng/dl total test, but my online results don't display free test, unfortunately. I got it retested last week and I now have 504ng/dl total test, so I can proudly say I'm on par with the average 71-year-old instead of 79.

I went to a urologist recently to get a lump checked, which thankfully was not cancer. I mentioned low testosterone while I was there and he was an old foreign dude that was practically yelling as he spoke. 

He tells me **""448 IS FINE, WHY DOES MAN UNDER 25 EVEN GET TESTOSTERONE CHECK? YOU DONT GET CHECK, YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM. YOU GET CHECK, IT MAKE YOU WORRY""**  and left the room.

So, I'm lookin' for a new urologist.

My basic dilemma here is that I worry that at this age if my testosterone falls in the textbook ""normal"" range, even if it's very low for my age, and I'm having very severe symptoms related to low testosterone, I still feel like I seem like an idiot trying to get legal steroids. My PCP is not very knowledgable on these issues and hasn't been much help outside of ordering my blood tests, and gave me no information on TRT even when I asked about it doing my own research. These issues are the only health-related issues I have. I had a full metabolic panel, lipid panel, vitamin testing, everything... I have no idea how to be taken seriously with this issue.

TL;DR: 22 and have many symptoms attributed to low T, and even have had blood tests showing low T for age range. My doctors aren't taking this seriously and these issues are running my life.",23Jan2019,1
103,"We live in the US in Texas, specifically the DFW area. Hi there, so a friend of mine as gotten herself in a real messed up situation. We will call her ""Sarah."" Sarah gets off work at 9 and we plan on going to the police station but need some legal advice as to how this will affect her in regards to her getting in trouble.

Back Story: So Sarah and I are 18. We've joked around about being poor college kids and finding a ""sugar daddy"" I always thought it was all fun and playful until my friend recently told me she's been seeing older men on dates and such. I didn't care at all until a week ago she called to say she would be sharing her location with me through our iPhones because she was going to meet up with some potential sugar daddy at a nearby park. I told her this was not a smart idea but could not stop her so instead insisted on details and location/ time of everything.

Sarah met some woman on tinder named ""eve,"" she was just some pretty girl that Sarah wanted to be friends with. Eve tells Sarah about a sugar daddy she has. Eve then tells Sarah that her sugar daddy is interested in her and that if Sarah went and gave this guy a blow job she would give her some money because she didn't feel like doing it herself.

My friend agrees and meets with said guy at the park like mentioned earlier. She gives him head they hang out for a while the she leaves. A few days later ""eve"" -which I believe isn't a girl at all but is actually this guy- tells her that he wants to see her again. Sarah says she's not interested because she was never paid and The Whole situation seems off. Eve tells her that this time she will go with her but my friend declines again. At this point eve tells her that the ""sugar daddy"" recorded her in the car giving head and that if she doesn't come again he will post it on social media and porn pages. At this point Sarah is freaking out so I tell her to tell them that she is actually under age and of he does that he will face child pornography charges. Eve tells my friend how mad this guy is and that they don't believe her, they also say they've looked her up and know she's been lying. -she lied about where she lived and her name- . They continue to black mail her and tell her how mad this guys is and threaten to ruin her life by sending this out.

We don't know if eve is even real or if there is an actual video. I told her she should press charges and that this guy seems dangerous. She is afraid because eve saying she will pay her that shell just be seen as a prostitute. what can/ should she do ?

TL;DR My friend met with some ""sugar daddy"" that she heard of through a girl she met on tinder. The girl told her it was her sugar daddy and shed pay her to go give him a blow job because she didn't want to. My friend goes and never gets paid. Days later they are saying she has to do it again or they will post a video that was secretly recorded on social media/ porn sites.",23Jan2019,1
104,"I quit my last job because i was afraid. People has so much expectations. My family, my parents, my team managers, they're all expecting i'd be doing great. Maybe i am. Maybe that's what people see but, deep inside me i'm so scared. I don't know what i'm doing. I blamed other people for my mistakes because i can't accept that i'm at fault. I want to grow. I want to be promoted but when the opportunity is in front of me, when i can just grab it and it'll be mine i can't help but pull myself back. I don't understand myself. I know my biggest enemy is myself. People will pull you down i know but, there are those who's willing to help me all the way. It's just me that's the problem. I'm afraid of rejection. I'm afraid of being judged. I'm afraid of myself. I feel lost. I can't make decisions. I wake up everyday without a plan, not knowing what i want. Or maybe i know what i want, i know what i need to do but my body and my mind won't let me chose, they won't let me move. I want to do something else, i don't know what it is.

I have a pretty mobile and isolated lifestyle. The jobs are seasonal and rural, the schooling is demanding, and the work is solitary. I haven't lived in one place for more than 4 months since I was 18/19. I need a lot of social and novel stimulus to be happy, and I make solid friends easily. But, I can't get beer with the boys from hundreds of miles away or take up karate in sheephumpistan, montana.

The years of isolation are taking toll, compounded by losing my faith, being ostracized by my church due to rumormongering,  several close family deaths, and watching my elderly parents spiral into disability and dementia. Salt in my increasingly confrontational behaviour and voi la

This has lead to me doing some reckless, gross shit to fill the void, but we'll focus on the hookups. Frankly, the only positive contact I have with women is one off hookups with strangers and the rare coworker, and it hasn't left me with a great attitude towards women in general. I digress. I think it's lead to a worse case of mouth herpes than the rare canker sores I got as a little kid. Not much I can do to give people a heads up, I've tried. This is not good, and I need to get it under control. Again, I digress. I want to turn my life around before something worse happens.

I'd genuinely rather blow my brains out (itself a growing problem) than fool around with strangers again, but I have no idea how to interact with women non sexually. I can seduce, I can pick up on interest, but how the hell do you date? I don't even want to have sex again until I'm serious about someone and have this herpes shit under control. But I've never met a woman in my adult life who wasn't a cheater or after a one time thing. I know they exist, but whaddya do? Most women I meet just want to screw without worrying about your name.

The suicide option never appealed because I was afraid of dying, but now...like you can't outrun it and it'd make the pain stop, but I don't want these thoughts. It's like a demon screaming at me

How do I human? I don't even recognize the guy I am today, frankly he's kinda scary.

&amp;#x200B;

So...last week, I started my final semester of undergrad. 

&amp;#x200B;

The very first day of a \[MWF\] Organic II chemistry class, I was late to class because I had been talking with a professor from my previous biology class on getting me off the waitlist. That Monday, my Organic teacher made us get the contact info of the person sitting next to us so we could have a friend in the class. 

&amp;#x200B;

That Wednesday (two days later), I got into my required class, and my biology teacher made the decision to move us to the same room where my organic chemistry lecture was also held the very next period. On that day, I had arrived extra early and got a good (left-handed) seat near the front, so I could sit in the same chair for both of my classes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, when my biology class ended and my organic chemistry class began, a girl came up to me and said ""Excuse me, are you in this class, or were you part of the previous class?"" I told her that I attended both of them. She said ""Oh,"" clearly annoyed, and sat next to me. She deliberately tried to talk to the person sitting on the other side of me, and I assumed that they had been acquainted on the first day of chemistry class, and the girl who approached me had been sitting where I was.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday, I didn't move and sat in the same chair both periods. The girl who had came up to me on Wednesday was nowhere to be seen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, (Tuesday), I was in the Organic lab class associated with the lecture, when the girl comes up to me again. She said, ""Hi, is your name Jean?"" I replied yes, and the very next thing she says is ""So...last class you took my seat.""

&amp;#x200B;

I knew immediately what she was talking about and told her that the reason why I sat there was because it was the only left handed seat at the front of the class. And she replied that that was why she liked it too. We talked for a little while and I found out that she had sat in that exact same seat during the previous semester for Organic 1. She said that she hated confrontation, but I told her it wasn't I big deal and I would move.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am thinking about it several hours later, this isn't high school, and we don't have assigned seating. Even though I'm annoyed now, in hindsight it is kind of funny that this person learned my name just so she could tell me off for taking her chair. ",23Jan2019,1

It is so bad that she doesn't even eat but she still throws up at the end of the day, and basically just throws up straight acid that is burning her throat and insides. I have no idea what to do, along with my other friends. She has been admitted to the hospital but refuses to change. Her parents are also aware, due to the fact that they sent her to the hospital, but are otherwise completely ignoring the problem. When I or my other friends try to make her eat, she does not listen. The only person who she will listen to is a close guy friend of mine, who I have tried to convince to help her, but he instead encourages her bad behavior because he does not want to upset her. He is very in love with her and would do anything to make her happy, even if it is slowly destroying her. I have thought about contacting the teachers in the school, but her parents already know and the most the teachers can do is alert the parents. We are trying to figure out why she is doing this, and one of the main reasons is because she is very into Korean pop music, and the idols are so skinny they border on anorexic.

134,"My brother and I recently moved to a new school, from a different state. I am a freshman and he is a junior. I am more socially outgoing, and I like to make people laugh. He is kinda shy and socially awkward. At lunch, we sit together, because he doesn’t have any friends. I want to be sitting with my friends, but if I do, he would be all alone. He just doesn’t care what people think about him, which is good for most people. But he wears the same general clothes everyday, and eats his entire lunch in 4th period. Also, since he is a junior in a new school, he is in some freshman classes because he didn’t take them at his old school. This is random and gross, but sometimes he farts to get me and a kid who sometimes sits with us to laugh. But neither of us like it, as he does it in front of people. Also, he literally makes no social interactions with girls. Like none, he is 17 and he has never gotten a girls phone number. I am honestly concerned that he will be a virgin forever. He also doesn’t have very good hygine, he literally never washes his hands, and he has acne (I do too, but not as bad).

My brother and I moved to a new school, he is a junior and I am a freshman. He had no friends, and is a little socially awkard.

I recently got out of rehab(about 6 months ago) and they say, change people, places and things. So I moved in with my uncle who is a real estate mogul(been a millionaire since he was 25) and he’s trying to help me to “adult” and become a man. So anyway recently he’s made it his goal to get me laid and I feel that’s weird in itself, but that’s another topic for another time. So he’s on Bumble/tinder whatever and he met this woman who is a nympomaniac and he tells me “hey I think I can get this chick to screw you” fast forward a bit of time, he sends me this screenshot saying she would bang him then bang me(with her agreeing).

(Me:M20) (Her:F20) 
Idk where to begin, I guess by saying we weren’t ever in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. So I guess this could be a friend zoned situation. But me and her were like the closest of friends for like 3 to 4 years. Eventually I gained feelings for her. That led me to be in the position where I was stuck because I knew she didn’t feel the same back. So I was stuck for a good while. Eventually I couldn’t take it anymore and I ended up telling her. So after that we hung out a little bit and talked. The way she made it seem like nothing ever happened is crazy. But after a little bit we just never ever talked again between them 5/6 years. It’s not like she completely blocked me out her life like she still liked my pictures and stuff on social media. But between them years I’m not gonna say I thought about it everyday but it just got to me, all the time. Almost daily crying to myself. then and even now I feel like I don’t want anyone else but her. I don’t even know what it is about her but she is just perfect to me. i guess this is the typical friend zone situation, because I’m not gonna say I’m perfect, but I was always doing the things she asked or looked for and was always there for her. Her family really liked me, and all that jazz. I understand that there are other people out there and I may need to move on. And that it’s not good for me to linger on this. But I just can’t move on, I don’t wanna give anyone else a chance, and really I don’t wanna move on. So I basically just sat here for them years just hoping she hit me up one day or something. Because I just couldn’t go out my way to hit her up out of nowhere, idk if it was my pride, or embarrassment or what but I just couldn’t do it so I’ve been stuck here.

On to now, this year I was determined to just hit her up and try and talk about it to either move on or try something. Because the way we ended I felt like it was never really over. That’s another reason I felt stuck. So basically through connections I knew I was gonna be able to hangout with her one more time before I tried to move on. I was waiting all that time for something to happen and then on New Years we meet at a party which we knew we would before we was going, so I ended up taking her home and all that afterwards. Before the party the plan was to talk to her afterwards about it. But after chilling with her again it’s like every single feeling I had for her came back stronger. And now I just don’t wanna end it. Now I’m literally in the same exact situation again. So since then we’ve been hitting each other up and having little tiny conversations and what not. But as of like a couple days ago. It’s kind of at a stalemate. But I’m literally like barely making it day to day. Thinking about it is really eating me up. 

The reason I don’t want to tell her is because I know that most likely she won’t feel the same again. And it’s like she was the closest thing ever to me. So I’d rather just always have her around even if we not talk then just end it. I just don’t know how I will take just ending it, it will foreal be like part of me died because we would never cross paths again and I don’t want that to happen.

So I’m basically on the options of telling her how I feel now, or waiting and seeing how things play out and see if we can get back close again.

I just want some advice on how to move on and or how to make things right with her. Obviously I can’t force anything but any advice would be nice.

Please please please please feel free to ask me any questions or message me for more details. There is sooooo much more to the story.

Please keep in mind, yes I understand that I’m very young and even when all this happened I was 13 but in my mind I’m very mature when it comes to life stuff. Like relationships etc. I also understand that I can’t force anything upon her and that no matter if I was perfect or whatever that she may simply just not feel me like that.

As well as yes I know that even with the small small small chance that we do get together that things might not work out, but I just feel like the main thing I want is to talk about and maybe even try and see how things go. 

I guess sometimes I just think that since we have grown that maybe she might realize something and comeback, I’ve always got signs from her that go both ways. I just hate being in this weird middle ground.

Before I post I see a lot of young people being told that their still so young and there’s a lot of time. But people experience things differently as well as take pain and handle it in different ways. I’m not tryna separate myself and say I’m special. But I’ve been blessed that nothing tragic has happened in my life but this has seriously been my only problem for 6 years I’m not saying I want to marry her and be with her forever even tho that’s what I want. I just don’t want no one else. I just want someone to take care of, to talk to. Like we use to do. I literally don’t want nothing else. It just kills me every night that the inevitable is bound to happen and I’m just stalling it, even tho it’s a possibility that things work out I know what the odds are and it’s killing me.

Already posted this on r/relationships

I left him a couple days ago and moved out. We both did our part in the hurt, but I just want to be free.

I hate them because, for 18 years of staying in that family, they force me to be the person that totally not me. They shouted at me, punished me and told me I was a naughty girl just because I liked a boy when I was 14. I didn't agree with their opinions in all aspects of life.  So during all my childhood, I grew up like a role model they wanted me to be because I was scared to be shouted and beaten by them.

After I graduated from the colleague, I got a good job, I travel and live abroad. I do everything that I never have to go back to that hometown. 

Why do I have such hated feeling for them? I want to understand from psychology view. I blame them for a lot of them for forcing me to be a different person and it took me a lot of time till I could get out of it.

151,"Ever since I’ve started working when I was young, I started getting terribly anxious because of my work environment, bitchy, lazy coworkers and  the typical work related stress made me very anxious. This started 8 years ago and it’s only caused by work environments, I haven’t been diagnosed, workplaces  just makes me very anxious because of my past experiences. 

I’ve shared this with my now ex-partner (let’s call them Ryan), my anxiety isn’t something I share with anyone, in fact Ryan’s one of 2-3 people who I’ve shared this with and it’s something I did because I trusted them and felt safe to share. 

We’ve had problems related to our situation ([because of not living in the same place among other things related to that]not lack of love, attraction, cheating or incompatibility, etc) and Ryan went to their siblings for advice. 

Ryan eventually told me they had accidentally shared with their sibling that I had anxiety and that they had told their sibling that it could be part of the reason why we had problems. 

I was upset but let it go because how can I hold it against them if it was an accident. 

Later on, the other sibling talked to me because my partner had gone to them for relationship advice as I mentioned before and the sibling called me unstable in a long text. Even if they meant well by the other things they said in advice to me, it was something that really upset me because I barely had a relationship with both siblings and I didn’t know exactly why the sibling thought that was right to say.

I brought this up to my partner and they said I had told the 2nd sibling I had anxiety and that’s probably why they said that. I doubted this because like I said before, I’m very private and this isn’t something I would share with anyone, let alone someone who I had very little, friendly interaction before all of this happened. 

I looked through my texts between the 2nd sibling and I (we had previously chatted casually a couple of times) and I never mentioned my anxiety to them. 

I think my partner told both siblings that I have anxiety and that’s why one of them called me unstable. I am very upset about it still even though it’s been around 5 months, I feel very ashamed and very unsure of myself and my identity, I feel like when someone says something like that, then it must be true. I haven’t been able to let it go or stop thinking about it. I feel like I’m overreacting.

It’s just — I’m empathetic and I feel everything going with everyone. You can say what you want, but I can be fine and the next tank because someone around me, that I love, is having a hard day. I try so hard to do what I can to make life easier for my husband and now my younger brother (31) albeit while trying to be a good mom and raise my two boys. 

My husband hates his 9-5 job and his boss is the epitome of a dick. I listen to my husbands woes day in and out while doing my best to maintain the home. I have two debilitating conditions and still do my best to make it nice for my boys and my husband. My younger brother separated from his ex four months ago and came to live with us and this has put our home in disarray. Mind you me brother is a vet with three deployments with his own struggles.

I sat down next to a casual friend and later my other closer friend arrived and sat behind me, since it was the closest other seat to me.

I've only hung out with them both individually, never in a group and before yesterday they never really talked. 

Both of them tried talking to me in class individually while whispering, but at one point I found it really annoying when one of them kept butting into our individual conversations whenever I'd try to reply or think of something to say, to the point where one of them would dominate it and kind of left me out. 

Whenever they started talking to each other at small moments I stayed out of them mostly out of respect. 

I'm introverted and prefer 1 on 1. I'm okay if someone interjects but if they do it all of the time, it gets bothersome.

The last straw was in the middle of oral presentations, and my friend next to me whispered, ""Oh god, when can I leave. I have to get to building A"" (It's like a 10 minute walk away)

Me: ""Oh boy it's already 3:30..""

Other friend sitting behind me: ""Oh my next class is in that building, let's go together!""

155,"Hey everyone.  I recently got out of a relationship of two and half months about a month and a half ago.  This may seem like a short relationship, but it was also my first relationship and in turn, everything seems very intense and more emotional than it was.  The problem with myself is that I tend to ruminate on the past and constantly replay certain events in my head.  To sum up the relationship, my ex was extremely toxic and potentially even cheated on me towards the end (a very grey area which is why I say potentially).  Literally all of my close friends and family have told me that she was extremely toxic, but I feel like so much time has passed since we broke up that I feel like I am second guessing myself.  I guess the overall advice I am asking is could someone please help validate me if my ex was toxic based off of these situations that occurred throughout our entire relationship?

1. Told me I wasn't good at making out on our first date and told some of our mutual friends about it.
2. Cut our first date short to get drunk with my roommate and other college students.
3. Never apologized for anything even when it was her fault (I always ended up saying sorry for everything).
4. Never prioritized me (would constantly cut our date nights short to hang out with others).
5. Was very affectionate with other guys that were staying in our house (rubbed my roommate's nipples in front of me, laid on top of him, joked about having sex with my roommate, wrestled with other guys and had them lay on top of her, etc.)
6. Never attempted to change anything when I was uncomfortable (I mentioned MULTIPLE times about how the affectionate stuff made me uncomfortable, but she never really cared to stop).
7. Got jealous when I talked to other girls
8. Would constantly tell me that I was overly angry or overthink things (I will agree that this is one of my flaws, but I think in the case of this relationship, my overthinking was justified).
9. Told me I was skinny and basically told me she thought I couldn't protect her.
10. Told me she wasn't turned on because the only thing we did was make out.
11. Tried to push me to have sex WAY faster than I wanted to (I am still a virgin, so this stuff was extremely stressful).
12. Basically embodied drama everywhere that she went (it felt like she was constantly cutting friends out of her life in the short amount of time that I knew her).
13. Stayed in contact with her ex (not always a bad thing, but in this case, her ex was completely crazy and treated her like shit).
14. Sometimes compared me to her ex.
15. Showed up to our first date late because she made other plans beforehand.
16. Got high on one occasion and got pissed off at me for some reason.
17. Would openly comment on how good looking this other college guy was.
18. Made me feel very insecure about everything about myself.
19. Never payed for anything and never bought me anything.
20. Rarely thanked me for things that I did for her.
21. Was really only VERY affectionate when she was drunk.
22. Guilt tripped me to go out and drink
23. Would insult and call me an asshole and then when I would get mad, would get pissed and tell me it was a joke. 
24. Felt the need to party all the time or get drunk all the time.
25. Would never send me thoughtful messages.

157,"I [28M] am completely lost as a person. I have recently been questioning my sexuality, (I am cisgender and straight but the idea of sexual advancement is so foreign to me that it causes me anxiety so bad I have physical pain. This includes asking potential partners about sex, kissing after a date, asking a girl out.) When I was in my adolescence I was a bit of an incel nice guy, but saw the folly of my ways in my late teens/early 20s. Because I received the rejection in my formative years I'm not really sure how to go about things now. I tend not to ask girls out, even ones Ive been told are interested in both fear of awkwardness and rejection. My few relationships that I have been in have also been hindered by this anxiety. I fear being labeled a creep and my size [6'2"" 285] is one both a turnoff [overweight frame] and imposes risk [strength/dominance.] I instead opt to hide in my shell and treat everyone kindly, but it's so very lonely. I live with my best friend and treat him as if he were my companion but am not attracted to him physically. 
Phase two is I have very few interests. As the social butterfly I try to be, I know a little about many things but have very few deep interests. I love strategy  (I'm very into politics and football because of the strategy involved) cultural food and Pink Floyd. These are my wheelhouses and have been for many years. I've failed to grow as a person and it's isolated and regulated me to not being able to have a normal level conversation about it because I've spent the majority of my life learning about 3 or 4 things in great detail. As a young person, I'm nearly computer illiterate (type 25wpm.) I'm not really sure how to use most social media platforms. I'm quite boring irl and have been known to subsidize my mediocrity with drugs (LSD, psilocybin mushrooms and cannabis only) as a way to connect with people.
Phase three is I don't know what I'm doing. I relocated about 1700 miles across the US. I know exactly four people here. I am as we speak, unemployed (job prospect in the works,) broke and, uneducated (HS diploma only.) I am a terrible student and always have been. I am dyslexic (never diagnosed but I cannot phonetically spell/read words) and have a tendency to wander when bored.  I do not doubt I am smart, but, I am admittedly lazy. I've worked in food for most of my life, spent 10 years in a cafe, worked my way up to management, love operational strategy and timing. In the same breath I hate the food industry. I want to do something that would involve a degree, nonspecific, but hate being in a classroom environment. I feel relighted to continue my cycle at the lower rung because of it. It's disheartening to know that you have the know how but not the means nor the ability to thrive. 

I took a trip once and at the end of it I was happy. I hadn't been happy in several years and I rode the high until the wave crashed a year later. I suppose in writing this I'm looking for any advice to help me get back on the wave. I thank you for taking the time to read this and helping me out. ",23Jan2019,1
158,"Recently finished college , during those two years i put my life on hold. School was my main priority and as a way to not stress so much i stopped caring about anything that wasn’t school related. I would study nonstop and had no time for a social life. 

Now that school is over i have no idea who i am, what i like, i don’t even know how to slow down and enjoy life. I have been at home and start work around March, so i have time time to figure myself out but even that is hard! It’s weird to not be stressed and living in a fast schedule of studying, exams, clinicals, homework, etc. 

Ironically i ran out of things I’ve been needing to do and I’m tired of being on my phone, but my SO doesn’t mind it at all. He is taking time off to be at home since he worked in a different state for the past year, only coming home some weekends. While i want to do more things to live and enjoy life, he doesn’t mind screen time all day wether it’s reddit/YouTube/gaming; so I’m kinda left with nothing to do but screen time.

So my question is, what hobbies or interests do y’all have that i can explore? How do you find yourself after a period of putting life on hold?And how do i get into something when i forced myself  into not caring to have any interest in anything previously? 

Thanks!

He even made jokes about my grandpa dying too and when I tried to explain to him it wasn’t funny to joke about that he told me that if I didn’t find it funny then I should join him next to his grave. This is just a small portion of what he says and acts like and it feels like it’s just being a bad friend.

161,"Long post inbound. 

I'm an 18 year-old girl. Without going into too much detail, my father is (non-physically) abusive to my mother and I. Due to a number of circumstances beyond the scope of this post, she will not leave him, and I cannot move out until college. I am graduating high school this summer, but will only be about 5 or 10 minutes closer to my boyfriend (it's relevant, more on him in a bit). 

I have been aware for a number of years that my home life is pretty fucking shitty, to put it bluntly. I have been diagnosed with various mental illnesses (namely type 2 bipolar and C-PTSD) and am physically handicapped. I am in therapy, but it's hard to make progress when you're constantly being retraumatized over and over. 

My boyfriend and I have been together just over two months now. He's 24 and an absolute angel. I've never had a man in my life treat me as well as he does, and we both want a future together.

He lives a bit over an hour away so we don't see each other daily, but we do text every day. We've also spent nearly every weekend together since we started dating. I prefer staying at his place and did this weekend, from Saturday until today. It was the longest I have ever stayed with him.

My father is a control freak and recently decided that I am only allowed to spend every other weekend in my boyfriend's city. My boyfriend has no problem staying at my house, but we both feel as if we're constantly being watched and can never let our guards down. I feel that every day when I'm with my father, but especially when my boyfriend is there too - my father is extremely strict about me dating and constantly reminds me I am lucky he allows me to do so. 

At his place, we sleep in the same bed together. We kiss, we snuggle, we smash, and I get to play on his PS4 and marvel at his huge TV. He also has cats. 

At my place, he's forced to sleep in the basement. We can't be in the same room alone together without both of our anxiety levels spiking over the thought of being caught. It sucks ass, but it's better than nothing.

I've only been home a few hours. It's always hard for me to return, but today has been the worst yet. How do I deal with this? 

TL;DR: Boyfriend is so good to me that going back to my abusive home after spending weekends together sucks more and more every time. Additionally, now we have to split time between his place and mine. How do I make all this suck less? ",23Jan2019,1

163,"Hello,

I'm going to be moving into a dorm soon with roommates which may be an issue when it comes to my alarm system. I'm a pretty deep sleeper, and I will sleep through any regular alarm on my phone, no matter how loud I have it set to. I always get enough sleep, so I don't think sleep deprivation is the issue. The only alarm that works for me so far is the Sonic Boom Alarm Clock. It features very loud beeping, flashing lights, and a bed shaker that goes under the pillow. It's most effective when I have the volume up 100% and bedshaker on. However, because it is so loud I'm pretty sure that it would wake up everyone within the surrounding 5 rooms. I've tried turning off the sound an trying it with just the bed shaker, but that wakes me up only 50% of the time. is there an alarm clock that uses headphones or anything else that won't wake neighbors up? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you. ",23Jan2019,1
164,"I'm not sure if this fits in this particular subreddit or if it would be better in one of the ""dating"" subreddits. About a couple months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. I broke a promise (I was kind of forced into promising, (I still fucked up, nonetheless.) which is primarily the reason she did. I tried, I said shit I actually meant, which is something I don't tend to do. I got, desperate? I don't know. Emotional would be an understatement. That just kind of fucked me up for a couple weeks, and as time went on, I got better. I was coping with it by hanging out with friends, who didn't necessarily support me, but they were there to hang out, and that's the best I think they could do. I just wouldn't ask my best friend to go and be my unpaid therapist. He doesn't deserve that, and he goes through a lot more than I do and comes out seemingly unscathed. But, back to it. I got better and coped with it. I started to kind of forget, but I felt empty. I still feel really empty, I think. Fast foward a couple weeks, she asks to talk to me in person. Now, we do go to school together and I think that seeing her somehow made me get over the whole situation better. We talk a little bit, and she told me that even though she thinks our time is over, she still wants to be friends. I agree to disagree, I suppose. Just replied, ""Sure"", to everything she said, and we supposedly let bygones be bygones. We chit chatted here and there, but I simply didn't just care to give a response that seemed like I care. I got cold. I had always been cold, and being with her kind of made me less so. I don't want to go back to being cold like I was before, but I fear that's kind of the only path I can go down. I don't see a path that diverges into something brighters. Something new. Anyways, back to it. For some reason, about a week later, I open up my locker to find a note in it. From her and her group of friends. The note is just flat out talking shit. It didn't hurt, per se, it just really pissed me off. So, I went ahead and wrote my own note. Now, when I say I went too far, I don't think I can actually state just how far I went. I went all out, years of bottled up fury and bullshit was kind of just fueled into that note. I lost myself in that little bit of hatred. I had like three pages of ranting about bullshit. I stuffed through the crack of her locker and I went on to class. She obviously found the note, told her friend who helped her write it, her friend, the next day, then proceeded to yell at me and go straight fucking psycho in the middle of classroom. I just stared her down, a simple ""I'm sick of your shit"" type of look. Eventually, she ran herself out of breath and walked off. I just continued with my day. After all of that, I felt at ease. I felt better. For a couple weeks, I was rejuvenated. Then, slowly, she crept back into my head. Little random thoughts of regret, it started out as. ""Why didn't you be the bigger person? Why did you have to do be worse than she was? Why did you let yourself fall that low?"" I couldn't stop myself from thinking those thoughts. I just couldn't, and they only got worse. Day after day, it slowly got shittier, and shittier, and shittier. One thought hit me right in the face, right out of the blue, ""...i miss her."" I can't even really bring myself to deny it, anymore. There's two things I can see, either I do miss her. Or, I miss just being in a relationship. She may not treated me right, she may of been really shitty to me at times, but I didn't care because that's not what I seen her for. I seen her for what she was. Something great. Obviously, something with flaws, but what great thing doesn't have flaws? Pizza is all greasy and probably has a lot of calories... But it's all fucking tasty and shit. Just, after all that happened, why would I still miss her? ...I just can't wrap my head around it. I'm fairly sure she's not over me, too. A friend of mine sits next to her and told me that all she talks about is how she's over me, or some shit. One of her friends I turned against her to some point also told me that everyone she sits next to at lunch talks trash about me. Of course, I don't care about that. That's also kind of off topic, but I mean, still. I miss having someone to talk to. I miss having someone I knew I could probably rely on. I miss having someone who cared. Or, seemingly cared. Shit happens, I've always said things like that but this time? I can't wrap my head around it. I can't get over it this time. I feel... Empty? It's just, well, it hurts, I guess. But it doesn't hurt, if that makes any sense. It fucking sucks. Best way put. Every day, it's the same shitty thoughts, same shitty self degradation. Y'know...? I feel lonely, but at the same time, I don't. I want to be alone. I know that isn't the best thing to do when you're goofed and shit, spend time with people you love, people who's company you enjoy. But, I just don't feel like it. What's the point?   Anyways... There's my rant? I dunno... I feel like shit like everyday and it kind of sucks. What's your guy's advice?",23Jan2019,1

166,"I made a stupid decision and now I am in a very awkward and stressful situation at work and need advice. 

A few weeks ago I went to lunch with my co-workers. After lunch we drove back to the office and when I went to get out of the car I opened the door and scratched the car parked next to us. I noticed there was a scratch but for some stupid reason I decided to ignore it rather than leave my name and number and offer to pay for the repair. One of my co-workers exited the car on the same side as me and noticed the scratch when they closed the door. This co-worker and I do not have a good relationship so instead of mentioning it to me they decided to stir the pot and tell the driver who eventually told the owner of the scratched car (I think).

I think I heard my name being whispered by people who were not there and can only assume they heard that I scratched this persons car. I figured the owner or a co-worker would have contacted me or mentioned it but no, just whispers.

I dont know the owner of the scratched car, I dont remember what car it was, I feel like a stupid asshole and I also feel like my reputation is now ruined. I even had a co-worker (someone who was not there and not on my immediate team) greet me in a sarcastic and aggressive way today. I am assuming someone told them about the incident and now that person thinks I am a piece of shit, which I am.

What should I do? I am too embarassed to ask my team whose car it was and admit I walked away like a shithead. It's been a few weeks and it's all I can think about.

168,"Growing up I was always ""the fat kid"". I always figured I'd lose the weight once I hit puberty, but it never happened. Being ""the fat kid"" in middle/high school really sucks and I just got sick of it. I finally snapped when I officially hit obesity, and so I decided that I would try to diet down to 130 lbs (I'm 5'8""). 

Since October 2017, I have dropped from ~195-200 to 140 lbs. My dad never even mentioned my weight loss until recently. My brother was recently diagnosed with anorexia and hospitalized, so I think this is what triggered my dad's paranoia. He is telling me that if I drop below 140, I will not be allowed to drive anywhere.

This is frustrating for me. I have been working very hard to lose the weight and I think that 130 is a perfect weight for a 5'8"" male with a small frame and low muscle mass. I know that he is trying to protect me or whatever, but I feel sabotaged. I keep telling him that I am not anorexic, but he keeps insisting that my brother started out the same way (he didn't, he dropped from 150 to 95 pounds in 9 months, wayyy faster than I did)

This is how I have been losing the weight:  
-No drinks except A LOT of water, occasionally tea  
-Small healthy snacks throughout the day, dinner as the only full meal  
-I don't actively exercise as I don't really have time (I work fulltime AND go to school fulltime), but I make sure that I am always active and not sitting on my ass vegging for more than an hour at a time.  
-No midnight snacking  
-Junk food as a rare treat, not an everyday snack  

None of these are habits that would point to anorexia. My dad's only reason for thinking that I have anorexia is because I'm losing weight (which is understandable, seeing as I used to be LITERALLY OBESE to the point where my doctor said losing weight was a must)

How can I explain to him that I am not anorexic? I want to hit my goal that I have been trying VERY HARD to achieve.",23Jan2019,1
169,"I work in a private for profit company and I’m doing a lot of extras around the office. In essence, I’ve been doing a lot of emotional work that I believe is well above and beyond my job description that really should just be in a position on its own. Because I’m the “token” First Nations person in the small office it is assumed that I will just do this extra work as no one else can personally speak to it. 

I do get free training of my choice annually and so I tend to pick training regarding Indigenous culture, healing, studies, etc. I am First Nations working in social work where our clientele is 99% First Nations as well. The work I do with the clients is very relatable to my own personal life. This isn’t a job I can “leave at work” because it focuses on my own experiences as mush as the clients. For example I was sent to a shelter to pick up and place in foster homes “two boys from a suicidal mom”. I arrive at the shelter and it is the two sons of one of my personal close friends. You can imagine my horror and panic and while my boss was sympathetic, no one could relate to that trauma and it was quickly forgotten...except by me.

I’m at the top of my pay grade but I do much more, am asked to do much more (cultural trainer, cultural liaison, ceremony facilitator and trainer), am personally emotionally affected and making the same as someone who is not asked to do anything extra, does not have the same personal connections to trauma, etc. 

I believe what I do should be mandatory in our workplace (such as a cultural advisor) but for whatever reason they keep assuming I will continue on as they ask. I feel like if I’m doing this extra work, despite receiving free training (all staff have this opportunity) I should be compensated further for the efforts. Tonight I did an hour presentation and then facilitated an hour long discussion about Indigenous culture, trauma, ceremonies, government, etc.  I made and EIGHTY PAGE BOOKLET for foster parents to reference and brought my personal ceremonial items to work to give foster parents hands on learning as well as doing a smudging ceremony with them. At the end of it all, hours of work (while I was ill) I was asked by my supervisor to “send a digital copy” for the rest of the company to reference. Not a thank you. No acknowledgement of how draining this is for me (I do this every other month), no acknowledgement or compensation for using personal items that on occasion get damaged, etc. It was awful. Just the insensitivity my supervisor showed was really surprising, though he’s never seen me present before but I expected something more....personable. 

How do I go about asking for a raise or proposing they appoint me to have a new role in a newly created position where I can put my efforts just towards these extra requests? 

For those that think I’m too emotionally close to this job, thanks for your opinion but I do this work because it is necessary. I will continue to do it without fair compensation (or look for a new job in the same vein elsewhere) but if I can explain its impacts properly then I’ll have been able to go so much further to help my community.

172,"Hi guys.. sorry for the long read.. dont worry I put a tl;dr on the bottom for those of you who wanna skip all of this

So I was playing Overwatch about a week ago and I came across this really cool team and so I added everyone on it. Nobody responsed besides one person, who I talked to for a bit after. We ended up exchanging discords and talking for longer there. That night, she called me out of the blue because her ""fingers were tired of typing"" and we just sat and talked for a bit and she was actually really cool. I thought she was a girl but wasnt actually 100% until we called that night because her voice is really quiet so was pretty drowned out during Overwatch. I legitimately really enjoyed talking to her, and this was the first time I felt legitimate joy out of talking to someone, or out of anything as a matter of fact, in a VERY long time.

 Also its worth pointing out that I have a bad lisp and Im SUPER insecure about it, and she managed to encourage me to be less insecure about it.. she was the first person who actually said she liked my voice (outside of someone else who I dont wanna get into...) she also hated her voice but it was because it was high pitched.. just a quick note..

So I kept talking to her throughout the next few days, and she was relatively responsive (within an hour or two at most).. She seemed to be giving me leads that she might be into me. I discovered her name was Jooeun (An awesome name), and I grew to like her a lot actually. It was only a few days but I really enjoyed talking to her..

Two nights ago, her and I stayed up all night and a good chunk of the day texting (not calling because she was in the car and doing other things).. She seriously seemed to give me leads she liked me at this point and it seemed like her and I were actually getting to be close friends and maybe even more soon.. I know Ive only known her for a week-ish but Ive done long distance in the past and Im willing to get into one that I only knew the person for a few days IF that person is interesting enough. I know what she looks like too, and she's pretty..

So here's the issue: Last night out of the blue she texted me (mid conversation) saying ""aye I gotta go.. brb"" and then she just went blank. Today at about 11 she texted me again saying ""Hey I’m getting off this account.. Idk when Ill be back"". I tried to text her back asking her what she meant but it turns out she blocked me. She also removed me on Battle.Net (Overwatch).. didn't block me though although that's an option. This came out of NOWHERE and she even explicitly stated that when she kicks people out of her life she ""leaves a note behind explaining why and all of the good memories"" or whatever.. 

I dont know why Im so upset about this.. Im at the level of crying. Ive only known her for like a week-ish so its not THAT big of a deal if she stops talking to me, right? Apparently not.. Im much more upset about this than I thought id be.. Im not 100% sure if she's even gone either I just have no clue whats happening. Im known to be SUPER clingy but I can usually forget about stuff like this without too much of a problem.

tl;dr: I met a girl who I was getting really close with who suddenly cut me off for reasons she didnt fully explain (and insinuated that she was coming back but Im not 100%) and Im more upset about it than is probably healthy.

What I want to know is:
- What do you guys think happened?
- Can I expect her to come back?
- Did I do something wrong?
- Am I wrong to be worried?

175,"Hi guys,

Having a little bit of a dilemma here. (FYI, this is a throwaway acct.) I am currently a college student at a relatively large state school, and am having second thoughts on a club that I am currently in. I am very involved here at school; in my first semester, I joined student government, am on the committee for the pre-med association, volunteer in the hospital, joined a dungeons and dragons group, and this club sports team. I have trouble socially, making friends more slowly than others (I don't party, have a \*unique\* personality, etc), so I wanted to really put myself out there and get involved as much as possible.

Now that second semester has rolled around, I am looking to join a couple new orgs, and have taken on a research position demanding about 10 hours of my time per week (for my major.) I'm having some serious second thoughts about the club sport I'm in.

Mainly, I'm unhappy. Like I said, I don't really party so I don't go to the social events, as they're far and risky for me to get to as I don't leave with the rest hammered at 2 am and don't have a car. That coupled with quite a few absences last semester due to academic reasons and illness (I was ill about 5 times last semester), I'm not really friends with anyone on the team. Most are indifferent to me, some are outright excluding. I never have a partner for any of the activities, nor do I talk to any of them outside of practice (or really at all in practice). The coach is not fantastically nice and I absolutely dread going to practice. I know most of this is my fault, but at the end of the day, it's also that I've burned that bridge.

So this is where I'm at/what I am deliberating.

Cons

1. I strongly dislike going to practice.
2. I feel excluded by coach, team members, etc.
3. I don't socialize with them and connect with my teammates very little.
4. I feel guilty even thinking about missing practice/quitting. Yet I still entertain these thoughts and hate going to practice.

Pros

1. I need exercise. I've spent most of my life with little discipline and as a fat slob. If I quit, I worry I will immediately fall off with an exercise program and be left worse off. I'm already on nutrisystem to diet off my weight; it'll be hard to couple an already difficult task with self-discipline for the gym (interestingly enough, I am disciplined enough to study 5-8 hours straight with no distractions, any advice on that end, please let me know)
2. It gives me something to do at night besides mope around and study.
3. It can \*sometimes\* be fun. I've met a few cool people and it's a very impressive resume booster as the sport is widely considered to be difficult.

179,"I’ve been convinced of her having Munchausens before. In the last year, she posted 23 times on Facebook about being in hospital; all for different ailments. She supposedly has diabetes, sciatica, angina and many others but shows little to no symptoms for any of them. She ‘falls down the stairs’ a lot but rarely comes out with a visible scratch.
I knew there was nothing I could do about it, she’s 34 and I’m almost a decade younger so there was no way she’d listen to me. And I tried talking about it with other family members who all agreed that her frequent illnesses were strange, but none of them tried to figure out the cause.

But now her 5 year old daughter is getting sick a lot. And I mean a lot. My cousin posts pictures of herself cuddling up to her tired and sick-looking daughter whilst they wait in hospital waiting rooms - and constantly logs these illnesses on social media for everyone to see. I’m starting to get worried, but I don’t know if there’s anything I can do? I don’t really know how to address the situation. Reading up about Munchausens suggests making the person aware of their actions but I don’t want to cause a rift for something I know won’t be listened to. But I’m worried for this little girl, I don’t really know what to do. ",23Jan2019,1

184,"Okay I know the title is a bit messed up. But basically, my love for someone is causing me a lot of suffering.

I dated a girl back in 2015 for about three years. We ended things early 2018 because we just grew apart. I still keep in touch with her, and my feelings for her turned from romantic to more how an older brother would care about his little sister or something.

She's really shy, and suffers from social anxiety. She's also not very open with her feelings, and not really the happiest girl in the world. She suffered from depression between 2017-2018, needless to say her transition to college wasn't very good. I would say she's a little young for her age, but not really in a negative way. I find it cute about her.

Anyway, I'm kind of a mom friend. Not to the point of constantly nagging my friends but more I just care a lot about them: making sure they're keeping up with responsibilities, being physically and mentally healthy, and overall just looking after their wellbeing. Especially with her, this is amplified several times over. But my concern for her health is at the cost of mine.

Since it was an LDR I can't really check up on her irl. And while I think she's able to take care of herself physically, it's more mentally and emotionally that's bothering me. She keeps telling me she's fine, but knowing her after four years, it's hard for me to believe her when she says that. I respect that she's really uncomfortable with talking about her feelings and whatnot, but making sure she's okay has kept me up at night.

Normally when I'm really frustrated with someone who's just being a complete dickhead and not realizing that what they're doing is dangerous or if their lifestyle is really unhealthy, or if they're just being unreasonable, I would have no problem just blocking them. But with her, I care about her a lot... and I feel like by blocking her and just freeing myself of my self imposed concern for her, that I'll be hurting her even more. And she's not the most... emotionally secure person.

I know this sounds very pretentious and it might come off as ""I know exactly what's best for others."" And I'm aware that you should mind your own business. But I genuinely care about my friends, not just her but everyone else. And seeing them hurt themselves by excessively drinking, or hanging out with the wrong people, or just waking up and staying in bed all day being miserable, it hurts me a lot. This is kind of a selfish question, but how do I care less about the people that I love? I'm glad that I feel this way about people I'm close to, and when they express gratitude for my concern it feels great. But with those who either don't care or unconsciously can't, I feel like I'm bagholding on a stock that dropping in price, but I don't wanna cut my losses out of fear for what might happen to them if I do... maybe I'm just overthinking things. But I want to know if I should just bite the bullet and live and let live...",23Jan2019,1

The other classes I know for sure I'm taking are Spanish III, Honors Bio/chem block, Jazz band, Concert/marching band, and APUSH.

Well when he came and picked me up he asked me if I wanted to come back to the house and play beer pong and I was down to. Well we go back and play beer pong. After a little bit, I get tired of drinking and sit on the couch. He sits next to me and asks me to “suck him off” I laugh nervously and tell him no. I must have told him no about 20 times. He then whips it out and starts jerking off. I sit there and ask him to stop. He then puts his hand on the back of my head and pushes my head down on to him. He keeps his hand there and wouldn’t let me up until he finished. I felt so disgusting and it’s the only thing that has been on my mind lately. 

His girlfriend is my best friend and I have no clue what to do. If I told her what happened I know she wouldn’t believe me and it would ruin her life. And even if she did believe me, the friendship would probably be over anyways. I never thought that this would happen to me and I have no clue what to do. 

Not to mention that this guy was one of my best friends as well. I loved, trusted, and confided in him. He took advantage of me and I feel so betrayed. I feel as if my life is ruined.

196,"I don't know what else to do here. Basically, my 12 year old political nephew came here from Mexico two years ago (he's born in the US, but lived in Mexico all his life).

I essentially believe that he was sent here so we would take care of him as surrogate parents but the excuse I was told was that it was so he ""would learn English"" which always sounded iffy to me because I know the kid knows no English at all, besides basic words. I know more french than he knows English.

I don't mind taking care of him, but I really REALLY believe it's simply not good for him to be here. Sure, he was a lazy kid back home and nobody ever gave a fuck about his education, so he's really behind. But the absolute wrong solution for this has been to immerse him on an educational system that's teaching in a language he doesn't understand. Not only does it give him the perfect excuse for when he's feeling extra lazy, he legitimately can't comprehend 80%-90% of the material that's being taught to him.

Sure, we're in California and maybe there's 3 kids on his class that also speak the language but it frustrates me to no end that this is material that's basic and I just know he's not catching it. I have to work, my wife (his aunt) has to work, we never have the time to help him with everything that he needs help with and I certainly don't have the time to give him 6-8 hours of school lessons after I get home from work and I sit down with him. God damn, I wish I could though. I wish I could take him to the mountains for a year or two and go through everything from elementary to high school, and make sure he thoroughly understood it. But I can't, that's not possible, and all that happens is that he gets more and more behind and I simply can't teach him anything else.

I take extra time on weekends to teach him some English, but on top of everything else (the shitty educational background, the neglect, the laziness, and the language barriers) he might also have some sort of ADHD and hearing processing disorder. I know it because I'm diagnosed with ADHD and I know what it looks like, and also he's got the retention of an buttered-up teflon pan.

Does anyone know if there are Spanish speaking schools in the Bay Area? Is home schooling an option? Damn, man. I really can't see this situation unfold any further. Some days I just want to tell him ""You know what, kid? You should try to be the best carpenter/mason/plumber you can because god knows you're not going to cure cancer or get us to mars here"" but I obviously won't... I don't know, should I?

What should I do?",23Jan2019,1
197,"So I was on holiday in Jamaica. I met this cute blonde in the gym quite a few times. We exchanged hi everytime we met (the first time she initiated conversation and showed me how to start the treadmill) but didn't really talk past that because we got on with our respective gym work. Our routine seemed to be pretty similar. Anhway there always seemed to be ""That look"" between us. We were both leaving on the same day and on the penultimate day we were both at the hotels entertainment. We didn't talk because we were both with family. On the day we were leaving we talked a brief while. She asked if i was flying out that day and where I was from - very brief conversation. Not even an exchange of name. But at the end of it when my bus for the airport came I turned round and we both waved 😑. 

So out of pure coincidence I found her Instagram because she posted a pic and put the location of the hotel we were staying at. I did so with a picture of mine and decided to click the link to see other pics.

205,"TL;DR: I had a shitty job with an awful boss and I can’t get over it. How do I let go of anger and pain I hold towards people that have hurt me??

My last job was terrible, I was under constant stress to meet impossible expectations under the leadership of horrible, selfish, ego centric, entitled garbage humans. I hated every second I was there, though I am very proud of what I was able to accomplish.

They constantly had insane expectations of me but never communicated them, only communicated with me out of disappointment when I didn’t reach those expectations. When I got into grad school, the ceo wanted to “make sure” I had the same goals as him for my future because he didn’t believe in higher education and didn’t understand why I would want to get a masters (schooling did not interfere with work whatsoever) because HE made it without ever going to school he was SUCH a success. Him and his minion, the VP of Ops, treated everyone like they were idiots if they didn’t think/speak/act on the same wavelength as them. They talked constant shit about everyone and underpaid all employees, which they got away with because they only hired younger people. They had work violations and HR issues, the CEO would go around aggressively touching people to show his “power”. It was creepy enough he had to touch people but he constantly told me I was “family” and how I was this “amazing” person but only because I fit some weird idea of who he thought I was. 3 months after I started he told me he wanted to be at my wedding (not even engaged) and wanted to be a part of my life forever. (I wish I was exaggerating)

Leaving was the single most stressful process I had ever experienced in my life. Within 1 week of giving them my notice (I gave them a month’s notice due to my duties) my direct supervisor (also the VP of Ops) began ignoring me and began delegating my duties to other people, all without communicating with me at all. I was in charge of hiring, on-boarding, and training and she HIRED someone that week, again without speaking to me. The CEO let me go a month earlier just to avoid the tension she was causing.

It’s been months and I am in a new city with a really great new job, I blocked all my former bosses on social media and have tried to move on. At times, I still find times where I get angry about how awful they were. I had to relearn how a healthy work environment operates and to not constantly shit on myself while shaking at my desk from anxiety.

Every now and then I torture myself to see what they’re up to and I get so angry that this guy, who caused me so much pain and anguish can be happy and have a family that loves him and thinks nothing but the world of him. I hate how unfair it feels that he gets to move on and marinate in his entitlement, the love of his family validating that he is this great person. I have always had a tough time letting go of shit like this, how do I learn to let this stuff go and move on?

Usually super tight black jeans paired with combat boots, docs, or some sort of platform sneaker and I like extra long tees a lot, but I’m usually in a tight crop toppy kinda of shirt so my pecs stand out and so my tummy is slightly visible when I yawn. But I like to change it up a lot, one day I’ll have a more gothic look to me, other days it’s clean cut and preppy, otherwise I’m thotting it up with a slightly more “urban” look I guess you could say???

I started doing hair in 2015 and now I’m really starting to get established and I’m making a name for myself. The only issue is that, since I’m kind of a chameleon and don’t have a consistent aesthetic to me that my clients see all the time, I don’t always wow people to the extent I know I’m capable of and they don’t rebook with me because they’re just not impressed with anything other than their hair and, believe it or not, that’s not enough.

Now, I’m a senior in high school and almost 18. I’ve always regretted breaking up with her and couldn’t get her off my mind for months, and I eventually texted her when I was drunk to try and reconcile things. We made plans to meet up soon, and I told her I really liked her and I’d fucked up before (I wasn’t really clear why I wanted to break up, I was embarrassed about being confused so I drug it out, it was a dick move that I regret). She told me she was in a long distance relationship but you never know what the future holds.

The other plans to meet up fell through- Fast forward to a few days ago, we made current plans to hang out when she gets back from a vacation soon. She also told me she’d become single. I’d love nothing more than to be with this positive, sweet girl I’ve always liked. She’s outgoing and open and so, so kind. But I’m still insecure about being called bisexual, even though it’s painfully obvious I am. Does that make me homophobic? I have many gay friends and I’m comfortable around them, but I don’t know why being ME labeled gay makes me so uncomfortable. And the girl I like is so openly comfortable with being pansexual, I don’t want to be rude, or have a deja vu moment by STILL having hesitations about LGBT labels. Any advice?",23Jan2019,1

218,"Long post incoming. This was also posted in r/askHR
I am 23 and have been in my first full time job for almost four months in the state of Ohio. 
Last week I finally was able to gather the courage to meet with HR specialists and start the process of possibly receiving accommodations on the basis of mental health.
To be clear, I guess I’ve never actually seen my exact diagnoses, but I have sought counseling and taken medication for depression and anxiety for the past five years. The counseling I received at my university did not believe in focusing on the diagnosis, but rather coping with the symptoms. So, no, a professional has never directly said to me “you have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder” and whatever else I potentially deal with. What I do know, under the ADA, my mental health state effects several life activities (hygiene, sleep, concentration, communication, and more). 
I did a lot of research before I even emailed my HR specialist, because I am the type of person who wants to be certain of the actions I take. I truly believe that my mental health issues qualify as disabilities and I’m not sure how much longer I can effectively work without some sort of accommodation. 
I shared with the HR people my concerns and stated that an adjusted work schedule would be my preferred accommodation. For example, starting work from home and then going to my work site after a few hours. I know that they do not have to agree to it, but I do know the employee and employer must agree on something when creating an accommodation. Correct me if I’m wrong! 
Now I just need to provide documentation and I’m currently working on that. I’m almost certain no one in my organization has asked for these accommodations for this issue before because the HR people have to go to their senior staff (the VP of HR I think?) to make sure they are approaching everything correctly. 
I’m honestly just scared that they will not grant me accommodations and I will have no choice but to leave because I need to put my health first. But I’ve emphasized with them that I am a hard worker and have a record of excellence in school and student activities from my college days. I can succeed. But I’ve gone through many significant life changes over the past year. Having accommodations as extra support would mean the world to me. Plus, I feel I need to know how to do this because I may need to request accommodations for the rest of my career.
Any advice would be helpful, thanks internet friends. ",23Jan2019,1
219,"If this is the wrong sub, I'm sorry, can you please suggest a sub to post it on, I'm genuinely scared and don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm good friends with a girl across the country. She's always been great, and we've face times for hundreds of hours. 

Tonight, she seemed to be going crazy. She said she was seeing a shadowy figure outside her window, and she said she was hearing voices. At one point tonight, she told me ""I'll be back in 30 minutes"" which felt weird to me, she normally just says ""brb"" or something like that. And when she came back, she said her mother had caught her trying to slit her wrists with a giant fucking watermelon knife, because the voices told her to. She sent me pictures trying to prove to me that there was something watching her, but it was just a normal window. She could be lying for attention, or something like that, it's entirely possible, but I'm inclined to believe it, she genuinely seemed off today. If she's not lying, then she's experiencing hallucinations, and delusions. I was face timing her, because I'm genuinely scared for her safety, and her pupils were expanding and contracting pretty quickly while sitting in a well lit room, and when she was looking at the shadowy figure, her pupils stayed gigantic, like way too big, and she was looking extremely intently at her window for more than 30 seconds at a time. After she got back from trying to slit her wrists cause of the voices, we face timed for 3 or 4 more hours, and she seemed to calm down. She became more relaxed and started petting her cat, and stopped looking at the window, and she went to bed.

If this is fake, I wouldn't be surprised. She's not the type of person to lie about something like this for attention or to look special, but I guess if she was that type of person, I wouldn't know. She also might have taken something, I asked her and she maintained that she hadn't taken any substances. The most reasonable substance she could have taken would be LSD, that lasts like 8 - 12 hours, and can on rare occasions cause psychosis. But she was acting strange yesterday and the day before too. For the past 2 days, she just was acting a little weird, and she's said that she's seeing things in her peripheral vision, but today was the first time she said she saw genuine hallucinations.

I kept quiet until the costumer left then when the supervisor started walking towards his office I stop him to avoid costumers around and tell him how inappropriate that was but I was barking words because I couldn't control my anger and instead of descalating he kept being sarcastic and I just said he's unprofessional and bad at his job or something and left, I haven't seen him yet but I know I will eventually, how should I handle this?

226,"Hi, I’m pretty new to reddit and this is my first post. I’m not comfortable talking to the people in my life, so I turn to you, the internet.

To start off, I’m a 15 year old girl in California. I have a 4.0 gpa and excel at sports. However I always feel empty or incredibly lonely. I have an amazing family, but it’s evident that I’m the least favorite child out of 3. I’m very mature for my age, making it hard for my parents to connect to me, unlike my two older brothers. This bothers me incredibly where during a family dinner I’ll feel so left out that I’ll excuse myself to my room to cry. They usually don’t notice.

I have friends, but not a best friend. I’m not good enough to be some ones number 1, even though I try so hard to be.  I had a real good guy friend, but we ended up having sex, which he told me after was just a joke and we should forget about it, since he has a gf. 
Also I’m pretty sure I’m gay, so thanks asshole for making me sure

Sometimes I won’t get sad over things, but really angry to the point where I have to take deep breaths to calm down.

I don’t want to talk about this stuff with my parents because I don’t want to over exaggerate this if it’s normal. I’m also just not good about talking about that stuff.

Recently I’ve found the only time I’m happy is when I get high with these girls that I’ve recently met. However I’m sure the happiness only comes from being able to forget things for a short while, rather than the company

228,"I have a little Pomeranian mix, he's never been abused or neglected, but oddly he's been overly aggressive his entire life. The only people he has never attacked is my sister and I, but everyone else in all of our households are fair game. 


Strangely enough he snaps very unpredictably; one second he could be loving on someone and begging for pets or attention, then in a split second he turns into Satan reincarnated and attacks full force, breaking skin and causing severe lacerations. There is nothing obvious that triggers this, like I said he could be in a sweet and loving mood and suddenly at the drop of a hat he snaps and goes ape shit. He's so small that I refuse to let alone punish him physically, everyone in my family also agrees with this but they are getting sick and tired of his attitude, as am I.


This has obviously created a lot of resentment towards him. I've had him since he was a puppy, spoiled the hell out of him and he is pretty trained when it comes to commands. When he first started to show aggression I didn't want to use force to punish him so instead I used treats and praise to reinforce good behavior, and scolding to punish bad behavior. This has done nothing to curb his seemingly natural overly-aggressive personality. The vets claimed it may be because he was a maturing ""adolescent"" male but now that he is fully grown and getting older, his aggression hasn't ceased in the slightest. 


He's overly protective of me, when my boyfriend even remotely comes near me my dog will lunge at him, only _sometimes_ which is weird. He absolutely adores my boyfriend most of the time, sleeping next to him and cuddling up to him while he plays games, sleeps or watches tv. My boyfriend has shown him nothing but patience and kindness for years, hoping to maybe break him down with love and patience, but still sometimes unpredictably for no reason at all, my dog will snap and attack him.


I don't know what to do, this is my first dog, though he is now almost 8 years old. I've always owned birds my entire life and find them quite easy to train. Everyone around me tells me I am too lenient with him and that we need to be rougher with him in order to show dominance. Both my boyfriend and I cannot and _will not_ hit him, no matter how aggressive he gets. We both feel this will not only further aggravate him, but ruin any potential progress in helping him to become more passive. 

I feel very strongly that when and if you get an animal, you do every thing in your power to keep them until the day they grow old and die. Give them a good home, to never neglect them or abuse them in any way. I have no idea what could have caused him to be so aggressive, but it's putting a severe strain on me and my family. My sister just had a baby and now I can no longer bring him to my parents house to visit because I'm terrified that he will unpredictably hurt the baby, or ANYONE for that matter. 


I refuse to put him down, and I refuse to use physical force to punish him. There has got to be a better way that has a happy ending for everyone. Right now as I'm writing this, he just attacked my boyfriend simply because he reached for the remote that was by my thigh. He broke the skin on my boyfriends leg, my boyfriend is now playing a game and my dog is nestled next to him in his chair, and my boyfriend is acting like nothing happened. I'm not really sure how to move forward.


I've read forums and stories of other people and how they broke their dog's bad habits, but nothing seems to work. Maybe there is someone out there that has had a similar situation and solved it. I'm really desperate to fix the situation. I want to help him and refuse to give him up for adoption or put him down. He has caused some pretty severe bites and I am terrified that at any moment he may snap and hurt someone again.

230,"(Sorry if I have bad English, it's not my first language)

I'm a member of a book club in my city. We are lots of members, we started lots of years ago, and many of the friends I have today is from that book club.

One of the members of the book club lives in another city not far from ours. He often used to come to our meeting. He have been bullied before and doesn't have so many other friends, except from in the book club. Before he met us he felt depressed, but now he was happy. We understood that we are really important for him. Everyone thinks he is a loveable and sweet guy, with a fun personality.

Suddenly he was gone, didn't come to meetings, didn't write on social media and didn't answer messages. We called his mom and she just knew he was in a place without internet, and she was also a bit confused.

It surprised us that we one day got a message to our book club that said: “I am sorry to say that I quit the club. Thank you for everything. I will always remember the time I had with you.”

He was gone for half a year, and we didn't get more information. We had our different theories. My theory was that he was in prison. Suddenly he was back! He didn’t talk about what happened to him. He seemed pretty fine, but somethings was a bit weird. Everytime we hugged and said goodbye, it was like he thought this was the last time we would meet. “I really hope we meet again” he said. I didn't really understood what he meant. 

One day he was gone again. He had closed all his social media accounts. After a while my brother called his mom, and she said that he was in a place without internet, and that he had done something he is ashamed of. I was sure he was in prison.

I thought I had no need to know what he had done. It was better if I didn't knew. But at the same time I was curious. So I Googled the city and the day he was gone for the first time. I didn't think I would find anything. But I did. I found a news article. It didn't say his name, but I knew it was him.

He had been in contact with 8 young girls. Most of them was under 15. He made them to send nude sexual photos. He used compliments and threats. He had over 300 different accounts on the site. I realized that that the first time he was gone, he was at the police for investigation. Now he is in prison, for more than one year.

Now I know. I wish I didn't knew. My friend is in prison for pedophilia. This is so surreal, and I don't have anyone to talk to. What should I do? Should I contact him? We could never be friends anymore, or what do you think?

I think I am the only one in the book club that knows this. Maybe they understand he is in prison, but I don't think they know why. So the hardest question right now: Should I tell them? Maybe we will never meet him again. In that case, is it better if they just have this good memory of their sweet friend that they for a unknown reason never met again? Or am I obliged to tell the truth?

My sister and his wife have a kid, almost 3 years old. Should I tell them?

What should I do? Please, give me advice! 

TL;DR
I am probably the only one in my book club that know our friend is in prison for pedophilia. Should I tell them?

 Anywho short recap in case you dont want to read my other badly formatted and badly written post. Basically a dude exploited me and my friend but we stopped it before it got too far, now I get panic attacks when I see him, or sometimes if he is even mentioned, depending on context.

 My band director has announced we will be working with the pep band, which he is in. One of the other students asked if he was going to help out and the teacher said yes. Specifically, ""Just watch and learn, he's... well he's *insert his name here*, anyways he's one of our best."" 

 I really didn't want to, but I couldn't help it and before I knew it i could feel tears bubbling up inside me. I felt sick. I went about the rest of my day but in the back of my mind it was constantly nagging at me. 

 I thought I was over this. I thought I had moved on, but apparently I was wrong. I want so badly to be able to move past the accident, which he has most likely forgotten, but I can't. My anxiety and my depression won't let me. 

I like to brush myself off as being an edgy teen a lot of the time, and that none of this really matters, but I would be lying if I told you that I was perfectly fine. This coupled with the fact that my friendships are slowly falling apart is killing me emotionally.",23Jan2019,1

233," 

I am beyond frustrated and I am at my wits end with this teacher.

This is a pharmacy tech class, and unfortunately only one teacher so there’s no way to transfer to a different class. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. she is ALWAYS on her phone, which is not a big deal if she were to have us doing work, which brings me to the next point.

2. we never do anything for the first 60-90 minutes of the class. We are just sitting there doing nothing, while she is on her phone. I understand having some downtime during class to catch up on work but an hour is excessive and usually, everyone is just sitting doing nothing.

3. when explaining new math concepts (basic algebra) she explains as x=ab which is easy to understand. But when we get the test, it is a word problem and nothing how she explained it. When we ask her about it, she just tells us its common sense. We ask her if she can explain it to us using real-world examples, she herself has trouble explaining and has to backtrack or even google it. We essentially have to youtube/google it and teach ourselves.

4. We’ve asked multiple times if we can go over our tests or homework to see if we got it right, and she refuses. So at that point, we aren’t even sure if we are doing the work correctly.

5. We go over questions on the screen and work as a class to solve, but usually, all get different answers and when we ask the teacher for help, she says “oh I don’t know, you tell me” or “it’s common sense”. And when we do select an answer, we ask her if it’s right and she says we will find out at the end of the questions, which we never do because we run out of time, and again we are left unsure if we are doing the work correctly.

6. She always says “I think that’s the answer” or, “I think that’s how you do it” which isn’t very reassuring.

7. The tests/classwork/homework always has errors. From being numbered wrong (1, 2, 5,6, 3, 4, 5,) to information in the equation needed to solve, questions being incomplete, or no questions at all. When someone brings it up to her, she only explains it to the one person and not the whole class.

8. We skipped two whole weeks worth of material needed for our PTCB exam and the semester is almost over.

At this point, I am so frustrated with the teacher that I am just getting upset over any little thing in the class that I just packed up my stuff and left today and went to work instead. I understand us having to use critical thinking skills, I’m all for it, but don’t tell us that you don’t know or that we will see and never bother correcting us. I am 26 and have a life outside of the classroom, I am up at 5 am to get ready and drop off my siblings at school before heading over to mine, I am not getting as many hours at work so that I am able to go to class and get my license. The last thing I want to do is go to class and just sit around and do nothing only to basically go home and teach myself. I am beyond grateful that I qualified for financial aid and not paying a dime, but I went back to school to actually learn (high school me would be shocked to hear me say that lol). There are other students who feel the same and are also paying for daycare and uber just to not really learn anything from the teacher.

Am I overreacting? Who would be the appropriate person to bring this up to? Should I even bring it up at all? (I would have to put up with her for about 5 more months) Or should I just start looking for another school with the program?

234,"I dated a girl in high school for about a year. We were each other’s first “boyfriend girlfriend” relationship. We were friends for a very short period of time but jumped into dating quickly. There are many good memories I can recall. Her and I both made mistakes and I have reason to believe that I made many more mistakes than her. The relationship barely lasted more than a year due to insecurities and inexperience. There was a fairly “messy” breakup and then went dark (no contact) for several years and counting. 

In hindsight, I think that our personalities aligned but our inexperience created so many issues. I can’t speak for her, but I wouldn’t be opposed to giving it another try. She was a good friend too, even if the relationship was longer than the friendship.

However, I realize that (1) most of the time when a person wants to try again with an ex, it’s the crazy one talking because they believe there were never issues or something along those lines, (2) most second tries don’t work out, and (3) texting an ex is normally a bad idea so I’ve heard.

It’s been a very difficult and different for me due to the fact that she had a kid before meeting me. I never thought I’d be in this situation and I understand the outside view of it, because I used to be on the other side. 

Things were rocky from the beginning to say the least. Her view on life and boundaries necessary for a relationship were very different than mine, although a simplistic view of out values matched up perfectly. We had a tough time reaching the point we are at today. 

When things are good, I feel as tho I have th most supportive woman I’ve ever met in my corner. The level of support was miles ahead women before her. It made me feel like “the man” and I loved that. Honestly idk how important of detail this all is as I’m writing this so I’ll just say in some ways I received way more than I could ask for, in others not so much.

Things get dull.. the joys of life.. the sparks.. they’re so sporadic it’s hard to appreciate the good times. Little things drive me crazy about the way she lives (her family came from a lesser standard of living is one way to put it).

238,"Hello all!

I start my Ph.D. this year and my supervisor has already advised me that I'm expected to be in the lab Mon-Fri from 9am-5pm (possibly earlier or later if need be; may include weekends). At the moment I'm currently working part-time (only weekends), and I'm under the impression that I can handle the work-load including my current job, but some of my friends don't think it's a good idea as they believe it will be detrimental to my research, and the purpose of me receiving the scholarship is to solely concentrate and dedicate all of my time to my research. 

If anyone has completed their Ph.D. and also had a job outside of the Ph.D. did you find your work to be compromised? Did you feel unorganised and were rushing to make deadlines?

240,"I’m a 21 year old man who lives on my own and pays ever bill but my phone bill right now, my parents are letting me use their plan because cash flow is tight. I don’t work full time because I go to school, they understand. Or do they? Do I? Keep reading. I’ll explain. This is long, but I’d love the advice. You can use the TLDR but if you read the story it’ll make more sense.

I have a job as a server. I’m going to school for communications. That is, I’m taking classes about African studies, how to do research in the modern age, and how to speak to people, so I can get a piece of paper that says that I can talk to people well. It’s useful because corporations require that piece of paper when they hire you to do things for them and give you a salary to do so. But I don’t want to join a corporation. I want nothing to do with that. What I’m getting into is sales, product sourcing, and other things for a small business. I’m following a business model where I should be making money down the road for hard work right now, and I’m mid negotiations with China on products. I’ve been consuming info on how to do this more than school, and realized it’s a passion. I have studied other methods on how people are making money and realized I could be doing those things if I had more time. And all I’m putting my time into is currently work that I have so that I can amass funds while I transition myself to making money from other sources, and school, which I’m pursuing a degree I don’t plan on using and learning about info I don’t care about because it doesn’t influence what I’m currently interested in or how I make money. 

My dad and mom both want me to take on student debt because of the sunken cost fallacy- you’re so close you might as well take on debt to finish” and my dad admits that what I’m doing should make me money in a year. Probably a lot of money. His argument for why I should finish school is that if something down the line goes horribly wrong and suddenly I have no money when I’m late in life “at least you have something to fall back on”. A degree that says I know how to talk to people. If I’m in my 40s, have been a successful entrepreneur until then and some crisis deletes all my cash very suddenly, and all the business I have, and all my connections, I could still manage to find a job earning just enough to get capital and live within my means to get back to making money. It’d be a setback. Not a game changer.  


His last reason for taking on 12k in the next week (when final deadlines are for payments) of debt and then plausibly taking on more next year (though he admits with my current business plan I should be able to pay for classes on my own next year) is that it’ll get my mom off his back. Because she would hold him responsible for teaching me about small business and ask where she went wrong all the way up until I could show her lots of money. “You taught him about how to sell stuff, it’s your fault he dropped out” so he’s telling me to stay in. 

They pay my phone bill. My dad is about to help me with capital because I can’t work full time to save to invest back into what will make me money. Relationships and capital plus work ethic earn capital. I’m using a relationship to skip the working and saving part, but if this pisses him off and he won’t help me, even if he cuts off my phone bill, then I’ll happily work a bunch until I do have the resources I need. I have WiFi at home through the apartment my current earnings pay for. And if I was working instead of spending time on classes, I could pay my own phone bill easily. And fix my phone screen too.

School exists for the purpose of learning how to specialize, proving to a company that you have the dedication to finish something and “can work for them”, and to create an avenue for making connections to use down the road. I have connections. I know how to meet people. That’s not the issue.

Final premise: schools are businesses that make their business your ability to learn stuff. If I need to learn about business laws I could “go to school for business” but really I want a specific class offered by the university. I pay them, receive knowledge, and I get good grades in that and study that shit because it is important to me personally. I don’t need the degree I need their specification. (In this hypothetical situation). School has prepped me just fine to be able to talk to people in formal style, write adequately, and have basic functionality in life. But I don’t want to specialize further, I want to use that knowledge and I finally realized the...

TL;DR college classes for a degree I won’t use are keeping me from making money and getting capital for investing in a market I understand, and i think I’m going to drop out. If anyone can give me a single good point or two why I should take on 30k in loans to finish getting my comms degree to prove I can talk to people, I’d happily listen. If you have a legit reason I should stay in school, I’d love to know.",23Jan2019,1
241,"Hello fellow memers and non-memers. I'm having family problems. Just your average teen having an emo perspective on life.

There's some things that have been bothering me a lot lately, such as my parents throwing away important things. They don't give a shit about my grades anymore, but focus so much on a stupid extracurricular activity.

I don't like this extracurricular at all. Heck, they even tried to call the cops on me because I refused to go. My parents never seem to understand what is going on in my head. They end up complaining about me not speaking out my mind when I get mad, yet they don't bother to listen to me. They don't want me to see a therapist, and mock me for going to the counselor for help. Although my counselor is a great counselor, she has tried to convince my parents to find help for a long time, but my parents refused.

Another thing that they do is compare me to my younger sister. Okay, we get it. She's smarter, more reserved, and more hard working than me, but my sister uses her parent's babying to her own advantage. ""Mom, the dumb one is eating in the basement and is taking up all my space."" 

After my parents ridiculing me about everything, I kind of gave up. My grades are crashing, my emotions are becoming fake, and I feel like I'm dragging everyone down with me. Of course, there were a few friends that were always there to support me, but I just don't feel like trying anymore. 

Please, if anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it. Sorry for this cliched and long paragraph xd

242,"I don’t know what is wrong with me but I’m a student in college and something I’ve heard a lot of recently is how I seem like I don’t care. This applies to a lot of things; my professor gave me a C because he said like I didn’t seem like I cared about his class (I talked almost every class meeting, I did the assignments ahead of time, knew a lot about the topic). I’m sometimes on my phone as much as other students are but it’s never to text or do anything like that but look up articles or facts related to the class topic.

A club I’m trying to join, after their interview process, said I just seemed like I didn’t care that much and it looked really bad. However, I do care a lot about joining and what they thought of me. I tried to talk to as many people in it as possible and connect with everyone. Like most people, introducing yourself to strangers and starting a conversation is hard and scary but I pushed myself through it and thought I did a fairly okay job.  I would consider myself to be above average physical attractiveness, fit, and pretty outgoing. 

Another example: one of my hobbies is photography and video making. Not only is it something I do in my free time, but I make my current income off of this. So obviously I’m passionate about it and my work but I have gotten reviews from clients saying I didn’t seem like I cared about my work, or just seemed disinterested. Obviously, this hurts a lot because it’s something I’m deeply invested in and now I just tell myself I need to try harder and do better.

After these 3 different scenarios, I just can’t stop thinking about how people think I don’t care, when I really do. And in fact, probably more than most people. I care a lot about what others think of me and my work, but I seem to not have any capability of showing it and it’s affecting my life and self esteem deeply. I’m a second year in college so I may still be adjusting, but I can’t tell if I’m just so depressed and need professional help to seriously change my mood and how I feel, or if I just have a personality defect and need to figure out how to fix it. If anyone has any thoughts please let me know; I’m so desperate to fix this. 

TL;DR: People think I don’t give a shit when I actually care about things/people so much. Negatively affecting my relationships and I’m losing out on opportunities. ",23Jan2019,1

I’m a 22 year old sophomore from northern Baton Rouge,LA at Southern University of Baton Rouge and I recently got back in contact with an old ex of mine from 2 years back. I “initiated” I know bad move, but I texted her and she took all day to reply. I told her that it’s been a while I loved to see her. She asked me on text why have I missed her and I told her that I remember her favorite movie “Selena” and she couldn’t believe I remembered. Jan 6 2019 of what I said in the beginning, I drove to Ruston where she is a 20 year old junior at Louisiana Tech in a made up sorority alpha chi in the same field of engineering I’m studying well no I’m mechanical she’s chemical. We hooked up after she got off work then for 1.5 hours we talked to catch up but I was there mainly to see an old friend or so I thought. I then started poking at her little chubby stomach a bit because I was trying to show her that she was beautiful to me inside out and I still supported her decisions to wanting to make change to her look. Fast forward 10 min we ended up having a session of indoor Olympics and we did two rounds with 30-45 min in between sleeping or so we thought. I spent the night to next morning of at her house. I tried to make a next date and she was being evasive and coy so I left with a hug and said call me when you change your mind I then got on the road back to br and she showed mixed signals texting on and off and called me once when I got back and otp I tried again to make a definite date again evasive and coy and I said well give me a call if you change your mind. Later that night I got in my feelings and I told her I liked her and wanted to know if there was a chance for us to keep having fun enough to where we can pursue something together, I know I ****ed up then she said the dreadful “I’m so confused. I’m just trying to get my finances together and I’m not doing so hot in school I can’t have a relationship right now.” Again I was like call me if you change your mind. She then text me “I’m just so confused” I said the same thing of my intentions and lil but of how much I liked her and if we part ways because of what I was looking for I would be a lil bummed out but I would let her go and not hit her up if that came to that. I haven’t talked or hit her up since last Tuesday since we last talked. I told her never stopped caring/loving (not in love though) for her and I felt great for getting a second chance with her. I feel like a dumbass piece of shit. I feel like she used me to fill her up with attention and my love only to use it as energy to talk back with her ex, other options in her phone, and view me as an option(when ready)/ugly to not be taken seriously for her boyfriend or anything?

252,"Hi guys,

So at the start of December I received news that my Grandma was in hospital in Western Australia. I lived in Vancouver, Canada at the time. My mother had us fly out to Australia to see her because we weren't sure we'd have an opportunity to see her again. Originally we were going to fly back in mid-December (17), however my dad lives in Adelaide, south Australia, so I decided to fly there for a month before returning home. 

Fast forward, I go to leave Australia, I'm a Canadian permanent resident so I show proof of that. They say because I don't have my actual permanent resident card, they can't let me fly out. I showed them proof that the card was lost when my wallet was stolen, and that I and applied for a new one in October 2017. Turns out, the proof of my permanent residence is not acceptable for travel. I have to apply for a travel document. But that's all fine and I understand that, really, it's my fault, not anyone else's. 

The problem is that I'm now in Adelaide, jobless and broke, having to pay rent here and in Vancouver. I have a paycheck waiting for me in Canada for work I did before I left. Is there a way I can get to that money? My old boss hasn't responded to my emails. I'm wondering if there's a way someone can go pick it up and somehow deposit it for me? Maybe taking photos of it so I can deposit it through my bank app? Would that allow me to access the money immediately?

Furthermore, how can I get a job here? I've applied to a lot of places but due to not having a driver's license or a car, a lot of places are simply too far for me to go there to work, and the places that are close enough have not replied to my application. I have a couple years cooking experience but I can't get in touch with my old bosses to get references. Mainly I'm just panicking about not being able to make rent for the Vancouver house.

253,"I’ll try to make this as quick of a read as possible. But it’s a long story. There is this girl I work with on Saturday nights. I just started working this job again during Christmas break and ever since I’ve been back this girl has been all over me imo. She’s constantly dropping sexual innuendos to me, touching my body in a way that I believe is more than friendly because I’ve never seen her touch anybody else that way. Also he always invites me back to her apartment. She just broke up with her bf a few weeks ago and she even told me she was going to do so before hand. She didn’t tell anybody else. 

I’ll start with the sexual innuendos. Saying that she liked my skinny jeans and how they showed her what I was working with. One night in the back of the restaurant where we work she said hey nick it’s dark quiet and it’s just me and you what are you gonna do about it. I said I’m gonna take out this trash. It was raining and I told he jokingly that she could hold my glasses. I came back in and she handed me back my glasses and I said without my glasses I would be bumping into walls, then she replied with saying that I could bump into her vaginal wall. Later that night when I was telling a story about my recent run in with a pot brownie that was too strong for me. I told her what kind of mattress I had. She told me that she’s never rode anybody on that type of mattress before. One day I was putting whip cream away in a back which she insisted helping me with. And while she held the bag and I scooped in the whipped cream she asked if I was going to do this to her later. There are plenty more of these type of stories but I’ll end there. 

She’s invited me back to her place after she told me that I was taking her out on a DATE after work, and nothing sexual happened. She still had a bf at the time. And now she asks if I want to help her take down her Christmas tree or how much her cat misses me. 

She’s also touching me in a very suggestive way. Weather it be running against me like a cat does when they like you. Knocking flour off my t shirt while standing within a 1/4 inch of my body while she literally rubbed me down. Hugging me and refusing to let go. Always touching my arms and holding on to them, paired with an occasional head resting on my shoulder. 

So the other day my sister in law got sick of me over analyzing this situation she wrote her a message on fb as me asking her how her weekend was and if she still needed help taking down her Christmas tree? She replied with a yeahhhhhhhh, I think I’m gonna leave it up forever. She’s normal shirt though texts I guess. 

So I’m asking you is she into me or I’m I just getting played with by the biggest tease of all time. I haven’t worked with her since I sent the text. And btw one of my women coworkers said that I’m still in a good spot. And everybody is telling me it’s that obvious so plz tell me what you think. Sorry it was so long but it had to be.

261,"Hi! I've (25F) lived with my roommate (27F) and her dog (1-1.5yo) for 6 months. We became friends shortly before deciding to move in together as I was leaving a bad roommate situation. I had met (and liked) her dog and chalked up some of the dog's behavior on puppishness. 

When I moved in the dog was at the tail end of her first heat cycle. Doggo was dressed in diapers and kept off the furniture the whole time. Fine and dandy by me. Roommie and I have talked about making sure the 
dog gets spayed and she is not interested in keeping the dog intact. Finances are an issue and I've suggested a program in our county that helps provide low cost spay/neuter to lower income households that a family member had used. She said she'd look into it... about 6 months ago. 

We had a discussion about it again last week before doggo went into heat again and when we realized I found and sent her the link for the application. In that time she has abandoned the diaper thing (""too frustrating""), started allowing the bleeding dog on the couch (or rather, never stopped her from getting up), and going out for long stretches of time where I'm not expected to take the dog out but I feel guilty leaving her to wait. That wouldn't be an issue if the dog wasn't a bully type dog that's way too strong for me to walk on a lead and she is unsafe to walk off lead. 

In the past 2 months we've had 2 major incidents where the dog bolted (off lead) across a street with oncoming traffic to bark at a couple walking their dog (on lead) and another where she again bolted off lead after a man walking down our street minding his own business. It's a disaster waiting to happen. 

That's scary, but now that she's in heat her behavior has become annoying too. Doggo got into my bathroom (usually door is closed) and peed on some laundry that had fallen out of my hamper as well as numerous things in the house. She also jumped on my bed (uninvited!) and got blood on my sheets which made me realize she hadn't ended her cycle, roommie just stopped diapering her which means the couch has period AAAAALLLL OVER IT. Roommie knows I find that kind of thing rightfully disgusting. She posted a passive aggressive meme on Facebook about how it's mean to keep dogs off furniture and anyone who cares more about hair on the couch doesn't deserve to live with a dog. Hair =\= Blood. 

There's more but TL;DR roommie doesn't take initiative to train her dog properly and to instead discipline after something has already happened. Behavioral issues exacerbated by being in heat are becoming a no go for me. My suggestions are ignored and my concerns are mocked. What do I do?",23Jan2019,1

The fire was confined to a storage room and the kitchen, but the house is unlivable due to the smoke damage (amongst other obvious things).

The house is my grandmothers and she does have fire insurance. At this point I’m not sure what’s covered, including emergency living costs (she has Farmers Insurance).

A few months ago, my friends and I all got together, they sat me down and told me that my girlfriend had been cheating on me. They had evidence thru phone calls and text messages. She had gotten drunk and slept with a guy in my class. We had been dating for about a year and a half. 

Needless to say, I was pretty bummed. I broke up with her a few days later. She claimed that it was just a joke and it never happened. I like to think that too just to help me sleep at night lmao. Regardless if they ever did anything together, she still lied right to my face about having him over on multiple occasions, they even went to sn Fransisco alone the day after she slept with him, lol.

She was very mad that I broke up with her and only felt like she was sorry for about a day, every day after that for the past 5 months she believes that she has done absolutely nothing wrong in the situation and that it is my fault for everything.

She blames the people who told me for ""bullying"" her and making up stories about her cheating {even though there's a literal confession over text :0)

the only thing I wanted was to keep her friendship because she was the closest friend I had. (never fall in love with your best friend!!)

She has split it up into sides, making me choose between blocking and not talking to all my friends that told me, or she will ignore me, and block me on everything. I could leave my friends that have supported me through these really hard times.

She would attack me for being a horrible person for not blocking them, saying stuff about how dating me was a mistake and that she's gonna replace me with someone so much better. Her mom has been attacking me as well, she has said some mean stuff, and some stuff that could get her in legal trouble too. 

This really gave me a lot of anxiety, and I could and would make a decision. She proceeded to block me on everything, unblocking me at times to shit on me more. She has effectively been not talking to me for a few weeks now, pretending I am invisible and talking to everyone else around me but me. I have learned to deal with it a tiny bit, it drives me crazy though. 

She has been hanging out with this other guy so much he practically lives at her house. It sucks that this breakup got so many people involved that sides have been formed and people have stuff against me (even though all I have done is listen to everything she says :( )

everyone says just to move on but is so much easier said than done, she was a huge part in my life and filled a void. I never imagined that it would end this bad.

phew that was a rant

&amp;#x200B;

after all that, I still can't help but look at her and be sad. even though she is mean to me, shes still pretty, I still imagine of all the intimate moments we had, dinners out, nights in bed. I can't look at her the same without thinking it, it hurts and I can't stop thinking about it. she really did love me when we dated (i think) and would do anything for me. 

after all this I miss her. but I know the relationship was kinda toxic, or else id go running back, I'm weak.

I just can't stop subconsciously looking at her and thinking of everything we had'did. 

it is ruining my life, i can't move on that way. I'm not really in a position to move, and I see her every day. 

any advice, pity, or whatever helps &lt;3

In 9th grade i did not the worst in my first semester, I passed a couple classes, but in my second semester I moved due to some drama with an ex, and I was finally ready to live with my mother as she was sober again. I had developed very bad anxiety over the last couple years, and had trouble in my new school, sometimes being afraid to breathe, and running away/skipping school, so I failed every single class in my second semester. This year, I got enrolled into online schooling, which made me more depressed and I had a hard time focusing, and at the time my mother began to unravel and turn back into her old self. I passed two classes, and have since left my mothers after she relapsed and physically got into altercations with her boyfriend, so I left and am planning to go back to my old school and I am currently staying with my grandparents.

I'm an immigrant that came to USA for 5 years and I got a job in a seafood company shortly after. They were short on people so they willing to train on site I managed to learn and earn a barely living wage now. Seriously I felt lucky to actually get a job without prior education here, I have basic read and write skill and my job doesn't require much of verbal communication. Due to various reason including myself I didn't try to attend school back then and I deeply regret that. At some point I start to look around and realize people my age doing much better made me really depressed.  


I wanted to work in IT or Industry Technologies related field. I live in Washington and recruitment for them are all over the place but I don't even have the minimum requirements. I tried to look out for better chance in attending college but I stumbled upon many problems. Where do I start from my current position? I have no prior certificate, degree or anything and I'm not confident in my communication ability neither. I actually graduated high school in my home country but does it has any use?.  At first I wanted to take a night class, but then I realized my work schedule clashed with it, I went to work at 5 a.m and usually get out around 5-6 not counting busy season where we work 13-15+ hours a day.   
I was excited when I think about it but then I start to have doubts: if I quit my job and take a day class with a part-time job, will I able to survive? How long will it take for me to reach my goal starting from almost zero? Which path should I take to do it? Will I able to do it? My current job is like a comfort zone that most likely won't ever change, neither worse or better until I retire, should I stay with it or risk for something better? Another thing that tingle me is if I choose the new path, it's as if I wasted the previous 5 years for nothing...

272,"I'm living in the graduate student housing with three housemates. Two of them are from southern Europe and the other roommate and I are American. One of my foreign roommates is... difficult. She was the last to arrive and at the time she ""traveled light,"" which means that she didn't bring pillows, bedding, anything. I took pity on her and loaned her a pillow. She really liked it and asked if I could buy her another one -- at the time she promised to pay for them. Since we're in a town that isn't really friendly to our wallets (but I spend my weekends in a metropolitan area where things are cheaper), I agreed. This was my first mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

That weekend, she asked me to do her homework (she's in a different field, but I'm in a math heavy field so she thinks it should be a piece of cake for me) for her and I refused. I came back to find her in absolute tears -- she threw a huge fit because apparently she has to get all ""As."" She said that she was already stressed, since she has to acclimate to a new country and a new language, and that it wasn't fair that I was charging her for things when I had a car and could get around easily. Basically, she thinks I should do things for her because I have the advantage of being a domestic student. I... still don't understand this reasoning, but the other European roommate banded with her out of solidarity. In order to keep the peace, I told her that she wouldn't have to pay me back for the pillows, etc. At the time, I thought this wasn't a big deal, because they weren't expensive. This was my second mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that I was coming off as a pushover, so I did manage to set some boundaries -- she used to come into my room and turn off the lights if I wasn't in the room at the time (never mind that I just stepped out for two minutes), and I let her know that this was unacceptable. But apparently this is not enough -- she still thinks I'm a doormat. It doesn't help that the other American roommate is a pushover who shares groceries with them and probably buys all the communal supplies. By now this problematic roommate has bought into her own argument that we ""owe"" her. She gets her way most of the time. She takes up all of the bathroom and hides my stuff when I leave for the weekend. She hangs her underthings in the living room (it's either her or the other European roommate -- probably both), which takes up room and is kind of...odd. I'll never be able to bring a guy friend over for sure, since there's no way he's going to be able to sit in a living room cluttered with bras and panties. She and the other European roommate leave their dirty bikes in the dining area, and they also leave their dirty dishes in the sink, but if I leave my dishes in the sink for a day, they throw a fit. She wants absolute silence whenever she's doing her homework, but she talks loudly herself whenever she feels like it and says it's a cultural thing. I think I once asked her to lower her voice in the morning, and she nearly burst into tears. She does that a lot. I'm actually pretty quiet, but she wants total silence -- I told her that she was being unreasonable and she escalated the situation very quickly by telling me that my attitude was unacceptable and that she would retaliate by screaming at 5 or 6 AM in the morning. I kid you not. And this comes right after she requests that I buy all the toilet paper from now on -- and that's another huge conflict right there.

&amp;#x200B;

Previously, we traded off toilet paper duty -- I'd buy it, and once the TP ran out, she'd buy the new rolls. She spends way more time in the bathroom than I do, since I only live there 3 days out of 7, but I try not to nickel and dime these things. She's making this very hard to do. She's decided that buying toilet paper is too big of a hassle for her, so she says that she wants me to buy them from now on, because I have a car. She actually called me up and left a wobbly voice message to stress her point. She also said that she would only buy the toilet paper if I drove her to the market. At the time I agreed if she promised to pay. What she didn't tell me at the time was that we were already out -- she'd torn through the last few rolls at an ungodly speed. So now we're down to our last roll, and we're having huge fights because she wants everything her way, and I just want to say fuck it, you can buy your own toilet paper, I'm done with you. I don't owe her because I'm domestic, I don't owe her because I have a car, I don't owe her a damn thing. We all pay the same rent -- to the university's housing department.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I've decided that I'm going to start bringing my own toilet paper to the bathroom. It seems petty, but she's the type to take a mile if you give an inch. That being said, I'm pretty sure she's going to retaliate. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with her? The other European roommate has her back and the other roommate has to live with them 7 days a week, so at best she won't take sides. I usually drive for 4 hours on Friday, so if she does start messing with my sleep, this can quickly become hazardous for my health. One of my friends suggested reporting her for academic dishonesty (she cheats blatantly on her exams and since she's on a scholarship, I can't imagine this would go well for her), but I don't like being a snitch. Is there a way to safely navigate the next six months so that I don't have to drive while sleep deprived, and I don't feel mad enough to report her when exams roll around this quarter? Also, am I being really petty? Do people usually just cave in these situations and wait for divine intervention or something like that? I've been extremely fortunate because I didn't have roommates for three years in college, and the one year I did have one, I roomed with my best friend who is made out of awesome and has never pulled this kind of shit with me.

273,"
Before I start,  I’d like to say I’m talking about my moms side specifically.  My family is extremely abusive and dysfunctional.   My mom is a heroin addict.  She’d come around when she wanted money from me.  She chose a man &amp; drugs over her kids.  All of my siblings are scattered across the state.  Some in foster care, with relatives, etc.  She’d only come to me if she wanted money.  

I moved in with her mom ( my grandma ) when I was 15.  ( I just turned 20 ) I was promised the entire world, but it was honestly a living hell.  

My grandma had been divorced years prior, and found a new boyfriend.  He was nothing but a shitty alcohol.   He’d go on and on about how I’d amount to nothing.   How nobody loves me.  That I’ll probably end up being a serial killer.  He used to flash his dick, and make sexual advances at me.   My grandma would do nothing about it.  He’d get in my face and intimidate me.  Always wanting me to hit him, but I never did.  He used to pound on my door at 3 in the morning, sometimes hitting it so hard it’d fly open.  All my grandma said was to just go upstairs.  Go to my room.  She didn’t do anything to protect me.  Instead, I was forced to isolate myself.  

My grandma didn’t want me going to public school.  She had me homeschooled.  It killed my social skills and social life entirely.  I wasn’t allowed to leave the house, make friends, or be a normal teenager.   I had online friends, but that’s a different story.  She’d constantly argue with me, lie to me, and lie to my family.  She would tell them I’d hit her, break stuff, and throw stuff.  99% of the time it wasn’t true.  Admittedly, I broke my own stuff a few times, and I truly regret it.  I’m not a violent person and I never want to be.   But I never hit her, or threw anything at her.  That’s absolutely ridiculous.

Then there’s my aunt, who’s a complete bitch.  She took in 3 of my siblings.  Two of them, she only kept for the money.  As the foster parent she’d collect from the state.  She’d beat them, intimidate them, and treat them like trash.  My youngest sister, she viewed her as her own.  That’s great, except she brainwashed her into thinking I wasn’t her brother.  She had her believe my cousins were her actual siblings.   Fucking unbelievable.  And, to top it all off, she threw the other two back into the states hands, once she saved enough money. 

My Uncle... I won’t go into too much depth about.  He got mad at me, and filed a false police report on me.  I was 16 at this point.  I was scared, and my lawyer told me to plead no contest.  It wasn’t the right choice and I was completely innocent.  Well, I had to take drug classes and do 32 hours of community service.  That was amazing of course.  Best time of my life.  I stopped talking to him after that.  

My other Uncle never liked me.  He said I was too disrespectful, thanks to the lies my grandma would tell everyone.   No idea if he would’ve been any better.  He always preferred my cousins over me.  The favoritism was obvious, and it genuinely killed me inside.  I’m sure he hates me, but I wouldn’t know.  

The last person I want to talk about is my cousin.  She lived with us.  We became extremely close, and I thought she had my best interest in mind.   Except she pressured me to smoke, drink, try drugs with her etc.  Because she was the only “friend” I had, I gave in.  All 4 years went by, and I thought she truly cared about me.  Well, my grandmas boyfriend died in a car accident.  He had a heart attack, and crashed.  About two weeks later, my grandma and I got into an argument.  She had promised me a vehicle, but decided to give it to my cousin instead.  Mind you, she already gave her the first car that I was promised when moving in.  My cousin ends up calling the cops and telling loads of lies.  Surprisingly, I didn’t get arrested.  But, my grandma filed a protection order.  I had to get out.  I was homeless for two weeks.  And, to top it off my cousin called my dads family, told them how awful I was, and not to let me stay there.  

I tried killing myself multiple times living there.   I regret never reporting any of this.  I didn’t think anybody would’ve believed me.  Maybe I would’ve ended up with a nice foster family.  I don’t know.  Now I’m stuck here with PTSD, Clinical Depression and other bs.  I can’t even begin to go into it.  They keep trying to contact me.  I’m still angry.  They’ve never apologized to me, and even if they did, I wouldn’t believe them.  It just sucks because they’re my blood.  What if one of them dies while we’re not speaking?  I’d feel like an awful person.   I’m thinking of trying therapy again.  I’m not sure.  I just feel so lost without my family. 

I’m probably forgetting loads of details, a lot of stuff happened living there.  If it was possible to erase the memories,  and them,  I would.  ",23Jan2019,1

276,"Months ago one of my roommates (John) has accused me of cleaning too much, telling me that I'm too strict when it comes to cleaning. We have a cleaning schedule, everybody has a separate choir each week. One particular day, when John's choir was due, I asked him how it happened that why he didn't do his choir, he said: ""I didn't feel like it."" and added a casual: ""You don't clean as much as you think you do.""  


I don't want to kill a vibe so I lowered my expectations and cleaning standards immediately after that, changed my habits of asking people why they do their choir by going completely silent and just doing my part. For weeks they have been doing the choirs for 50%. Normally I would've done the other 50% after a couple of days to finish the choir, but as I said.. i quit doing that.   


Fast forward a couple of months, turns out Rick (my other roommate) has turned the tables on me. He's been talking behind my back lately when my girlfriend is in the kitchen; questioning her questions like: ""You know how X never cleans up?"", also falsely accusing me of losing certain kitchenware ""Did X throw away the kitchenware? You know how X always cleans up in a frenzy!!"".  


I  consciously didn't clean the dishes maybe 2 or 3 times in a total of a couple of months because I lacked time, and thought they wouldn't care since I've lowered my cleaning habits based on the habits of my roommates.

278,"I been having a hard time finding work, but think I figured out the main reason.

I have a few large time gaps between the few jobs I have had. Those jobs were also short lived.
I realize this must look horrible to potential employers.

However there is and was nothing I could about it.
Life just kept giving me road blocks that caused me to loose transportation long term, move suddenly. And a parent that did not want me to have work while in college nor a car or even help me get any transportation. He wouldn't even drive me to potential jobs.

Which made my resume disgusting looking for work history. With three temp jobs a managed to get two were purely volunteer work too.

I am unsure how I can address this in my Resume, Cover Letters, or Interview. I rather not bring up a sob story of ""my parents neglected me and made it hard for me to get anywhere for the longest."" That's pretty unprofessional.
I still can't afford a car of my own but do live with a roommate who can and has been driving me places to look for work.

I think the time gaps is the issue, but could be other things I'm unaware of still.
I am 26 years old. It's getting rather embarrassing and frusterating being so behind for my age.
Really can't be stuck jobless much longer. I really should be helping with bills and expenses here. I feel terrible that most I can do is clean and apply to places just to get barely any calls.

So I have this friend, let’s call her Stacy. Stacy and I have been really close friends since 8th grade and we are both 21 now. She has a history of letting people walk all over her, and take advantage of her unfortunately, but that all seemed to change early 2018. She met a guy named let’s say Josh. Josh was a military vet, older than us but someone who finally respected her and asked what she wanted out of life and her relationships. Somebody she could finally be herself with. They talked for a couple months and things were starting to get serious. He unfortunately passed away in May and I have never seen somebody so broken in my life. It was like I watched all the promise leave her body and as her best friend, it made me feel broken too seeing her like that. It didn’t feel real, and to be honest, still blows my mind just thinking about it. 

Fast forward a couple months, she’s still grieving but getting better. I decided to have a bonfire at the end of summer, and she ends up flirting with one of our friends, let’s say Tony. They ended up, well you know what that night and everybody kind of just looked at it as a one time thing. Well now we’re here, 5 months later, and they’re still fooling around, but now she’s hardcore invested. Tony is a very nice guy, a very good guy actually. But he’s not what she needs. He’s a drug dealer, he got a DUI(as a minor btw), just got out of a four year relationship, and leads her on to the point of no return. It’s basically like she went from a man to a boy, and I’ve noticed it change her attitude completely again. She tries to be more like him, dressing in the street wear, sneaking around, lying to everyone, and just becoming a shell of her former self. She’s come to me for advice and I’ve told her my concerns, and I’ve told her how she deserves much much better but she just doesn’t seem to care. It’s like she’s content being miserable, and the more she gets like that, the more it’s pushing me away. 

I don’t want this guy to ruin our friendship, and I want her to realize her worth. I feel like she was just lonely following the loss of Josh, and needed somebody, but now she’s just going to be heartbroken again. I want to surround myself around positive people. I want to surround myself with motivated people. I want her to want to be better and I want her to want to deserve better but she just doesn’t.

281,"About a month ago a good friend [F18] of mine [M21] was back home for the holidays from university. I’ve known her many years and there were always feelings between us but it always seemed like it wasn’t convenient or the right time to act on them. This time I decided that I had enough of suppressing these feelings and told her how I felt, and she reciprocated. She spent the night at my place and we were intimate. 

The next day I asked how she felt about us and she said she wasn’t sure. I knew that she was seeing someone at the time but she had told me it wasn’t serious, but still I didn’t know what to expect from how this development would change our relationship. Later she called me crying, telling me that she was worried about screwing things up with me, and that she couldn’t deal with this right now. I did my best to comfort her, told her that I loved her and that I would be here for her, and that I was confident that she couldn’t hurt me. The conversation ended I thought relatively amicably. 

But, for the next week she basically ghosted me.  Wouldn’t answer my texts or calls, every message just delivered not read and no way to leave a voicemail. Once she called me back but hung up as soon as I answered. I wanted to see her again and talk over things, but with no luck. I was upset with her behavior, but I was trying my best to be patient/understanding, because I know that she’s emotional and can be sensitive. A few people  told me that I should’ve just dropped her then and there because of how rude she was, but I didn’t have it in me to throw away years of friendship over this one incident.

At a moment of desperation I contacted my friend’s sister, who I’ve also known for years, if perhaps her sister had said anything about me. She said she had not, and wasn’t aware of what had developed between the two of us. She did inform me however that the guy my friend was seeing had flown down here, surprising her and was staying here for the holidays as well. This set me off a bit, but it helped make sense of why she wasn’t communicating with me. 

Eventually she messaged me, told me she was sorry for how she’d hurt my feelings and that she understood if I couldn’t forgive her. I told her that I conceivably could, because I do still want this to work. She said that we should just give this some time, and I can agree with that. 

But it’s still difficult because she still won’t talk to me. I’ve tried to just be casual, say hi, check up on her, wish her good luck for going back to school, but still radio silence from her. Using social media has become an uncomfortable experience, because I can tell she’s viewing my stories on SC/IG, and the same goes for me viewing her stuff. I’m not so sure it’s really healthy for me to follow her social media, but it feels good to see and hear her somehow. 

I’ve been thinking about moving on, not necessarily dating someone else, but just closing myself off fully to those feelings for her. That’s difficult to do obviously, and I feel like I really can’t unless I have some kind of closure, which as long as she doesn’t talk to me, I feel like I won’t really get. 

Any advice for what I should do or even can do? ",23Jan2019,1

We are both 20. 

Me and the girl are okay friends and were talking about getting our drivers licenses, I cracked some joke about how kids are 16 and getting their licenses before me. She says “I’m turning 18 soon and I don’t have my license yet either.” I know it’s not a big legal deal or anything because at the time they dated he was a minor too, but the age gap does make me feel a little funny because he passed it off as them being the same age. I don’t know why it makes me feel so weird. Is it normal to feel weird about it, or am I just overreacting to finding this out? I mean, if they were dating in middle school, he basically would have been dating a 5th grader as an 8th grader. It doesn’t exactly make sense to me. ",23Jan2019,1

I go to a university in the UK. I'm originally from 8 hours away from my uni. Last semester a friend who's mental health has been terrible for as long as I've known her became over attached to me and the other guy living with her, we helped the best we could just like we always have in the past. And after months and months of being emotional blackmailed, gaslighted, lied to and about and manipulated by her (its part of her disorder to be out of touch with reality and maipluative) and after the 3rd suicide attempt in a month which had been attributed to our presence. We realised being there for her made her worse (hospital didn't believe they were genuine attempts wouldn't take her, I don't know what I think) leaving her alone made her worse, getting her help didn't work and made her get angry at us and us leaving the flat gave her opportunities to kill herself and after being told it was our fault we felt it was our fault. We realised we couldn't be in her life anymore. A lot went down it's not necessary to go into. During this time I spent so much time in hospitals overnight, having 4am conversations, being woken up by screaming in the night, I slept badly when she was in because I was worried she was doing something to herself so if check up. My depression (which I've been okay from for 4 years prior) hit me so hard I believed I was a bad enough (ugly nasty ect) person to make someone want to die without even having done anything. It could be as simple as looking at her in the wrong way. I slept so poorly and missed so many classes my grades dropped a whole grade across the board. I tried to leave the situation when it became extreme but couldn't for 2 months. I also stress eat, I had a body I was really proud of, I'd hit the gym once a month and it was enough, after 5 months of extreme stress my clothes are too tight for me and I feel like I'm in a strangers body. I hate it. I've started working out a lot and eating clean again. My (ex)boyfriend told me I'm an overreactive person and would only let me talk about my feelings to him for one hour a week when everything was happening so I obviously broke up with him, however I've realised I'm not happy with myself anymore and being by myself is honestly really claustrophobic. I had a great group of friends who now all think I am a bad person because I left the area over Christmas to recover. During that time my friend told her disordered version of what happened (not her fault she genuinely believes it) and people decided off limited knowledge what had happened. I know full well most these things didn't happen but at this point I'm so defeated I'm just letting go. I'd rather be friendless than deal with one more thing. The stress of coming back to this situation and having it go from one person I can't escape telling me that I'm a bad person to lots of people hinting it, hasn't been great. I've started stress eating again. The few friends I have left I find it hard to tell about my mental health because I handle myself very well and id rather not have it known. My head is better since moving away for a month (no more meds! :) ) but its plumetting everyday. I want my degree. I'm a year away from it. I don't want to go back to studying for 3 more years by switching uni. I'm happy to isolate myself and just heal but I know that's a habit of mine that makes me feel worse eventually. But is this a serious enough situation to warrant it? I'm sad and fatter and not funny and not as pretty and not as confident in social situations and I have less friends and I can barely work because my brain hates me now. I just don't know whether to pack uni in? If i should try to explain myself to my friends? Wether that was emotional abuse? (its just a flatmate so can it be??) If i should just isolate myself from people I know deal with my own shit quietly and just decide I'm never gonna be as social and happy and confident again and to just sionara that shit and try to meet new people? I feel lost do you pursue things or walk away?",23Jan2019,1
284,"I have been through a length hiring process (2 interviews and a 4 page working brief) for this job. I was called today and offered the position. 

I was thankful and asked if I was able to let them know tomorrow (I wanted to discuss with my family etc who I had not told about the role at all) which she agreed to. 

Then I received a call back from the HR manager who claimed that ‘because of my hesitations’ I am not the right fit for this role anymore. i told her I wanted to accept and she said that was no longer an options I was planning on taking it, and feel like it’s been ripped from beneath me for no reason. Every other job I’ve applied for has allowed for a period of time before accepting. 

I want this job. I knew that but hadn’t told anyone else about it so thought it would be best to consult my family first. Now that’s all over.

He called me pretty early, usually he calls me around 1/2 am, this time it was just minutes past midnight. 
15 or so minutes into the call and he is fast asleep, fast forward and hour into the call and I’m still awake. Suddenly I start hearing a teaser through the call, like in the movies, when someone is using it mid air just to scare someone else but it’s nowhere near the body. 
A few moments pass and I thought it was my headphones, I change them and I still heard the same noises, suddenly I start hearing other one, like when you light a match using the box, also like in the movies, I can imagine the scene, the box of matches is in a close up and you see how it’s opened and the match scrapes to it until it starts burning. I could also hear when someone is moving little things in a big open building and the sound hands make when you rub them in certain ways. 
I started to freak out but I didn’t want to end the call because I was afraid something could happen, I knew it wasn’t my boyfriend because he was sleeping and he was really tired. 
The sounds had an echo, like in an open building and they sounded near me and then far away, it shifted from time to time.

So within our group of friendos, we all get along pretty well. Give or take some good debates.

However, in the last year or so, one of our friends has been having a tough time mentally. Which I fully understand, because as have I and we’re all a bit rough in our own ways. 
But she’s turned into a bit of a toxic person, which she never was beforehand. 
Most of us have tried to talk to her about how she’s feeling, let her know we’re always here, all the unconditional love stuff that’s necessary for someone struggling with their mental wellbeing. 
She talks, but is obviously a bit uncomfortable doing so. So I try not to push it. Recently she has become quite irritable, self-centred and negative. She’ll openly humiliate, almost bully people while we’re all sitting together, she gets impatient, rude and snappy if things don’t immediately go her way. 
If we bring up a topic to talk about, she’ll either talk over us, interrupting with something solely about herself or something completely off topic that none of us can really work with. It makes things awkward.

I’ve been friends with her longer than most of our other friends, so I try to remind them maybe she’s overwhelmed with her emotions and it’s spilling over in a negative way. But understandably they’re getting more and more frustrated and kind of want to hang out with her less. Which sucks.
One on one, she’s different. She kind of returns to the person she used to be. It’s when we’re in a group, it’s like she gets uncomfortable and turns weird. 

I love her, she’s my best bud. And I know for a fact deep down she’s a very loving, caring, hilarious person. But I’m starting to get frustrated too. I want to confront her about this, because it’s like she doesn’t even realise she’s doing it. But she has the tendency to feel attacked, get very defensive and feel like I’m only saying it to intentionally be nasty. When it’s not like that at all. I just want to be honest, tell her we’re all a bit confused, she’s being a dick and if she doesn’t reel it in, our friends will keep pushing her away. 

I’m at my wits end because all of our friends complain to eachother and me, but no one actually speaks up and just sits letting the resentment grow because of how sensitive she can be.

Do I just bite the bullet and confront her, potentially ruining our friendship? Or should I just let it take its own course?

TL;DR: my friend has recently become self centered and rude. How do I confront her without making it seem like I’m having a go at her?",23Jan2019,1
290,"I started slacking on doing my work in middle school because I fell into the “failing is cool” group of kids after moving across the US.

Every couple of days, he walks down to driveway(where my house is), and walks up the steps in front of my house. Alternatively, he could've crossed the street from where his house is, and it would've been quicker. But he decided to walk right up to our house.

Every time he would walk up the stairs, our dog would start barking, which is not unlike him, but I just thought this was a detail I shouldn't leave out.

One day, my parents went to take our dog out on a walk, and he ran up to him, before they pulled him away. Now, he carries a baseball bat every time he goes around outside. I'm really scared that if I take the dog out he's going hit me.

298,"Hi guys...I'm here today because I have no idea how to deal.

He genuinely has been the worst he has been emotionally since...he was a kid. Back then he used to harass my other brother, J, and bully him until he started crying and this used to make him smile...and...how he's been acting kinda reminds me of that, just with less joy. 
He's been going to therapy and psychiatry for many, many years, and takes a ton of psyche meds. 

I'm honestly scared of him--when I was 15 tried to choke me the first time. He had physically attacked people before (including breaking someone's arm) but that was the first time. And he has occasionally over the years raised his fists at me, but more often recently when I try stopping him from bullying J or my mom. 

Frequently in the past 4 months he has picked fights far more often. And...he just won't let go. And it's honestly scary because he yells and shouts and the others are pretty meek people, but J does have a temper too which can be problematic too..

If someone else tries to intervene - basically me - that makes him more angry because he thinks he's being ganged up on even if everyone but me is quiet and is just telling him ""please calm down"" or something like that. He will think things that aren't mean are mean (i.e., someone telling him that maybe he should give his computer - when it has performance issues - a break after he played it all day) and verbally attack people over it...and it's hard to sit in my room and do nothing. 

Another incident happened again like it has almost every day...it is midnight, his yelling woke me up and it turns out he's out in the dark living room still on his laptop while my mom is trying to sleep and he's trying to lecture her on just something absolutely arbitrary. I told him that he woke  me up and asked what was wrong...
he looked at me at rage and said ""Why you talking like a little princess? That's not you!"" and I wasn't, I just was worried...
just a month back he was enraged by my usual gruff tone. But then he admitted that it was mostly how I'm impossible to read. So how am I supposed to talk? This is mainly because of my upbringing...I learned to hide as much emotion as possible to keep myself safe...and now I'm so stressed out that I can't help but show some emotion, but he seems to think it's an...act? He thought one of my asthma attacks was an act too.. 

Oh yeah--after my mom made the suggestion about getting off the computer...he tangented off about how she is horrible at taking care of animals, that all our past ones developed health problems and died because of her (we didn't have many and it wasn't her fault, they died from old age) last one developed issues after eating one of his psyche pills he dropped and was too lazy to pick up in time. Then he blamed her for not noticing stuff that happened in his childhood that he intentionally concealed and lied about back then and therefore ruining his life, acting as if she must have ESP or something...

He seems to have built in a rationale for abuse; if someone's acting stupid, then it's ok to latch onto them and not let go. He (E) latched onto (J) my other brother for being ""irrational and idiotic"" for listening to a certain two youtubers--telling him that it's basically a ""religion"" (even if J is just watching them for fun), etc, that he just wants my brother to think for himself and that all famous people do that, but then he went onto some far more personal and painful, personal jabs (secrets so I won't mention here) as if he wanted them to hurt. My other brother is autistic with pretty severe anxiety and heart issues; this is a very distressing thing to witness...and then when J says that he doesn't want to talk about something anymore E just goes on about it. 

Already said that he doesn't care if he treats us like shit now because the world has done bad things to him...but then he launched into talking about burning Qurans in front of the police station that supposedly wronged him or that he was supposedly on the news and that the police had said some...stupid stuff? He acted as if this, which ""happened"" years ago was why he snapped now. And all the other wrongs in his life are actually years in the past; nothing has happened recently but somehow he's gotten increasingly hostile. Or at least he acts neutral but then the littlest things might tick him off...aka, anything he construes as stupid he exploits as fuel.

I wouldn't be surprised if this goes ignored or downvoted but I honestly don't know where else to go...like, both my mom and J have bad health issues--my mom has heart disease and blood pressure problems and she has surgery this friday too. 

I want to move away soon but I'm terrified to leave E with those two as he is..

302,"About 3 months ago I left a relationship of 3 years. We moved out of state for the last 6 months we were together. There was never much substance between us, and when we moved in together it became much more apparent that we weren't right for each other. I believe that she was a narcissist, and drained me of any drive I had during our time together. 

Once I left though, it was like night and day. I'm motivated and excited about the future. Since being out of the relationship and back to the city, I've been reconnecting with my family, friends, and hobbies. I gave most of myself to my relationship, so I'm finding that I have to work hard at developing my own independent identity that doesn't require someone else's approval. Have been applying for jobs and have been to several interviews, but nothing yet. I've noticed that I'm stressing about time passing, like I need to make some ground-breaking progress every day or else I'm not trying hard enough.

We talk everyday but not full on conversations, just bits here and there. We went to the movies one-on-one (I asked him), we also split the check 50-50. Additionally, he is kind of dating/not-dating my friend in a complicated way. They both liked each other but the best-friend of the girl he was interested in was very against it as she was his ex. So the girl put them on an indefinite halt until the ex said it was fine. Apparently, although controversially, he had been pining for her despite what the ex said and it was 100% the girls call. Around the 3rd time I hung out with him (in a group), they had just been 'granted' permission to date. But he suddenly wasn't so interested? I even joked to him with a ""thats exciting right?"" and he was very 'umm' about the whole thing.

I also tried to check in on his relationship status asking how he would feel if a girl asked him about and he just said ""it would depend on the girl. But I'm not opposed"".

316,"Here's a rundown of my life-situation. I'll try to keep it brief but it's still quite long so I'll appreciate anyone that bothers to read through this wall of text.

Growing up, I was always the odd one out. Despite having somewhat decent social skills and looking normal, I was terrible at sports and always slightly ""out of the loop"". I felt like I was never good at anything and had really low self esteem. I don't want to cast blame for my own negative life choices or short-comings, but I think part of the reason I was ""this way"" early on was because I had a absent father, who was a good man and provider, but spent no time with me and had no relationship with me. I had to learn what sex was, why I was seeing changes during puberty, how to shave, etc on the internet. 

During my preteens/early teens, there were many times when I had no friends and it got so terrible that I switched schools my final year of elementary. This resulted in me becoming the most ostracized person in my new class and missing out on a good quarter of my classes, almost failing the year. To me, that proved the problem was not the other students, but myself. I had previously lost all of my friends in grades 2 and 5 and faced severe bullying and had switched schools hoping for a different class that would accept me. That was the worst year of my life. A day didn't go by when I didn't face verbal or physical abuse.

Come into high school and I thrived. I met new people and my grades soared. I was one of the top students in grade 9 and 10 with a ~ 96% average over a full course load. Come grade 11, I once again felt as though I was losing what little friends I had and began to fear I'd revert back to being ostracized as I had been in previous years. As well, I developed a skin condition and had a bad reaction to the meds I was taking to treat it. It caused both chronic fatigue and horrible skin dryness, my skin would flake from my face. This made my situation in high school unbearable.

Due to my worsening social situation and medical issues, I opted to take my remaining classes online rather than in a classroom setting. Which proved to be a terrible decision. I thrived with the structure and social aspect of school. I became extremely isolated and turned to the internet to cope. I began spending 10-12 hours a day online. At the time, embarrassingly, mostly playing minecraft. I ran an active server and felt like I had purpose and was liked. People wanted to spend time with me and liked me. I still felt awful all the time because of the lifestyle I was living but didn't change, I felt trapped. 

Some friends from my time in high school began to spend time with me again and invited me over, but the relationship was ended when I refused to smoke marijuana with them. I felt like I had an addictive personality and didn't need that in my life as I was essentially a high school drop-out and my parents were already very worried about me. I lost my only real connections to the outside world that day.

Come graduation, I got to see all of my classmates succeed while I fell behind. All of the people that ridiculed me and even some of the people I tutored a few years earlier surpass me. My depression worsened and my classes sat stagnant. I'd start them, lose motivation and drop out of them. I'd play the same games and go on the same websites day after day even though I disliked them. It was a huge struggle because my classes were all online and I used mindless internet browsing as a form of escapism. I became extremely isolated, no contact to anyone but my immediate family that I avoided by switching around my nights/days. I felt like my focus and feeling of well-being was poor daily so I'd constantly put off my classes to when I ""felt better"". Well, time passes quickly when you sleep 12-14 hours a day and spend the rest of the time on the internet. I eventually finished all of my classes and with fantastic grades, but just completed the bare minimum required to graduate. I was 22 years old at this point.

Now I'm 24 and have done nothing since. I feel as though I have no direction in life. I feel as though I have no passion or interest in anything. I've looked into completing trades classes but even then I have no inclination towards a certain trade and I feel as though other people and future employers would ask what I've done the past 7 years of my life. As well, a trade's class would easily set me back $6000-10,000 here and while that's a good investment, I feel like it needs to be something I know I want and that I know I can find employment in. Lots of ""normal"" people I somewhat know have done trades classes and can't find a job with past work experience and references.

A part of the problem is that I also feel like I can never be good at anything. I know that sounds odd, but I feel developmentally stunted and broken. I'm a man in his mid 20s that has achieved nothing. When I think about things, it sends me into a downward spiral that ultimately ends in suicidal thoughts... I have no friends. I've never even held hands with a girl or gone on a date. I have no job.... and it all leads to the broken dream. In my life, I wanted nothing more than to be a dad. To provide for a family with a wife and kids. It seems unattainable and I have to admit, I had given up for a long time.

The rest of my family is quite successful. My brother is in one of the most prestigious careers there is and on track to making well over a six figure income in a few years. My parents are upper-middle class and retired. They worry about me a lot. Unfortunately, my mother has been retired for a while and my father's company shut down so I have no connections to get a job. I wish I could get my foot in the door somewhere, anywhere to prove myself. I just recently tried applying to over 50 entry level jobs over the course of two weeks with a resume full of lies to get myself out of my current lifestyle. No call backs. I can't get a job in a grocery store or fast food. It broke me. I'm going to try to apply to some more in the near future.

I know I need to change. There hasn't been a day that's past in years I haven't had suicidal thoughts. I've tried a lot of things from therapists, psychologists, anti-depressants... nothing worked. I currently just feel like a husk of a person with no purpose. And it's odd, but I feel like I've repressed a bunch of emotions over the course of my life and I have no way of accessing them. I feel like I've almost become robotic. Like I don't react or feel like I use to. I go outside and I feel like I'm not really there or connected. 

The one thing I do know is that I NEED to change. I know I'm not going to be around in a few years if I don't change. 

Any suggestion on how to proceed in my life of nothingness is appreciated.",23Jan2019,1
317,"So me and this girl let's call her J and I'll be V were talking for a few months we would hang out until 4 in the morning I would go visit her at work it was the beginning of a cute and cheesy relationship then out of the blue she gets her phone taken away so I can't contact her this lasts about 3 weeks during which I would  send occasional love notes for her when she got back one of which I  came to my senses and told her I love her and to my delight and surprise that night she messages me and tells me she snuck her phone back to message me and she loves me too so she sneaks out of her house and we hang out that night all night and we kiss it was the most magical moment in my life so I take her home before her parents wake up and she lets me know she won't have her phone for a good while again...so three months go by of me doing what I done before occasionally leaving a little love note here and there with nothing but the messages being sent and not received (all the messaging was over Facebook messenger) then another month goes by and I see her on a new profile and now she has a boyfriend... But during the time I wasn't talking to her I had signed up for the military and knew I was leaving for basic training in about half a month so I got sad but said hey I'm going to be gone anyways...a month into basic I get separated medically for something that happened when I was a baby (that's a whole other story) so I come home and I have a friend request from her I accept it and that's that but I just couldn't stop thinking of her so one day I message her just ""hey"" I was going to see how she was how everything's been and she replies with a long apology saying she's sorry she couldn't talk to me and all that I tell her it's ok I'll always love her and that's when she lets me know she loves me too but she has a boyfriend...

320,"I have just graduated from my bachelor's degree in Marketing and I have realised during my time studying that the part I found myself most interested in is the psychological elements of marketing. SO I would love to further educate myself in the psychology field... but the problem is that I am 23 years old and start all over again would take about 5 years of studying (if everything goes right ....) which would make me about 29 years old when graduating psychology (if I do so) I think that is too old.

The best idea is to attend a Master's degree in a field combining economics with a more psychological approach such as evolutionnary behavioral economy for example. Only problem is the only university that offers such a course near where I live has told me the chance of me getting in with only my marketing knowledge is slim, because no neuropsychology background. The more I think about it the more I wish I had studied psychology but I'm intimidated by starting 5 years again instead of doing a master of 1 or 2 years.

323,"17 yo dude. In college. 

My life’s a complete mess right now. 
Context: Never had friends in Middle and High school. 

Now I’m in College and I made many friends but I somehow can’t get along very easily per say. 
I can’t work well in projects, I get stressed out easily, makes me say the wrong things, and I don’t admit when I am wrong. 

Have faced multiple mental health issues. I’m quite out of it now but nowadays I feel it is coming back, specifically depression. 

Long post ahead. 
TLDR: ALL my friends said I’m too egotistical. Said a lot of harsh shit about my mum to my friends because she threatened to call the cops because I was underage smoking which is against the law (she found my packs and whatever I said about my mum is mentioned below) 

So my friends kinda told me i’m too egotistical and I’m being a dick to everyone most of the time (in general sense) 
They think I’m not comfortable with myself. Problem with the way I react and think. 
They also think I’m not ready for any emotional relationship and I should stay out of it. 

Everyone’s been telling me that. My parents, friends and even extended family. (cousins n stuff) 

They also think I get into “fight” mode really easily where I always have to counter whatever people say. 

The conversation with my friends started today because just yesterday I had a HUGE blown up argument with my parents because I’ve been smoking cigarettes. I lied to them despite them asking me and then they found my packs in my school bag. 

I had a BIG fight with my parents, mum specifically and pretty much degraded her to my friends in school because I felt she is too over protective, feel like I’m being treated as a kid and as a prisoner sometimes. And the reason why it was a BIG fight was because she threatened to call the cops on me because it’s against the law to smoke underage where I live. (smoking legal age is 19) 

I said really harsh shit about parents, specifically my mum,  to my friends. My friends kinda wanted me to stop saying it. I said shit like how I wish I was an orphan, or if it was better off if they died or I died or lived without them (parents are both 58 with me turning 18 this year) 

My friends were telling me that I should change myself and I just said that I don’t know how and I just give up and it’s better for me to go back to being depressed so I don’t be like this. Last thing is my friends think I’m too uptight and that can be a factor as well. Can’t take jokes, very sensitive. 

So ego is my biggest problem and I don’t know how to just stop acting this way. 
I do want things to change but I don’t know how. 

Please advice me 
I appreciate all inputs and thanks in advance !

326,"My ex fiancé and I were engaged for over a year. We also lived together. I am on the lease and so is he, but he paid for the bills while I was in school. He has broken my trust before and I realize I should’ve ran for the hills, but I tried so hard to make it work. I had some bad trust issues with him and always felt like he was going to hurt me again, but I ignored myself and kept the relationship going. I asked him if everything was alright this past Sunday night because it felt like there was a little distance between us. I said it felt like there was something going on that I just couldn’t put my finger on. He changed his phone password, turned off his notifications, because I needed to “trust him more.” His bank account stated he went to these places and spent way more than just a single meals price on his lunch break at school. I asked him about these things and he called me crazy. And then, he literally told me he wants to just be single. I was crushed. I cried the entire night while he slept peacefully next to me. I had no idea what this meant, I offered to work it out with him, give him his space and what he needs. He was so adamant about getting me out. The next morning, I packed a small bag and headed to my dads house. I forgot so many essential things, so I ended up having to go back and decided I would pack everything at once once I was back at the apartment. He was there, alone, not giving me any other reasoning. I cried my eyes out for four hours as I took down all my decorations. I packed up all my things. He cried at some points but was still acting so cold to me. I asked him how could he throw me out of my home. He told me he just wants to “find himself because he’s been feeling like he’s so distant from reality nowadays” (total bullshit.) I was crushed and confused. I finally left and went to my dads house.

I couldn’t eat for two days. I couldn’t sleep either. I was constantly wondering if he’d realize what a mistake he’d made and come back with apologies like he’d been under stress and he’s sorry, etc.

My neighbor from the apartment complex delivers food in the area. She just happened to be driving right past the restaurant where he and another girl (who has a boyfriend) were eating. Not to mention the same restaurant we discovered and would always go together to. She immediately texted and told me about it. I asked her to see where they went afterwards. He took her right back to our apartment. This is less than 24 hours than when I just moved out. The same apartment I lived in, worked in, fell in love with, and I’m sure the same bed I slept in, they fucked in.

She actually took a picture of them together for proof, because I confronted him over text message. He denied everything profusely, said he was with another person. I sent him the picture of them two, and he didn’t reply. He met this girl in a program at school they are both in. He told me he knew her from something previously, and told me not to worry about it since she has a boyfriend and that he’s “in love with me.”

So it’s been a really rough two fucking days for me guys. I’m over at my dads house. I’m not sure what to make of this situation. When I found out, I was just so numb. I woke up this morning with extreme anxiety and had to breathe to calm down. Does anyone have any advice... or has anyone been through something similar? I can’t believe he just crumbled up our relationship and threw me in the garbage.

332,"Hi guys,

i need to say that my personal nature is quite weird when it comes to relations/emotions. I hardly feel that thing called ""love"" at all (noticed that already a time ago, also think that it heavily depends on how much work the partners are willing to put in), but i just recently noticed how i heard her laughing (without being with me) and I genuinely felt warm inside. Also during christmas break, where we were apart for almost 2 weeks, i noticed that i miss her already.  
Due to the fact that we need to go to our home-countries soon again, 1000km apart, are we planning our future. Im thinking every now and then about something to break the relation but I deep inside know that I would do that to just take the easy route and be emotional safe. I may also think that I am not worth it and that i am going to hurt her ( because i broke up all relationships after around that mark of 3 months) and she's just the sweetest girls of all i've met so far. I just feel very uncomfortable to plan moving together after our studies and stuff, not because of her, but because of the commitment we both have. We are together for a bit over 3 months by now.

Im currently ""fighting"" those emotions with thinking about the upsides such a relation with such a partner has. We could explore the world, live in different countries and support each other to reach our goals. But as my mind is, its start to not get influenced by these thoughts anymore since the ""separating"" date comes so soon, and from there on we would have to commit really hardly. **Does any of you knows what could help me?** I am talking with her about this, but i am for sure not going to mention that I am not that falling in love guy or feeling hardly anything. She knows what i am thinking, but its ofc also really hard for her to commit with someone being as instable as i am (i already tried to break the relationship due to the exactly same negative thoughts, and she managed to back me up and support me which was quite the achievement).

I am really looking forward to any help, please just nothing negative since i am really bad at distinguishing between good and bad advises here...

343,"I am a 22 [m] struggling to make ends meet, i dont have a particularly bad upbringing but not a good one that left me emotionally scarred as i was physically and emotionally abused as a child.

My father is a bad alcoholic that even after going through and completing AA twice still reguses to believe he has a problem and won't stop.

My mother is an emotionally abused wife who only advice is passive aggressive due to fear of crossing my dad and being on his radar.

He watches everything i do always knows where im going and he has been on this power kick where he is constantly talking about throwing me out and trying to make up reasons as to why he should.

He blames me for messes i never make i got to a point where i was sick of it and found a reasonable way proving i dont and that jes blaming me for his messes.

Its become clear to me when i heard him talking to my mother about throwing me out [again] and reasons why. One of the main ones was ""it would be less heartache on the family"" in turmoil and sickened by this i called my older brother, he had been through the same thing, my father threw him out and he had to rely on friends to get by.

When i told him what had been said he seemed angered by this and just replied, ""what family is he talking about"" the conversation went no where from here though, just alot of advice that doesent help that was the only real comment he had made.

The other advice was more like ""someday you'll look back on this and laugh"" just general comments to get me off the phone.

We got off the phone and im still sitting here at 3 in the morning wondering what to do. He has already thrown my brother out but he relied on the kindness of his friends. I have none i would surely suffer greatly and being a past addict i would never make it.

I dont know what to do my job is part time i work maybe 3 days a week, i had a job making good money but it was only temporary work during this time i spoke highly of my job and was super happy thinking i woild finally get to leave and not be street bound like my father hoped.

During this time my dad introduced me to some ""friends"" who later turned out to be dealers and anyone that knows dealers they are good at getting in ur head and i was quickly hooked and on the stuff again.

Needless to say the money went everywhere but to me starting my life, which i feel was to his liking even further because he seems to be trying to convince my mother that my only way is to be thrown out and she wont hear of it because of how it upset her when my older brother had to endure the same.

Hes trying to make reasons as to why im unfit to live here i had quit doing drugs and was clean before he introduced me to his ""friends"" i thought he was trying to help me maybe find someone to be a roommate with or something more positive.

I realized his intentions one day when i was upset and venting about the money i had lost and wish i would have seen it coming. He smirked and simply said ""i can get you to do anything""

After this my mom was talking about helping me to get a place, having heard this before and avoiding getting my hopes up i qanted to keep it on perspective knowing how my father is, so simply said ""get his permission first he's the one that has an issue with it""

He of course hates the idea as usual and said i would just trash it and use it as a party house and on and on. But fails to realize i was clean before his friends got ahold of me and anyone that knows addicts knows that staying clean also requires you to stay away from those people for a reason.

He doesent want me to have help but je doesent also want me clean and constantly says he wants me out, he clearly stated the only way im getting out is feet first, im stuck and dont know what to do in a wreck enough.

How do i get through to him to stop this fascination with throwing his children out, i have 3 brothers my oldest didnt get thrown out, why must my middle brother and i suffer this way?

344,"Hi there, 

I am 18+++ year old person who has a nice patchwork family. I got my father (not bio), my mom, stepmom, lots of siblings, cousins and whatnot. When I was 14 my father told me he wasn't my bio father. Tbh I didn't give a shit, because when I was 10 I already had the same talk with my grandma who is the second wife of my grandfather. So mentally I really always was in a ""you are in my life, you care = you are family to me"" state of mind. But, it came as a surprise to me that my mom didn't tell me that and when confronted, she first got angry that he told me without her consent, then she didn't want to tell me more, promising me that she'd tell me when I was 18.

Fast forward many, many years. I finally got my answers which I waited for the \_majority\_ of my life (but seems like I just got 18 now according to my mom's promise.)

The story that my mom told me (INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY, but a summary of her story):   
he married two women to grant them citizenship - for money, (before he met my mom, but she made it sound like the second marriage wasn't even over when he already proposed to her)  
he had a very very traditional mindset regarding women and work, or women in general and respected her as such, (given that is multiple decades ago, this still might have been normal back then, idk)  
he got mercenary training (don't know if he worked as such) maybe somewhere in Algeria, details unknown, if he ever worked as such is unknown,   
he kept a weapon at home (NOT U.S.! so this is kinda weird, strange and dangerous behavior and big red flag) *without a weapon safe*, which adds to the dangerous and stupid thing,  
he borrowed LOTS of money from my mom for his car and gave her the papers as security but she found out that he resold the car thus was scamming her and at least one other person for money,   
he threatened her multiple times to give him back the papers for the car without returning the owed money to her, finally trying to get the papers by filing them ""lost"" (=trying to steal the security for the money from her),  
he supposedly asked her to pack her bags in a hurry and flee the apartment with him and live out of the car for a few days all while she was highly pregnant (with me), (this one has an ADDED ""supposedly"" because she isn't even clear on what they ran away from),  
he came home late most nights and after my birth she finally got the courage to check on him/see why he isn't sleeping in the master bedroom and noticed he is drunk, thus interpolating he came home late AND DRUNK all these weeks/months, thus classifying him as an alcoholic. -- this last one was the reason she finally cut her losses and kicked him out even though he left her lots of debt. (Whether he was an alcoholic or not is unclear to me, also, why she never noticed before, but hey, who didn't believe a lot of lies for stupid behavior from someone we love(d) and later noticed how stupid we were for excusing their behavior?)

Now, I always was curious about my bio-f but I am realistic and know the best thing he could have been for me now is only a ""good friend"". And that was my thinking before the story. Now I know a one-sided story of someone who I found in social media, seems to have a new, much much younger daughter and seems to be politically active and respected in his town.

**TLDR**: my bio-f seems to have been a major danger ranging from scammer to violent tendencies to keeping weapons to alleged problems with dangerous people -- I was curious to meet him as a person (not as father) for most of my life but am conflicted now that I heard one side of the truth, and I am TONS of ways of conflicted about all parts of the story.

My questions (3) I am asking myself and not getting enough PROs/CONs to make up my mind, thus trying to reap the benefits of HIVE MIND ""reddit"", is:  
**SHOULD I meet/contact him?** And if so, **HOW SHOULD I do it**, keeping in mind that I would like to always have a safe ""opt-out"" door which I can chose to take and not be involved with him anymore, if anything turns bad? And: **CAN PEOPLE CHANGE** as in ""can they change THAT MUCH""?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll take the following questions away:

He knows he has me as a daughter, he knew me for 2 weeks before getting kicked out, I do not know if he tried to keep in contact but was shut off or he didn't bother, nobody of my family has kept in touch with him. The 2 weeks he knew me he is said to have been proud and has been showing me off to people (as contrary to loving) but to be fair, every person shows affection differently and I know that. Also I got different names soon after so he couldn't have kept in touch.",23Jan2019,1
345,"We got into discussing our economic opinions last night, and it just kind of hit me like a ton of bricks that we’re very different people. He’s not a bad guy at all, but I just realized the depth of his self-centeredness when he was saying things about not minding stepping on and over folk to get ahead in life because he thinks that’s just how it is.  I do love my bro, sincerely, but I know I’m prone to cutting people who think like this off, and I’m feeling dread from the idea of the friendship breaking down eventually.  Ultimately, my political and economic views are important to me, and I don’t think I’d ever be the sort of person who doesn’t care what someone else’s views are.

And previously I've gotten interviews for every job I've applied to, I stopped being able to really work in September. My mental health was deteriorating, I was really depressed (which I didn't realize at the time, I knew something was wrong but idk) so I quit my job and took a break, having the money to live off of while I try to work on myself (living with partner at this point). Got hired for another job at UO near the end of October, early November I was involved in a domestic dispute with my partner in which I was unfairly arrested for defending myself (It's extremely difficult to talk about so I'll leave out the details). Because of the injury I sustained to my ribs I missed my first few scheduled shifts, I told them what was going on and they were understanding.... I probably worked 3 shifts, but my mental health kept getting in the way I just couldn't do it. And my missing the first few shifts made a huge difference for me, if any of you have anxiety that affects you in this way... You'll understand. I haven't contacted them or been back since basically this time last month, I have a small amount of money to be collected from there (about $50....) but don't think I'll be able to pick it up due to my anxiety, I cry and start hyperventilating every time I try to call or email. I've been applying for other jobs I believe I can handle, for over a month now and haven't gotten any interviews....

The only problem is that my boyfriend wouldn't be comfortable with me doing it, which I understand. But I need money and he can't give me the money I need (nor would I want to ask), I love him so much but honestly I need to keep myself alive...

353,"TLDR at bottom

Last year I moved into my grandma's house after she moved out. I ran into some financial struggles and was forced to look for a roommate. I had a friend stay over one night and asked him if he was interested since every other friend I have wasn't financially able. He said it was a definite possibility. 

A month later he texts me and asks if the room is still available and I told him yes. He said he'd take it and I told him I just wanted 400 a month. He said that was fine and he could move in the following Thursday. 

So I went to the spare bedroom and cleaned it out. Went to the store and bought some paint and gave the room a fresh coat to the color he wanted. I also wanted him to feel welcome and I bought him some groceries, beer, and a TV mount so he could save the floor space as it was a smaller sized room. 

On Thursday I text him asking what time he was coming. Didn't get an answer until 9pm saying that work kept him late and he'd have to come next Thursday. Fine, no big deal. The following Thursday I text him again. No response. Call, yet again no response. Never showed. 

It's been several months now and I haven't heard from him at all. He posts on Facebook and Snapchat so I know he's alive and his phone works. I had to move out of the house because I couldn't afford it. 

I've known this guy since college and considered him one of my best friends. 

Question: should I confront him on this or just let it go? And how should I go about calling him out on it?

356,"I sincerely hope he doesn't see this. I also hope I'm not overreacting here. This is a long text. 
My brother is 17. I'm 20. Our mother happens to have a mood disorder and she gets depressed every now and then. 
I want to make one thing very clear. We have never had fights in our family. We've always had a great relationship and there has never been any issues whatsoever. I love my brother, and I hope he knows that. Mom loves him to death.
But something changed when he started dating this girl last year in April. 

He was living with his father at the time but eventually he wanted to leave and live with me and mom instead.
I didn't get to see him very often when he lived with his dad, but when I did I noticed that he seemed a bit off. 
He told me he had become depressed and that was why he wanted to live with us. He never told me why he was depressed, but I didn't want to push him so I just made sure to be there for him. 
His dad and stepmom eventually refused to let his girlfriend visit them cause they said she was manipulating him. My brother got mad at them and wanted to leave ASAP. I helped him get out of there, and then his girlfriend was allowed to live at our place as well. She paid for food and whatnot and we had no issues with her at first.

We got along really well and she would gladly help around the house. 
Mom eventually fell into a depressive episode and made the house look like a mess, among other things. She got mad at us three after telling her that we had cleaned up around the house. She felt personally attacked for whatever reason, but she eventually got better and apologized. Her mood improved quickly. 
I spent a lot of time hanging out with my bro and his girlfriend. A lot of time. 

Then I noticed that my brother's girlfriend would not fucking stop complaining about mom. Everything she did was wrong. Everything. 
I obviously got mad listening to my brother's girlfriend, who mom allowed to live with us, talk so much shit about our own mother directly behind her back. 
I tried to stay calm at first. ""Haven't you noticed that she has actually improved lately? She's really trying, you know.""
""I guess but she's still not good enough."" and she kept complaining. Sometimes when I picked them up after school, the first thing she did was talk shit about mom. My brother never defended her. Not even once. It pissed me off. It was so unlike him.

My brother seemed even more off than before. Distant, and almost cold. He has never been like that before, but he never wanted to talk to either mom or me about it so we assumed that he would tell us if we had done something wrong. 

His girlfriend began trying to control everything around the house. She also began controlling him. She began insulting mom right in front of her (claiming she was only joking) but she was not. She knew exactly what to say to make mom feel like shit. Mom didn't want to fight with her, so she ignored her.
But his girlfriend acted like nothing was wrong. She had never told mom why she was so mad at her. Never. She just made passive aggressive comments. 
My brother became even more distant. He seemed completely disinterested in the stuff he used to like. I could barely recognize him. He never wanted to hang out nor talk with either of us. 

When his girlfriend was mad at mom, she took it out on him. If she was mad at me, she took it out on him.
He was the one who told us if she was mad at us. 

I got tired of her bullshit, and asked her ""Have you even talked to mom? If you're so unhappy with her then you should fucking talk with her about it."" She told me that she did. That was a lie. 
Then she began trying to get ME to turn against mom. I basically told her to shut the fuck up. 

I soon after heard from my brother that she wanted to leave because she was so mad at mom. 
Again, she had not mentioned anything to mom. She had never tried talking it out with her. 

And then one day, my brother told me he wanted to move. I asked him why. He just said ""I don't like it here"". I told him to talk to mom about it, but he never did. No explanations. 
I tried asking him what was wrong, but he never answered.

I told mom what his girlfriend had said her behind her back, and her reaction was basically ""haha ok i'm kicking her out. I'm not having this shit anymore"".
Mom eventually asked her if she had talked shit about her, which she completely denied. Mom then told her that I was the one who told her about it. She didn't respond. 
After a short argument, she kicked her out.
The last thing she said to mom was ""How does it feel knowing your own children hates you?"" And laughed.

My brother got extremely mad. We both tried explaining to him why we wanted her to leave. He thought we were attacking him. 
The next day he just got on a train and left. 
We're not entirely sure where he is. His girlfriend knows where he is but refuses to tell us.

He eventually texted both me and mom. Told mom that she had used him as ""her personal slave"", which is completely untrue, and that neither of us have ever supported him nor cared for him. We asked what we did wrong. He just said everything was our fault. He demanded mom to give him money so he could live in his own apartment, otherwise he'll never talk to us again. She refused.
He had tried contacting a social worker so they would help him. They didn't want to, and instead told him to head back home. 
The social worker is trying to help us get him back home, but it's hard since we don't know where he is. 

The cops won't help us. They called his girlfriend's mother and she doesn't want to help us at all. She actually demanded the cops to get my brother his own apartment cause he's not leaving. She also told them ""he's feeling well"" but the cops never managed to talk to him about it.
So since she told them he's feeling well, they see no reason to help us.


We have absolutely no idea what to do. This is so unlike him. He has never done anything like this. ",23Jan2019,1

The cat has been here a few months and it's scratched some furniture, mainly the living room sofa. As far as I can tell the cat hasnt damages my own room.

I work for a 3rd party retailer for one of the big three wireless carriers. I've been there for almost a year and in my time there, the store manager who hired me has quit, leaving the position open. Our manager (prior to her leaving) suggested that I apply for the position. This is where I'm conflicted.

My coworker has basically been there since they opened the store. When his first manager was fired for ""fighting a customer,"" he was told he was next to get the job. Then the woman who hired me happened and he was overlooked. Now, all of this is happening and rumors from other stores have been saying that he's going to be overlooked again and that there's a strong chance that I will be the next manager.

Obviously I feel very concerned about this because my coworker has been there for me every single step of the way and DESERVES to be the store manager. I've made it clear to all of the higher ups that if it were down to him and I for the position, I would happily step back so that he could have the opportunity. My husband disagrees and says that I deserve it and that upper management see that.

What do I do? Do I put myself first and leap at the opportunity or do I give it to someone who has busted his bottom to get it?

368,"So let’s start from the beginning... I graduated high school then almost immediately moved to the other side of the country. Dad got a promotion at work, you know the deal. Initially the idea was to do some tech college or go for my AA, but I ended up just going to work for my dad full time. 5 years eating shit for no money got old so I branched out. I’m pretty out-going, charismatic, methodical, and I like a good party... so I figured fk it - I’ll tend bar. Did a year and a half of bar tending, managed a brand new bar from opening day for about a year and a half. 

Opportunity came knocking, and I moved on it. My brother got into a sales job, real entry level, smile and dial shit. He pulled me in with him, my brother and I are 2 years apart, and we do literally everything together, shit we shared the same room for 12-15 years growing up. I hated the job at first, wasn’t a fan of the product, nor the environment, but I saw all the people around me killing it (some making 20k+/wk) so I stuck to it, and got good at it. About three months in my brother approached me and looked me right in the face and told me “we’re quitting today.” 🤨 long story short, 2 of the top producers of that firm I was at were plotting to break off and start their own firm, my brother and I were their top prospects to come with them. 

Fast forward 1 1/2 years - I had never made more than 30-35k/yr... I made 70k my first year doing this(at 23/24 years old), I was loving it... then my boss went to prison. He’s an awesome dude, just got caught up in some stupid shit, white collar, Wall Street crime. Went away for 13 months, and the whole firm slowly fell apart. His partner was a fulll blown sociopath, embodied the word toxic, we would butt heads so bad it would end in yelling fights in the office. 

Opportunity came knocking, offering stability, benefits, PTO, Salary, and a great commission structure, I chomped at the bit. This company is a market leader at what they do, awesome company. I got my brother an interview and we both got the job. I tried using the job offer as a way to bait a counter offer from where I was already at to get partial ownership of the company. No go.. I took the offer. I was happy because I wanted my brother out of that industry and into something more stable but I knew there was still money there to be made for me. 

Anyways, I dove into the new job head first, and actually loved it. The people/company were fucking fantastic, in fact the people is what makes this so hard. I’m doing good at the job, but honestly I hate it. Love the people, hate the job. 

My past boss that went to prison gets out.. mind you, him and I kept in touch over the time he was in. He’s like my mentor in a way. Gets out and tells me his current partner is driving him insane, lazy, drug issues, doesn’t contribute.. ya know the whole nine. Tells me he wants to start a new office, offers me a salary, a generous percentage of the company, and a big sign on bonus to eat my current book I’ve been building over the last year. This is exactly what I wanted, a year ago before I quit... 

So now that I’ve gotten all that out of the way, the advise I need... I don’t want to quit my current job right away, because I won’t get the sign on bonus for another month, I have big checks still coming in from my current job, and we still need to get the new office set up. 

We have quarterly reviews coming up, and I know my goals will be questioned. These people have been so good to me. In that meeting I’m going to have to either Lie to my current bosses face, or tell him the truth and risk being fired when I still need the commissions owed to me. If I do lie, when I quit in a month he’s going to be pissed I lied. I don’t want to burn this bridge...

I’m not here to trivialize what she was going through, as her depression and suicidal tendencies were serious. I had always been the stable rock in our friendship (it lasted for 8.5 years!) and had never really needed her to be there for me in that way. But the one time I did...I got told to wait until she was available to talk to me. She was busy now and had no time for me, but if I waited a month she’d have nothing else to do and would have the time of day for me. That was after I confronted her about her long silences and brushing me off. So we’re no longer friends. It was a slow death really, cutting off one thing after another on her side. I’m ashamed to say that even though I was the one to tell her off, she had to cut me off. 

Anyways, in her post I found she trashed me and the rest of her old friends for associating with someone who sexually assaulted her in the past. It’s heavy stuff, but the context behind it is all wrong and I really wanted to reply. To get her and the other anonymous people to understand. But reddit and posting is her safe space.

Nothing really matters to me like “what movie do you want to see?” This might not seem like a huge deal but it is when I have no preference at all!

He told me he has insomnia most nights. And the only way he can fall asleep is it he talks to this imaginary girl that he made up in his head. She’s standing in an intersection and there are cars all around her and she’s scared. And every night he talks her to calm her down. And this is how he falls asleep.

He talked about her like she was a real person that he cared for. But he did acknowledge that she was in his imagination. I’ve never heard anything like this. Is it normal? Should I be telling him to seek therapy? Or continue dating him normally?

381,"I went to a hotel in the US that was part of a chain and the front desk clerk ripped my passport. They never said anything about it and the next day i realized that a part of my passport was missing. 
The hotel manager found that piece of paper in their office trash. 
The issue is that a valid passport is a requirement of employment for me so I had to rush to the airport to not miss my flight. I didn’t take time to take anybody’s name and all (rookie mistake I know)
Because I had reported a passport stolen in 2015, I am only eligible for a 2 year passport at a time, until this ripped passport expires which is 8 years from now. The total cost of all that is 2030$ just in passport fees, not mentioning the waste of time and money since this interrupted a mini vacation. 
I have called the hotel chain 4 times and emailed as well. I haven’t been hearing anything back from anybody there. 
I am wondering if anyone here would have any suggestions of what do next. Is there actually something that can be done ?

382,"Hey everyone.

So, I'll be heading to college in a few short months. Expect to get accepted to a few pretty good CS major colleges as an international student. And I love studying CS. I do.

But I've been coming to the realization that I love filmmaking more. I'm good at CS, but it doesn't engross me for countless hours the way that filmmaking and storytelling does. From what I've read, you don't need to go to film school to become a director, at all, really. And now I'm very very confused as to what I should do.

I'm an overachiever, and I'm constantly feeling like everyone expects me to cure cancer when really I want to make short films and movies. I feel dumb and like I'm letting those people down.

I'd appreciate any kind of input.

Thank you.

tl;dr signed up for CS, may want to do filmmaking, unsure of what to do.",23Jan2019,1

Long story short, the replacement is a mutual friend of us all who does photography in the group. 


I feel like while she probably doesn’t have all that money sitting around, she she should at least offer me a free or discounted family photo shoot or something else that doesn’t really hinder her, seeing as she is getting a fully paid all inclusive cruise paid by me. What’s worse is Carnival even said I’d get the money back if I disputed it, but at this point I don’t want to ruin if for her. Do I ask? Not ask?

So I'm 18 and unemployed. I had a job in the service industry, and I hated it. I felt nothing but dread going into work, and I quit because I just couldn't take it anymore. Enough about that though. So, I currently have zero prospects. There is good money in IT and I could get an apprenticeship in that, however the money is pretty bad, the hours are rubbish, and I have no clue if I'm cut out for it. I also know nothing about IT.

In my spare time I like to write, trawl the internet for music as that's really my only passion, and learn. I have a fascination with films and acting, but that's a pretty inconceivable career path for me. I play bass and guitar also, and I sing when no one's around because I'm god awful. But again, there's no money in music.

My grades are pretty average. I passed everything, but it's not something I would brag about. So, as a result my CV is average, as I quit my monotonous college course after a year because of how worthless it was.

389,"So my Dad is 54 and has been (officially) unemployed for 5 or more years now although still does some work from time to time with his mate - he was a floorlayer.

Since he is at home all day basically all he does is drink and he will go through a box of 20 Tennants beers in one day. He stays up until about 6am in the morning before going to bed and then waking up at 2pm to do it all over again. He usually drinks at least 4 days out of the week and I imagine he consumes about 80-100 500ml cans of beer. In my opinion he needs help however if I or my Mum was to say this to him he would lose his shit. He isn't an angry drunk or anything and would literally just sit there and watch tv or whatever but he would become angry if I said he has a problem. 

He has been stuck in a rut for a long time now and clearly he isn't changing and I'm worried that his drinking will be severely damaging to his health as if I was to guess I would say he weighs around 18 stone (250lbs-ish)

Big mistake! (My therapist helped me realize this was an unhealthy result of my people-pleasing.)

398,"I met this guy thru a mutual friend... this guy I’ve been talking to doesn’t even live in the same state as I do, we’ve visited each other about 3 times in the course of 10 months. We’ve communicated via text, calls and FaceTime. During my second visit we slept with each other. I’ve had conversations with him regarding the nature of our relationship and where it’s headed. He stated numerous times that we aren’t exclusive, that I can date other people and he encouraged me to do so.  He has some issues with his legal status in this country and for that reason and the long distance he felt like we can’t put a label on it...And it wouldn’t be fair for me to wait for him and deal with his situation.. 

During this time I slept with someone and I didn’t tell him about. 

He found this out recently through a phone call in which I told him that I was asked out on date but wasn’t planning to go thru with it because I wasn’t interested. He then tells me I’m free to do whatever I want but if I do then he and I aren’t a thing... I was confused.... I said, wait we are a thing? I thought we weren’t? And then he asked me... have you slept with someone else besides me? And I responded with yes. That’s when the shit storm occurred. He never wants to speak to me again and I’ve respected his wishes. We weren’t dating, he never called me  girlfriend and yet I feel like shit for hurting him like that. 

Earlier this week he sent me a message. The message contained screenshots of an email  in which he and a recruiter were discussing his availability for a final interview... turns out he was planning to move out to my city just to be with me. His message calls me a pathetic liar and some other hurtful things about my mental health (I have depression). 

I want to explain to him that I did not cheat for the reasons I’ve mentioned in this post. I thought of replying to his last message or sending him a letter. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want him to hate me and I’m sorry I hurt him. I lost a lover and a friend...

I went to school there from 1st grade to 7th grade and then moved to the US with my father at the age of 10 so I can get the citizenship. In my country I was always doing better than my siblings in school I got near perfect scores every test and subject. When I moved to the US it was a complete cultural shock and it was very difficult to deal with considering all my relatives in America are workers and not well educated and barley speak english. When I got to the US my dad decide it would be better if I lived with my 35 years old brother. Living with him a few months he bought a grocery store and started a business with another partner. Soon later I was enrolled in school. Schools in the US are very distinct from the schools in my country and it was very difficult to compete against my classmates considering I don’t speak the language. I didn’t give up and kept trying. A bit later my brother started making me work in this business he bought as a cashier. I would go to school come back at 3PM and work until 1AM everyday. In the weekends I would come to the store at 8AM and work until 1PM. I was told that I am working for 50$ but I didn’t get a dollar put of it. At the time I thought it was fine since I am helping my brother, But because of it I started falling school and barley passing.

I cooked for them, and did chores as much as I could didn’t enjoy a fraction of my fucking childhood but they would still mentally fuck the shit out of me and call me a failure because I didn’t manage to learn english in the 1 year I was in school. I threw my passion for education and decided to help them and they still shat on me for it. I cried many times because my brother wouldn’t give me permission to go play soccer with friends I made. I tried to make me feelings clear to my brother but he would make fun of me or joke about my feelings. It kept building up, I was getting abused by everyone physically and mentally I kept it all in and told no one. I would smile and make my friends in school laugh although I just slept on the fucking stairs the night before. I wasn’t allowed to go home my only place was that fucking store. I would only go to the house at 1pm when the shops closes. It got so unbearable and I wanted no one to know. I missed my mother and sisters. My older brothers and father would take their shit on me and never listen to me and put me in the wrong.

He wouldn’t let me go home but finish my shift. I was at the back crying and working and this women who is a customer who always was nice to me and treated me nicely walked to the back and saw me crying and looked at me with sad eyes. It broke my fucking heart I’ve always wanted to not let myself be a burden to anyone and seeing her get remotely upset made me so much more upset. That night it was my first suicide attempt as I couldn’t get the fact that my family member hit me for defending myself and someone who treated me nice almost cried to seeing my pathetic self. Nobody knew about that suicide attempt and life kept going and finally graduated from middle school. Which was the day I noticed how alone I am.

They don’t listen to me nor care for my side if the story. One time I got into a fight with my older brother and when my dad came the first thing he did was yell at me and call me a degenerate. I tried to explain to him what happened and that I did nothing fucking wrong he slammed the door in my face. It hurts so much it really does. I am alone I hate myself because I am not the person they want me to be. My mothers and sisters are the only people who keep me going. But it’s been months since I’ve talked to them last since I am afraid that if I do talk to them I would eventually hear them call me a failure which will make me fucking lose it. I’ve tried my best to satisfy them I just can’t please them. I am asking for advice on how to deal with them. I want to move out but that scares me so much. Ever since I was 10 I’ve been told I won’t amount to anything. I am afraid to start a relationship I am afraid to open up to people. I am afraid of proving them right. I’ve never told anyone about this and I don’t think I will but please if you have an advice let me know. These people have crushed every single will I have and have mentally fucked me. I am starting to go insane I laugh uncontrollably when they yell at me. I am working my ass off and somehow still ain’t good enough. I don’t want to kill myself because I know my mom would be upset and thats not what I want. So please if you can give me an advice help me I am suffering severely.

411,"I’ve known him for 4 years now, met him in college as we are both in the same program. Always been a really intelligent guy, but burdened by brilliance. He has very strict parents that were incredibly hard on him, and he has a lot of trauma from his upbringing and a weird family relationship. 

Every time I see him, and he is now my roommate so that’s pretty often, it turns into a 1-2 hour monologue over how much he regrets coming to our university, how he hates it here, how he has it hard since he’s Indian, can’t get a gf bc hes Indian, etc etc. and I have always been there to listen and try to give him advice. 

It’s been like this as long as I’ve known him, and I feel guilty that I don’t even want to talk to him or hangout with him because i know that at some point, he’s going to talk about these same things over and over again. It’s mentally and physically draining and it’s causing me to resent him. 

In the past I’ve brought up he should consider seeing a therapist to talk about things with, since he desperately needs to. But his answer was “Why do I need to pay someone when I can just talk to you?” Or copped out due to his pride.

412,"Background: I never wanted to go to law school. I went because I struggled finding a job coming out of undergrad and I couldn't sit around waiting for something. I hated/hardly tried in law school, got out with a decent GPA. I did the minimum studying for the bar and I (un)luckily passed. 

 About me: 25 years old, practicing in Ohio. Sports Management undergrad, living at home with parents. I've worked as a law clerk for about year for this firm before starting this position. 

Since then I've been practicing as an attorney for 3 months now and I hate every moment of it. I work in a small personal injury firm, and when I was first hired, it seemed like a great opportunity. I'm not being paid much, but its more than I've ever made and the hours weren't bad and my boss said it would be a good opportunity to learn.

But in the time I've been here I feel like the only thing I've learned is that I hate practicing law. I work 8:30am - 6/6:30pm everday, I dread showing up to work so much that I stay up until 1/2 am every night and am late nearly everyday. I've completely lost what little interest I've had left in legal work, and every assignment just makes me more stressed. I have absolutely no desire to get better at my job.I'm tired of dealing with deadlines, getting yelled at by my boss for things that are out of my control, and talking to clients who clearly don't care enough to give me what I need to complete their case. Honestly don't care very much about these clients or their issues. 

Every day when I come home I'm grumpy, irritable, and too tired to do anything. Being at work all day just sucks everything out of me. I'm starting to get really annoyed by everything outside of the office and it is worrying my mom and girlfriend.

I need to find something else to do, but I feel like I've wasted so much time accidentally becoming a lawyer, that I don't know what else to do. Not to mention I'm drowning in law school debt right now so I can't afford to quit my job until I find something else. I've tried looking for other jobs/careers but I just don't know what I could do. 

Nobody seems to understand. My parents only think ""you're a lawyer it'll be fine."" My law school friend who didn't pass the bar is jealous and says ""figure it out, you're lucky you passed and got a job immediately.""

She says she doesn’t want to rent anymore and she doesn’t want anyone telling her what she can and can’t do.

417,"I originally posted before thinking that the mold issue was in my air conditioning system, but it seems to be a much bigger issue.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a9xd3m/fl_potential_mold_and_health_issues_what_should_i/

To summarize:

I went to my landlord to get my air conditioning system cleaned after getting sick due to mold. The assistant manager sent maintenance to clean the unit, but mine and my s/o symptoms were still there, even after being treated by a doctor.

I go back and speak with the district manager of our apartment complex. I explain the situation and she instantly got SUPER defensive during the conversation. I was simply asking that she sends maintenance back to clean our air conditioning system, because we are still sick weeks later. She was trying to lecture me on medicine and mold, and she says, ""If there is mold, you would notice moisture and mold spots in the apartment!"" I told her that I did in fact mark moisture spots in the ceiling on my move-in checklist. Which she storms over and pulls to see that it was written down. She spends the next 5 minutes typing in her computer furiously, and afterwards says, we will send maintenance over tomorrow.

Maintenance never showed, so I go back to her office the following day, and as soon as I walk in, she puts her cell phone to her ear and locks herself in her office. I spoke with the assistant manager again, and maintenance comes the following day.

Now, it has been 2 weeks since my system has been cleaned a second time. We are still sick, and had to pay to get seen by a doctor again and for additional prescriptions. I go to the hardware store and purchased one of the petri dish air quality mold tests, and discover that there is still mold in the air of the apartment. What should I do next?

TLDR- Landlord has cleaned A/C system twice, but there is still mold in apartment (discovered through home testing). Still sick after 3 doctor's trips. What should I do next?",23Jan2019,1
418," This past Friday, I went on a snowboarding trip. On the third run, I was going straight pretty fast until I clipped my back heel and wiped out pretty hard. I flew down the trail a good 10-15 feet before coming to stop.

During the wipe out, I nailed my left hip on the ground pretty good. I didn't hear anything snap, but it hurt a lot. As I was laying on the ground, I could feel blood sort of flowing around the area internally. It also feel pretty warm.

The pain has definitely subsided since Friday to the point where the pain is more of a nuisance than actual pain. I'm just curious though if I need to be concerned that it still slightly hurts anytime I walk or move the upper half of my torso. There is no bruising, but it is tender when I touch it.

I assume it might just be deep bruising, but I want to hear from others who may know more about what may be the case. I know some injuries like this may not seem to be major right away until it prolongs for an extended amount of time and I just want to make sure mine isn't anything like this. So any thoughts and suggestions on this topic would be greatly appreciated!

419,"Hello r/Advice

I just arrived to visit my uncle yesterday, I see him about once a year because of distance. I had my concerns when he told me about this young, French woman who he had been messaging, but didn’t know how she found him. He went through a really rough breakup two years ago and still hasn’t recovered, so I just decided to accept it as something that might be good for him.

Later on in the evening, he asked me to work on his laptop. While doing so, their chat window was open and (shame on me) I snooped the whole damn thing. Firstly the selfies she’s sending of “herself” are actually Dani Daniels, the pornstar, which a simple reverse image search quickly revealed. I thought, okay maybe a bad catfish. And then, the smoking gun, several requests for my uncle to send her money. My uncle is struggling financially, and he smartly declined each time and got upset with her for asking. Though he does promise once he lands on his feet he’ll gladly support her.

As far as scams go, this is elaborate. They’ve been messaging for weeks now, it must’ve been two weeks before money was even mentioned. I commend the scammer’s dedication to lull their victims into a false sense of security, it’s truly conniving and predatory shit. My uncle truly seems to be infatuated with this made up woman who speaks broken English. Why they are targeting a man who has no money is beyond me, but I chalk that up to the language barrier.

Now, I know I have to tell him. And I know I can sugarcoat my snooping so it wouldn’t be such an argument either. My only worry is I can tell that, to him, this is truly one of the only good things he has going for him right now and finding out otherwise could be devastating. I’m confident that he’s a sharp enough guy that he won’t send them money, but the truth will come out eventually no doubt, that or the scammer will give up. What would be the best approach to tell him? ",23Jan2019,1

Apart from that he is really fun to be with and caring as well so you know he has the looks and his character is amazing.

At first, he didn't have this effect on me..but now I don't know what happened! I keep fantasizing about him like sexual thoughts and this mostly happens before I sleep. When I'm around him I act normal..so I don't flirt with him etc..he's married and I have a bf there is no chance in hell that something is going to happen between us but I keep having these thoughts and I feel guilty because I feel like I'm doing something wrong especially since I'm in a relationship.

She sits at home every day and does very little with her life. Her husband has recently said something inappropriate to me which made me feel uncomfortable and her very angry. Things have been sorted now but I can’t help but feel she resents me right now despite doing nothing wrong. Some people just need somebody to place the blame on I guess.

Anyway, I’ve made it very clear to her previously that I have no interest in Facebook or messenger etc. If she contacts me (which is very often), it’s normally via WhatsApp or text message. I rarely go on Facebook.

Today, she has messaged me on Facebook which I thought unusual. (She spends a lot of time on it).
I noticed she’d messaged me through a group which was also strange. The group was last used in 2017 when I was with my ex. He cheated, threatened to kill himself when I wouldn’t take him back so he was subsequently blocked on there for my own good. 

My friend and her husband kept him as a friend on there which is fine, he did nothing to them and it’s none of my business.

Anyway, she messaged me through this group today rather than directly. I noticed there was a third party in the group but couldn’t see their profile which prompted me to think it was somebody I’d blocked, after looking over the previous messaged sent in 2017 I realised it was my ex.

She has apologised and said it was an accident, but how could she have scrolled back all the way to 2017 when she’s been messaging me numerous times this year?

Hi there everyone,

I am on the lookout for international health insurance with maternity coverage. Unlike shopping for local health insurance, auto, or home insurance, this has been quite an overwhelming experience for me. Talking with agents and reading brochures (e.g. Cigna, Allianz) have only opened up more questions and doubt than actually giving me answers.

First off, a little about me - 27 year-old male, Filipino citizen, now living in the Netherlands, but travels frequently between European cities, maybe once a year to the US, and back to the Philippines once a year on home leave. My fiancee (29 year-old, also Filipino citizen) and I are getting married and I thought it would be prudent for both of us to be covered internationally (she tends to vacation often and also return to the Philippines often).

I would like to include a maternity coverage since I plan on beginning a family with her soon. We are both covered by the mandatory national insurance of the Netherlands, but I can imagine that she would rather give birth in either the US or Philippines where our relatives are. As far as I can tell, the Dutch national insurance (CZ) does not cover this.

What would be some of your recommendations? Suppose we want to explore the option of giving birth in the US or Canada, what would be a good mix of deductible and premium? I am used to 0 deductible, but I understand that this would mean a very high premium. What are your experiences with insurance providers and who would be best? What is the cost of giving birth in the US and Canada? (I know the cost here in the Netherlands and back home in the Philippines). What are your experiences of your spouses/partners giving birth abroad? What other things should I consider and take note of?

Thanks!",23Jan2019,1

449,"Some background: the last job I worked was in 2012 before spending the past 7 years taking care of my bedridden mother, so I'm not really sure the etiquette for things like this.

I sent in a resume to a craigslist posting and got a call back at about 6pm, within 10 hours of emailing it. Unfortunately I wasn't home and missed the call, and the message left said to give them a ring at any time. It was late so I waited until the next day (yesterday), and called around 2pm. I didn't get a response so I left a message with my phone number and the option to email me as it generally gets a faster response. 

I haven't heard since then and I'm being told I should call again by some people, and others telling me to hold off another day or so. I really don't want to mess this up as money is super tight in our house and this would make things so much easier on us. What do I do?",23Jan2019,1

So he sees me standing there and glares at me and stares me down and goes  ""what are you looking at"" or ""you got a problem wit me?"" It was a super agressive tone and combined with the eye contact it was like I was back in school and he was saying ""get lost or mind your own business I'm gonna kick your ass!"" 

I kept glaring at him and moved towards him and said ""yeah I have problem."" I don't think he was expecting that cause his whole tone and posture changed. He seemed almost scared. I think he thought I just worked there and would scurry away. He looked like the guy that wouldn't do anything beyond be loud.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25, working as internal tech support help desk (""Desktop Support Analyst"") at a growing company of around 500-ish people. I've always LOVED working on computers and other electronics and have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and trivia around the subjects. I honestly always wanted a job fixing computers - I knew it wasn't lucrative at all, but it's my passion in life to work on, tinker with and repair computers. I'm also generally quite friendly, and I've been told by others (including my manager) that my people skills are very good, so I'm cool with handling people (both irate and friendly) of all walks and such. Worth noting that when I first joined, I was ECSTATIC as I had a friend who worked here previously and he talked the world of them, and they seemed so forward thinking and I really loved it. I also find that now, my interest in this company is waning as well - possibly owing to feeling like an invisible little cog in the machine now.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, I've been here for.. well approaching 3 years now, and lately I have noticed that I'm REALLY not putting in my all anymore. There's a number of things that bother me as of late - things like lack of communication with my manager (our team and him all used to work in close proximity, now we only MAYBE see him once per week for a team meeting to get him up to speed if he doesn't cancel), our team is now spread out and sits in all different spots in the office, and I find that my patience is getting thinner with the ""customers"". I don't show it to them, but I can quickly go from feeling neutral to feeling like the person I am dealing with is an idiot, and it's a bad feeling. Additionally, I no longer tend to take a lot of initiative to do projects - at all. I used to fill time by imaging up to 10 machines at once and managing them all while working on my workload and I enjoyed it - now, I image a machine only when necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly here, worth noting that I do have diagnosed ADHD and am medicated for it, and my interest in my work varies from day to day as such, but over time my interest gets progressively lower. What can I do to sort of re-spark my interest? I don't want to do that because I just want to be the most efficient worker in the world or to kiss ass or for a promotion - from a personal satisfaction standpoint I'd like to feel motivated to really pick up slack (without having my boss like.. threaten my job or something) and be the best I can be and push myself. Telling myself to just do it or just be more motivated doesn't work (or at least last) - does anybody have any ideas?",23Jan2019,1

454,"Okay so, I'm a 17 year old boy working as a host at a casual dining joint in the USA.

A while ago, a new dishwasher was hired. He's from Israel I believe (or somewhere around there - he's definitely Jewish, but I don't really know any finer specifics.) He can't speak English well at all and most people have given up trying to understand him when he speaks. My little sister has a speech impediment though, so I know how difficult and frustrating it is when nobody understands you - but they could if they'd just try. So basically, I'm more skilled at listening to people with speech difficulties is what I'm trying to say. So I try to respond to him when everyone else ignores him.

But around a month ago, when I was still 16, he asked how old I was, I answered, and he asked if I wanted a girlfriend. I misheard him - I thought he asked if I wanted a friend. Unfortunately it seems I cannot take that yes back.

He immediately said that he knows ""lots of girls"" and he can find a girl for me. He says He knows one who's 15, I politely decline and say no thank you. He says he knows one who's 17. I say no thank you again. I leave to do some work, hoping he wouldn't bring it up again.

But the next time I go back in the kitchen to put away dishes, he's back at it again. This time he says he knows a girl who is 12 years old. My jaw dropped TBH. I tried to recover and politely decline again, but he kept insisting, eventually concluding that there must be something just WRONG with me to turn down these offers.

I talked to my mom about it and she said to tell him that my mom doesn't want me to date and that she wants me to focus on school, which isn't true but she hoped he'd get it. Nope! He doesn't get that either. He said she must be crazy and laughed, and asked, ""why do you listen to your mother, eh? No dating... (Vaguely puzzled noises ensue.)""

I hoped he'd just forget about it, but every time I see him he brings it up again. He keeps saying he wants to be my ""godfather,"" and eventually explained that he thinks that means he gets to choose my girlfriend. I tried to explain what that actually is, and how that's not really legal in America, but he won't hear it. I really don't see why he's so insistent on having a scrawny, short, kinda weird-lookin' white American kid date his daughters. But I'm not entirely sure they're his daughters - the only info I have is their ages. I really don't want to do anything that would cause him to lose his job, that is extremely against my moral code of conduct - I will if it's the only thing I can do, though.

And to top all of this off, he doesn't even know that I'm gay.

But I feel guilty not giving in and living with the possibility that I deprived someone of a happiness I very much could have given them.

I honestly feel really bad about it because well, one person in my class hates me, who knows what her friends think about me. And I dont know what to do with the situation. I want to be petty. I really want to GIVE her a reason to hate me because if you're going to do it, it better be for a good reason. But I don't believe that's the right thing to do. I think I should just..

462,"This is going to be long and jumbled. I'm sorry. 

I'm 27, a single parent, and have never lived outside of my family home or made a decent wage in my life. I was always told I was infertile, but on my 20th birthday I found out I was 20 weeks pregnant, with a man I was casually dating that was abusive and never helped me with a thing, financially or otherwise. I had my son, my ex left, and we haven't seen him in 6 years. I am perfectly happy with that. I want nothing in child support from him, because I do not want to open a door for visitation and him in my life, I am scared for my safety. 

I started beauty school when I was 21, and got my Cosmetology licence that same year. I was in beauty school from 2 to 10 every night, 5 days a week, so I hardly saw my son. After I graduated, I started working as an assistant in a salon making minimum wage. I worked long hours and weekends, and still didn't get to be with my son much. We lived with my parents and 4 brothers in a smallish house. It got to the point where he was calling my parents ""Mom and Dad,"" and calling me by my first name. My parents, though great people, aren't the best at respecting my boundaries, and often interfered with my parenting. In their eyes, I am a baby raising a baby, and they have to do the real parenting. When I was 24, I left the salon. I wasn't good enough to be promoted to a hairstylist, and it wasn't worth not being around my kid for a dream that wasn't going to happen. Around this time, I met my boyfriend and we started dating. 

I started working at the daycare center my son was going to and my mother runs as her assistant, so I could be with him more often. The pay was slightly better than the salon, but not by much. The Supervisor of 11 years was retiring, and since I worked alongside my mom for so long (I was working there for years before I went to beauty school) it was promised to me for over a year. I was hoping the pay increase would lead to me being able to afford my portion of a home with my boyfriend. 

When the Supervisor retired and I took over the position, it was a very small pay increase-DEFINITELY not enough to afford rent and bills. I have no concrete proof, but I am 95% certain that the original supervisor made significantly more than I did. But the shift hours were perfect that I can pick my son up from school everyday, be home by 3:45 every day vs 7:00 or 8:00 or even later. And I was able to take enroll him in a karate program, where he has made so many friends. My relationship with him has improved so much. He is my #1 priority in everything I do.

But my responsibilities at work and at home are increasing. Due to a family issue, my parents around much at work or at home, so I have been picking up the slack for everything. I handle the daycare while she is gone, I get my brothers to and from school, I cook dinner most nights. And I feel like I never get to work on building a life for myself. I am watching everyone I know get married, buy their first home, be successful, and I bust my ass everyday and have nothing to show for it. I still live in my childhood home, while sharing a bedroom with my son.  My boyfriend swears up and down that he loves me and wants to marry me, but in order to be engaged, we have to live together first, which I understand completely. 

My boyfriend and I have talked about moving in together so so so many times. He is my best friend. He loves my son and treats him like his own, he always has my back and takes care of me and my little guy. He owns his own house, but I can't move in with him because it's too far from work so I would have no job, my son would have to give up karate, and the schools are dangerous since the area has an MS13 problem. He makes twice what I do, so it's frustrating looking at homes that he can afford but I cannot. 

I finally found a house in my town that had everything we wanted (My bf HAS to have a garage to store his motorcycle and quad, it needed to have enough bedrooms so that my son could have his own room, etc.) and it was within our price range. I sent him the Zillow link and BEGGED him to let me make an appointment to look at it. He was skeptical for a few days, but finally had a long talk with me last night about what our finances looked like and what we should expect from cohabiting, and it seemed like all systems were a go. Well, we waited too long and someone snatched it up. 

Right now I just feel incredibly hopeless. I have a feeling that my mom pays me less than she should so that I can't leave. My state I live in is very very expensive, I work full time and still have nothing to show for it. I have been trying to look at other jobs that pay more, but unfortunately I do not have the qualifications for a job with a livable wage. How do other people do this? How do other parents juggle between working two and three jobs to make ends meet and still raise their kids? I'm currently applying for scholarships to get a Bachelor's degree online for Early Childhood education, so that I can find a job that lets me be home with my son on nights and weekends and during the summers. I don't need to make a huge amount of money, I just want to be an independent adult who can raise my own son without someone else interfering and telling me I'm wrong, or just ""pretending to be an adult.""

I don't know what I'm asking for anymore. I just can't keep living my life this way, like a failure. I feel hopeless. ",23Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

2.5 years ago I found out my husband got another woman pregnant, I instantly packed up and was out of there. 3 months ago I agreed to work on things for the sake of the children.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I moved back, I asked my husband about my wedding ring, I left it with my other jewelry when I moved out. Husband said he wasn’t sure, I figured it was lost in the shuffle and I would eventually run across it, no big deal. For Christmas, I received a new wedding ring to replace the “missing” ring. The “missing” ring has a serial number engraved on one of the diamonds for identification purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I get a call my from a jeweler on the OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY letting me know my ring was in his shop being appraised - it was going to be melted down and sold. I explained to the jeweler the ring was lost and I had no idea how it ended up in a different state. He agreed to pass along my number to the person who dropped the ring off. 3 days ago I speak to the woman who turns out to be the mother of the woman my husband fathered a child with - her daughter gave it to her and asked mom to sell it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The mom shared that she spoke to my husband a few weeks prior about the ring, she was going to give it back but my husband told the mom to keep it. Turns out that not only did my husband know where the ring was, he GAVE it to the woman he slept and had a child with. After speaking with the mom, I casually asked my husband if he knew anything about the “missing” ring, he flat out lied. Looked me dead in the face and said he hasn’t had eyes on it since I took it off and left.

This weekend I planned to come up and visit because I haven't seen him in a month and a half due to winter break. We made these plans a month and a half ago and I've been checking in to make sure this weekend still works for him. I talked to him yesterday and I was like ""so I'm coming around 5:00 on Friday"" and he's like ""Can you come on Saturday, that's my boyfriend's birthday and we're going to a party"". I was really upset at him for this because I switched around a lot of things to make this weekend work. I usually work 6-7 days a week and told work I couldn't cover the weekend shift because I was seeing my friend. He has only been dating this guy for 2 months and this guy is incredibly clingy. Anytime I'm with my friend he says he has to text him back right away or else he gets bombarded with texts about not answering. I don't have an issue with him seeing his boyfriend, but how could he just casually ditch these plans that we have had for so long? I feel like he doesn't respect my time and the effort that goes in to planning things. Even if he had said a week ago this weekend wouldn't work because he is going out with his boyfriend I would've been fine with it, it's the fact that it is 2 days before. This isn't about whether he should prioritize me over his relationship as much as it's about respecting my time and the plans we make in advance. Yes, our friendship means more than this little tiff but I'm not okay with him doing this and I know if I say ""it's fine"" it will still bother me just as much.

471,"(I want to preface this by saying that I have been friends with all three of my roommates for 5+ years and I really want to maintain that friendship if possible)

My three roommates (let’s call them one, two, and three) and I decided going into this lease that myself and one were going to cook for us each night, and two/three were going to clean up and wash dishes afterwards which sounded like a great plan. 

It turned out to indeed be a great plan for the first few months until roommates two/three started getting lazier and lazier with cleaning dishes and it started to get to the point where the sinks would be stacked super high before they would make any effort at cleaning them. Myself and roommate one spoke to them on many occasions and each time the result was them saying they would do a better job. Needless to say, nothing changed and the dishes would still pile up. 

This is a problem that has progressively gotten worse, and I assume will continue to. Before we went home for Christmas break, we all had a sit down to talk about the situation and the conclusion was that two and three would make it sort of their “New Years Resolution” to really do a better job and make sure everything was cleaner. 

Coming back from break, everything was okay for the first week, but there was one instance this past weekend where it has gotten to be the worst yet. I was leaving to head home last Friday for the three day weekend to visit family and, to no ones surprise, the sink was almost full as I was about to leave. So, I texted roommate 2 on the way out and just gave him a friendly reminder and asked him to try to clean the dishes so I can cook Monday night when I got back.

Fast forward to Monday night, I come home, sink is fuller than I have ever seen it, and the clutter of dirty dishes has spread to the counter and even on the stove. Instead of yelling at them, I decided to walk straight in and start cleaning the dishes by hand for nearly two hours while roommate 2 sat on the couch watching Netflix. Keep in mind that the kitchen is in plain view from the living room and he definitely knew I was washing because he was turning the volume up in the tv to drown the noise. After I did the dishes, I left, went out to eat and told them to figure their own dinner out.

Realistically, it’s not a huge deal that the dishes are piling up because they do, eventually, get cleaned but both roommate one and I absolutely hate cooking in a dirty kitchen and when there are dishes everywhere and it gets to the point where it’s hard to even find a clear spot on the stove to place a pan, there is a problem. 

I need help figuring out what to do next... Should I tell them I am done cooking for them and start to just fend for myself when it comes to cooking for only myself and cleaning my own dishes? Or should I attempt to talk to them again and try to fix the arrangement that we’ve made? I also want to add that neither roommate 2 or 3 have any idea how to cook. As an example, roommate 2 has to call his mom and ask how to make ramen noodles on the stove for his lunch last week.

Here’s some context, my social situation is not amazing but it’s fine nonetheless.

I am not quite sure, but I think my mom's monthly income is around 4k to 6k United States Dollars. My mom works really hard and sometimes she doesn't come home from work until late. She works in the genetics field and the hospital she works at doesn't seem to really care about their field. My tuition cost around 11k dollars and next year it is going to cost around 13k to 14k, in addition, my little brother also goes to a private school that costs around 8k to 9k.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about telling my mom to take me out of the school to save money for our family. However, I am too afraid to do so, because the consequences of me leaving the school will really impact my future, most likely in a negative way. Where I live (I will not specify because that is personal information) the difference between private schools and public schools are pretty huge, in terms of education, environment, and other factors. In public schools, the education could get you into universities around the area, but the environment isn't so great. In the area where I live specifically the school building are pretty worn out and old, sometimes the AC wouldn't even work in the hottest days. The people, unfortunately, are very... rebellious I guess I could say. There is a lot of severe bullying and I remember a long time ago when I was in public school a girl in my class tried to commit suicide. Private schools, on the other hand, have a more prestigious education that could get you into the top universities in the world. The people aren't so great as most of them are just spoiled rich kids who drive around in expensive cars. I would like to say that I have met a great set of friends that I can really depend on and that I don't want to lose. But one of them had already moved schools, and another one might move schools or move to a nearby country, and another one has been thinking about leaving the school. This leaves me with only one friend that I'm not as close with as the other three. I get good grades and I hope to study abroad to ensure a good life, and I want to get a good paying job after all my mother has spent a lot of money on me and I want to repay her. If I lose my school I might lose the chance of studying abroad and might end up in the same spot as my mother, struggling financially.

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought about many things to cope with this. I thought about leaving the school for my family's benefit or staying for my benefit. I wanted to at least try to make some money by cooking and selling them to my mom's coworkers to at least help my mom a little bit. It sometimes does get to me, and I say this is all my fault that my mom is struggling. I just want to go away so that my family can relax and have a good time without having to think ""Oh, we don't have enough money for that."" or having to think about a budget constantly. I really don't know what to do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

In my school contract, it states that if you are in this certain company (which is a very influential and big company in my country) you will only pay around half the amount. My mom can't work at that company because it does not provide the field she specializes in. My dad can work in that company, but he chooses not to. I don't want to blame my dad, I don't want to force him to have to go to work knowing that he hates this job, and the only reason he applied for it is to pay his children's tuition. The company is also ""manipulative"". Basically, your outside life directly associates with the company, the company mainly knows everything about your life outside of work. It's also like being labeled as the company's slave more than who you are. I am kind of glad that my dad decided not to work there.

475,"Lately, whatever I say or do sparks trouble... I used to think that everytime someone's angry, I'm at fault and should apologize and change/fix behavior. 

I noticed this made people walk all over me on the long run. In an attempt to improve, I'd not give in that easily and try to reflect on the situation that had happened. 

Yet my main problem is: 

I can't help it. I keep doubting myself. 

Thing is people show they're upset but never bring it up (i.e. texting decreases, talking is less, facial expressions change). 
Usually, I'd feel guilty and ask if I did something wrong. They then explain their reasons for being pissed/sad/angry and I end up feeling like an asshole for wronging them. 

If I explain my actions/words, I'm being defensive, not owning up to my mistakes and thus an asshole.  

If I just ignore their signs of displessure/passive-aggressiveness and wait for the other party to inform me how they feel.  I'm being inconsiderate, selfish, and still feel like an asshole.  
(note it makes me anxious just dealing with them when they're in that mood, and decide to leave them be to help cool down...)

Asking my family for their opinion could be biased. 
Even explaining situations from my pov could be biased. 

I can't keep up with social situations because it leads me to overthink everything. This post is just the tip of the iceberg... is this normal? How do I evaluate myself properly? 

I don't mind owning up to my mistakes.

I thought we had gotten over this. However, sex has been an issue. In almost every aspect. We rarely have sex, and when we do it's not great. Husband has some issues with erection. Claims that it's his high blood pressure and medication. I, on the other hand, overthink everything and just think that he has this issue because he isn't attracted to me. My BFF says that he wouldn't be with me if he weren't attracted to me. But, I still have this thought in my head.

495,"I want to keep my anonymity of me and all of my friends in this, so a throwaway is needed. Sorry for the post becoming long.

I am based in the UK, doing my A-levels currently. My friend, John started having faint spells and going unconscious at random moments last year in the summer. It got progressively worse and in the months leading up to Christmas, he had strokes and heart attacks. He recently stopped going to school and through snapchat, one of Johns friends (Claire) texted through Johns snapchat account saying John is due for an operation for the removal of malignant tumors (it was Stage 3 angiosarcoma). This was a shock to me and a few of my friends, some of my other friends found out when he got the diagnosis.

So from then on, none of me or my friends have seen John, and we have been getting regular updates by Claire, along with Johns fiancee, Jessica (at this point, I and my friends have never met Claire and Jessica in real life, we have only talked through Johns snapchat before). We were told that he is in palliative care at a hospital and no friends or family can see him. My friend, Liam was not happy with this and told Claire that he was going to the hospital regardless of what they said. The day that Liam was going to go to the hospital, we got an update that John had been transferred to another hospital, but for some reason, the patients next of kin (parents) were not known so we were not allowed to know where John was transferred until the next of kin was cleared up. This was really suspicious to my friends since as soon as Liam wanted to visit him, he was transferred. So he called up the hospital he was previously staying in, asking for John. There were no known records of John staying at the hospital for any treatment.

This really confused us, but we did not say anything to Claire or Jessica, who we are still talking to through Johns snapchat. In late last year, we got to know about Claire and Jessica, and what school they go to. It's a small community so my friends knew their school and have friends at that school. We asked my friends friends about Claire or Jessica. There are no such people as Claire or Jessica in their schools.

We are getting really worried as to what is happening to John now, and who has been texting us all this time. Please take note that all we knew about Claire or Jessica was through John, we never spoke to them directly.

We were also told by Claire that the school John goes to (and I go to) only know that John has family issues and that's the reason why he is not in. We have also been told not to tell any teachers or other friends who don't know the situation.

Can anyone help us with what to do to get to the bottom of this, I am still under the assumption I am talking to Clarie or Jessica, but I am not responding to their messages through Johns snapchat anymore? IMO I do not think of going to the police, there isn't anything substantial I can bring to their attention, especially if I can go another route to find what has happened to John.",23Jan2019,1
496,"I've been talking to the school counselor since the seventh grade ( I'm in the eight now) and I've been doing it behind my parents' backs. The reason I started doing so is that I've been feeling really depressed since the fourth or fifth grade and I just couldn't deal with always keeping it on the inside anymore. But the thing is, my parents don't believe in depression. The one time I tried to bring it up they made fun of me. 

So during January last year, I made an appointment with the school counselor. My best and only friend had just left me and my suicidal thoughts were coming back. Having to keep all of it on the inside was slowly breaking me and I was desperate to talk to someone even though I knew my parents would never approve. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have a thing against the school counselor because they think she's not in it to help kids but to make money and they were scared about CPS getting involved since they were already on my families ass (not because my parents are abusive or anything. It's because my brother murdered someone and his kid's living with us).  So I understood their fear but decided to disregard it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now seventh grade went by fine. The counseling isn't exactly the best but that's probably my own fault because I've been too scared to admit all the hardcore stuff but it has helped a little. Most of my problems depression got blamed on my sleeping problems though. So the counselor kept trying to get me to take melatonin, which my parents really didn't approve of when I brought up the idea. My parents think that melatonin is dangerous and that it doesn't actually help but my counselor keeps insisting I take it. I don't though, not yet at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the eight grade rolls around and shit I'm still depressed like always. I go to the counselor's office again but this time she takes the melatonin thing way more seriously and I end up actually getting a prescription for it. I take the prescription home and my parents say no. The counselor tells me that since I'm 15-years-old I have the legal right to make my own medical decisions and encourage me to still get it.

&amp;#x200B;

 I do even though I'm absolutely terrified of getting caught and that my parents are right but I'm so desperate for help so I end up trying it. It helps for a week or two but then it stops working. Then my dosage gets upgraded from 1.5mg to 3mg and that works for a few days but then stops. So now I'm still getting six hours of sleep, I'm still depressed and then I get the ultimate fist up the ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

I start having panic attacks multiple times a week. I've had panic attacks before but back then it was like three or four a year. My counselor starts to realize how bad shit actually is and then it happens. The final countdown for my life is coming.  

&amp;#x200B;

The school counselor and doctor have a little chat with me in the room and decide that they aren't qualified enough to help me and that I need serious help. I apparently need a proper psychologist and medication, neither of which they can provide. So then they decide that my parents have to get involved. I beg for them to not get them involved and that I don't need medication but they still call my parents to set up an appointment. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom was actually really understanding on the phone which made me feel a lot better until I went home and found out that my parents don't actually understand what the meeting is about. We're a family of immigrants and my parents don't speak the language very well so my parents misunderstood the entire phone call. When the counselor explained an incident at school, my parents, though that she was talking about the time I got really sick and fainted at school. The counselor was actually talking about an incident where I had a massive panic attack before a chemistry test, had to be taken to another room to calm down and fucked up on the test really bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my parents are going to go to the my school thinking I have a doctors appointment about my low iron levels and instead, they're gonna find out that their daughter been lying and disobeying them for a year. And then there's going to be a massive fight about my treatment because there's no way they're going to let me see a therapist or get medication but if they refuse CPS is going to get involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want even want the medication honestly. Medication is scary and I don't like it. I don't want something that's going to affect my brain, the entire concept is fucking terrifying. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now I'm so scared of what's going to happen and I don't know what to do. What should I do? How do I get out of this? Who's side to I take in this?

499,"TLDR at the end

Hi! So I live in Sweden and in two weeks I have to have registered my choice of gymnasium, which is sort of like high school. I have decided on the school, but I can't decide on which ""line"" as they're called here. It's basically the theme of your education. There are nature (science), economics, social science, and so on. Anyway, I have narrowed it down to two very similar lines, but there are some differences. I will either choose the ""Humanistiska"" (I think it translates to humanitarian?) or ""Samhällsvetenskap"" which is social science. Humanistiska has more classes that I find interesting, such as literature and the history of culture, but a lot of people choose it because it's a bit of an easier ride and that means that there are lots of slackers there and not very motivated people, and I'm afraid to get sucked in by the wrong crowd. It's of course impossible to know what MY class will be like but that's the norm. The social science one has more motivated, more likeminded, people that I think I would get along with better, but on the other hand I don't find the classes (leadership, communication) as interesting. I don't know which one I should choose, since I think both could work for me. Please help me decide.

TLDR; Should I choose my education based on which one I find more interesting - but has less motivated people - or which one has more likeminded and motivated people, but not as interesting classes.",23Jan2019,1

To make a long story short when I was 17 I was kicked out from A levels (kinda like high school in the UK) for poor academic performance.

After that my parents sent me to 3rd world Africa to study medicine. Medicine has never been my interest in life but because I had no qualifications or anything it was the only option I had.
The 1st year was ok because it was basic and I passed. 2nd year was pretty difficult and I passed all but 4 exams, redid 2 and passed. Now in 3rd year I've come to understand medicine is not my calling in life. 
The entire semester I skipped my lectures and was banned from all exams. I sat at home eating junk food not knowing what I was doing with my life. Now, most likely I'm going to get out for poor attendance and not sitting any exams.

Most likely, I won't be able to return to the university so I'll have to go back to the UK.

I think my main problem in life is that I never explored what made me happy and what my destiny was. But now, I think I'm more oriented to playing sports. I was good at sports when I was younger but gynecomastia ruined my life. I even confirmed this with a genes report and said I have the right genes for athleticism. 
Now gyno free I think I could give sports a try but I really don't know if I should, since I've been kicked out from everything at life. ",23Jan2019,1

504,"I see myself as someone who has poor judgment.    I take everyone at face value and I'm very agreeable.  I'm really afraid of judging others and it becomes difficult to see the truth of the situation, because I have a problem with possibly being wrong or hurting someone's feelings.  I'd rather do something keep people emotionally stable with me than what is best for the situation.

Sometimes I over correct by being untrusting, because I'm afraid I'm being taken advantage of but I'm not sure how.  Bottom line is I have a hard time judging people and situations.  I feel like an idiot.  I think I have some kind of learning disability.

515,"I'm looking for advice on where to turn from where I currently am in my life. Right now I'm unemployed and living on a large some of money I had saved over many years and I'm nearing the end of my savings. I've been living in a condo without working and tried attending college again last semester thinking it would do me some good to go back to school. I took four classes but I dropped one, didn't do ANY of the material for one of them and took an F and got a B in my last two. I hate to put blame on something dumb like depression, but the truth is I couldn't bring myself to have good study habits or to try put in my best effort at school. I wanted to go back so I could have relevant skills in today's complicated world. My terrible GPA landed me academic suspension so I'm not attending this semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had recurring suicidal thoughts for about 8 or 9 years and I feel as though I'm reaching the end and that the truth is that I will end my life in about 2 months. I've got enough money to live for those two months but after that I can't see how I can go on. I don't have any real skills that I can apply towards a career or a full-time job. I've never worked with modern technology all that much despite being 22 y/o, so I have no photo editing, video editing, coding, marketing, social media, adobe skills whatsoever. I don't see what marketable skills I have that could land me any job worth pursuing. It makes me feel sub-human and irrelevant to today's world, like I don't belong here in these fast and confusing times while I lag behind everyday.

The only silver lining would be to work for my parents company again and try to make a difference, but I feel as though I would be crawling back and it's a VERY thin silver lining. I was working at the company but it felt more like I was thrown into it rather than wanting to be a part of it as I had no direction in my life. After graduating a very depressing and mentally straining, unimpressive 4 years of high school, I was working at my parents company just to get by and keep myself distracted. I attended college for a couple of years during high school but didn't have plants to go back. Fast forward a year and my brother wants to expand my parents company. Naturally, I'm thrown on board and expected to be a leader for the company in order to expand and grow. I had NO experience being a manager, leader, or executive for ANY sort of company nor did I have any business education or any idea on how to make the company successful. Sounds terrible having an entire company handed to you and told you will be the owner in 5 years right? It was a nightmare for me, I have no idea how I would possible be able to handle such a big burden at such a young age (I was 20 when this started) and with no experience or education on how to do so. On top of that, I'd never had a good relationship with my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward nearly two years, the company is doing okay, not great, but okay. It's kept afloat from the good reputation our company name has had but everything seems like a goddamn mess. My brother and I are in charge but on top of my lack of inexperience and my brothers equal if not greater lack of inexperience plus stubbornness, cockyness, and lack of humility it's clear things are not getting better. Parents have no idea what to do either has they are also uneducated and put faith into my brothers plans of expanding the company. Everyday for me is a strain and although I want to have time to educate myself or make plans or do SOMETHING to help improve the company, it's smeared out by the sheer amount of hours working within the company basically as an employee. Imagine Elon Musk putting working the manufacturing floor instead of being CEO, but he is also the CEO.

6 months ago, my father and I get into a dispute while at work that gets physical. At one point in my life I went to juvenile hall for giving my dad a few bruises on his face after he pinned me down and choked me while he was in a drunken rage, apparently he didn't hold me down hard enough to give me any marks so I'm in the red. Dad goes to AA to get cleaned up but never actually fesses up to anyone INCLUDING MY FAMILY that he was the one who attacked me while I was the one who wound up locked up, so naturally there was always something in my subconscious that could never fully forgive him. On top of him being a drunkard my whole life and being abusive, we've obviously never had a good relationship despite him preaching about 'family is all you got' etc. So my father and I get into this argument that gets a little heated. My father pins me against the wall but I don't struggle or try to punch him as I know where it's landed me before. He's got his fist cocked and ready to hit me so I'm taunting him to punch me so he can ""go to jail like the POS he is"" and blah blah. He puts me down, I tell him I'm quitting, I start walking to his truck he lent to me while my car was in for repairs. Naturally, he tells me not to even think about taking the truck, I throw the keys back at him and walk home which took about 5 hours. 

Quitting was over more than just the little dispute, but that's how it ended up happening. Now here I am, not knowing where to turn or what use I am to anyone in the world. I'm not even of use to myself, and I don't know what the point of trying is anyways. I hate everything about myself, from the physical to the mental parts. I feel as though I'm a sub-human breed that doesn't have a place in this world full of more capable people who are smarter, better looking, healthier, etc. I don't understand the point in using resources just so EVERYONE can live, but what if not everyone wants to live? Why do we have to care so much about every single life on this planet? It's a mundane existence and for me, nothing has any feeling and I don't remember a time in my life when it did. I think that's just how mental illnesses feel, like the world around you is devoid of meaning or feeling. Sometimes I get small a small glimpse of what normal people feel when they speak or hear words from others, it's as though I can actually FEEL my emotions for once, but then it's gone and it's nothing but a sea of emptiness again.

516,"I am a 23 year old male recently graduated from college. Until high school, my social life was fairly well. At high school, I've gone to a boarding school. It was the best school in Turkey at the time and it was completely voluntary. But I've hated it, especially being together with same people day and night. For 5 years I've been there, I've constantly tried to isolate myself from others. I've sometimes managed to succeed, and sometimes I've failed.

&amp;#x200B;

When I've got into college, I got my own place and began to live alone. In a sense I've finally achieved my goal of isolation. But then, I began to need some people in my life and I couldn't get any new people into my life. I had only 1 friend that I've got through 4.5 years of college and he was a friend from my high school. Throughout my entire time at college, I haven't got any new friends. Having a social anxiety is definitely a reason for that, but I think the main reason is that I judge all the people I meet, or don't meet but just see from a distance. This behavior is probably a result of being stuck with people I didn't want to be with for 5 years in high school. I don't know how to change this behavior. The only solution I can think of is forcing myself to ignore the judgements in my mind, but it requires a lot of trials to finally succeed and with a person with social anxiety, I won't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result of giving up for future friends, I've become obsessed with the people from my past. These people aren't necessarily some people I've used to be close, but they are people I used to know, mostly from high school. I think it was more comforting for me to eliminating the meeting phase, given that we've seen each other for 5 years with most of them. I've texted 4-5 of such people, after 2 years of no communication, and tried to develop our relationship. I've sometimes felt like a creep, because we weren't even close back then. At the end, none of them turned out well.

&amp;#x200B;

But nowadays, there is one particular person from high school, that I'm pretty obsessed with. We have participated a 1-month school trip to USA at our first year at high school and that's pretty much all we've spent time together. However, it was probably the single 1-month I've been happy in high school. After that trip, we haven't talked face-to-face besides some greeting, and texted for some time after 2 years from that trip. Now, it's been 9 years from that trip, and I always think about her. I think it's a squish rather than a crush, but it's surely pretty intense. The strange thing is that, as far as I know via stalking, we are 2 very different people and our thing probably wouldn't last long, but I keep dreaming about it. Also it's worth mentioning that I've texted her 3 times in last 1-1.5 years and didn't get any response.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that my situation about meeting new people and making friends will ever change, and I embrace that. But, I don't want to stuck with my past, obsess people from my past, and keep dreaming about them. I'd appreciate any advice.",23Jan2019,1

I idealized chasing the dream and had the support of my folks from a very young age.

Background - I had a problem setting up my autopay so they asked to pay by money order or cashiers check. Over the holidays I was travelling and couldn't physically go buy a money order and bring it to their office when the rent was due on the 5th of this month, so I got a late fee applied. Stupidly (first time renting an apartment), I thought I just have to pay rent before the next one is due... Turns out they had mailed me a 72 hour notice to pay on the 16th (I'm a student and use my parents address for everything so I unfortunately don't check my mail very often).

I'm just kind of freaking out right now because this is embarrassingly dumb of me. This is my first apartment and a few months in I'm already failing at being an independent adult.

I've been trying to show her that she is worth loving for almost 2 years but in the last few months we have had big fights that she says are about me not giving enough. And most days it feels like I have no idea what she needs at the moment, cannot give it to her, or I don't want to because I need space. 

Now we are less than a week from a planned trip to live in Spain for a few months. We have not seen each other since Monday, which was when she claimed I was flirting with someone in front of her. I wasn't. But she often throws out a big accusation and I can't prove to her that I wasn't. We fought badly (her style is one I do not agree with). I stormed out of her place and haven't seen her since. 

She sent me an email about how she saw the girl I talked to overstepping what's appropriate and she was upset with me for engaging in what she saw was a covert way. I meant it in a friendly way, because the other girl was the only person in the room with us and my girlfriend and I weren't talking (we were ""getting over"" our last argument).

She swiped on me first and at first I was skeptical but after talking I think she’s really funny and nice and cute. Perfect relationship material. When we started talking, everything was going really great! She always responded, didn’t take too long, and seemed genuinely curious about me as I was with her. She asked me for my Snapchat later that night and we started chatting on there. For the first few days after that she ALWAYS hit me up first, responded in a flash, and helped to keep the conversation going while being flirty and lighthearted about it. She loved seeing my funny selfies as I also loved seeing hers. We had a genuine connection and it was probably the best one I’ve ever had with someone on Tinder or even in general. We started a snap streak and everything and I was pretty much automatically her new best friend on there. Naturally, she asked if she was the only girl I was talking to and I went with the honest route and told her no and that there was one other girl that I was scheduled to go out with in the next few days(the truth). She seemed to understand because we were both on dating apps so it was kind of obvious. But I asked her if she was talking to anyone else and she said no. I still don’t know if she’s telling the truth. My gut says she’s being honest. Of course there were some hiccups in the conversation but nothing I couldn’t turn into a joke afterwards. After about 4 days I was really comfortable with her so I asked her out. She wasn’t that far away.

It’s no surprise that this is where it got iffy. She said she “didn’t know” because she was on edge because of a few unfortunate stories she recently heard on the news regarding Tinder. She said she didn’t know if I was a normal person yet. I told her I understood and asked if she wanted to just keep talking and she said yes. Later on I messaged her apologizing again for asking her out so soon, and she was totally cool with it and said she really liked me. We continued to talk in our normal flirty way for the rest of the night and she even said that she wanted to call me at some point. I said maybe because it’s hard to find time for that with my family usually around.

The next day, it was taking longer than usual for her to start up a conversation so I snapped her first. I think I chose an unfortunate time to start talking though because I was about to go out to lunch with my family. I told her I would text her later. She said okay. So I snapped her a few hours later trying to start a conversation and it worked but she left me on read. So I made a joke out of it because she had done the same when I left her on read a few days before. She responded “sorry haha” and that was it. No selfie just text. She even left me on read again a few messages later. She actually hasn’t sent me anything more than about a sentence or two (max) since. Yesterday I had to snap her first and it had gone down to one and two word answers. I asked her if everything was ok with us twice and she insisted she was fine and I was fine. Today she flat out ignored me. 

What the hell is going on? I had a great connection with this girl and I want it back!! It’s so weird I’ve never really heard of anything like this happening after such a good start. I know it probably seems like I’m overthinking this, but I tried to give as many details as possible. Some serious suggestions/advice on where to go from here would be great! Thanks",23Jan2019,1
533,"Just as background, I collect and play with Magic The Gathering cards. I regularly visit my local game store and I’ve been playing for almost a decade now. So I have a big collection of these cards, and I’ve spent a lot of money on them.

I have a binder with all my most valuable cards on a shelf in my room. I was flipping through it and I notice there are empty spots in it. I look in all my boxes and sure enough, they’re gone. I added up the totals of all the cards I was missing and it’s nearly $500 (it was only 3 cards, but they were incredibly valuable).

I might not sound like it, but I was and still am livid about this.

My step-brother (&amp; my roommate, we share an apartment) has no reason to take them other than money. 

- He’s the only person who knows where to find them.
- He’s the only person that knows where and how to sell them.
- I’ve found a few cards in his glovebox before, and he pulled some bullshit excuse to why he had them.
- I know he’s not above stealing from me because he’s done it before. He’s tried to steal my playstation, my weight set, and even my shoes for cash.

I’ve contacted my game store and I’m in the process of finding out whether or not he’s been selling them anything.

He’s know to deal with drugs and stealing from me for cash, so I’m talking to his mother about it too.

We grew up being best friends, but I can’t handle this anymore. He’s betrayed me far too much for me to put up with him anymore. I just want my cards back before I either kick him out or get my own apartment.",23Jan2019,1
534,"All my life I’ve hated going to school. High school was pure hell for me. Besides learning about war history i hated high school. Then i applied to colleges and got in, but idk why. I just did it because that’s what everyone else was doing. When i finally committed to the college I’m at now (currently in second semester of freshman year) i felt nothing. My first semester was pretty shit for various reasons, but not because i missed home. Truth is I’ve never felt “at home” anywhere. Here I am in my second semester, looking at all these paths i could take, and I’m not liking any of them. Not a fan of STEM jobs, not interested in business or law. I have no interest in my classes. It feels like high school all over again, where I’m just taking classes because I have to. I’m really starting to think college was not the right route for me, and i don’t mean to offend anyone of course, it just doesn’t feel right to me personally.

She didn't want to but i said really theirs no worry since the lights are off. Anyhow she didn't want to, so i started dancing in hopes she would come dance with me. This probably went on for a solid 5 minutes.

As i was dancing a security guard came up with a flashlight asking what I thought i was doing. I said ""sorry just dancing"" and he said ""it's pretty damn suspicious when you keep coming in and out of a dark gymnasium"" and then I left with the girl.

Am I just being paranoid because for some reason I keep feeling like I'm gonna get suspended or some stupid shit like that since we were wandering around the college hanging out and they've got cameras.

Also do you think they've got me on film dancing? And they're gonna save it or some shit? It was pretty cringy since i was trying to impress a girl. Also worth noting I guess i work at the schools library and my dad works at IT lol.

Thanks in advance.

  


TL; DR: I was dancing in a dark gymnasium to impress a girl. One of the doors was unlocked so I went in and started dancing in hopes the girl would dance with me.

545,"I graduated last year with my bachelor's degree and later moved to a big city to find work. I was working full-time for a while in a job that wasn't related to my field. I hated that job, so when I got another job offer I left, but they then turned around and gave that job to someone else. I've been unemployed for quite some time now, and I'm still applying and job hunting every day, but I've had no luck. I may have finally landed something in a coffee shop, but I'm not certain yet, and February 1st is right around the corner. I've got no money. I won't have rent. I'm not even able to focus on rent right now, I'm just trying to keep my account from being overdrawn. My landlords have been forgiving with late payments too many times, and I think this is the last straw.

I can't go back to where I'm from because my parents are displaced, both staying on family member's couches. And I don't have the money to move back. My family has always been below the poverty level and I thought college would break that cycle for me, but so far it has only made things worse. So, I screwed up and I'm on my own. This city was where I always wanted to be, but I guess I wasn't ready for it. Right now I have to face up to the facts, and the fact is, I don't have my rent. I need to start figuring out what I'm gonna do.

No, I'm not asking for money. I just want to know what to expect. For example, I have a bed, I have belongings, things I can't lug around. What will happen to my things if I can't afford storage? I live in a cold city, and right now it's full of ice and snow and freezing rain. How do I ensure I'm somewhere warm every night? If I have to be outside, how do I protect myself? I'm a 22-year-old woman, going on 23 in a few weeks, and I don't have any training in self-defence. How do I keep safe when I have no home? How will this impact my ability to get approved for an apartment in the future? If you've been evicted before and had nowhere to go, what are your top recommendations for how to survive while I try to pick up the pieces of my life and get back into a job and a home?  
Before you recommend-- I've already tried r/Assistance, and just got downvoted. People were mostly unkind and told me to become a sex worker. Yes, sex work is real work, but it's not the life I want. I've also tried r/borrow and got radio silence. My rent is probably too much. I'm outta luck, and this is happening.

**P.S.** I know a lot of people are going to want to say mean things and outline why I'm a failure and a low-life, how I've gotten myself into this mess, and how I'm a drain on society. Yeah. I know. I've heard it on here before. The thing is, I truly used to be the most ambitious person out of everyone I knew. I was first in my family to go to college, I founded and ran two community organizations, I won departmental and international honors in college regularly, I graduated on time as a 4.0 student while working 3 part-time jobs, I was the president of multiple clubs, I volunteered at women's shelters, I coordinated fundraisers and benefit concerts, I coordinated trips to D.C. to rally for causes me and my fellow community members believed in, I got scholarships to study abroad all around the world, and I did this all before the age of 22. I was the person people thought was ""going places"". But now, as fate would have it, I'm just a person with no place to go. College means nothing and it made me delusional about what I could accomplish out here. My spirits couldn't be any more broken, so please spare it and direct your venom somewhere else.

Only reason why I am not doing that is because I don't want to end up on a chair that's not for gaming purposes and get customers from one destination to another like my father. 

I also despite people especially when they think so highly of themself, so I want to dominate them with words, knowledge and everything in the between. Of course I wouldn't have to do this if I were on my chair and be busy with playing.

I get there and find the nurse laying in a pool of her own blood whimpering with whatever oxygen she can muster. The suspect is standing approximately 10ft in front of me. I have my firearm drawn. I am screaming and pleading with him to drop the knife. My partner arrived and came through the opposite door to me out of line of sight. I tell him to get his taser and deploy it. My partner cannot see the suspect due to him standing behind a partition wall. Finally the suspect steps out sees that he has a taser and charges him with the knife. I had to use my firearm or my partner would have been stabbed as well.  I immediately fell to my knees and started crying. The female and her unborn child survived albeit some life altering injuries to her. 
   I went through the protocol of the investigation and everything was determined to have been justified in the incident.

555," 

Hi there!

I apologize if this isn't the appropriate place to ask this, but I feel like I need some outside input/advice on this. Sorry, it's a little long!

I've been talking to a girl at work for a while. I only see her once a week and we hit it off pretty nicely. I asked her out, she accepted and then she couldn't make it because of work and rescheduled. Before that rescheduled date happened, she told me she got back together with her ex over the NYE. She didn't want to make things awkward, etc. etc.

I continued to keep things casual and we kept on talking at work for the one hour or so we see each other. She is admirable and works incredibly hard with her two jobs, and honestly I thought about ghosting her because I think I'm not mature enough to handle a friendship with someone I have feelings for. It was fun to talk to each other and we opened up quite a bit about ourselves.

I thought about asking for some space this week such that I wouldn't get in between her and her ex, but something came up before I got the chance to tell her.

At first, she was very quiet and hesitant to bring it up, and I could tell. I said she could tell me what she was trying/struggling to bring up.

She had confided in me that she was thinking about breaking up with her ex. Apparently her ex had cheated on her for the third time. This ex of hers told her that ""he would change"", and that this time she was seriously considering dumping him.

At first, I asked if she could tell one of her friends about this, as I was deeply uncomfortable about this discussion. She told me she wanted my advice as to what to do.

I felt like a huge douchebag since this seemed like a conflict of interest, but at the same time, this ex of hers is a fucking manipulative asshole from the way she described him.

Apparently this guy doesn't return her calls, does any of the BF-GF relationship stuff, has vandalized her car once before, keeps telling her that ""he'll change"" and all these other shitty behaviours that reek of manipulation/abusiveness.

Honestly, I told her that these were huge red-flags, and she should've dumped him the first time he cheated, hell even before that when he vandalized her car. I felt incredibly bad for her, and also was a bit happy that despite only seeing each other for an hour a week for about a month so far, she opened up about this.

Aside from that, she also said that her previous ex had also cheated on her, which kind of raised suspicions for me but I don't know what to think about it.

She said she'll dump him at the end of the week. I am hoping she goes through with it. If I see her next week and she hasn't, I'll be disappointed as this isn't healthy for her and I'll probably be more assertive and lay things out for her next time. She's already told me she's been to the emerg because of all the stress going on in her life, and I really think she should cut ties with this guy.

Am I in the wrong here? I feel like this is the right decision, but I also feel like a prick because I still have feelings for her and I don't know if I'm being biased. If she doesn't drop him next week, should I calmly explain why she should and advise her to get another opinion as well since I can't be the only one to think this isn't going to work out for her?

Is there a reason she opened up about this to me? I was planning on asking for some space because I had feelings for her and didn't want to get in the way of her and her ex, but with all of this going on, I completely forgot entirely. I still have those feelings for her, and I don't think I'm mature enough to stay around as a friend.

I also really don't think she should be rushing to date, myself as much as I'd like that, or anyone else for that matter in the mean time. Should I tell her that?

I would love any input or advice on this. Please let me know if you need any clarification on what I've written, I'm just writing as things pop into my head. Sorry this was so long too!

Thanks!",23Jan2019,1

557,"TLDR 4 friends from high school live in a house together but one isn’t motivated to find a new job. We’re not entirely stuck with him but we want to help encourage him to take income a bit more seriously. 



So for a bit of background first, we live in an area where rent is growing so fast, that without regular pay increases, you could be forced from your home. About a year ago a group of friends from high school decided that the most economic way to survive rent increases would be to divide up the rent as much as we could. But now that our lease is coming up again we can see what the next couple rent increases will be and 3 out of the 4 of us have prepared for it. 

The fourth one of us  however is about to lose his third job of the year and hasn’t shown much promise in his never ending job hunt. And what’s become really alarming is that he now takes one if not a couple day(s) off a week to ‘job hunt’. And on top of that he feels super accomplished and proud after submitting only 5 apps in those days. 

He also is the type that has way too much of a dependency on his relationship. He will quickly lose all his motivation if she even texts him (and she always texts him). He’s spent entire sick days from work claiming to be job hunting but is just on the phone with her for hours and then getting picked up by her and staying out for the rest of the night. 

It’s like he’s a teenager avoiding homework but this homework saves him and his friends a lot of financial headache.  I would try to kick him out but I might be a little late. The two possible replacements are still in their own leases and ours is up too soon. Besides, him and I go way back and I want to help him see that he needs to shape up to survive, but he’s been committed to his own bs. After all, it wasn’t that long ago when he helped me out of a similar funk. He helped me get over myself and the years since have been the most successful of my life so it would feel wrong to abandon him in his time of need. ",23Jan2019,1

She would even do this on plans that she initiated. This became increasingly irritating to me and I sat down and had a long in-depth discussion on why her flakiness is an issue that’s impacting our friendship. I even told her that if you can’t realistically commit to plans, I’d rather not be invited at all. Even after this conversation she continued this behavior on an even worse level. I ended up telling her that I’m completely fed up with this behavior and this can’t continue anymore. I told her I needed space away from her to re-evaluate this friendship.

It all started last year, when his grades started dropping. After this, he started displaying very hateful behaviors.

Very recently, he was expelled from school for the rest of the year, for throwing a stink bomb into a classroom, which caused part of the school to evacuate. He is extremely manipulative, and will not take responsibility for any of his actions. He has shown an active interest in drugs. My question is, what are you supposed to do about this?

My mother passed away 13 months ago and my father passed away 4 months ago.

The past 4 months I have completed all the final things I needed to do for my parents estate.

I have received a bit of an inheritance. I will receive 500 a month for the next 3 years, and got 60,000 dollars.

I have bought new clothes and paid for one year of rent in advance. I have paid all my debts and now have a 715 credit score.

 I have put 25k in my savings. I have about 20k in my checking account. My monthly bills are about 250 a month for utilities, insurance, and 250 a month for food.

I have no pets or children.

I know I need to find a job and get back to work. A job is a major priority because I have no family left, no one to fall back on if things go south. 

However, I have spent the past 7 years caring for my parents. I have had no real relationships during that time, and spent everyday with my parents cooking, cleaning, maintaining medical equipment, driving them to appointments, doing after surgery care, etc.

I want to doing something for myself, but I don't know what. The first time in many years I have only myself to look after and don't know what to do with myself.

Maybe a vacation? Maybe buy a decent car? Should I invest my money, and if so, how? Maybe just go straight to the job hunt and work one full time and one part time job? Maybe go to community college part time, try and get something better then an associates degree?

I feel both free and lost. Like I can do anything I want but am stuck doing nothing because I don't know what I want.

570,"Basically I’m 15 and i fell in love with a boy at my old school over text message and phone calls. I’m not entirely sure but i think i mainly fell in love with him because he was making me really happy when i were going through family problems outside of school and it made me reliant on him.

I ended up confessing my feelings towards him after a month but he said he didn’t like me back. Then unexpectedly two weeks later we were having a conversation and he admitted to liking me and he said that he didn’t tell me earlier because he didn’t want to hurt me as he has football and he wouldn’t have time for me as a boyfriend.

He decided to try anyway and unfortunately i made the mistake of telling and it spread throughout the school. People were teasing us both about it for an entire week and they even found out where and when we were supposed to meet.

He texted me at the end of the week and ended it because it was making him unhappy and making him lose focus which i think he meant by football. I’ve never been heartbroken before so it hit me so hard and I’ve never been so sad in my life.

2 months later i texted him which was near Christmas last year. I said that i cared about him and that i was glad i met him. He was really blunt with me and didn’t seem caring at all that i bothered to text him after all that time.

The thing is, i really adore him and to be honest, i know it sounds ridiculous but i think he may be the one. It’s hard to find a connection like that in person, but to find it while texting someone or being on the phone to them is unthinkable in anyone’s mind.

Male 25yo, I've been in a relationship with my gf for about 9 years. And I've lied about some important and others not so important things. Mostly related to money and stuff I did during our earlier days together. 

Nothing to do with cheating on her with somebody else. Mostly just things like ( Yes I already paid my car insurance, or yes I called the bank for X reason ) and some of the lies come up eventually. And we usually have big fights let's say every 2-3 months. About those times when I lied. 

I know it is my fault and I also know that I am a lazy person. Why do you guys think I'm lying to her ? Could it be that I'm scared to lose her ? Or get her mad ? I dislike having discussions over anything if it makes her sad or mad. I really love her but I really don't know how to tell her about  some of the lies I've told. Like for example I haven't renewed my driver's license but she thinks I did. Or that I quit my job ( I got fired for missing 2 days of work ) I didn't feel like going and they fired me.

576,"I have a confession to make:

​

I'm on the way to being a influencer(I have hit the max friend limited on fb several times and have thousands of followers), I have multitudes of friends, I get invited to parties frequently and asked on dates

But

I get paranoid that absolutely everyone in my life hates me.

​

Long story short I ended an abusive relationship with a pathological liar 7 months ago. One of the reasons it took me so long to leave is because he threatened to continue spreading lies about me. He had been telling his friends, and I'm guessing anyone who would listen that I had been abusive, when in fact he had been doing the things he said I had done to him. When I unearthed this(via his friend sending me a very nasty text AS I WAS PACKING TO LEAVE) I confronted him and was told ""what is the point in telling anyone the truth if you are leaving."" And so I stayed. And he told that single friend some half truth. He had been taking fun of my accomplishments with his friends and so now I feel like a fucking joke any time I talk about anything I'm proud of.

​

A few weeks later he used my mother's very recent death as an excuse to continue to lie to me and I decided enough was enough. I had to save, hire movers, arrange utilities, find an apartment &amp; sign a lease in secret to get away from him.

The issue is three things: 1) my paranoid brain is worried about what he has told people about me. He displayed classic narcissistic traits so I am sure he started a smear campaign against me. 2)To hide the abuse I had to hide my feelings from my friends. I had to pretend on so many occasions I was okay when I was not so I got used to swallowing my emotions to the point that I fear expressing them to anyone, even those people who say it's okay and ask 3)He kept me extremely isolated from my friends in the 15 months we dated and so I completely lost touch of how to be vulnerable and emotionally open with people. When the only support you receive for that long includes consequences like getting screamed at, you get terrified to tell people how you feel.

​

I guess my point of this post is to say I don't know how to be vulnerable anymore. Not with my friends or family even though I really need people right now to hear me. I feel like if I were to open up I would be a burden. I am so scared to be myself it's crippling and this feeling that people hate me makes me so anxious. I really don't know what to do.",23Jan2019,1
577,"Long time reddit user, created this throw away account for obvious reasons.

 

My girlfriend and I have been together almost 3 years. We live together, share expenses, accounts, and plan to tie the knot one day. She always told me something big went down with her dad growing up.  I always assumed it was just a big fight or she ran away or something silly with the way she talked about it.  But today she told me that her dad sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions when she was around 13.  

 

 It was a big drop, she had a bad morning and it just came out.  I listen to her story and I got what details she remembered.  She doesn't know long it went on, but it was graphic and it happened while he was on some kind of drug, a pill.  A drug that he never took before, or again?  Since it stopped and since he said things like  ""don't tell it will tear the family part"" and ""do you want your mother to find out and leave us"", those words and fear kept her from telling anyone this until now. 

 

Once she told me everything and calmed down we started discussing what the next step would be. Part of her wants to tell someone in the family, while another wants to report it to the authorities.  She has a sister still living at home and a brother expecting baby.   

&amp;#x200B;

She has always been odd about sex and randomly violent and/or angry when the situation didn't quite call for it.  I just chalked it up to her being kind of out there and really passionate. But after she told me her secret it was like a weight was lifted.  She doesn't snap at the same stuff anymore and isn't afraid to ask for stuff during our private time.  Finally admitting what happened has sparked such a huge change I am not sure I can explain exactly.  I think she is starting to realize how big of an impact this had on her and is starting to heal.  I want to help.

 

This happened almost 10 years ago and she would only have her word if she reported it. The thought of ruining her parents marriage is tearing her up.  I keep saying things like, ""I would want to know if my spouse did those things and what if its happening right now or might happen to your future niece or nephew.""

&amp;#x200B;

When I say these things, I feel kind of bad, like I'm manipulating her into doing what I think is right.  Either way I will back her decision 100%, whatever she decides.  And I know I want the bastard to pay but her feelings and future are what is important to me.  So I ask anyone reading for some unbiased advise/opinion/slaps in the face, whatever you got to help us along.

578,"Sorry in advance, this post is pretty long because there's a lot to unpack. There is a tldr at the bottom but of course the main story provides really important details.

We've been friends since around middle school and are now freshmen in college (attending the same university). We used to be more like acquaintances, but around the later years of high school we became closer because we happened to always be around each other. 

At first I didn't notice anything off about this friend at all, probably because she was very similar to me. However throughout high school and into college I did a lot of personal reflection and growth, because I realized that I was toxic myself so I worked to fix that. 

We didn't hang out much in person after graduation because I pretty much spent the summer cooped up in my home focusing on my own problems (just to say this now, I'm obviously not perfect and I'm still working on it and maturing lol). throughout our first semester of college, I realized that she still had the toxic habits we both used to share, but they had gotten A LOT worse. 

One of the most glaring problems for me is her ""sense of humor,"" which I don't even want to classify as humor since it mainly consists of insults and humiliation far beyond the point of being funny. I spent my first semester of college putting a lot of thought into what my major should be, and changed it more than a few times. Everytime I changed my major, she was ready with insults, dejection and discouragement under the guise of ""joking around."" When I finally decided on a major that seemed perfect for me (something I'm passionate about and will make plenty of money), I didn't let myself be excited about it around her because I knew she would be very judgmental and pessimistic about it until she could make me feel the same. I should also mention that as she was criticizing me for changing my major 3 times, she changed hers 5 times and obviously saw no problem with that. 

Something that isn't necessarily toxic but more annoying is her absolute lack of any self awareness or volume control. She's always exceptionally loud, always talking and always complaining about something. There's been plenty of times where I want to go to the library to study, but I know that she's going to attach to me and go wherever I go and continue to be loud, so we have to settle for super crowded dining halls or places outside.  

She's also heavily critical of people. If someone makes a tiny mistake in front of her she jumps at the opportunity to make them feel like shit about it. We have a geology lab together and in one class I mixed up Augite and Hornblende, which aren't the most glaringly opposite minerals in the world, and she proceeded to constantly call me an idiot, dumbass, etc throughout the 2 hour lab session. If I'm writing a paper and decide to use the word confused instead of discombobulated, she'll laugh and ask me how I got into college with a 2nd grade intelligence. The worst instance of this is when I shared with her that ADHD is something that runs in our family that my brother and sister were diagnosed with, and even though I was never diagnosed I felt like I had it too. She responded with something along the lines of ""honestly you probably do, but I think you're actually autistic because ADHD doesn't make you that stupid."" I also don't have the best dating history and she likes to bring this up by calling me a slut and saying I'm too stupid to date anyone. 

On top of all this she has a confidence level that reeks of delusional arrogance. In her mind she does nothing wrong and is capable of anything in the world. When I asked why she changed her major each time, her answer was always along the lines of ""I can do any major I want to, there's just so many options and they're all stupid."" It's especially bad because she puts herself on a pedestal higher than  everyone around her. She constantly is looking over my shoulder as if she sees herself as my mentor or something, and always asks to look at my work so that she can point out any little flaw she finds and criticize me for it. If any guy looks at her for more than a second she automatically thinks they want to get in her pants.  She does have a high intellect; even I can admit she's freakishly smart. But she harshly dismisses anyone she thinks doesn't match her intelligence (this goes for anyone smarter than her too).

There's really no doubt in my mind at this point that I don't want or need a friend like this. But we do have a lot of history and a lot of mutual friends. It's also hard to just avoid or ignore her because she'll either blow up my phone or go around the *entire* campus (which has 55 academic buildings alone) looking for me. I also showed her my schedule (yes, I know, that was ***very*** stupid of me) so she knows where my classes are. I've tried ghosting, I've tried ""weaning"" her off the friendship,but nothing has worked. I genuinely feel like having this toxic kind of person in my life is heavily conflicting with the work I'm trying to do on myself, but I don't know how I can call off this friendship. 

**TL;DR:** My friend is impudent, socially unaware and has an extreme case of delusional confidence. How can I drop this friendship without causing a heap of drama? ",23Jan2019,1

Backstory(trying to keep short) is I was abused physically and mentally by my parents growing up. I have serious depression that my parents did not believe(only made worse with the yelling if I was crying -which was often). Once I was old enough and had a job I went behind their backs to get myself help because they didn't want to help me(they didn't believe I needed help). I've been on medication since and it's helping tremendously.
My relationship with them is ok now. I haven't forgave them and I don't make an effort to see them but they're nicer than before.
Husband and I had the serious talk about kids. I told him I was scared with the depression and anxiety, I'm also forgetful. My choice was to not have kids. He could have gone either way but supported me, stating he likes it just the way it is and doesn't need his ""name or bloodline"" to continue.
Now, if I was to say this to my mom she would not understand. I know she would get upset. That's why I'm contemplating just saying I'm infertile/female parts are no good for her to take it better than the other option and not make a huge deal out of this.
Another option was to just not say anything and eventually they'll figure out we aren't having kids and they silently or verbally get upset one day(or talk behind my back to my sister, which my mom does).

We were not what I would call ""friends"", we were just people who sometimes got together and had a bit of fun. In this group there was this girl, let's call her Cathy. I never had any feelings for Cathy up until this point, and I never felt particularly close to her or anyone else in the group. Reason being we are just too different. Turns out an almost 3 year difference is a lot more than it appears. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some background on me: I am an average student but I have lots of interests on the side lines. I have 2 published books, am a freelance 3D artist, currently working on a mobile game, and although I love talking to and meeting people, I don't enjoy drinking or the night life. My close group of friends is made up of people already working, or other students who have managed to make their side interests into jobs. This is the total opposite of everyone in this group. They have no hobbies or interests apart from school, and they love to get blackout drunk. Hence why I never felt anything for any of them, and I never felt bad for knowing they didn't really feel anything for me apart from being someone they liked to hang out with once every blue moon.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this all changed when Cathy started showing attention to another guy, he can be James. So I would be taking to her and she would turn her back on me to go with James. Or leave me alone to be with James. Or whereas we would have a serious, dead-pan conversation no matter how hard I tried, she and James would be extremely playful around each other. In my head this clearly meant they were dating, and it still means that to this day, even though every proof points otherwise, like a) Cathy has had a boyfriend for 2 years, b) James lives 3 minutes away from Cathy yet they never go together to school, c) if Cathy stays the night alone in her house, James still leaves to go to his hometown, d) if James stays the night, Cathy will still leave early and go to another town to meet her boyfriend

&amp;#x200B;

I started developing feelings for Cathy all of a sudden purely out of this sense of extreme jealously and inferiority. It's not like I wanted a relationship with Cathy, sexual or romantic. I just wanted her to pay as much attention to me as she pays to James. This soon turned into very obsessive, annoying, insistent feelings of inferiority, jealously, and all around hurt. I could not stand to go to class. This is when I made the two best decisions I could make during this situation. 1) Enrolling in therapy. 2) Telling Cathy I simply could not emotionally bear to be around her and I wanted to break away from her and be alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Then Cathy did something she must have regretted 2000 times since. She told me to stay. I told her everything, about how I was constantly feeling the need to compete for attention around James, and how I found James to be annoying so I couldn't stand to be around him, etc. She asked me to please just keep getting along with her and ignore James.That was the first conversation. We had about James. Second conversation can be summed up with ""You do know I think James is a cool guy, but I really don't get along as deeply with him as you seem to think I do"". Third conversation, fourth, and fifth was me talking to her and her scrolling down her Instagram feed watching loud videos and calling me a drama queen.

&amp;#x200B;

That goddamn feeling of inferiority and obsession has only got stronger after this. My friendship with her is now completely done, finito, it's over. Yesterday we had an exam. James finished first, she finished second, I finished third. When I got out, they were talking about an exercise. I stood by them just expecting her to break conversation and talk to me, or that she at least started making eye contact with me. Since that did not happen, I interrupted. Today I called her out on how that made me feel, she called me out on interrupting (which is one thing I always accused James of doing), and went into Instagram as I tried to discuss more.

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy... Is not helping. When I got in I was seriously expecting her to go ""What you're doing is abusive to both sides. You should break all contact now and I will help you deal with your feelings after that"". She did not do that, in fact all of her tips go on the opposite relation, and me managing my feelings while still talking and being with Cathy daily. She gave me barely any tools to do this though, and I'm having trouble using them. The feeling keeps getting stronger. Now it's no longer James, it's almost everyone. If I'm talking to Cathy and responds with one word a dead face, and then talks to someone else, anyone at all, while laughing, bang. That's it. There it is. My therapist says that since I have a history of being bullied and then coming back home to a family who would beat me out of my sadness and lock me in my room to study, my brain will look for specific people who it knows will not be a match, and then develop strong feelings for these people, so when that person ignores me or walks away to talk to someone else or whatever, not it has still more proof that I'm a failure. 

I have no clue what to do. I'm certain Cathy wouldn't actively stand against me cutting off all contact again, but I feel extremely bad if I stop talking to her. I've tried talking to other people and girls, but I feel no interest at all in them, and if I'm talking to a girl near Cathy, I use this new girl to make sure Cathy can listen to us having a good conversation so she can get jealous, I guess? If Cathy doesn't seem to care, I stop caring about this new girl as well.

What the hell. What are my options? I feel trapped :(",23Jan2019,1
592,"(Translations might not carry the exact meaning behind what I want to say as English is not my primary language)

So, for a week I'm staying in a foreign country. My school decided to put us in the hands of a hosting family as they can give us shelter and food. It's been 3 days and I just got the most horrendous experience whose target wasn't me. My two roommates, let's call them C and P. I've know C for a year now and we just met P at the beginning of the trip. The problem began yesterday, when I was eating dinner with them, and they started to say that this girl is hot or other things like that (without her knowing). At the beginning it seemed pretty inoffensive, and I didn't say much because I didn't want to sleep with people that had this reputation of me ""ruining the party"". But then, today, they shocked me when they said those things in such horrible manners. When I told them to stop this, they tried to justify by telling me that ""we're men"" or such. They continued their thing and when I asked them if they were serious, they told me ""yes."". 

Now, I've just gotten a conversation with C, and he tells me that the problem is that I don't understand them, that what they really mean is that she's beautiful. I go on a rant about how words have meaning, connotations and history behind them, that those kinds of words are only used by people who don't have respect for ladies. He carries on by saying that as she's such an exceptional one she should be treated as such, but then I thought and told him that you wouldn't treat your own mother like that, that you wouldn't treat her like a whore but rather like a princess since they are so exceptional. That's when he began avoiding the subject by telling me that he likes to understand people, to talk to them to learn about them and not look at appearances, making this great picture of himself and telling me he understands me. When P returns to our room where we were talking in, C just negates all the things he just said when P tells him that she's meat he'd want to eat, and he approves what P says. Of course C says that they shouldn't do this anymore, but I'm not sure if he's sincere and since P was absent during all the conversation, I don't think he changed his opinion. 

I feel stabbed right now, I can't think, I'm too tired, I have 3 days left and I want to know what to do. I just talked to a great friend of mine and she told me that I should tell one of my teachers who are with us for the trip. However this teacher has a reputation of being humorous and I don't think I can anticipate his reaction. Should I still tell him? Should I just keep my silence? Please help.

TL;DR: My two roommates are being disgusting towards a girl in our hosting family for a scholar trip and don't seem to see it as such.

PS: I'd like to remind you about the fact that the girl doesn't know about anything.",23Jan2019,1

I told her I was planning on taking another 2 years of school to get a 2 year degree for computer networking (I absolutely love working with computers, and figured I would enjoy it more than the path I am currently on now... although, I'm finishing up this last semester so I can at least graduate out of this marketing degree I'm in right now) and she got super upset. She asked why my work wasn't scheduling me more hours, and I explained to her there was a mixup when they put in my new schedule and I have to talk with them on fixing it; but the HR person wasn't there this weekend, so I had to wait to get it fixed. 

She then started taking on a very snarky tone and demanded I take extra classes this summer to graduate quicker, and when I mentioned possibly finding a more sustainable job she got super upset, and she continued to raise her voice as she continued to tell me that she plans on taking me off of her insurance and all of the accounts we have around home (although it's just the phone plan and netflix). I told her she could do whatever she wants and I didn't have her fucking answers for her, and she erupted. 

I just got up from the dinner table and threw my food away, and she yelled at me about never facing my issues. I looked up at her without saying a thing and she just continued to yell more and tell me that she wished I didn't live in her house, and that I should find another spot to live. My dad questioned her as to why she was acting crazy, but honest... it's a usual thing for her. Sadly, my two other younger siblings have to hear the brunt of it as well. 

Later that night, I heard them arguing and *quietly* yelling. I'm 20 years old. I planned on moving out next year, but maybe I have to move that date up. My girlfriend isn't able to move out quite yet, and my other options for roommates bailed on me before. What should I be doing? School is going fine for me, I work 30-35 hour a week, and sustain myself just fine. But this really came out of nowhere. We haven't talked since, and my father hasn't said anything either. 

tl;dr: Mom threw a massive tantrum and basically said she is taking me off of all insurances and said she wished I would live somewhere else. Dad argued with her, and none of us have talked since.

Some background: my husbands brother died when he was seven. He had all sorts of congenital and physical defects that resulted in his parents running back and forth from the hospital. Even so much as to live at Ronald McDonald house for a time. The poor kid had 40 surgeries before he was two. Even though my hubby was only two years older then brother, he still saw everything that happened. He doesn’t talk much about but I think he’s scared about having the same thing happen to us. I mean, his parents almost divorced over the brothers death.

She had friendzoned my friend a few times before but he still liked her. I was with her one evening and she confessed to me and i rejected her out of respect towards my friend. After a week they got together.

The day before the brake the girl told my friend that she doesn't love him anymore and they took their short brake, but immediately after they split the girl got her feelings back for him.

I had told her I needed to process things. Instead of waiting for my to get back to her, she began to hound me about it. She messaged me over and over. I told her I was uncomfortable with the whole thing. I told her this several times. Eventually, we talked civily about what went down with my child’s dad and the conversation died off. I never gave permission for her to see my daughter, though. I came to find out that, without talking to me, grandma (on dad’s side) facilitated the getting together of my child and his ex.

I’m currently working part time and studying to become an electrician but I’m not really interested in it and was pushed to do so by my family. I’ve been thinking about pursuing game development and have some background in coding in high school, mostly coding in arduino. I found it interesting and was doing most of it in the group projects. Gaming has been my passion for most of my life and I know people say it’s hard hours and will put you off games but I don’t mind putting in the work. Don’t know who to ask since my family doesn’t really understand the games and think it’s a waste of time. Would really appreciate some help. ",23Jan2019,1

633,"My boyfriend drinks a lot. He's not an affectionate person, I've always known that and I love him the way he is. He is very responsible, smart and funny. On New Year's he proposed to me, and it was one of the scariest things that's happened to me.
You see, the first thing that came to my mind then was that he can change his mind. The thing is, he almost never wants to see me, he's always told me he doesn't want to live with me, 90% of the times I ask him to help me with anything or offer him to meet up, he refuses.
One of the things that makes it so hard is that the only times he's ever been affectionate is when he was drunk. I know he's always had a hard time acknowledging his emotions, but hear me out. He would call me over only when he was drunk, he would say all kinds of nice things, but the next morning he would say he regrets calling me over and that I shouldn't really listen to his words when he's drunk. I asked him to stop calling me when he's drunk and being so nice in hopes of him trying to do that while he's sober, but he stopped doing any of that altogether. He's trying to stop drinking but I caught myself thinking that sometimes I would rather he drank only so that I could hear from him. I feel like I'm a piece of shit because the person I love so dearly almost only wants to see me when he's drunk. I feel like he can't tolerate me any other way or something. Sometimes I can't breathe and I don't really want to.",23Jan2019,1
635,"We became really close at the beginning of the school year. She’s pretty popular and is super nice and friends with most of our class. We have most of the same friends and now they don’t like me. I know exactly why they don’t like me. I have a more malicious type of humor and I sometimes go too far. We make fun of each other usually and are assholes to each other. But I mean none of it. It’s just who I am. My sense of humor might not come through with everyone and might not make sense. She made me feel super comfortable with myself and she gave off a vibe that my personality was okay with her and she found it funny because she would laugh super hard at the stuff I would say and she would throw stuff back at me. But I guess I got the wrong signal and went too far. Now I’ve messed things up so now she’s told all her friends about me and now they don’t talk to me. They always ignore me and avoid me. I ask a question about the things we’re doing in class and she either ignores me or gets upset. I know it was my fault but it makes me feel unwanted. I’ve said sorry multiple times and she has said it’s okay. But I know it’s not okay.  I know I should probably just suck it up and deal with it because really in high school, no one cares about you at the end of the day. But how can I fix this?",23Jan2019,1
636,"Do you constantly find yourself scrolling and scrolling on social media? Realize it. Delete the app, only to re-download it and do it all over again? 
Though it’s obviously that social media is a platform where people go to boast and post about the wonders of their lives, I tend to absorb myself into it too much. 
Growing up, my mom always compared me to other children.. asking/telling me “look at her, why can’t you be like her?” So I’ve built this horrible habit of comparing myself to others. Especially my friends. 
I’m 24 years old, an RN and I feel confused and unhappy about my life because this job had not turned out like how I thought it would. And I’m burnt out from taking care of others and feeling like my life is pointless because I don’t get to do the stuff that I want to do (travel, shopping, spend time with my bf). 
I’m constantly comparing myself to my bf’s best friend who works as a manager at a phone company. Jealous that he makes way more money than me without a college degree. Works better hours and has this girlfriend who does the same thing as him so they’re always getting to hang out/travel cause they have the same days off. This friend seems like he has a better outcome for life as he eventually wants to do business and his family owns all sorts of business. 
So that leads me to where I am... constantly comparing myself to him and his gf’s lives. Jealous and feeling sad because I feel stuck in my life and my life is nothing that I want it to be. 
I want to stop feeling sorry for myself and be happy with what I have. 
But I’m not sure how/where to start. 
Any advice would be appreciated.

TL;DR: how to stop comparing myself to others? How to be grateful for what I have?",23Jan2019,1

640,"To start off, it'd be good mention that I'm really insecure about whether or not people like me. This is mostly cause in elementary, I was like a failed extrovert, where I loved doing anything social with my friends, but I just wasn't good at making any actual friends, so I was always stuck wanting to do something with friends, but never having any friends to do them with. 

This hasn't really changed at all, now in highschool. The only difference is that I got better at socializing a bit. 

So, about 8 months ago, I met who would become my girlfriend. We were friends for about a month before I asked her out. She quickly said yes, and revealed that she had a crush on me since we met. After that, everything was like bliss, and I was madly in love with her all the way up until the end. During that time, all of my insecurities and doubts about no one actually liking me melted away, and I can't recall a day that was really bad when we were together. 

It all ended, however, when one night a couple weeks ago I asked her if she could something head upstairs so we could FaceTime (we went to different schools, so when we actually saw eachother was rare, and her parents wanted her downstairs whenever they were home so they could hang out, which rarely left me any opportunity to Snapchat her, let alone call or FaceTime, so I constantly missed her whenever she was downstairs) And because of that, she broke up with me the next day. Apparently asking her to go upstairs once in a while so we could talk was being ""too clingy"". 

After the first couple days, everything started to get back to normal, but it's now a couple weeks, and all the insecurities and fears she had been keeping in check are starting to return. Along with this, I'm starting to get the feeling that I'm not special to anybody. Like, the looming fear that no one considers me to be a close friend, not even my best friend. 

If this had been before I knew my ex, I might've been fine, but since then I'm so used to being actually happy, going back to how it was feels even worse. And now I'm terrified there's nothing I can do to keep myself from becoming insignificant to all my friends and truly alone, at least for the rest of highschool (currently a junior). Is there anything I can do to try and change this? 

TL:DR life feels like shit, and it feels like I can't do anything to change that, what do?",23Jan2019,1
642,"With my therapist. I don't want to post many details here because I don't want him knowing I ""told"" someone. I love him, very much, but I can't help feeling violated by him. Things have been sexual for awhile. The first time it happened, I wasn't ready, he knew I wasn't ready, but it still happened. Since then I have felt tremendous pressure. I don't want to lose him or his love but what if it's all a lie? What if he's just using me as his sex toy? It feels that way sometimes. I think maybe I'm in denial because I just want his love so bad.

I'm very broken right now and I don't know how to leave. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated. I'm not a troll. This is my life right now. I would love to hear feedback from some mental health professionals. PMs welcome. Thank you.",23Jan2019,1
643,"I'm not sure where to begin. I was so hardworking. I valued getting good grades at school. These days, it seems like the day passes by so fast while I have sat around doing nothing but tapping on my phone screen. I don't think I'm depressed? But my grades have slipped, and I procrastinate to the point of self-destruction. I've tried literally everything. All the productivity tips like time blocking, checklists, scheduling, you name it. It just never sticks. I tell myself to get to work, and to change, but it never happens. I love fashion and art and I plan to focus my career path on it. But recently I haven't even picked up my pencil to draw. When I do, it just doesn't turn out the same as before. I am so behind on my art projects and somehow I don't have the will to even start them. 

I always thought that this was probably just because I'm lazy. But even lazy people will finish what they have to. I realized that in the last month, this problem has gotten worse. Today, I faked getting sick for the first time because when I woke up this morning I felt so tired and something inside of me rejected school. I have never done this in my life. I told myself I would use the extra time to catch up on school homework, but I've been in bed all day accomplishing nothing. I hate this side of me.

647,"Alright, so I've talked to multiple people who are close to me about this and they all tell me the same thing, that I do need to talk to her about it. My main problem is that the only way I've learned to operate (due to an extremely lonely bring up) is based on need, I'm still very much awkward with emotions (I have Alexithymia) but today I managed to figure out that I actually miss my girlfriend, despite having classes and a home period with her. I would feel terrible if I just asked for her attention, which would force her to change her habits for me, but it feels genuinely bad that she literally never seeks me out, not even to say hello. It's not that I want her to become dependant on me, she knows that I'm there for her the instant she needs me, but I just don't feel any love. There's only two people who manage to ""lift"" her up, let's call them Veronica and Joe; Veronica is someone who is obsessive and doesn't realize it but she's managed to get close with my girlfriend, Joe is my buddy and he's an all around cool guy, he's the incarnation of the stereotypical teenager. This very fact alone makes me feel like I'm missing something, and I'm not going to lie, I'm a really boring guy, I was forced to grow up too soon and I'm socially awkward, so I tend to rarely mix in well within any interactions. I believe I'm also jealous?

I don't want to make it seem like I haven't tried to confront... hell, let's call my girlfriend Emily. But I also haven't been direct about it, the two questions I've asked are, ""Am I boring?,"" and ""Are you content with our relationship?"" To answer the first question, since I just told her that I feel like I'm not as noticeable, she told me that all I had to do was be direct about my needs and that she'd try to pay closer attention. To answer the second, she told me she was content and that our relationship was up there, however, she did tell me that she's faulty of not being almost at all comfortable with being vulnerable, due to the possibility of repercussions. Ever since then, she seems hesitant to even hug me, she told me she wasn't comfortable with kissing (the same day I asked about her feelings about us), and I've come to feeling more void about myself.

I sincerely love Emily, and we've been together for what's been 8 months now. I also feel like I'm being a bipolar/needy bitch, because the instant she does something nice, the bad feelings go away. She's also granted me the privalage of getting to meet her family, which in my mind establishes seriousness, especially since I'm the first partner she's done this with. However, the fact that she doesn't ever reach out with me in conversation or romantically makes me feel ugly. Also, I feel the need to clarify that both Emily and I aren't exactly physical, we've only made out once and I understand not wanting to smooch in public, but it's the fact that she's been hesitant with even hugs that bugs me. There's two smaller things that get me too, on our very first date she told me that she would give up ""angst"" because it would set our progress backwards, but she's still reading it and she and Joe are always in calls together (but it's not cheating, since she abhors cheaters and Joe is going through his own relationship stifles right now). 

I've tried to list all the major things as fairly as I can, and I guess what I want to ask is if anyone can help me in any way at all, just, I don't know what I'm feeling or what I could do about this situation. I'm more than willing to confront her, but I don't know what the hell I would tell her.

I'm not sure if it's obvious, but I'm also willing to answer questions that would help me, except I feel like I've thought of most of everything on my own.

Just writing this out felt great, thank you for anyone who's willing to help me out or even bother. Seriously. ",23Jan2019,1
648,"I’m 25, established in my career, but believe I’m being taken advantage of. Almost 1 year ago my mother moved in with me which was supposed to be at the most for a few months.

649,"Hey everyone. I started a new job that is fairly high level at a brand new company two weeks ago. The job seems pretty decent, and I made friends quickly with one of my coworkers, we will call M, right away. 

M seemed really bright and bubbly and I liked her a lot. She told me on day one that she is a mom of one little boy and that she is currently going through a divorce with her husband of 11 years. I listened and expressed sympathy and then changed the subject. 

Since then, M has been coming into my office every single day to talk on and on about her separation and impending divorce. She comes by for at least 30 min every morning, and sometimes comes by for another 30 min in the afternoon. Every time I speak to her, she immediately turns the conversation back to herself, her husband and the divorce. Finally, today I said “I don’t really have any more advice to offer you. I’m sorry you are going through this, I know it has to be tough.” And I said some encouraging things about pulling through it. I then suggested that she may want to look into speaking to a therapist since this is a tough situation. 

When I suggested the therapist, she did not seem happy. She said “oh, is me talking about it to you too much for you?” I didn’t want to be mean, so I assured her that I wasn’t upset that she talked to me about it, but encouraged her to seek out someone who might be more beneficial. She seemed angry and hurt and didn’t speak to me for the rest of the day.

I’m stuck. I like her a lot and would really like to have friends at my new office so I don’t want to cause her to drop me. However, I am trying to learn a new job right now which is stressful and exhausting, and it’s freaking me out to have my new boss see her in my office chatting that much, because I don’t want him to think I’m a slacker. I want to be a good friend, but that’s a road that needs to go both ways, and she’s draining me right now.

650,"This is a little long but this is so serious to me. 

Using this on a throwaway account because friends and family know of my main. 


So, I’ve lost a lot of weight in the last year and I have to admit, I didn’t lose it in the best way (I was stressed out about a relationship and I kind of lost appetite, but I still ate when I was hungry). I never forced myself to eat when I wasn’t hungry, because why do that? However as soon as I felt hungry, I ate. I never puked my food back up however. 

Today, my mother comes in my room and tells me to come sit down with her and my dad, that I was in trouble. I had not done anything wrong to my knowledge so I was a little nervous. 

I go sit down and she says,”Son, be honest. Have you been puking up your food?” I had no clue of where she was thinking this or why, so I told her,”No!” She did not believe me it seems even though she claims she does. She said that they will go get my throat looked at and me examined if they must.

I then got really defensive, and I told them that I would never ever do that! That is honestly the truth!

I then found out why they have this idea. I have friends at school and all three of us have been losing weight, which I guess looks bad. Anyways, apparently a teacher over heard us talking about puking up our food (What??? I legit have never joked or talked about this ever with anybody and especially them). It turns out one of the friends actually does this, and the other one lost the weight the legit way, by fixing the diet and exercising (which I also eventually did).

I don’t really eat in the mornings or afternoons because I’m not hungry but I come home and have a big healthy and hearty dinner (Chicken, beans, etc.)

I fee like my parents don’t trust me. For example, over the summer, they thought I would commit suicide so they took away my hunting guns in my safe near my room, but I didn’t act weird or anything. I would never ever consider killing myself, much less shooting myself. It bothers me because I don’t know what I did to lose their trust. I don’t do drugs or drink or do anything else bad, I’d say I’m an okay kid.

Anyways, here’s the questions Reddit. 

1. Did I over react by getting defensive over this?

2. What should I do or what would you do in this situation.

3. Am I wrong in any of this?

I know it was long but this has me so bothered. I’d never do this. If you saw me in person, you’d never even think I’d do something weird like this or shoot myself because I’m not showing signs and that’s not who I am! I feel like I’m a one man army here haha. Thank you Reddit! ",23Jan2019,1
