0,"I’ve complained about my neighbour so many times now, something must be done.
We rent through a huge well known company.
They never ever do anything about it and keep fobbing me off on the phone saying the representative for our area is ‘on the sick’.


It’s a serious neighbour dispute.
We need a meeting for mediation.
I’ve had to quit my job because she keeps me awake all night banging on the walls.
She sleeps all day then wakes up at about 10pm, she usually starts banging on the walls about 12am, sometimes it’s gone on til 5am.


It sounds like she’s hammering a picture into the wall with a hammer.
I’ve spoken to her about it 4-5 times and it’s in one ear out the other.
On a few occasions it has become quite frightening because she isn’t all there and seems violent.
I have had to call the police to come out and check on her because this just isn’t normal.
It’s 12.20am now and she has just started again for the night.


I am now without a job as I couldn’t carry on not sleeping then going into work.
I just don’t know what to do anymore.
I’m sitting in my living room just shaking with anger and I honestly could cry.
I’m 34 and it feels like I’m being bullied by my neighbour because she likes to bang the walls in the middle of the night.


I’ve become a night owl and sleep during the day because SHE does.
Please note this isn’t because we are noisy so she is ‘getting us back’ or anything like that, we are usually dead asleep in the middle of the night when she starts, with no tv left on or any noise of any sort coming from our house.


We would be out of the house all day and honestly we are just quiet people in general, we’ve never even raised our voices at eachother in this house. 
This started a few months ago now.

I quite honestly feel suicidal about this.",16Jul2019,3

2,"This is going to be very long and might be a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandparents are in some dire need of help. My dad and his sister haven't done anything to get them on the right track, and I feel like I need to take the initiative because it's hard seeing the way they live. They never did anything, because they knew that if the city knew how they lived, they would be out of a house and probably be in a nursing home or assisted living. Everyone knows something needs to be done, but no one has the guts to put their family in a bad position.

They are getting old and are both hoarders, with my grandfather becoming more of one in the last few years. My grandmother is morbidly obese and my grandfather is a diabetic (type 1), neither of them will take care of themselves. My grandmother asks my grandfather to do things because she ""can't"", and he does it. Like I said, my grandfather is diabetic and doesn't take care of himself. He has insulin reactions all the time because he takes insulin shots despite having a functional pump. This has almost resulted in his license being revoked after a car accident years ago. 

The main thing I am concerned about is their living conditions. As I said, they are hoarders. They also have a dog, who they feed but don't clean up after. As a result, there is dog piss and shit everywhere. The house reeks to the point that no one visits anymore. My grandmother has been diagnosed with asthma, with the cause being not only her weight, but the dog piss in the house has literally burned her lungs to the point of no return. The furniture is nasty and I will spare the details about their bathrooms. Another thing about my grandmother is that she has IBS. What does this mean? It means that sometimes there is even human feces on the wood floor and she doesn't clean herself. They have been hoarders for a very long time, after my dad left home to be exact. As a family, we've always felt that the house was more cluttered and nasty than it was full of junk, if that makes any sense. This has changed recently and has emerged as a whole slew of problems. 

They have gotten into going to estate sales. I just assume that you as the reader are familiar with how these work. The problem with this is that they can't afford to go and get literal junk that needs to be thrown out. Because they are old, they can't move this stuff by themselves so they have to get someone else to do it. This involves my aunt and my cousins, because my dad doesn't want to condone what my grandparents are doing. One thing my grandmother recently wanted was holiday decorations. What did she get from the estate sale? Almost an entire walk in closet's worth of plastic tubs with trinkets for just about any holiday you can think of. Why? For the amount of stuff she was getting, it was a bargain. A problem arose upon picking up the items, they didn't have enough money. The logical thing to do would to be to just leave the stuff, but since my cousin was already there, they asked for a loan of $35 to get the stuff. She was pisssssed. She gave them the money, because it was hard not to. She's a twenty two year old trying to feed an illegitimate child and go to work for pennies, she didn't have the spare money to do that. She's made it clear that she's done with her grandmother. Not to mention they still didn't have money for bills. The second and most recent problem came up today. They got some exercise equipment. Neither of them are interested in getting fit, but hey ""50 for 3 pieces of equipment, what a steal!"" Obviously this was broken equipment from the 80s, but hey, bargain. My other cousin came to help them this time. Not only did he have to disassemble some of it to get it in his truck, but he also tore something in his shoulder. He's in the ER now and is what inspired this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you've heard their conditions and all the stories, I need to know who to get in contact with in order to get this rectified. The state of the health, finances and home are on the line and they need a wakeup call from this slumber they are in. I need this to be anonymous, because I don't want to be the bad guy. I live in Western North Carolina, so if anyone knows of anyone in this area that deals with this kind of thing, let me know. Could I call Social Services? I'm pretty sure they deal with this sort of thing.",16Jul2019,1
3,"I was offered a merit scholarship to a university that I’m attending in the fall. One of the main reasons I chose it was because of the scholarship they gave me, which had a lot of perks and also had ~9k in grant money. However, when I got my financial aid offer on my portal, it turns out I didn’t sign a contract that was due last month so I forfeited my scholarship automatically.

I’ve been panicking because this scholarship means a lot to me. The 9k is 1/3 of what I have to pay per year, after university grants have been taken out. My family isn’t rich at all, but we aren’t considered low income so we don’t get any help from the government. 

I called the financial aid office and they told me to write an appeal. I plan to tell them that I recognize my lack of oversight on the contract (I swear I didn’t know there was one but lo and behold it’s there) and that there were no email notifications reminding us (my university sends emails out for lots of reminders), and I want to focus on how much the scholarship means to me and how much effort I put in just to be chosen. 

Can anyone here help me out with this? I don’t have a reason for not signing the contract other than that I really didn’t know it existed, but the people there don’t seem that lenient or sympathetic. I’m really worried my appeal will be rejected and there’s a lot of pressure on me from my father who will have the main financial burden. 

I have no experience writing an appeal letter so I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to word things or what to focus on in order to be more persuasive to the university but also not sound too desperate because I really do need the money. 

Thanks!",16Jul2019,1
4,"I've been in my company for as long as the company has existed (approximately 15 years).  Started here while in college since I had previously known the company owner and his sister.  I've stayed with the company through ups and downs (even suggested I take a pay cut instead of a few employees being let go during the financial crisis), and have helped out and taken on a new roles when asked.

As my role began to grow, I had taken a lot more tasks.  Although not uncommon, my skill set in this office is me and only me.  No one else tries to take it on.  We did hire someone to help take new projects on in my department (not to help lessen the load).  But as his experience grew, so did his workload.  Eventually, he left because it was too much for him.  Instead of finding a replacement for him, all his work essentially fell to me.  Now I feel like I have the amount of work equivalent to three or four people.

At this point, still without hiring anyone new, management has decided to minimize the amount of time I am out of the office (I am one of maybe three people that can do inspections), and the amount of proposals I can send out (we are also encouraged to get clients on our own for the company).  Still. though, management would still assign those tasks to me without asking, preventing me from telling them 'No'.  Kind of the final straw is when managment volunteered me (without asking) to go out and do a 10-min powerpoint presentation at an upcoming seminar, for a subject which I have minimal knowledge of.

Is this a company I need to leave?  I clock out of work stewing about all the assignments I have.  I spend Saturdays and Sundays thinking about how I can handle the upcoming week.  The only assisstance I've gotten from managament has been, ""I know you have a lot of work to do, so I'm allowing you to work overtime"" (OT had been abused before so it's only on a 'need to do' basis).  They did mention hiring someone to help, but they've intereviewed students fresh out of college, which will give me the task of walking them through the work process.  I've been here my whole adult life and I've never had to apply work anywhere else (meaning, I've never had a resume, or any job-hunting experience).  So, leaving would be a huge step back in my life.  Shoule I leave?

TL;DR  I don't feel appreciated at work and I feel like leaving.  Should I?",16Jul2019,1
5,"I just started driving about 6 months ago, and I’m almost done with my road lessons. However, whenever I drive, whether I’m in my moms car or the car I use during road lessons, I feel pretty anxious and constantly on edge. ESPECIALLY on the highway. I get super scared going over 50 and I feel like I’m gonna run into the person in front of me or like accidentally drift out of the lane. I’ve been on the highway about 4 times with my driving instructor, and I did okay.

I think the anxiety is caused from my driving instructor. He’s a super grumpy older man who seethes anger. He’s screamed at me, has swore at me, and today he even grabbed my hand while I was driving and made me beep the horn and told me “Stop being so nice and start using your brain”. He made me cry pretty hard once and had me pull over so he could yell at me and tell me that “I’m the only one making myself upset,” while he had been screaming at me the whole drive.  

Anyways, I have one lesson left with him and I’ve pretty much gotten used to his comments so I don’t take them to heart as much anymore, but now whenever I drive I have this nervous feeling in my body that makes me feel like I’m gonna get into an accident. 

Any advice is welcomed on how to maybe feel calmer behind the wheel :) I’m 16 by the way.",16Jul2019,2
6,"I (13/M) understand that teen boys are stereotypically depressed, have anxiety and are loaded with acne. At every school i've been to, nobody besides me fits the description. I feel like i will never change and will die alone. One of my main problems is that i fantasize about and obsess over women i will never be able to date (actresses, teachers, girls in my class) and women noone else likes. I went to a school i was fairly popular at and met a girl who almost every boy said was psycho (exaggerated) and ever since couldn't get her off my mind. I barely talked to her but am still thinking of her daily, six months after i left the school. The oddest part is that i found out the main reason i love her (her intelligence) is a lie and that she just cheats on papers. I had such great friends but the whole class found out a secret about me and got out of that school ever since. So many kids there i could relate too and have felt like i would never meet a group of people i could relate to perfectly. I got bullied daily at my most school due to the secret i left the prior school due to. I tried to transfer again to homeschooling and did everything i could but one thing i needed my dad for and he waited too long to do it. The one thing i had going for me was that i was decently intelligent (considered gifted) but now i feel anything but intelligent. I'm overweight and would like to work out but get anxiety due to my acne. The only reasons i have yet to commit suicide is because i feel people would miss me, i don't have a gun and don't know what comes after death.

11,"I've been living in a new apartment for a few months, and there has been an issue with the upstairs neighbors being really loud for a while. Tons of stomping, slamming things, occasionally what sounds like a shout or words that I can't make out. It will often go on for 10 minutes or more and then stop.

It happens every other day or so, and has continued for the past few months. I've been slowly piecing together what is going on day by day. At first I thought the floors might be super thin or something but they clearly cannot hear anything that happens in my apartment. 

The sounds will frequently move up and down the hallway, like someone stomping really loud and running. If their apartment is the same layout as mine, the sounds often happen in the guest bedroom, and go throughout the hallway, kitchen, and guest bathroom. 

There has never been a noise complaint (that I'm aware of) and no police have ever come to investigate. I've only seen the neighbors a few times, there are two to three of them and they all look like mostly average young adults, twenties or thirties. 

I don't want to assume they are being violent and cause problems, and I don't want to assume just based on what they look like. I don't live in a bad neighborhood but it is a below-average income area and the neighbors drive a car that is very old and beaten up (even compared to the neighbors and myself who also drive shitty beaten up cars), and generally look unhealthy (one person is really fat) but they don't look like methheads or trailer park white trash (they are all white, and this is in the Atlanta area).

I don't know if I should file a noise complaint or call the police or something. I'm worried someone is being abused but don't know who the victim or attacker are, and the sounds often wake me up at 2-3 AM, plus are just bothersome in general at other times. There's no set time this all happens.

17,"Ok, i hate to make a post about this but i just dont know what to do.

Backstory:

So, when my daughter was 12, a 17 year old started to stalk her. My daughter being young didnt see a problem with hanging out with a 17 year old. We warned both of them several time to cut contact she had but he started stalking her. He called me once and tried to convince to let him date my daughter saying how much he loved her and how he could be a great and caring boyfriend blah blah blah. He tried every argument with me he could think of and failed. So after showing up at various places, hunting her down online and on xbox getting nowhere he stopped. Weeeellllllllll ,we found out yesterday they had been talking again online and via text. My daughter is now 16 almost 17. yesterday around 6 am this kid killed a girl he was dated and proceeded to post pics to his instagram and text them to my daughter saying what he did and why then tried to kill himself.  The girl that he killed looks almost exactly like my daughter so there is an already psycho element to this. I guess she was a youtube personality (?) (im not sure if thats right) Now, the pics that were posted to instagram are now all over 4chan right now. Also, MSM has started to pick up the story. 

Now the backstory is over. 

As a father what do i even say to her? 

How can i comfort my now traumatized daughter?

Her mother and i are going to get her into counseling immediately.

I see my daughter hurting and just dont know what to say.

Sure kids dont come with an instruction manual but this, this is out there.  

I'm usually a ""buck up"" kind of guy but noooooo wwwaaayyyyy am i saying that right now.

In this day and age kids are ""always"" on the internet, Now if this story gets bigger and plastered all over even more, what can i do for her then?

&amp;#x200B;

He's been trying to get his drivers license, but its been weeks with no word of it. I finally bring it up today, and he instantly starts degrading himself like (oh, im worthless) ect. I tell him he'll get it eventually, and sent him an online study guide for the writing portion, and tell him to write it down in a notebook so he'll remember it better. Of course hes like I cant get one my mom works 3rd shift. I can't really help, I have alot of notebooks I would give him one if I could.

&amp;#x200B;

All he says he wants to do is sleep and play video games. I suspect he has some sort of mental illness with how many times the past 3 years he puts himself down. His dad did not help (verbally/mentally abusive to him and his wife, which was rare it was mostly directed at him). He just hardly passed highschool but he did very well his senior year (all F's from beginning of year, to D-B's) compared to his 9-11 grade years. He tries to blame it on his dad that hes not doing well ect but I tell him that he doesn't live with him, and he cant use that excuse anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to help him with all my best, and said that if he does not have his drivers license or in his own apartment by the time I get out of college (about 24/25 because im looking at a 4 year) or ill have to continue my life on my own. Ive said to get help from his cousin (whos 18, but pretty much had his life on track at 17, drivers license, graduated early, college , good paying job already, his own car). It scares me because he's brought up marriage when he has all these problems that bring me down in mood because hes constantly worrying me and saying I would be better off without him, that hes trash ect along with not really trying not to get a job to help with all these things. I've suggested therapy too, but he'll probably make up an excuse to avoid it as he's done in the past (ex, too much money, parents dont care ect)

I am a 20 year old female and work as an apprentice cook. 
For the last few months I have been getting really close with one of my coworkers. He has helped me through a lot and we have been spending a lot of our free time together lately. 

He is insanely handsome and sweet and smart and we share loads of similar interests, hobbies and got a very similar sense of humor. 

We have always been jokingly flirty but lately it's been getting pretty serious. The tension between us is getting almost unbearable and something is going to happen sooner or later.

There are a few problems
1. The age gap. He is 10 years older which could cause loads of problems for the both of us.

2. He is my superior at work. We work the same station together and he is supposed to teach me. I am getting transfered to a different restaurant soon but until then he is more or less my boss.

3. It could seriously damage his and my reputation is anyone found out.

So, am I obligated to help them fix it? It seems as they want me to chip in to pay for the replacement, but I don't feel like that's fair. I just don't want to get into any legal trouble.

26,"I know this question has probably been asked a million times, so sorry for any repetition.

I work in the medical industry, and I recently got licensed to practice a few months back. I've been job hunting ever since, but haven't had any success. This morning, I got a phone call and I have an interview at a hospital on Thursday! Even more amazing - it's the hospital that I did my placement at while I was in school a few years ago, and it's where I always dreamed of working after I got licensed! It's a temporary position to cover a maternity leave, but it's still a foot in the door, and I've been wanting to work there for years.

I'm nervous because I don't interview well. I have all of the required qualifications, all of the best references, and I will rehearse all of the answers to all the classic interview questions, but as soon as I go in front of an interviewer, I panic and sound like an idiot. They emailed me with details about my interview, and I will be going in front of a panel of interviewers and answer their questions for 45 minutes. Every time I think about it, I feel like I want to hurl.

Does anybody have any advice on how to get through this with my dignity in tact and, hopefully, a job? It would be much appreciated!",16Jul2019,1

She arrived only a few minutes before me, (like 2). When I got to the house I saw her about to key into my home. I honked a “beep beep” and waved “no wait!” Like the “one second” hand symbol. 

She then said, “I have a key!” And I said “yes mom, but I’m not the only one who lives here and I rather you just wait a moment and let me open the door rather than you surprising my roommate.

28,"I dont like it. I dont like it. I've been alone since December when I broke up with my girlfriend. Since then I've been happy and working on improving myself. About a week and a bit ago I met this girl. She is perfect in literally every way. The fact that she looks incredibly beautiful is just the icing on the cake. Only problem is though shes too good. I dont think she'd ever be with me, I've gotten signs but no definite ones. We've hung out for a long time for 4 days now. We connect really well but I dont think I'm good enough physically for her. I wish she was a bit less attractive because I'm truly infatuated by her being. It genuinely breaks my heart that she has to look so fucking flawless. She looks like Khalessi when she smiles :( I hate this. I felt so strong and unbreakable mentally for so long it was great. Now I feel vulnerable and weak and scared. Apart of me wants to just cut off connections and never speak to her again cause it hurts but we've gotten so close that it would feel wrong. I care about her a lot. Too much. The only other girl I was in love with I had to be going out with her for a good couple months to love her. Why did I fall so fast.  I didn't think it was possible. It feels like such a genuine childish love/crush where I cant stop thinking about her. Helppppp! Wtf do I do. :( why does her ex have to be a male model with a sexy ass body.

29,"On Saturday, my boyfriend and I got really drunk at a wedding, and ended up in an argument when we got home. It wasn’t a huge deal and we know we need to separate in order to cool off when we’ve both been drinking. We maybe yelled at each other for 3-5 min. He went to the park across the street, I got in the bathtub. Next thing I know, I’m opening my bathroom door to a COP because one of my neighbors called the cops.  It was literally 8pm. To begin with, I am livid. I have a hard time letting things go and I’m dramatic and I know this and it’s something I’m working on. But everytime I come home from work in the evening, it reignites my anger to think about someone around us calling the police over a petty little argument. Does anyone know any good techniques for letting things like this go? Or am I just gunna need to tough it out and forgetting will come with time? I’m having to restrain myself from hanging a sign in the window that says mind your business or something equally immature and petty because I’m so upset about the whole thing. I’ve never dealt with the police ever and I’m a good person and now I just feel like whoever did this branded us as the crazy couple on the block, as my half my neighborhood witnessed the cops showing up.",16Jul2019,1
30,"I was sexually assaulted two years ago by my ex-boyfriend within the walls of my high school. Just this past year, I’ve decided to take action, but now I’m not so sure. 

When I decided to spread word, I came to my school counselors. Every person with authority gave me a different answer as to why I SHOULDN’T press charges. I was told, “we changed the security system to electronic that same week,” “the security tapes are probably taped over,” “no one is going to look through that much footage,” and it seemed really like my school is just covering their asses and not wanting to get involved. Their answers could be truthful, but I doubt it. 

Other issues are that when my boyfriend and I would text, I would always cater to him and his needs, which mostly meant nudes. 

Obviously, saying “no” was a turn off for him and I’d get the cold shoulder until I complied, but that’s not something I ever communicated through text. If the police got a hold of the messages, they’d see us sexting back and forth with no known sign of me being absolutely terrified and disgusted with myself. 

I don’t want to become one of those headlines in the news that are famous for those judges who let a man from a “good family” run free, but, I also can’t live with myself seeing him ruin other girls’ lives. I feel responsible. 

Some minor bullet points:

- The ages listed are the ages we are currently. At the site of the assault I was 14, he was 15. 

- He was my first boyfriend; I didn’t know what I was doing when it came to relationships. I was his second girlfriend. 

- There’s been talk of another girl (presumably his ex) who’d been assaulted by him as well, but I don’t know who. 

- He hid our relationship from his parents. I managed to get his permission to allow our friends to know, but he broke up with me when I told my mom that we were dating. My parents had no negative reaction to our relationship. 

- I was assaulted before first period (7:20 AM) in a stairwell. I was having a major anxiety attack because the night before, he texted me to come to the back of the stairs so he could “grab me.” The only reason why I went was because he told me that morning, verbatim, “It’s not like I’m gonna hurt you.” 

- Yes, I said “no.” I said no the entire duration of the assault. 

- We never had sex or any sort of genital/skin to skin contact. 

I feel so defeated. If I can’t get him in legal trouble, I’m getting him into high school drama that’ll last him the duration of Junior-Senior year. My issue is, I don’t know how to start. I know it’s open-ended, but any advice is appreciated. 

Thank you.",16Jul2019,1

32,"My (half)sister (25) and my brother-in-law (24) have cut off my mom two days after getting married, a wedding which my mother largely planned and payed for. The reason behind this seems to be my sister’s drinking problem. She’s not necessarily an alcoholic, however, she’s an extremely mean drunk. 

The night before her wedding, my sister got extremely drunk at the AirBnB that our extended family (including myself (15), my mom, and her dad) was staying at. My brother-in-law was also very drunk, but passed out almost immediately and the groomsmen had to help him uber to the hotel. My sister began attacking anyone and everyone with ruthless, personal attacks. These people included myself, my mom, her dad, her grandmother, and our aunts. We did nothing to provoke her except for saying she needed to tone it down a bit as it was around 2 AM and our other grandparents and family were trying to sleep. Eventually, our mom had had enough and forced my sister, who was going to stay at the AirBnB that night, to uber to their hotel.

The following day at the wedding, my sister refused to talk to me or my mother.

Yesterday, 2 days after the wedding, my brother-in-law sent a text to my mother saying that he and my sister were cutting her off and to never speak to them again. My mom, who was not in the wrong (in this situation at least), is extremely devastated. She can hardly talk or think about it without crying and is very angry with herself, my sister and brother-in-law, and the world.

I’m a minor and I live part-time with my mom. Because I’m a minor and my sister is an adult who lives independently, there’s nothing I can really do to fix the situation. Is there anything I can do to at least help?",16Jul2019,2

35,"\[19M\] Let's just say that I'm not the brightest person. I'm also not very motivated. I went to college for one year majoring in audio engineering, and I pretty much hated it. I got a 2.1 GPA my first semester, because I just didn't know what I was doing. I ended up taking 8 classes in my Spring semester and while I was doing pretty poorly, I decided to pull myself together after midterms and ended up with a 3.6 GPA. Yet, after coming through with better grades, I don't really think I learned anything and I didn't feel very accomplished. I didn't make a single connection and spent the whole school year in bed. Because of financial reasons, I transferred out at the end of the semester and I've been currently ""looking"" for a new school even though I haven't given it much thought in the last 2 months. In other words, I haven't left my bed for over 2 months.

I promised myself that I would put more effort into my studies, but I just don't care. I just don't think I have the attention span or discipline to actually engage in my schoolwork, because everything just seems too complicated or boring. I only gain a sense of accomplishment when I work on my own projects, whether it's producing/composing music, making videos/editing, etc. 

I know school is crucial for developing the skill-set for your future career, but I phase out in literally every class daydreaming about my own projects. I want to care about school, but it seems impossible to. I've been ""trying"" to look for a school I can transfer to at the moment, but I don't know where to begin and I get stressed out every time I see the tuition and give up. 

What should I do?

TL;DR - not very motivated about school even though i try to, having trouble finding an affordable school and trying to care about my studies and future",16Jul2019,2
36,"My boyfriend and I are in our late 20s and have been dating for a long time. The topic of kids never really came up because when we started dating that’s not something we were thinking about. Now it’s been years and I know that he wants kids, but I don’t. 

I know it seems like a simple situation, but he’s the type of person that doesn’t think too much about the future. I’ve literally sat and thought about every single thing that having a child would change in my life. I’m pretty sure he only wants kids because that’s just what people do. But I don’t think he has really thought in depth about it. 

So I’m afraid even if I bring it up to him, and we break up over it, he’s just going to think I’m being irrational or something. And sure, even if he thought about it to the level I have, he still might come to the conclusion he wants them. But I want him to be sure. 

We’ve both said little comments over the years about kids. He knows I don’t want them (I think he assumes I’ll change my mind). And I know he wants them “eventually”. We’ve had one conversation about it where we started to talked about it, but when we disagreed we just kind of dropped it. 

We’re both really non confrontational people. I think we’d both rather ignore the problem and pretend it isn’t there. And it sucks because we get along perfectly aside from this one issue. But you can’t really compromise on kids. 

Basically, we’re getting older and I want to start my life, whether that’s with or without him. I live with my sister but I want to move out with him and buy a house. And I’m not going to do that without addressing this first. I just don’t know how. I was thinking about writing a letter maybe. How do you start that conversation though? “Hey I need to know your thoughts on this and if they’re not the same as mine we have to break up?”

And how do I get him to take it seriously and not just shut down and avoid the problem? How do I choose the date and time of this talk that could potentially be our breakup?",16Jul2019,1

41,"So, i'm 19 and I still live at home.   


Last year I got into an extreme sport that's growing pretty rapidly in the US. After accumulating a bunch of knowledge about it I started posting on reddit about it and my posts started getting some notoriety. Eventually, some people who currently run the largest company in the US began responding to them and indicating that they'd like to meet me. 

&amp;#x200B;

They bought me a plane ticket from NY to Florida to come hang out with them for a week and be a guest on their podcast. At the end of my stay, they offered me a job. Basically, it's a much lower salary and less benefits (at least less *official* benefits like insurance) but also there's no state tax in FL, and the big one is that housing is provided (In a 32 foot RV trailer, mind you, but that's still pretty dope in my mind.) So I accepted. It's crazy that I got offered a job in the industry let alone by the biggest name in the industry, and with me being basically some nobody on reddit. So I accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next week i'm going to pack up my car and head down there. So where the advice comes in, is what should I do to prepare for this? For any FL residents among you, are there particular things about living there that I need to know about? If it helps, i'll be living in Polk County. There is a month long trial period to this job, at the end of which I either am out the job or I can renegotiate for higher salary, depending on how the fit is. So I will either stay there or live with my aunt (only 45 mins away) while I find another job.

65,"Hi, I’m a bicurious? white male who has no idea what to do and I hate myself for it. I’ve recently gotten into a relationship with a trans man but is still physically a woman who has yet to undergo their transition. I completely respect and honor his feelings and I’ve never loved someone more than I do for him. And because of this I’m terrified of losing him over possibly not being ready for the transition. I prefer women, but I love him more than anybody and still wanna be with him just as much. But I can’t help but get selfish thoughts on how I’d rather him reconsider and it makes me feel disgusting. When he’s feeling dysmorphic I try my best to listen and reassure him, but I can’t help but feel like I’m not enough for him. I just want him to be happy, and I want to figure out how to work with this, but I have absolutely no idea how. Sorry if this is too complex to answer",16Jul2019,2
66,"Let me keep it brief and explain my nervousness. 

We've been living together now for 15 months. Been together for about 2 years. My gf has been on pill with imperfect use (taken daily within 3 hours). Her daughters love me and I love her and her daughters. I didn't really want kids with her but never really made up my mind on It. I always wanted a family but not in the situation where there's an exhusband who the new kid will eventually see as the new kid would want to be with its sisters eventually.

The whole thing really frightens me. Idk whether to stay together, to terminate, to get married. I have horrible anxiety and maybe that's another issue but the ex-husband thing (even though he's a very nice guy) has always been a hangup. I like the idea of a family but one where it's me and my wife and our kids every day with all the chaos that brings. 

I work a good job. I'm in good health. I'm a happy person. I'm just really scared now.  

Any advice? Thoughts? Thanks.",16Jul2019,2

68,"My whole life, I have always had poor self confidence in myself. This poor self confidence has always been accompanied with my social anxiety, minor depressive symptoms, and has affected my past relationships. I believe most of it stems from my very emotionally/verbally abusive parents who have always held me to very high standards in nearly every aspect of my life, continually telling me I wasn’t good enough. I have been told plenty of times by people that I was very pretty, and every time it’s been very difficult for me to actually take that seriously or process that. My self confidence issues also stem partly from my previous relationship of 5 years where I had been cheated on for a short time period during that, and from the fact that my ex immediately turned to a dating app after we broke the relationship off. My self confidence issues have been affecting my new relationship, where I have developed trust issues with my current boyfriend whenever he goes out with his friends (to music festivals or bars) where I have thoughts that he’s going to find someone better than me and leave me when he’s at these events. I try to come to these events with him, however I’m usually busy with working or simply cannot go because I’m not of age yet. I always end up overthinking when he’s out with his friends thinking that he’s talking to prettier/girls who socialize better than I can, and it’s becoming a big issue now since he’s been going out a lot this summer. I would appreciate any advice on how to increase my self confidence, and any past experiences with similar issues and how one gets past these issues. Thanks so much.",16Jul2019,2
69,"I (19M) have been in college for one year and after finding out about some health issues that would disqualify me from getting a job with my degree, I decided I either needed to change majors or get out before I get into more debt than I already have (I’m not doing too bad but another year would SERIOUSLY put me in a hole). 

After looking at all the different degrees my University offers I can’t find one that I would legitimately enjoy, or that would actually produce a job worth putting myself into serious debt for. If I drop out now I could easily repay my debt within a year or two just off of my savings. However everyone other than my dad seems to basically be telling me I’m not making good life choices and I should stay in college regardless. Another university is not an option as my current university is the only one I can afford.

My parents are divorced and My dad regardless of his strained living situation has offered his home if things don’t go well between me and my mom should I choose to drop out. my mom however keeps telling me even if I drop out I can stay with her BUT I’m making a stupid decision if I would go through with dropping out. This kind of makes me think if I go through with it she may hold up for a while but will ultimately kick me out.

Now onto the work situation. I have quite literally no work experience at all. I have never had an actual job in my life. I’m fine with working wherever and honestly at this point I think I’m over the idea of choosing a job that I would enjoy. I’m just unaware of how things work in the real world for people with no college education because I’ve always been coached on what to do once I have a degree.

Basically if I do this I feel as if everyone around me would think I’m throwing my life away and I have no idea what I could do with my life at this point. I feel like college has no place in my future but I can’t help but feel like I’d be screwing up by dropping out.",16Jul2019,2

It’s sharp stabbing pain in my left temple area, lasting for a few seconds, then leaving. The pain then radiates all over my head for a bit, then dissipates.

I think the stress I built up is now affecting my body.

So I’m 15 and still live with my parents, so this is especially hard, but my dad is a pedophile, and I’ve known for years now. I was going to pull a joke on my dad when I was 11-12 and while on his computer I found a file with a woman in a bikini, kind of weird but not too weird, and I show my friend that same week because I found it funny, but we notice something odd, odd meaning they where no older than 12, and that his images were full of similar pictures, one of a topless 17 year old girl and the other of children in revealing clothes doing sexual poses. And the very next day they’re all gone, deleted, don’t know what happened. Then 2 or so years go by and I try to forget about it as I was far happier when I didn’t know, and what didn’t make it easier me and my dad were very close. But 2 years later I discover more, I feel sick for months thinking about it, I consult my girlfriend at the time who I trusted and still do to help me, but it’s hard when you’re not close with the rest of your family, I can’t tell anyone else other than my mom, though we’ve never had a great relationship, nothing bad happened but we’re just very different people, and I ended up doing nothing about it, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.
Just the other day while my dad was distracted talking to someone I went to sit down in his chair to ask him for something, I look over to his screen and see another picture like the ones before, all my “reasonable” theories have been completely ruled out, I’m scared to confront him about it and I’m scared what the police will do and I’m scared what my mother will do. I feel stuck and I’ve only trusted 3 people with this knowledge, and the only other friends I felt comfortable telling were drunk because I knew they wouldn’t remember, sorry this was long but I just want a normal life away from this crazy shit, and my only plans consist of running away, threatening him, or blackmailing him.

My landlord sucks. Really sucks. It used to be okay but the last few weeks have been insane.

She bangs on the door and if I don’t answer or my roommate doesn’t get there in time, she will literally just open the door and walk in. This time she came at 9pm, and let us know that she had not yet received our rent for the month. The woman was here on the first, asked if I had rent, and I said yes, I had already put it in the drop box. It is now the 15th and she’s just now telling us she doesn’t have our rent.

87," I am a computer science student. I work part time to pay for my tuition. I don't have many experience in social problem, because I always alone and avoid conflict. 

So my team were given the responsibility to work on late projects. We got projects that were abandoned by former employee or projects that had no meaningful progress over a year. My boss told me to take over it. We had to complete it in 1-2 months for each project, because you know, client getting angry. I encouraged my team to work hard. We did complete all of it. Though it was a hell. Each month, one by one, member of my team got sick, some even had mental stress. Sometimes we worked from 8 am to 3 am. We have to juggle with our college studies too. Nothing was pleasant. Yet my team trusted me, ""whatever you do, I do"". It hit me hard, I had no close friend, but I guess this is what it feels like. 

Then our company got into financial problem. Well of course, we had lots of late projects. It's negative cash flow for years. We didn't make profit because too many projects were far too late. The company's payroll is so high yet most project thrown into us, the cheapest labor. I started thinking was our sacrifice worth it?

One day I asked why we didn't get funding from company X. They said ""well the owner is asian"", and then they said ""Asians are taking our job"". Instead of confronting it, I just kept silent. My team also went silence. We got some beers and agreed what a terrible answer it was. My team performance went down. Instead of working every single hour we can, we worked based on our contract, it's 6pm to 10pm. There were almost no communication between my team and the management, because everybody else worked 9-5. They no longer gave us projects.

After two weeks we were called. Tbh I screwed up. Thanks for my poor social skill and bad  communication, I look like an asshole that want to be rewarded with money for our hard work. They said ""everybody is working as hard or even harder, nobody complain about money except you"". And when I bring topic about company X, they said ""company x owner is an asshole, we did say it was because Asian, but do you really think we decided it just because he's Asian? Do you think we have no reason behind that? Do you not trust us that much? Do you know that we worked with many good asians before? ""

Tbf from their story company X owner does look like an asshole. Though I don't understand why they bring race in the first place. When I asked they said ""well maybe we were joking, or maybe it's because we were in bad mood because you are an egoistical prick that think you know it all"". 

They kept going on saying how I had a bad attitude, they said I was egoistical, they said I couldn't trust other people except my team, they said I couldn't watch other people feeling, they said I didn't like to hear answer that different from my opinion. 

I felt like I was the villain here. After that I apologize. I couldn't afford to lose job that paid my tuition.

I don't know what to do. I still feel something isn't right. I can't work in my fullest. My heart just don't accept this. Yet I don't know if I can land on another job with my current saving. If I try to get another job does that mean I run a way from problem? I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.

My grandpa is getting really sick, and is talking about our inheritance a lot since he was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago but is back home and doing okay. And after visiting recently (I now live on east coast while they are still on west) it was shocking to see how slow he moves and how the chemo has affected him.. Him and my grandma helped take care of me after my mom passed when I was 15 they had temp custody of me and took care of me for a while.

My grandpa and Dad hadn't talked in 5 plus years up until this past Fathers day....because of me. I was so happy for them and felt like I did something good.

My Dad has lost a lot of teeth from meth, has gotten married 3 times almost 4, I witnessed him hit my mom and 2 other women throughout my life...he was only stable in my life for 6 months when I was a baby and then again when I was like 5 for a year. and then for a couple years he won custody of me when I was like 8 and it only went on 2 years...after my mom got me back she eventually passed and he was in prison at that time so I went to my grandparents .. &amp; at that time before and after he got out he was constantly partying and in and out of prison, no where in my life. Since then I was emancipated at 16 and saw him once at 18 and then another time when I was 21. 

Just wanna add that my Dad always has these loving cool families bring them into his life, give him great jobs and truly love him. He is clean for a while and then he messes it up again. It's crazy how many families he has f&amp;^%$# over...


In 2016 we started talking on the phone and have been good, we laugh together and talk about things, he always gets really emotional about his dad, my grandpa. I always think to myself 'how can he break down like this to me when he was so absent in my life?' My granpa gave him the life, yes he was a military man and maybe tough but he provided everything and more. 


He told me ""This is the longest I've been clean in over 20 years..I'm over 3 years clean"" and he sounded so so good I was so happy. He even sent me a Christmas gift in 2018 , something he hadn't ever done before. He was calling me, face timing me and just really being cool..we were even planning trips to see eachother. He was engaged and is working his own mechanical shop that was given to him from the family he lives with, supposedly. Now that he recently in the last couple months he has stopped calling and stopped reciprocating us talking I've been feeling like sh%$ and had a feeling something was up but I wasnt too sure. . 

Back in late March I told my grandma how good dad was doing and I was so proud of him and he sounded like a new person, my grandma was so happy. She told me maybe he has changed, my grandpa refuses to talk to him because the last time he was there he was living with them and was doing good for a couple of years but fell into meth again and stole guns, valuables, keep sakes and just disappeared. He broke both their hearts for the hundredth time. My grandpa has refused to even open his letters and always puts 'return to sender' for over 5 years now....after I told my grandma this she said to have him call on Fathers Day so he did and they made up, my grandpa from that one conversation put him back in the inheritance. 

I called him a couple weeks ago and he wasn't the same, even admitted to me he got high again and his fiance left him and said he was high just a few days, but I don't believe that at all. He always disappears when he starts getting high like that. He even in June liked my birthday picture on my birthday but didn't call or text me, it really hurt because I thought we were doing better ..and I of course called him on his birthday and he didnt answer so I just texted him and he texted back right after in May and that's when I had a feeling too. It happened so fast and I shouldve listened to my intuition and told my grandparents earlier.

My advice I'm asking for is should I tell my grandparents that he isnt doing good and that he isn't really what I thought he was ? I am not sure if I should just let it go and let him get this large inheritance. But I know that they would'nt want him having it living the same selfish life he always has and waste all the money on that life style on drugs. My grandparents worked so so hard for everything they have. I feel responsible for him being back in their life, at least over the phone and he acts like I dont exist anymore. I don't believe he deserves to be a part of it, am I wrong ? Advice please.

I was going to go on Etsy and order them a water tumbler with straw with their favorite Disney Princess Silhouette on it and the bridesmaid’s name on it OR order them their favorite color Minnie ears because I would love a Disney themed bachelorette. Or should I buy both of those items? Or should I do something more simple I don’t want to overdo it but I also don’t want to under do it while being on a budget. Thank you in advance!,16Jul2019,1
101,"This might get buried by the time its too late but meh..

I started a new job and there was a girl which showed interest in me first. We've been flirting for a while and tomorrow im about to go and meet her outside of work environment (kinda like a date but we didnt specify it as such) and im shitting bricks terrified. Im the type of person that usually doesnt look for relationships, meetips, etc. and it backfired now. My insecurities and anxiety are eating me alive from the inside out and when im like that my brain just stops. Im afraid i wont be able to have a normal conversation because of that.

Any tips on how to be calm and have a good time instead of overthinking without saying anything of value the whole day tomorrow?

102,I’m 18 so is she we just graduated highschool. We had a few classes in freshman year and we talked a lot in math. We have messenger and Snapchat. We havnt talked much the last 3 years but we still say hi to each other we were close at graduation and talked for a few. I didnt know it at the time but i had a feeling that she liked me. Back in February i looked back at our fb messenger and she was hardcore flirting with me i was too stoopid to realize it. ( i was about to go on first date with a girl ever and I wanted to see how I messed up before so I don’t do again)  I wasn’t ready at the time anyways my parents just got divorced at that time i was scared of relationships now I’m not. We both going to same community college and we both know that and I want to start talking to her and possibly date. Is it bad or weird or something that i feel that way and want to re-connect and if not how do i do so. Btw I’m single and she is too.,16Jul2019,1
104,"ahout a week ago, i met this really hot guy. I play volleyball and this guy was my ref. he’s around my age and the entire time him and i were laughing about stuff happening on the court and just making a few comments (it’s an older people volleyball league i do with my parents. but i also play for my school) I had seen him a few times before last year or so and i had played on his court but it was completely different this time. Also, we had gone to different high schools but only about 15 minutes away from each other. so i’d seen him then too but again, never talked. anyway, in the previous times i’d played on his court, he pretty much ignored me. not saying muxh. i’m F18 and hes M20. i could feel him starring at me often times even my mom picked up on it. after the game we talked for a few minutes (he came near to me, obviously wanting to talk but he seemed like maybe he was too shy to initiate, so i started our conversation) with almost my entire family near by. he turned his back for a minute to go pick up a ball and i slipped out without saying anything more. (i wasn’t being rude i just got distracted and our conversation was pretty much over anyway) i guess my question is, when i see him next week what do i do? let him come to me? ask him for his number or just lay low? If anyone has some good signals i should look out for when deciding if he’s interested or not, and/or advice for the next time i see him that’d be super appreciated!!

105,"I (21M) have no idea what I’m doing with my life anymore. I don’t know what I feel, what I want to do and what to do. I’m working at a Cabelas rn just to have money to pay off my car I decided to buy (prolly wasn’t the best idea) and I’m living at home with my parents. I’m not against the at home thing but I’m not in school anymore and idk what to go back for.. I stopped going for some serious mental health issues but I got on anti depressants which helps a lot but it hasn’t helped give my life a direction. I’ve researched and researched and debated and everything else but every line of study, work (trades included) feels “meh” to me.. I’m incredibly indifferent to EVERYTHING. The only thing I don’t feel indifferent about is the girl I’m in love with who won’t dump her toxic/manipulative boyfriend. 

I was always decent with my hands and numbers but to be honest I was always mediocre at everything? I think? I wasn’t a master welder or woodworker and I wasn’t a math wiz but I was just decent.. which really gave me no direction. I know I want to live a comfortable life and be able to support myself and a family (a wife and too many dogs😁). I’d love to own my own house, a nice car, able to have hobbies and all the things! But I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO! My parents don’t push me but I know they want me to have a great life which is why they are so understanding. I have amazing parents and I’m so appreciative of their support for me but I feel like I’m letting them down every day I’m not thinking of school or a better job. They allow me to live at home and sit on my ass and do nothing on my days off but if they need something from me I’m on it in an instant. I love to help around the house since they do so much for me. 

I feel like this may have been a little ranty but I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just want to make my parents proud, live a happy and comfortable life with a job I won’t hate and I don’t know.. live a life.. if that makes sense.",16Jul2019,1
106,"Hi so i need help, i’ve been talking to this boy for a very long time like 6 months and we haven’t gone on a date yet because i keep making up excuses because i’m nervous and always get anxious beforehand. We live in the same town so  there’s not really any valid excuses i can give but i just feel like i won’t know how to talk to him in person and not be weird or awkward. 

Another problem is i think he might like me more than i like him as he seems too agreeable. What i mean by that is i’ll give my opinion on a subject and he will have a different opinion as me and i’ll be like omg why (jokingly as i tend to like a debate or to hear other viewpoints) and he will automatically change his opinion to suite mine. Maybe i’m just making excuses to not meet up with him because i’m nervous but idk . He is really lovely and made me a very nice playlist (am i getting sidetracked? maybe) but i’m still so anxious to go out with him.

Well, I posted a couple hours ago on r/findareddit, asking for a sub where I could find some gory videos. I ""like"" to watch those videos, like I'm really curious to watch people getting hurt on a hardcore level, maybe even dying. However, after I watch like 8 of them, it's like my brain is suddenly aware of what I'm watching, so I unconsciously close the website. Plus, I hate horror movies, and I find it weird that, sometimes watching horror movie trailers keeps me awake at night, but watching a video of someone dying in real life seems a lot less scary to me. Weirdly, I love a book series called Fear Street, which are books about murderers and that kinda stuff.

109,"One of my best friends has made three attempts on her like in the past two months. The first time I had spent the previous 4 hours talking to her about her problems and trying to find out what was wrong, I thought i left her in a good state and I was wrong. She proceeded to take vast amounts of painkillers to try and take her own life. From that point she had stopped drinking and our friend group thought we had started to get through to her. We were wrong as it turns out as two weeks ago she tried to take her life in the same way yet again this time on a bigger scale. This time I had tried to not be a part of it, not because I didn't want to be but because I was not very close with the group of friends at the time as I had just broken up with my long term gf who was also a part of the group. It seemed to look like she was finally trying to get help with her mental health as she had a doctors appointment lined up to get blood tests and organise counselling . 

This leads on to last night, I was at the hospital with two other friends for an unrelated reason, one of them started to suddenly faint so we called her and asked what to do and she was helpful and her normal self with us over the phone. long story short we had to call an ambulance and spent the night at the hospital. during this time I was on the phone with her for an hour or so just talking and she brought up that she was getting nervous for the blood test that she had the following morning. I sat and talked with her on the phone went through her doubts and offered to go with her to which she accepted. I then had to put the phone down as we were finally getting seen by a doctor. It was after that she got strange, told me she had done something and wouldn't tell me what. I am aware that she is a self harmer and questioned her on it, she said that was what she had done and she started to sound dopy on the phone. Ive helped her before after she has done it with cleaning her up and making sure she gets back to bed and walked her though what she had to do, she told me she was going to sleep and after I had made sure she was ok let her go off the phone, it was about 6am at that point and we had all been up through the night dealing with the other situation.

Fast forward an hour and i get a message saying she doesn't want to die alone. I couldn't get a hold of her, no-one could and we were too far away to go and check on her so we sent someone who lived close by to go and see if she was ok. She had done it again and is now refusing to get help from the doctors and wont talk to anyone, she got back from hospital today and has locked herself in her room and wont talk to anyone with her phone off and we are all scared it may happen again. 

We are at a point where we don't know what to do, we don't want to force her to get help that she doesn't want but we also don't want to loose another friend to mental illness. We are stuck at a point where we risk our friendship trying to help her which some of us are willing to do if it means saving her. 

None of us know what to do and im asking here as a last ditch effort what do I do? How can I help? are there maybe things we haven't thought off? is this just a loosing battle? She needs help and we don't know how to give it to her. please someone I just don't know what to do.",16Jul2019,1
110,"Hey guys, I’m in a really rough spot right now and just figured I’d need some advice.

Warning, this post will be all over the place seeing as though my mind isn’t in the right place.

Where do I start? Well, I’m a 22 soon to be 23 year old college dropout that’s drowning in credit card debt and banking from being an idiot in 2017. I went to university in 2014 and bullshitted all the way until spring 2017 and only managed to gather 54 credits. What’s more fucked up is that I had a girlfriend who was willing to help me out in any way shape or form , I had a nice apartment near campus, nice credit, I still had the option to achieve and go far, so many tutors, so much everything and I still decided to give up on it all in and drop out. Broke her heart, flunked out, started smoking an unhealthy amount of weed daily, what an idiot right? 

But that’s not even the worst part. After doing  all of these stupid things, i went back home to the city  and still continued to fuck up more by getting more credit cards and fucking then over, dropping out of community college, and smoking more unnecessary amounts of weed, and just overall doing nothing productive.. I continued doing all of this until the beginning of 2018, where I ended up sick from not taking care of my body, started getting paranoid from smoking weed, and ended up broke from not being able to keep a stable job. It wasn’t until recently where I started to fully acknowledge the hole I dogged myself into and a fire lit up under my ass to get out of it. And honestly, i just want to get out of it because there’s no point in complaining. Granted I don’t give myself too much shit for all of things I have done, because I didn’t have the best upbringing so for me to even be here or even have the mindset of wanting to get better is somewhat good and I think it’s achievable I just need some guidance or advice.

Now as a result of all my shenanigans, I am currently in default in student loans which means I can’t go back to school until I handle that, I can’t even open a bank account, overall loan debt and banking debt is $45,000... ($39000 from college , $6000 from credit cards), very unstable mind from consuming grams of weed for 3 years straight, and pretty much just lost. And to top all my shitty mistakes in the past, I would like to add that I am not a great socializer (I may have a very very light case of Aspergers or something idk), I’m not great with chicks, just sorta attractive enough for them to ignore my social ineptness, and I am still recovering from a lost of trauma in my past, so that may set me back.


So what am I asking... well I want to know what are the first steps I should take to get out of this hole? I want to be successful, I want to get my degree, I want to make money, I want to be better socializer. How can I achieve this?",16Jul2019,1
111,"Hello people of reddit! 

(Sorry for the long story here but I've been thinking about this for a while now.)

I have quite the tech problem on my hands here. I have been working really hard to get a good amount of money for me to blow on a new computer that I've been wanting for a while now... like 4 years now (and have found a lot of games that my current pc can't run). But then the question came up after talking to my cousin, should I build or prebuild? Now me, who doesn't not jack shit about PCs, shouldn't build one myself and I don't have friends to guide me through the process and my cousin lives too far to help.

So then I got to thinking, should I just get a playstation? I know it's blasphemy to become a console peasant but it's easier and I'll know when a new one comes out I should just buy it and there's no brand questions or part replacement or anything. Now also thinking is how playstation has the VR headset (which I really love VR) that I know that when I buy it it's gonna work no question about it. Basically: simple everything.

Then the argument for (build) PC side is I have a lot of games already that I know I just need a new PC to run them with more then 15 fps. With this in mind I also like keyboard and mouse better than controller for fps games. Also if I get better at PC hardware then in the future I would just need to buy 1 or 2 bits to get my computer back up to top of the line if I build it right instead of buying a whole new system.

Now here's the question, should I buy a PC or a console? If I get a PC should I build or prebuild?",16Jul2019,1
112,"I am about to move into my first apartment next month but I do not have a car, mostly because I cannot afford insurance.

Im an 18y old f.

114,"I'm (19M) a pending asylee from Venezuela in the US with my family (since 2016). They applied for it and added my siblings and me on it. If I leave the country my process will be denied (which I don't really care) but I'm affraid their process in queue could be harmed because of me leaving the country forever. They've worked a lot on our documents since then. 
I've finished high school but I couldn't start college because I don't have the money or the citizenship to apply for financial aid (which doesn't stop me from studying from internet). So I'm just spending my days at home without even working because I've also lost my EAD. My dad is the only one that has a job in our family of 5 members, and my mom stays at home cooking and taking care of my siblings.

My dad works as a school bus driver but since schools are on vacations, he isn't working nor getting paid. So now he's working on uber and my mom is taking care of an elderly woman for this week to cover some of the bills of this month. In the meantime, I'm ""babysitting"" my little brother and sister while they work.

I'm willing to move to Argentina because my aunt, who lives there, it's totally okay with me living with her and is also able to help me with the flight ticket (I'll obviously pay it when I gather the money). 
College is free in Argentina, she already found me a job, and also citizenship is easy to earn.
I've also met a girl from there, which I'm in total love with, and we've been talking since almost 3 years ago (she's real btw). So I've got everything basically planned.

Everything looks fine from this perspective but as time passed by, my dad has been controlling me. I've discussed with him about my plans about leaving and living my own life as a mature-teenager-road-to-adult age but it doesn't look right to him. For him, I'm ""selfish"" for only thinking about myself. He wants me to stay with them, taking care of my siblings when they're working, and spending more time with them as a ""family"" (even though we are having a hard time on the economical side). 
He also has become really harsh towards me, everytime we come across a topic about dysfunctional families he points at me as the bad example for wanting to leave them. My mom also supports him saying that whenever our process is finally granted everything will change, but I'm affraid this will last more years and I wont be able to live my own life at that point. 

Recently I bought a 27 inch pennyboard and I told them I'd go to the park by myself and try it. They both got mad because I didn't asked for permission and told me I'm still a kid for them. That I must, under every circumstances, ask them for everything I want to do. I can't even go out with my friends because they're affraid some immigration agents could deport me, even though I'm not ilegally staying in the US.

Currently they're saving money to renew our EAD because they're about to expire, and if they renew mine I won't be able to leave because they would've spent that money for nothing (about $450 each)

I feel like I'm just a waste of space/money, and they only make me feel like it's the true. But on the inside, they don't want me leave them.

This may sound childish or even emo, but the fact that I'll have to spend my life here makes me really suicidal.

At this point I'm fearing about my future, that I will never be able to have my own family, my own house, my own life in general; I'm living theirs (and portrayed as selfish).

If you're an attorney or lawyer, please guide me. 
Can I cancel my asylum pending case without ""harming"" theirs? If so, how?


If you're a family therapist or psychologist, please help me.
How can I make them open their eyes and show them that I want to live my own life. Am I selfish for thinking like that?

121,"Reddit may not be the best place to go for this but I’m angry right now and need advice from a nonprofessional standpoint.

TL;DR: I'm 14, my only parent (mom) is depressed and doesn't hold conversations with me. My therapist told me I should lower my standards for her but is it wrong to tell her I want her to talk to me?

Basically my mom is depressed and struggles with mental illness as do I. Of course we deal with things differently. I'm seeing a therapist and she was, but stopped going. But the situation is that I feel like she never wants to talk to me or help me. My therapist said that I need to lower my standards for her because she isn't in the right mind to hold a conversation with me and it's not that she wants to not talk to me but maybe she can't. Like when I try to make an attempt to talk to her, she only responds with ""Ok"", ""I don't know"" (most commonly), or ""Hm"". It's really frustrating mind you I'm only 14, she is my only parent, and I just want to talk to her. I also don't really have many friends or anyone to talk to at all really (besides my therapist), they're more just friends I hang out with occasionally. 

Sometimes (like just now) I get extremely angry and self-destructive when she doesn't respond to the things I'm saying and I just yell. It's not something I want to do but it happens before i have time to think about it. Most of the time it comes of rude and bitter, obviously. Today was a rough day and my therapist told me to avoid if, should, would, and coulds, in sentences because they're bitter and I'm not going to get anything out of except for anger. But I'm still angry. And I don't know how to release it. It's something I'm working on but I just saw my therapist today and she gave me that.

I understand that she probably isn't in a good spot in life right now but I don't know, I just feel kind of upset all the time and she's my mom, you know. 

Should I lower my standards? Or should I let her know I want to talk to her more? Or both?",16Jul2019,2

So I am engaged to the guy I’ve been with for more than 4 years and sometimes I worry that I’m making a mistake. We are both in our young 20s and I love him so much. But we do have issues and I don’t really know if they are red flags or not. An example of a recent red flag: I want to get a tattoo as a remembrance of my brother who passed away a few years ago but my future husband is completely against me getting a tattoo. He pretty much said he can’t and won’t stop me but that he really doesn’t want me to get one because he likes my body the way it is. He doesn’t have an issue with tattoos in general so I don’t really know what his problem is. We’ve fought about it on multiple occasions and each time the want for the tattoo goes away because I’m just sick of the fighting. But eventually I start wanting one again and another argument follows. That’s just one example on an issue we have. There are other issues too, but that’s one that always gets to me. He also hates the majority of my family and we are always fighting about that. I really love this man but sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be with someone else. He is a great guy but the few issues that we have can sometimes seem monumental. What I really want to know is if anyone has advice on the tattoo or family issue?

123,"I (20f) had a bout with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and BPD when I was in high school. I have since recoverd for the most part but I have a lot of scars. I can't hide them unless I wear long sleeves all the time.

With my partner while we provide for our self's. Yes I know we still seem young but this is what I want. I made videos venting why I feel this way and how Id achieve it. Like locations, laws, land prices, etc. Its always been a goal of mine. I know many will disagree but the way I see society is different to others. I often refer to it as the rat race to death. I have one life. The way it is going has made me go see a therapist because I'm just not sure how much I can handle it. Me and my partner have around 3.5k saved. Trying to get more. I really want my parents to acknowledge how serious I am about this. 

I know it sounds really far fetched but I know deep down I'd be happier. I want to go back to our routes that got us here and re learn the most important things. I don't like the way my generation is going and how de sensatized everyone in my generation is and how dependent they are the littlest of things. My goal is to move to Norway with my partner and start this adventure. It just really hurts how much my parents aren't on board with this. I finished uni for them. I worked for them and to provide for my partner. Now that I want to do something for me, they just won't take me serious due to my age. I don't see why people should get looked down on for it. I know others in the off grid community. If it can work for them then surely it can work for me? I just don't know how to continue this way. I've told them and my doctor confidently I don't know how much longer I can keep leading my life this way. It's just miserable. Ever since we moved out and I've had my own place. Even though we were well off, it's just not something we want. Are we crazy? Does our age really matter? How do I convince them to let me go on my own path that isn't popular among the current world. If I can't figure this out then I really can't tell how much longer I can do it for

126,"My mom is 5'0"" and 200lbs. She is on a CPAP, takes blood pressure meds, and is depressed. She has a shit marriage and a shit job. She doesn't want to lose weight because she sees herself as healthy. She says she doesn't feel sick. She tried going to a weight loss doctor last year (at my father's behest) and successfully lost 20lbs while she followed those instructions. But she refuses to continue those instructions because they are too hard. She now drinks protein shakes and bars as part of her weight loss plan because they are only 200 calories each, but she eats them in addition to her normal meals, not as meal replacements. She doesn't work out or exercise at all.  

How do I convince her to listen to reason when it comes to her health? 

When I ask her to go to the gym with me, she just shuts me out and stops talking to me for a few days. She won't go on walks with me. She loves to eat out at restaurants and won't stop, even when I make dinner at home. She openly resents me because I'm back to my pre-pregnancy weight 4 months after having my first baby. She always said that she got fat because she never lost the baby weight (essentially blaming me, her only child). I want to help her but she won't help herself.

128,"When I first heard about the Bianca/escty case, it instantly triggered my paranoia (let's just say I have very bad paranoia). Hearing about how Brandon, an incel orbiter or whatever you call them, how he was able to track Bianca down and murder her frightens me.

For a while I've always wanted to post just normal pictures of myself on social media or make YouTube videos, but when I see cases like this of someone tracking you down and stalking you (and in some cases,then be murdered), it makes me fearful of being social media. I love social media and I would love to post myself more often or even stream someday but I can't when hear things like this.

Like for instance, one woman on Twitter talk about how some guy from the dark web tracked her and her family down and threatened to harm her, how do I avoid things like this?

I'm sorry that this was such a long post, I jus wanted explain the reason why I'm asking advice for this. I'm just gonna go ahead and ask a few questions:


How do you avoid cyber stalking?

How do you avoid being doxxed?

How do you avoid/ deal with people like this?
(Especially the one regarding the dark web stalker)

If you were trying to be an influencer or be popular on some social media sites and you had to deal with a stalker like this, how would you deal with it?

I know it's dumb asking questions like this, but I'm just a very cautious person and I just don't wanna ever be in a situation like these.

Short version of it, I saw a guy staring out the window at children playing. He was in his under garments, and was touching his crotch. I quickly told the children's parents, and called the cops on the guy with my sister.

Just hours after my encounter and writing down it in my post, my brother in law told me that thinks he recognized the guy. 

Apparently, the dude was some Romanian immigrant that goes to my church. According to my brother in law, he is the father of a little boy. I dread that he was just simply a father watching his son playing, had a terrible itch on his groin, and I just reported an innocent man. Right now, I am trapped in a whirlwind of self doubt and uncertainty. Still, I just got a terrible vibe from that guy, and whole situation just felt shady to me.

I was a dentist in Moscow and when I moved to the states I began preparing for the exams to eventually get accepted to a Dental school. I could visit my parents once a year for maximum 2 weeks (because of work) My parents visited us once. I am still homesick and I cry sometimes because I miss my parents, my friend, my city. I can't really share it with my parents because I don't want them to be sad. I know they miss me horribly (I am the only child), but I always want to stay positive for them.

135,"This is a tad bit long and im sorry but im at the end ..

And it scares me

Well i guess ill start with the fact that I have a disease(genetic) and thats what started all of this. A few years back (4 to be exact) i was finally diagnosed , with the ""family curse"". Because of this i have to take meds and a booster needle of sorts. It slows down the breakdown of my soft tissues and muscles. Over a year ago i found out i was pregnant (3% chance of natural conseption).but i was told the medication would severely impact the baby.I spent a week sitting in a depression weighing the worth of my own body against MY miracle. And i decided to stop my meds and make sure she would be healthy ( my disorder at that point was tame and was not effecting my baby). I got a good portion through the pregnancy (7 1/2 months)  before i noticed anything was wrong. First my jaw was always sore,then my gums would break from toast and such..then soup startwd to irratate me to eat. For three days i ate as healthy as i could and took tylonal for the pain. A few days went by and i just had normal discomfort....that was till i ate a grilled cheese.. 1 tooth fell out and 2 others snapped at the root... The meds no longer keeping it in check it had broke down my already fragile teeth (smoker of 8 years up untill the pregnancy) (yes i know gross and unheathy but it was how i coped with my traumas)... My teeth for the lat bit of my pregnancy were dying at the roots and trust me 3 doctors and 2 dentists said they couldnt do anything untill after...well fast forward to a month after i had her. I went in to see if anything could be done at all....... And my olny option was to pull them and get dentures AT 25! The damage was over 80% of my top jaw and 30% of the bottom. I choose to do it after a doble jaw infection nearly ending me( with a two month old at that time). I still have horrid night mares of the day i got them pulled. The sounds , smells and feelings all embedded in my brain (p.t.s.d. from it is unexplainable). Im now 1 appointment away from getting my false teeth..but everything has now caught up to me. I can normally keep my emotions well in check but now i feel frayed. After having my body 60% change from having my daughter (which i wouldn't change) and now at 25 going on 26 shortly with no teeth...i dont even know how to begin to feel pretty. And yes i have a man who tells me everyday how beautiful i am no matter what. And teeth or not he just wants me healthy and happy.. But of corse that doesnt change how i see myself. I love him for the support i really do but when i look in the mirror its like a sunken faced stranger is looking back.im no longer me ... And i cant fucking stand it.. I've tried everything...therapy..meditation. Working out...just to feel human again..nothings working. How? I need help!?!",16Jul2019,4
136,"(This is going to be a very long post) 

Me and my sibling were abused until some other adults and ACS interfered. Apparently the problem was “fixed” we were both told and our parents said everything was brought up that they done so that the family can continue moving forward and live together. We went to counselors and therapists and ACS was dismissed two times (the third one I’m unsure what’s happening) because they were confident with the right resources our family will be able to work things out. 

My senior year of high school a relationship counselor cane to one of our classes and what she had talking about triggered memories for me. I already knew my mom and dad had touched me by grabbing my head and forcing to hug me and even my mom pinning me down because my mom was annoyed that I wouldn’t be affectionate towards her and they would call it “conditioning.” What I didn’t remember until late senior year is that my mom had touched my butt a lot as a kid, and not just a few times as a joke. There’s also vague memories I have of her sticking her fingers down my pants but I don’t know how much of those are real. Then I remembered and event from when I was six where she held me down in my bed because I wouldn’t hug her and I had to lie to her and told her that I wouldn’t hug people because of a girl at school who didn’t know personal space (I told her the truth first and even punched her and kicked her, but she said that I was lying so I decided to tell her what she wanted to hear). She held me down on more than one event, it’s just that when I was six I lied to her why I was bothered by it. She would also pin me down and lie on top of me until I stopped trying to get her off of me because “she used to be able to do this to me before and now for some reason I had a problem with it” (she did do that to me before, but when I was six I told her to stop and she still didn’t).My mom for years would also grab my butt and say stuff like “I should be able to do this because I’m your mother,” even though she was fully aware I hated it and had problems with people touching me. She would also tickle me but by grabbing my ribs and armpits while holding me in a hug. Each time I shifted her grip on whatever she had her hands on would get tighter and she would bring up the same excuse.

I had suspected before something else as well but wasnt sure how to tell an adult (I already had weird communication skills and I could go through a conversation I was supposed to have with crucial things being unsaid at any time). I had memories of my mom getting a bit too upset that me and my sister were growing up and that I had gotten taller. Other parents get upset like this so I didn’t think anything of this. She would also, though, deliberately not let us eat when we were hungry and all food had to be from her permission (this apparently wasn’t normal in friends houses and apparently the first some of them heard of when I explained why I didn’t eat like they did when visiting. We weren’t overweight either or on any special diet, and I at least was skinny for my age but not exactly underweight as far as I remember). She also didn’t want us getting bigger she said, and would only buy clothes that were too small for us, especially for me the oldest. I had so many cuts and cut off circulation from my clothes, especially bras and pants, that didn’t fit right. Some shirts I had I could barely breathe in and had a hard time getting them on and off of me. My my mom would get angry when I asked for bigger sizes and would try and be persuasive and say I shouldn’t waste money on clothes and that’s why I can’t buy my own clothes, because I’ll get the wrong size and there would be no point in my purchase. I told my sister this too and she remembered and told me her personal stories with this.

I went to my sister when I first remembered these things and my sister remembered things in detail and told me she was too afraid to tell an adult. Months later when I was in college, she asked if I could do anything once I was a legal adult to handle this in a legal situation because she didn’t trust our mother and wanted them both arrested (as she had also admitted to me in high school) and I told her I didn’t know what to do about it and we’ll see what happens. At this point I had already told my grandparents who had said this was no big deal, said my parents weren’t perverts, and then proceeded to give me and my sister a lot of things (my guess is to make up for stuff, and my parents started giving us a lot of things as well after I brought this up to my grandparents and it just made me feel guilty). I really didn’t know how to perceive this and figured things could be worse, so I decided to listen to my grandparents and parents on past events and new memories of this stuff and let it go. 

I had let it go until I saw old family photos. Some of them were taken with me and my sister crying, some of them were taken with my mother touching me and my sisters chests, and one of them my dad was touching my crotch while I was on his lap (the last one I think it can be argued that he was holding me up so I don’t fall, but I looked maybe eight in that picture and no one even got rid of that part to just show our faces or anything). I showed the photos to two friends and they thought it was weird. I showed them to the guidance counselor at my school and explained to her everything above, and asked her is this sexual assault or part of the abuse or what basically, and she called ACS (which is the third time they’ve come to the house). I’m not sure what these things count as and how bad it is. I’ve told my mom why they came to our house a third time and explained to her why the guidance counselor thought things were bad and my mother gave an argument with many holes in it that said variations of these things basically “all of this is common. The friends I know grab their kids butts. Parents pin their children down all the time. Well it was common when I was your age (which I read not. I check with her siblings and she lies about her and her siblings being physically abused, at least from what I’m told by my grandparents and both of my mothers siblings).” And finally she argues “I did this to be controlling. I have God now don’t you think this will get better? (Which I then tell her it will if you make an effort, regardless of what you believe if you don’t do your part how is anything going to get better)”. I can’t bring it up to my grandparents because my grandmother says that my situation is fairly common and my mother has changed but I’m not sure if she has. My grandfather said that our situation is very bad, but I don’t know if he’s afraid to say more or if these are pity words. These are only the things I remember as well and I’m not sure if there are any more. My sibling claims she’s seen other things with me involved but I don’t recall those events, so I’m not including them in this post. I communicated with a reliable relative after third ACS visit and he said this was screwed up and keeps asking if my mom is getting better but I don’t know if she is. 

Instead of physical abuse and mental abuse now, she eventually resorted to just manipulation (while apparently throwing and breaking objects in between). She’s had me and my sister take medicine we weren’t supposed to. For me this had me feel burning and much confusion, go to the bathroom less than I should and throw up a lot, including throwing up some blood on on the occasion during this time period. In the past she didn’t want to take me to the doctor for things I was supposed to go for and complain when she took me on some times I was supposed to go, and would go out of her way to lie to the doctor about how I handle things, my symptoms, and family medical history. And these things in this paragraph were before the third ACS visit. Her words aren’t going to get to me any more but I’m worried that something will happen but I don’t know what. She’s now back to favoring my sister (probably because she’s a minor and she doesn’t want my sister saying she wants to move out any more) and she seems to want to use my mental disorders so I can get a disability check and possibly so that she can get some of the money too (shes always said if I come across money she wants some of it, and I wouldn’t be surprised if she asked for some money but I don’t want a disability check and am determined to get through what I have to and not apply for one). She’s seem to take advantage of the weird communication skills I’ve had and still have and make it about herself and how she’s felt like I did (although by her description it doesn’t seem like she’s matched how disorders made me suffer like she says we match), and use it to win in arguments as well. If she’s changed, she at least finds a way to get her feelings across differently using other actions instead of blatant physical abuse. As far as the inappropriateness on my dads behalf there were weird comments but nothing I’m too concerned about compared to my mothers actions. 

Overall, I’ve run into problems where others would do inappropriate things towards me or say them and I didn’t think it was a big deal, but I think what my mother did deserves at least some consideration as to why and if she’s fully changed. I feel I can’t talk about this with my parents or grandparents but I don’t think bringing up the fact that I think my mother made the worst mistakes out of inappropriate encounters  would help in conversations with these select adults. There’s much more to this story but this is getting long. I just don’t know how to perceive this. Any perspective will help.",16Jul2019,1

They don’t have a custody agreement yet so every couple of days my dad will come pick us (siblings) up, have lunch then take us back. Recently my mom has been going downstairs into the garage and staying there for hours on end talking to somebody. Last night she was down there till 6pm to 12am and then told us she was talking to her lawyer despite it being Sunday. I was a little annoyed since we have to ask her permission to go get food and there was nothing in the house. I didn’t interrupt her cause interrupting my mom on the phone results in a fight for being disrespectful.

Well today she had us talk to him over the phone and he said “tell your mom she’s a lunatic. She told me she was going to dump me cause I’m too hot.” I handed the phone back to her and awkwardly laughed as she left my room.

Plus she’s very secretive of her phone now and giggles every time she gets a text. She’s starting to become annoyed whenever I ask her who she’s texting (I’m just trying to make conversation and not be snoopy).

So I'm a young adult (under 18 and not old enough to drive/work) and I have some things I really want to buy. For now I want a monitor and a keyboard, and then eventually I want to build my own computer (the prices are pretty cheap rn for computer building). 

So I ask my parents, and my parents understand that I need a monitor so I can convert my laptop into a desktop for when I'm not at school. I value aesthetics a lot and I really want a nice looking monitor/keyboard but obviously they cost a lot/I have to sacrifice features which I'm fine with because I don't want to game or anything. However, I used to play lots of games on mobile, and a single pc game with old integrated graphics, neither of which I do anymore, but my parents sorta still think I play games (even though I'm just browsing reddit or finding a good deal on a monitor/keyboard). 

he type of aesthetic I want involves a bunch of white/silver + RGB (if you're not into computers, its basically when there's red, green, and blue backlighting and lighting in general), and every time there's RGB, its a ""gamer"" thing, and all product titles say: ""Gaming keyboard"" when I really don't want to use it to game, but I like it for the aesthetic. I think I've sort of convinced them, but every now and then they say its for gaming or something. 

I'm okay for the monitor, as its not too hard to find a silver monitor for a good, cheap price, but the keyboard is the hard thing. If you go on amazon and type: White RGB keyboard, you get a bunch of results that are some knockoff China brand selling keyboards for $50, and obviously I want something reliable so I'm not gonna buy those. That leaves me with less than 5 options, all of which cost close to $100, which my parents don't consider reasonable for a keyboard when you could just buy one of those ""garbage"" keyboards for $5. (Again, the reason why the prices are so high is because I want a WHITE rgb keyboard)

&amp;#x200B;

Those keyboards are all from razer or corsair (both of which are gamer brands, but again I just want the aesthetic), but they start from $90 (and that one only has a white backlight and no RGB, and then it just gets higher from there). So yeah idk what to do.",16Jul2019,1

152,"I liked this girl I was friends with a lot, eventually I told her and she said she didn’t want a relationship. She wouldn’t tell me she didn’t like me. A couple days pass, she’s asked me to hang out several times since the rejection. She’s always texting me. I eventually tell her “I need some time to like, get over you”

She freaks out and asks if we’re still allowed to hang at work and text and hug, etc. Eventually I tell her “I just don’t wanna hang out in person, everything else is fine... but are you sure you don’t like me, you really seem to.” She won’t tell me she doesn’t like me. Straight up I ask her “Do you like me that way? Yes or no.” And she won’t say no or yes. She flips out once I pressure her to just give me some closure, so I end it. We’re not speaking right now, and I’ve un friended her on social media. 

Frankly after she confused me that hard and that much I don’t know if I’d want to be with her anymore.

That being said, she was really set on being friends but once the possibility of a relationship was gone, I stopped wanting to be her friend.

So with that said I ask, if I like someone enough to be with them, why wouldn’t I want to be their friend? I’m tired of feeling unfulfilled in my relationships, I know if I stay her friend that’s exactly how I’ll feel so I decided to cut it off big time. I feel mean and terrible and like I should remain her friend, but I really don’t want to. Somebody explain myself to me because I can’t figure it out. Also, could someone also explain her behavior to me? She hugged me, called me “intriguing,” hung out with me every day, got sad when I had to leave, texted me constantly, FaceTimed me constantly, fell asleep on FaceTime with me at 3AM after we talked all night. Is that seriously the behavior of someone who doesn’t like me? I’m so confused. Help.",16Jul2019,1

He’s constantly asking me to give him head and I say no everytime because I’m scared and don’t think I’m ready. He gets mad when I say no. One of the reason I’m scared is because one time I was giving head and this dude kept pushing my head down and I threw up all over him and I don’t want that to happen again it’s embarrassing when you suck at those sorta things and then ur boyfriend gets mad at you. Am I wrong for getting upset when he’s constantly asking for me to suck him and I say no.

159,"I've been battling depression since the last 3 years. To cope, I started writing a journal mainly to vent about my dark thoughts and problems. Yesterday, I found my dad in my room with a disappointed look on his face, reading my journal. I tried to stop him from going further, which resulted in him snatching it from my hands and reading everything aloud. My dad has been aware of my depression, as I do confide in him, and I have also sought help from friends and family members. Besides, my emotional state has improved a lot over the past 6 months, and I'm a much more stable person now. But I do battle with the occasional bout of depression. The problem is that he wasn't really aware of the extent and depth of my problems and he's in utter shock over everything he's read. He feels scared (that I might harm myself), disappointed, upset, and heartbroken. I also feel that he's acting in distant manner. What should I do to win his trust and show him that I'm fine? How do I mend our relationship? How do I show him that I'm not that disturbed person anymore? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

163,"My (19F) father recently lost his job suddenly. we were making more money than we have in years. My mother was getting excellent insurance through his job. 

My mother is diabetic and needs her insulin. A few months ago, she was told she is losing vision in both eyes, and there is no way to reverse it. But to slow down the process of her deteriorating sight, she must get injections in her eyes for 6 months to prepare her for  laser eye surgery. With his insurance, the injections were of no cost to my mother or father. She can not stop the treatment abruptly or it will make things worse. Kinda like just stop taking antibiotics bc you think you're better. 

Now, without the insurance and under my mother's not as good insurance, my mother will have to pay at least $1000 for each injection plus fees and at least $200 for her insulin for which she has 3 different kinds not including the needles. She also won't be able to afford her glucometer equipment. 

That's only a very small peice of the stress I'm dealing with in my life. But that's the most challenging and stressful to deal with. Not only do I suffer from chronic depression, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety, so does my 12 year old sister! I'm so hopeless. I've been working 40 hours a week at Walmart and my job is sooo mentally draining. I'm considering even becoming a cam girl or something that I can do on my own time on the side to make a little more money. I start community college next month after a gap year and idk if I can handle it. Everything in my life is overwhelming me. 

I have no close friends. My boyfriend lives in Michigan and he's homeless and sleeping in his car.... I don't want to bother him with my at home situations when he doesn't even have a place to lay his head at night. He is my closest friend and I trust him with my life. He's come to see me so many times just to spend the weekend with me and I live all the way in Pennsylvania (10 hours away). I want to move with him in my city but I'm worried about my family. I won't be able to afford to live on my own and help pay for my mother's medications. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? I know there may not be much to say but I need encouraging words... Please. Also, I don't have the best insurance and the wait for a therapist or doctor in my very small city is 6 months at the least and I've tried just about every doctor here and none of them helped.",16Jul2019,2
164,"I (20M) have been broken up from my ex for close to two years now, and I just cannot seem to get over her. I have been dealing with depression which has driven me to points of very real suicide thoughts. I was dealing with it in the relationship as well however it was never to the extent of how it was after the break up. Our relationship lasted just shy of 2 years and it was a very ugly end to say the least (I'm sure it's necessary to say we did have a few clashing moments from both ends throughout the relationship, but I did betray her trust in the end ultimately leading to the end)

&amp;#x200B;

I have been through too many transitional periods since the break up, relying on alcohol as a start and after that stopped I had started smoking marijuana basically everyday as an unhealthy habit to forget about it all. I had also forced myself to believe I was never really in the wrong, so all of these factors eventually came crashing down on me when I came to the conclusion that they're all unhealthy and toxic traits to have. I can't just say all transitional periods were bad, but if they were good and had good intentions I would somehow end up back doing bad things.

&amp;#x200B;

Been 2 months since I cleaned my act, finally re-looked over the whole relationship and finally accepted it for what it was and really accepted the fact that I was in the wrong, hurt and betrayed her. Ive stopped smoking and doing all the wrong things that have been hurting my mental health, got a new job, starting a new sport (MMA) and connected with all my closest friends and family again at the level it was at before everything went down hill (I was very closed throughout when everybody knows me for being open).

166,"Im 22f and my bf is 29. We have been together for two years.

I dont have many close friends and have very little of my own social life. Most people i socialize with are at school and school events, or clients turned friends from our work (we work together at our 4 person business).    In the time we have been together i have gone out by myself with friends only a handful of times.   And with opposite sex friends only a couple of times. 
Those times he has been visibly jealous, not passive agressive or anything but indeed uncomfortable. I also fucked up (idk? I dont feel i did anything wrong but i could have handled it better) By inviting a male friend to stay over at my house for a couple of months, because he had been kicked out by his mother.  He was pretty bothered by that, and my friend even visited our business once and my bf exited the building.  All turned ok with my friend and he got on his feet, went back to his city and is doing better.
Since then i have not gone out with a male friend again.

The way I see it, he can and has invited male friends to stay at his house, and sometime goes back to his home city and stays with friends.  I don't know exactly who he stays or parties with and i don't need to because i trust him.  Im bi and my best friend is  lesbian, we have had sleep overs since childhood and still do roadtrips and pool parties with other girls (many of them bi and gay too) and nothing weird has ever happened.  So why should there be such a huge difference with my male friends? 

I should note that my bf has zero female friends that i know of, he gets along and socializes with females at work and school but very very lightly.

I have been feeling pretty frustrated with my social life and I want to try to connect with my acquitances more, but now i feel nervous to go out with male acquitances. I dont want to be inappropriate or disrespectful with my boyfriend. But i dont know where to draw the line, is it ok to go out for coffe with a male friend one on one? To go to the movies?.  To go to his house to play videogames?  Like obviously i wouldn't go on a one on one roadtrip but im not sure about other stuff.

I also feel dumb because i didnt feel like this with my ex.  He had his girl friends and i could goto the movies with male friends and hewould drop me off at the place lol.    So i feel this fear/anxiety is mostly in my head. And its annoying because i feel restrained and dominated by what seems (to me) retrograde and close minded ideas.

Any advice on how to tackle this issue? How do i properly go oit with friends without being inconsiderate to my bf? If he gets upset, how do i handle it? How do i stop feeling nervous about this so i can go and live my social life?",16Jul2019,1
167,"One of my best friends is part of a group of that I used be somewhat associated with when I started college. The thing is, I sort of drifted away from these people and found my own crowd, but I am still very close with my friend because we work together. For reference we are both 20F, so as you can imagine we do enjoy a bit of gossip now and then, especially since I know her friends and they are some very...interesting people so there is often enough to talk about.

What makes me nervous, though, is whether this gossip is one-sided. I don’t have any reason to know those people’s business, but I know anyway. I really don’t do anything gossip-worthy for her to tell them, I am extremely boring and generally mind my business, but the problem is that they know me too and who knows?? She tells me their dirty laundry and remains a faithful friend to them, what might she be saying about me? It makes me paranoid to think about. 

She is a great friend and we are very close, technically she has known me longer than them but is very tightly bound to that group so it makes sense that she would vent about them to me (they often force her to hang out with them) and mostly puts up with them because of her boyfriend. Any time they have ever mentioned me she has told me about it and it’s never about anything serious.

Idk though...just makes me anxious. She is a gossipy person and I doubt her friends are any different...don’t even know if I’m warranted to have doubts about her considering this is all pure speculation. I have even asked her jokingly before if she talks about me with them and flat out said I’m not relevant to their conversations but...how are they relevant to ours?",16Jul2019,1

The only problem is I’m currently making the average nationwide salary for this position (45k) which after taxes is only around 33k for me.

That’s plenty to live on, but once my loans start coming through in November I’m basically going to be sending 50-60% of each paycheck towards them, on top of living expenses (have yet to find an apartment near my work that is under $800 a month, currently commuting an hour and still living in cheap college housing) and the fact that I’m already at my positions ceiling salary wise, I’m not sure if I was right to pick this job, but they were the only company that would hire me.

Will I be gaining applicable skills? How long should I stay at this position? Or do you think I’ll be getting a raises? I’m not really sure how progression, promotion and salary raises quite work.

172,"it started off in the school bus in the morning. I had recently been very sick and this was my first day back to school in ten days. I felt fine when I woke up and I had a massive breakfast, as I was very hungry and I never ate a lot during the time that I was sick. My mom said that I should eat lots of vegetables and healthy foods so I wouldn't get so sick again. She served me a plateful of beans, carrots, peas, potatoes, eggs, and a few slices of bacon. While sitting in the bus I felt a dull ache in my stomach, and it made a loud rumble. I thought that it was just gas, but I couldn't release it as I knew that it would cause a stench and everybody would mock me, so I just kept it in and prayed that it would just go away. After stopping to pick up more students, I bent over slightly and farted (luckily it wasn't that loud and I don't think anybody heard it), I started coughing to try and hide the fact that I had just let loose. I thought that I felt better now that I got it out of my system. I arched my back and brought myself forward to get comfortable in my seat, when suddenly I did a massive fart, and I felt like something shot out of my behind and had left through the leg of my shorts . As I looked down the floor around me turned brown and it smelled really bad. I had pooped myself and some of the diarrhea had sprayed on the shoes and trousers of a small boy, as he was sitting right next to me when I had soiled myself, and there was a puddle of runny poop that was slowly running down the bus. My bowels released themselves again while I was farting , brown bubbling liquid surrounded me, and I could see bits of carrots and intact peas floating around, and I even got chunks of it stuck on my schoolbag. It smelled like rotten eggs, and beans, it was awful, I was almost choking due to it's stench. Everybody was laughing at me as I was struggling to escape my pool of runny poop, and the poo covered boy was horrified and started to shake his leg viciously as parts of poop came flying off his clothes into my mouth and eyes as I was trying to exit my seat. All the students ran out of the bus except one who had slid on the pile of diarrhea and fell on top of me as I was trying to escape bringing me back into the river of poop. The bus driver forced his way through students who were leaving the bus and slipped on a pool of diarrhea and face planted on my seat which was covered in crap and children held his head down into the bubbling poop as they tried to force themselves out. Since we were so close to the school entrance a school teacher came out and told me and the other boy covered in crap to remain in the bus until they got wheelchairs through for both of us so we wouldn't get poop all over place. They told us to take all of our clothes off so we wouldn’t make a mess with our poop covered clothes. Me and the other boy both stripped down until we were both completely naked and then they had us put our poop covered clothes in a trash bag and then they took them away. I felt a strange arousal from standing their naked and I ended up getting an erection. I was so embarrassed but I just couldn’t help it. The chairs arrived and I exited the bus and as I was going to sit down I farted again and pooped all over the chair, but they said that they only had two and I had to stay in it. All the other students looked at me as I was getting wheeled into the school naked in a chair covered in poop. The teachers were standing outside their classroom doors in the hallway as I was being wheeled through. Eventually we got to the school nurses office where they let me use the shower and gave me a change of clothes to put on. They said they called my parents to come and take me home and told me to sit down and wait until they arrived. Eventually my mom came and took me home. This was 5 days ago and I haven’t been back to school since. I need to make up some important tests but I don’t want to go back to school because I will surely get made fun of by my classmates. The boy who also got covered in poop emailed me saying I humiliated him and ruined his life. He also said he wouldn’t be returning to school ever. The school also contacted me by phone and demanded that I pay them money for a new seat for the bus to replace the one that got covered in my poop and they also said that I will not be allowed to return unless I am wearing a diaper at all times while at school.",16Jul2019,0
173,"So I’ve been to this party and I was one of the few people left. I never liked my bff ex, never thought of doing something, but that night I got so drunk and high. He sat next to me and started flirting, i didn’t take it seriously because he is like that with every girl and continued talking as if it’s nothing. Then he layed his head on my lap, started moving it slowly and then put his hand under my skirt and slowly started to touch my clit. There were people around me so I’m not sure if they noticed but it surely was awkward because they saw me lean on and saying to him to stop and I’ve pushed his hand a few times. But after some time I got horny and couldn’t resist, and i thought okay a little bit of this can’t do harm. As the night was ending, there were four of us in the room, and the other two were kind of a couple (and a girl who took a picture and I’m sure she send it to my bff- but she didn’t mention anything to me), so they went somewhere I’m not even sure where and we were alone, I’m really not sure how it come to that so that he got naked, and started fingering me. I know i didn’t wanted to kiss him and i barely did, I was just horny and drunk and high and I enjoyed the attention. I told him a lot of times that i didn’t want to do anything and i pushed him, and i told him i don’t want to hurt my friend and that she loves him... and as i was about to go he grabbed me and put me on top of him started kissing me and he put his cock in me. I wasn’t even aware that this was happening until i felt his cock. (I was super drunk) And then i just went with that. He came in 10 sec and after that I told him that he can’t tell anyone because a lot of things are complicated. I loved his best friend and my best friend loves him. He was like don’t worry bla bla. But he is known that he can’t keep a secret. He just talks. After that the next night my bff told me that he called her in 4am, and they talked for two hours. He told her that he wanted to see her again and some romantic bullshit. The thing is I can’t look her in the eye anymore without thinking what I’ve done. I’ll never admit or tell her but I’m afraid if he does or she somehow finds out. She noticed that I act strangely and i know i do because i feel guilty.

174,"As a Southern California transplant from Ohio, I’ve always felt lucky to be near so many great things. I’ve been at a private university studying law for almost four years here, and I absolutely hate it. This place has robbed me of my innocence, time, money, and morals. I feel so dirty and corrupted. For a while now I’ve been waking up wishing I was anywhere but here. I would truly rather get the living shit beaten out of me then sit through traffic here. I just see my life slipping away at every spotlight, and it’s all one big hamster wheel. I crave a simpler, more wholesome lifestyle.

Somewhat recently, I connected with some family roots in Sweden (my family was originally from Sweden and Norway) and was able to visit the country and Copenhagen. From the minute I landed I felt a strong connection and finally felt in a natural state. The inefficiencies of what I seemed to be plagued with in Los Angeles just didn’t exist much there. Of course, it all comes with a cost there, but LA is taking my sanity. 
I really want to uproot my life and go to law school in Sweden, but what’s really keeping me here is my boyfriend who I love so much, but I don’t feel I can really talk to about how miserable I am here because he feels it as a personal attack since he grew up here. 

In addition, I have no understanding of what it’s like to be an expat or move to another country. Especially because I want to do law. It’s 4.5 years there and I would have to do so much more school. I’m scared of risking everything I know, but I also feel like I have nothing to lose other than my boyfriend. I like to think my life would be so much easier in Sweden, but I don’t know that. I’d have to learn a language and go to  law school, and qualify to practice there. I just want some advice. I feel lost here and I don’t know if that’s a sign that I should leave. Am I being selfish?

And on multiple occasions I’ve talked with her and expressed my support for her but its not something I’ve pressed over and over again because other topics have come up and somethings aren’t things that you want to dwell on. Well long story short I was working with one friend Connor tn who asked me if I had talked to Cat. And I said no not since last week when we went to the gym and Applebees. Well then he says well don’t let Cat know I told you this but she was saying how you never hang out with her and she feels that she’s only a friend when it’s convenient for (me) and that I haven’t supported her or comforted her in her break up xy&amp;z... and I was like wtf. That is definitely not true and especially with the whole “only a friend when it’s convenient for me” like wtf does that even mean? I have never asked her for help, most of the times that we hang out its bc I set it up I can’t think of a time when I felt her friendship was out of convenience.

I should note that my bf has zero female friends that i know of, he gets along and socializes with females at work and school but very very lightly.

I have been feeling pretty frustrated with my social life and I want to try to connect with my acquitances more, but now i feel nervous to go out with male acquitances. I dont want to be inappropriate or disrespectful with my boyfriend. But i dont know where to draw the line, is it ok to go out for coffe with a male friend one on one? To go to the movies?.  To go to his house to play videogames?  Like obviously i wouldn't go on a one on one roadtrip but im not sure about other stuff.

I also feel dumb because i didnt feel like this with my ex.  He had his girl friends and i could goto the movies with male friends and hewould drop me off at the place lol.    So i feel this fear/anxiety is mostly in my head. And its annoying because i feel restrained by retrograde, juvenile and close minded ideas. Kinda disappointed in myself.

Any advice on how to tackle this issue? How do i properly go oit with friends without being inconsiderate to my bf? If he gets upset, how do i handle it? How do i stop feeling nervous about this so i can go and live my social life? Any input is welcome.",16Jul2019,2

182,"The internet was a little different 10 years ago. There is a man in Canada that did some fairly awful things to others in his community in the name of God. He's a street preacher who I got kicked out of his church by trolling him and posting it online, it's still available to read and the first thing that comes up in a search for his name. 

He's since started a new following in an independent church and I'm worried. I know this man, I played several characters while trolling him and I will swear to anyone, this is a truly evil person. 

Why I trolled him I can't say as it'll reveal who he is pretty damn fast but what this guy did was awful, I mean rape, theft and possibly murder are the light stuff. He did much worse, but, again, details would reveal him. He's a fucking terrible human being, the worst I've ever known.

183,"I have been very open to change lately. For example, I want to switch my classes in school so I can move into a higher class and learn more, as I am ambitious to obtain knowledge. Furthermore, I also feel very limited by my parents, and have been pushing for change. 

Regarding the school issue, I have previously moved up classes. The school moved me back down classes, despite me showing outstanding results. The school has given me a couple of reasons why the switch cannot be done, such as the scheduling, and another teacher even said that my past teachers asserted that I can’t do it. My parents have not really been on my side when it comes to switching classes, and even they believe I cannot do it. 

Regarding my parents, they are like helicopters. Always hovering over me. I feel as if I can rarely see my friends, and stay up later, despite the fact that I am well older and it’s the freakin summer! I understand they believe they are protecting me, but man, it’s more annoying than shielding. 

Everyone around me has denied change, and I am ready to throw in the towel and give up. Normally, quitting is not my thing, but I’d rather not keep fighting one sided arguments, and mostly losing.

186,"
I’ve tried to write this down in as little as possible with as much information as possible for you all to understand, so please forgive me if this is still too wordy or rambly, I just feel like there’s so much information to the story.
When I was 11 years old, my stepfather molested me. My mom and my entire family believed me but because of financial reasons, she stayed with him. She even got pregnant by him a few months after the incident. My mom made me confront him just a day after it happened and made me describe to her in front of him what it was he had done to me in detail. He said he didn’t remember anything, that he was sleeping. A little context on my stepfather: He’s worked 2 full time jobs to support our family as long as I can remember. he’s been in my life since I was 3 years old and the only father I’ve ever known since my birth father died of bone cancer when I was 1. When I was 7/8-ish I finally started calling him dad. I love/d him as so. And he was always a good dad/person to me, Which makes what he did all the more hurtful. I thought I had forgiven him for so long and everything was fine, we were a happy family. Him, my mom, me, and my two younger sisters. I even kept calling him dad. I forgave him, and life moved on. I guess I locked away all the anger and resentment I felt because coming closer to the 10 year anniversary of the event, all these emotions and feelings started coming back to the point where I would get panic attacks. I went to the doctor and got a prescription for Xanax and a referral to a psychiatrist as my gp said that it sounds like PTSD and I needed to talk it through in therapy. This was over a year ago. I never made the appointment with the psychiatrist. I moved out when I was 18 and since then I see my family almost every Sunday. But lately I haven’t been going because I don’t want to see him. I feel hurt and betrayed that my whole family still loves him even after what he did to me. That my sister, whom my parents told what her dad did to me, still loves him after the fact. At the same time I kind of don’t want to stop seeing him because he did basically raise me and I did see him as a father, and I don’t want my family to get mad at me for “breaking up the family” now that I don’t go see them on sundays. It truly is such a complicated situation and I’ve tried looking for similar situations posted on reddit such as mine for advice but I’ve found none so I decided to make my own post. I also got engaged back in January and it’s been breaking my head on whether or not to invite him to the wedding. I don’t know how my family would react to that. 
What should I do? Is it healthier for me to cut all ties with him even though my family won’t? Or continue living the “forgive and forget” way and still see him?",16Jul2019,2

But with this girl, I can confidently say that this feeling that I'm feeling is actually me being in love with this girl and its crazy to me because its only been a couple months and yet she already has has such a strong impact for me. It has been an honor to make this woman laugh. And I want this to be a forever thing with her. Now the difficult situation is that she got out of a serious three long year relationship not that long ago. So she is still healing from that scar that has been left. She sometimes gets very overwhelmed with some things that I will do. For example when I talk about my feelings to her and what I want for us.

Today she came over for a bit and we ended up having sex. The sex wasn't that good honestly and this isn't the first time either. After, she talked to me on how she mentally isn't ready for such a serious thing like this and other things that involves a couple (we've had this conversation multiple times). She said that although she has broken up with him she feels like she is in a way cheating with him. we agreed that we won't have sex anymore until she can feel comfortable doing it with me and not thinking about her past. When describing her past relationship her past relationship she says how shit it was, yet she was so in love with this toxic person that she believed she will end up marrying this guy. So breaking up with him although she says that she's glad she got out of a shit relationship. it was such a difficult thing to do for her. This girl cares for me a shit ton, she states that she can see a future with me. she tells me how blessed she is to have a guy to be as supportive and caring.

195,"Not sure this is the right place for this.

How do I stop wanting relationships and friends?

From ages 16-17 I was a huge creepy asshole. I treated my girlfriend horribly, was manipulative, acted in ways I consider abusive. I lied, towards the very end I cheated, even though I told myself it wasn’t cheating. I have no excuse for why I was like this. I had supportive parents and my sibling has become a wonderful person. I have intense mental illness but that didn’t start becoming bad until around 18. I was simply selfish and minipulative, full stop.

Around 18 I started reading a lot of social justice stuff and feminist stuff, grew up a lot, and just generally didn’t repeat those same patterns of behavior. That doesn’t make what I did any better, it is just important for that to be clear. At around 19, my mental health took a deep dive into unstable territory. My particular mental problems sometimes influence my memories and judgements, and sometimes have even given me false memories of hurting people when I actually hadn’t.

Don’t let that last fact make you think the first part is a delusion, it definitely wasn’t. But what it does do is make me unable to move on from my misdeeds. I constantly think about them, every day for hours a day. Until recently I wasn’t able to hold down a job, live on my own, or maintain long term romantic relationships. Add to the fact that my former partner denied feeling abused by me, and it was all very confusing. Also I would sometimes convince myself I had abused people, only for them to tell me the things I was worried about didn’t happen in the way I remember. Again, some of you may be tempted to suggest that I wasn’t as bad as I think in my first relationship. I don’t want to rehash everything shitty I did, but just trust me it was abnormally shitty.

About a year ago I had a breakdown, not uncommon for me but this one stuck. Against the advice of my parents I cut off contact with all my friends, explaining I had been abusive. Any attempts at contacting me I shut down and they no longer try. I swore off any kind of romantic relationship or close friends. I don’t think anyone in the world would ever want to be with me if they knew what I’ve done, and I don’t want to burden anyone with my baggage.

That said, I am desperately and horribly lonely. I work a shit job, come home, spend time with my family, and volunteer in ways where I don’t risk making new friends, and sometimes hang out with my roommates but never get too close. I go to therapy. It has been almost two years since my last romantic relationship, and four years before that one. I miss my friends so much it hurts.

I am not here asking how to make friends or date, as that is impossible for me to do in an honest way and every moment I spend with other people feels like an elaborate trick. I don’t want sympathy, I am where I am because of my own actions and carrying this self hate is the price I pay for what I’ve done. I am not the victim of this story and do not mistake myself for one.

All I want in this world is to make art, be a part of a supportive social community, have friends, and be able to have loving relationships. I cannot have any of those things, so how do I stop wanting them? I need to keep going to work, I need to maintain basic levels of health. I’ve already looked into suicide, but the materials I would need for a painless death I don’t know how to obtain and honestly I’m scared of it. I don’t know how to survive without these things, everything feels empty and pointless. How do I make myself stop wanting them?",16Jul2019,1

198,"using a throwaway bc the friend in question follows my main as do several others. hope this topic isn’t too silly for y’all. 

so i’m in high school, about to be a senior, and one of my best friends (i’ll call her anne) has been dating this guy for about a year and a half now. i’ve personally never been a big fan of this guy because he isn’t at all friendly to me or any of anne’s friends, but he isn’t mean either and he treats her well and they’re crazy about each other and he makes her really happy so of course how i feel about him doesn’t matter as long as he’s good to her.

anyways, a couple months ago, a group of people within our “social circle” were talking, and i wasn’t there, but one of anne and i’s friends told us that they were talking about anne and her boyfriend and how “disgusting” they were together and how they showed too much affection in public, and she tried not to show it but i could tell that this was really upsetting to her as she brought it up multiple times over the next few weeks. i told her each time honestly that i don’t agree, they’re just acting like any other couples would and do act in school sitting close with his arm around her and holding hands and hugging and stuff like that, nbd, don’t listen to them

flash forward to a couple months later and in my english class (which anne is not in) my teacher gets into the topic of gross couples (in general, no one in specific) who are always kissing and being gross in the hallways of schools and show way too much pda and taking it overboard as a way of helping us to better understand the book we were reading. the jock in my class feels the need to chime in and says “ew i know a couple like that who are all over each other all the time in [hallway name]” and the whole class laughs and then breaks off into their own conversations. i actually felt my face turn red bc there aren’t many lockers in said hallway and anne and her bf were really the only people he could be talking about, but i hoped otherwise. then this guy asks my teacher, “hey do you know anne?” to which he responds yes, and he says “yeah it’s her and her boyfriend, they’re disgusting” and i could feel my stomach drop at the use of the same word that made her so upset a couple months earlier. i felt so bad and sick to my stomach bc i just couldn’t believe people were talking about anne like this

now, i’m torn on what i should do, on whether i should tell anne or not. on the one hand, if i tell her, she’ll be embarrassed and upset but they’ll be able to tone it back a bit and people won’t look at them like that anymore (i personally have never seen them be as disgusting as these two people have described but maybe i just wasn’t around at the right moments). on the other hand, if i don’t tell her she won’t have to worry about any of this, but people are always going to think she and him are disgusting and i hate to hear people talking about one of the best friends i’ve ever had like this

hope all of this made sense and i’m happy to clear anything up, but 

what would you do??",16Jul2019,1
200,"Nothing really is new, I've know her for about 9 months, and I've liked her pretty much majority of our time together. Started off as strangers, became friends, currently best friends and i absolutely cherish it more than anyone can ever realise. But at this point, it's not a crush, i actually really LIKE this person with all my intention, with all my heart. 

At first, it was just a little crush, but over the past few months and especially weeks, Ive gotten to know her on a much deeper, more personal level.‏‎ Shes beautiful, inside and out. I did confess to her, albeit pathetically over text, couple of months ago. Ofc, she didn't return my feelings and I knew that already, but that didn't stop from it hurting. The pain did get easier, but what didn't was, how I never and still am not over her. I dont know why, i thought i accepted that she can't ever see me any differently, that im only a friend to her yet i still like her more than ever. 

My emotions for her are stronger than the first time i confessed. Also, our friendship is stronger than ever. We've gotten pretty close - as best friends. I want to at least talk about my emotions to her, as it really has been hurting more and more. Tbf, she did say I can talk to her about it if need by but this was months ago. Idk, Im afraid that ill ruin our really close friendship. Im afraid, ill annoy her by bringing it up again. Especially because she is talking to someone and that's unfair for them. 

Theres most times tho, where I feel like im not the right person for her. A different lifestyle, mine being the more restrictive and annoying. There's also different mindsets? Im more of a shy and quiet where she is much more outgoing and straightforward, which I really like and admire about her. Literally the age difference haha, she is a year older which hurts sooo much. How I wish i was older... even a few fucking months would make it easier.
I dont think im the right person for her, all I see myself as is a best friend for her. If i see it like that, then why should she see it any differently. 

Is it pathetic to say, most of my 2019 has been spent thinking about a person who doesn't think about me like that, is it pathetic of me to want someone who doesnt want me. Is it pathetic to like someone. I don't really know anymore.",16Jul2019,2
201,"I’m 17/m and I’m a senior in highschool. I ruined an amazing relationship with a girl I really cared about. I didn’t know how to express my feelings and I really didn’t know what I was doing it was my 1st relationship.

Problems with her family and being really stressed out at the time made me break up with her. Looking back on it the issues could’ve been resolved but I overreacted at the time. She really loved and cared about me but I was really stupid and let her go. She found another guy in 2 weeks and told me last week that he’s done more for her in 2 months than I did in 9 months. That really hurt me. I put up with a lot of shit just to be with her.

I’m feeling really lonely right now. I’ve lost her and all of my friends. I really feel like she was the one girl for me, tailored to fit my life but I screwed it up. I’m hoping when I head off to college next year things will change and I’ll meet someone else and new friends.

I’m just really scared that I’ll never find another girl who will love me for me. I’m scared of being cheated on or dumped because they were just tired of being with me. I’m scared of never finding love again. I've seen what an unfaithful relationship can do to someone. My mom cheated on my dad twice and now he's just a shell of a man. I don't want to end up like that. I'm terrified of it. 

I struggle with a lot of self confidence issues to begin with. This spring/summer has just been hell for me. I’ve really tried to work on myself as a person and I’ve been trying to read and hit the gym a lot. It’s really hard when you see everyone else having the time of there life’s and I’m just sitting here like a lonely idiot. It’s especially hard to see my ex girlfriend hanging out with her boyfriend on social media. It just makes me sick knowing that there doing all of the stuff that we used to do.

I know I probably sound like the stereotypical teenage boy but I really worry about never finding someone again. I’m 5,4 and kinda skinny, I’m not the best looking either. I’m maybe a 6/10. Ive been told I look like a young Toby Maguire so imagine that I guess. I apologize for the panicky tone of this post.

203,"hello everyone, I’ve been trying to find somewhere to post this because I really wanna talk about it and I decided this sub is my best option. this will probably be a long read so apologies in advance.

I’ll call this girl beth. I guess I should start by saying that I’m 19 (M) and she’s 15, which right off the bat is very weird, I’ve never “liked” someone that much younger than me and I’ve also never liked someone that I met through gaming. it’s a bit embarrassing but we met through minecraft a few weeks ago (I used to play it religiously ~3 years ago and just recently came back because it’s kind of fun to play just to pass the time). we mainly use discord to talk and shit. 

right off the bat I thought she was pretty cool because she has an amazing sense of humor and is really sarcastic, but I just thought she’d be a friend that I could occasionally chat and play with. however for the last week or so, I’ve completely fucked up my sleep schedule (staying up until literally like 11am when I have work later that day) just so I can talk to and play with her. she’s australian and I’m american so it’s really the only way we can talk for long periods of time. we’ve talked one on one a few times but there’s usually a few other people in the channel with us. 

so a few days ago she said I should follow her instagram (at this point I have feelings for her) and I did, after which she said I can follow her spam if I want, which has less than 25 followers and seems to get into some deep shit sometimes, so I thought that was a pretty good sign.

anyway this is already kinda long so I’ll try to wrap it up, beth is “dating” this other dude that’s in the discord, although she seems embarrassed by it. a lot of the time i’ll make fun of her for “edating” because it’s kind of a running joke in her discord and she’ll get all defensive and say she isn’t dating him, yet everyone knows that they’re a thing. so yesterday I ended up telling one of her friends that I like beth but I’m not so sure that I actually wanna pursue her, she basically just said ha that’s so cute blah blah maybe she’ll try to talk to you if her “bf” starts treating her badly or something. once again I stayed up extremely late last night talking to her and some other people on discord, but I eventually left when she started talking about the dude she’s dating because for whatever reason it made me sick to my stomach.

I know this is a really weird situation and I feel like I’m overreacting over some random girl I met online, but I genuinely enjoy talking to her. we’re constantly making fun of each other and I can make her laugh pretty easily, but we’ve never just messaged each other and been like “hey you wanna play/talk??”, I’ll just join the channel if I see she’s in there. sometimes she’ll @ me on discord telling me to join and talk with them but idk. I wanna just tell her that I have a crush on her because I just feel weird talking to her now, I love hearing her voice and everything but it’s just a weird feeling, kind of hard to explain. I feel like even if she wasn’t dating this other guy there’s nothing I could do anyway because of our age gap and the whole online dating thing, which I don’t know if I’m comfortable with. 

anyway even I don’t get many responses it felt good to type this all out I guess lol",16Jul2019,2

207,"So I was with her for about a year. Me(22M) and her(23F) had a really bad break up that was honestly my fault. I out her in a bad situation that ended with her breaking up with me really badly.

With that break up, I lost a lot in terms of progress. I was part of this trade school program, and I brought her into it. Because of the break up, I got kicked out the program. 

So, I now work at a minimum wage job when I could've been doing something better while she's finishing the program. I can reapply, but i have to wait a year. In other words, I have to start over.

So, how do I move on from her because I did love her. And how do I forgive not only her but myself? How do I find peace? I'm kinda depressed if u cant tell. Lol",16Jul2019,2
208,"I have a very Mexican mother who's the type to not take mental health issues that seriously. I've talked to her before about how I feel and how I think something like therapy would really benefit me. For some time, my emotions have been getting the best of me and she blames it on teen hormones (which I understand). She tells me my problems are nothing compared to what others have so I shouldn't complain.

[I do not want to self-diagnose] My main problems are intrusive thoughts, horrible habit of eating my problems away, have depressing lows for no reason at very awkward times, etc.

Is she right? Do you think it's just me getting older and my hormones going wild? Or should I at least try to get professional help just to be safe?

209,"Hey. So I am a 17 year old guy. I need some advice on making close friends. For my whole life I've been moving and so I've never stayed in a single school for longer than 2 years. Idk if this affects me and the way I connect with people but I've always mostly had ""buddies"" that I only talk to during school.

 I feel like socially I'm capable, I just literally have never tried going further than being friendly to people at school.

 Idk I guess what I want to know is how do I even begin to develop friendships that last outside of school?

 Is it even normal to just text random people? How often do people actually hang out after school? Is it annoying to have someone try and become your friend when you already have all the friends you need? Idk man I'm confused.",16Jul2019,2

211,"I am a male at the bright young age of 15 and I am in (so far) the biggest predicament of my life. This is going to be a wild story so buckle up.

&amp;#x200B;

Characters

Me/I: It is me, male, turned 15 a few months ago

A: The step-cousin in question, female, just turned 16 today

G: Other step-cousin, male, 14 almost 15

&amp;#x200B;

Every summer my step-cousin (A) comes from a few states away and stays at our grandma's, usually she stays for about a month while the rest of her family stays for about a week. For the past two summers, my other step-cousin (G) and I have gone out and spent time with her. I am going out tomorrow (there is a possibility of G going but we aren't sure yet).

&amp;#x200B;

Two summers ago everything was normal, we hung out in the basement while our grandparents and other cousins stayed in the top two floors and, like teenagers we raided the liquor cabinet and drank a little (not enough to make us hammered). We spent all night playing on the new Nintendo Switch and watching movies together. We played hide and seek at 3 in the morning, this woke my our grandma up because of all the laughing, (she said it sounded like a bunch of animals) but she's really cool and was alright with it. We pulled an all-nighter, this was my first one (pretty sad right?) and I really enjoyed it.

&amp;#x200B;

Last summer was a little different, we stayed on the top floor instead of the basement. Half of the top floor was a loft looking down on the main floor (just trying to help you picture it). We mostly all chilled in a queen sized bed since everything is super loud to the people downstairs. Since other people were awake and we couldn't do any rebellious teenager stuff, we decided to start a Harry Potter marathon. After everyone else was asleep we started playing truth or dare.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: A is very attractive, especially a horny little teenager. In conclusion, playing truth or dare made me even hornier. We did body shots, made out, showed parts (not too much, A is slightly insecure), etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning A and I woke up before G, we had some emotional talks, it was very comforting being there with her. Soon G and I left. A couple of days later I am texting A and we start talking about some stuff. One thing leads to another and we both start confessing our feelings, she admitted that if G wasn't there then she would have fucked me in that bed. I was amazed by this, I am not the most attractive and I am not really one to be with girls (It's not that I'm not into them it's just that none of them are attracted to me). For the next couple of weeks, we keep texting each other and eventually come up with a plan for us to fuck the week that she will be leaving to visit some other family. She tells me that I need to get my hands on some condoms, so I contact a friend and he convinces his aunt to give him some condoms. Unfortunately, A and I never got the chance. Some unforeseen events came up and one of us was busy when the other was available.

&amp;#x200B;

It is now this summer, she has a relatively new boyfriend back home but seems to still be showing interest in me, I have no clue what to do. As I said, I am going to our grandma's tomorrow and I really don't know what to do.

I always feel like when they don’t talk to me that they hate me so much, but literally when any other race doesn’t talk to me it doesn’t bother me and I don’t know why. It’s like I support them more than any other race, but when they don’t include me then suddenly I am opposed to them the most. I don’t know how to stop thinking like this. Sometimes it feels like every white person is connected with each other and it’s easier for them to be friends, but when I try to befriend them, they ignore me.

218,"The thing is, one of us, more likely me says something in a joking and non-serious tone, and if it bothers him, he responds in a completely serious tone and asks me to stop and never do it again because it makes him uncomfortable. I don't have a problem with him being open about what he's not comfortable with but what a fucking mood killer; Holy shit it's frustrating. Especially when it's all just an obvious joke he takes things so seriously and sense it's such a contrast to the joking mood we're always in, it puts me and whoever else in the call in an awkward situation.

Example, I'm in a call with this guy and I, and at some point we spiral into this tone of us, but mainly him acting all gay and cutesy and as a joke I respond with ""oh my god your soooo cute!"" and THAT'S WHEN HE DRAWS THE LINE, like, dude what the fuck. He's like ""That makes me really uncomfortable, can you not do that? Like, just stop."" LIKE YOU WERE DOING THE SAME THING TO ME YOU FUCKING HYPOCRITE.

I've been in this apartment for 1 year and 6 months. I pay $300 a week. It's in a great spot and I really don't want to have to move. 

My lease is up on the 26th of September. I really don't want to move since I love it so much but I'm going into summer and boy..does this apartment get HOT. Last summer I had to leave every night to sleep at a friends place because he had aircon. 

I'm pretty sure she'd be down to let me sign another lease, she is super nice and chill plus she hasn't even done an inspection on the place.

Anyway, I'm thinking of emailing her and saying I'd love to extend the lease if we could get some aircon installed because of what happened last summer. I'm going to offer to pay more rent for this to happen.

229,"First things first, for the last 8 years I’ve been busy raising my daughter. A lot of that time as a single father, but now I’m married again and in a fairly stable place. I put a lot of my life on hold in order to focus on getting us to where we are now in life, But now, at nearly 27 years old, I’m finally presented with the chance to do what I’ve always wanted to; go back to college. My wife has a great job, I’m freelancing pretty consistently and my daughter is becoming pretty independent as far as 8 year olds are concerned. It has lined up really well. 

But here is where I reach an impasse. I have two career paths I could see myself enjoying greatly. 

Law — I love studying law. I’ve been doing it as an amateur just for fun for quite some time. I come from a long line of pastors, and though I can’t say I agree with their beliefs, I respect that I have inherited a fairly natural ability to debate and clearly argue a point in my favor. My wife hates it LOL. Joking aside, I feel like my natural abilities pull me more in the direction of legal studies. It would be a long and tough path with no promises. But I could see myself even enjoying a career as a legal assistant if not a lawyer. 

Biology possibly with a focus of  Zoology — I grew up on somewhat of a homestead/farm. I raised all sorts of animals and still have a list of pets longer than I have time to mention. It’s a passion of mine, caring for animals. I also take great joy in gardening, nature in general. I don’t have a lot of knowledge in this area, but that is what fascinates me. The chance to really learn something new and make a career out of something I love. 

My biggest worry is the classic “I feel like the clock is ticking” on my chance to really get a good career going. I know it’s never really too late. But sometime it feels that way. It’s made this decision really hard. I know there are some incredibly wise folks on this platform, so I’m hoping to gather some solid opinions. I appreciate everyone’s time. It means a lot.",16Jul2019,1
230,"I’m married and I love my wife. I really do. But she doesn’t listen to me. She barely makes eye contact some days and ignores me about what I think we should do with our child in some situations. She doesn’t disagree, she just doesn’t seem to care to listen. I have to repeat myself constantly, and sometimes she just nods an answer, even when my question isn’t a “yes or no”. I don’t believe any parent should make a decision alone when it concerns a child. Not if there’s two to cherish him.

We’ve had issues before, but about different subjects. Sex mostly, but her not speaking to me has been haunting our relationship for a long time. And that’s more important to me. (Sex is also not her concern, to set the record straight. It’s mine). 

I just want my wife to care about what I say, like I care about what she says. I’m always all ears, and have been. We’ve been together for over 10 years. But I’m getting frustrated. I feel like the bad guy. I talk, she doesn’t listen. I suggest, she ignores. She airs out our dirty laundry in public sometimes, and around extended family, then ignores me. Or she says “I didn’t mean to do that”, or “it wasn’t my intention to...” Words I’ve heard so many times my stomach churns when I hear it. I just feel disrespected, and lonely. Really lonely. 

I feel like my marriage and the life of my child is out of my hands. I work from home some days to stay with them. I don’t want to miss a thing with the kid. They are my life. 

I tried talking to her and asking her why countless times. But we’re still in the same boat and I’m the only one rowing. I just get mad now and I don’t know what to do. I don’t lash out. But I’m starting to get loud, and I’m catching myself loud talking at her blank stare whenever we bicker. It’s like she hates me. She doesn’t respond. And I’m starting to hate myself for my aggravation. I hate that I’m getting loud. I don’t know what I did, but I feel like I’m being punished. “Am I a bad person” is always on my mind. Am I what’s wrong in the relationship? I don’t want a divorce. I really don’t. I’ve waited my whole life for this woman. This smart, sweet, beautiful woman.

-we have worked with her for 4 years, no problems
-became great friends
-an opportunity for one of us to become manager came up, no one wants to do that 
-we encourage her to take it since she showed some interest, she was sold when she found out she would get paid great 
-first she gave herself the perfect schedule, she took weekends off and gave herself all morning shifts (no one else has weekend days) 
-we take an average of 6 clients a day, she started taking just a couple
-we start having problems with out schedules (I literally closed every day, and it really conflicted with my husbands schedule so I literally never saw him until my days off) when she took on a new hire to train 
-after the new hire was ""trained"" she still has weekends off and all morning shifts with the manager, because even though we have been friends with her for ages she says we are too miserable to work with lately 
-they are best friends and hang out every day and do basically no work, while the rest of us do everything 
-new employee is very poorly trained and a liability to the company 
-we are miserable, and go above her heads to complain to upper management 
-upper management takes her side, because she has them convinced that we never brought our concerns to her, and we are just being dramatic since she is our friend and trying to override her
-she has given me a the worst associate review with the company I have ever had, and her reasoning is because ""it looks bad if I dont since we are friends""
-all associates are fed up and doing not doing their jobs properly anymore, but she doesnt take action 

Now before everyone tells me I need to report her to HR, it is not actually really anonymous and things are hardly ever actually done about it. I have seen associates get bullied after filing a report until they quit. Right now all I'm hoping for is that I can still transfer (I'm not sure anymore since I have poor reviews on my file and the upper management dislikes me now). Once I transfer I was just going to remove her from my life completely and just try to move past this... but we have been dealing with this for over a year now and it's been a huge toll on my mental health and it's just not ... satisfying.

236,"I thought that it would be helpful to get Reddit's opinion on an issue that has been weighing on me lately.  

A few years ago, I (31F) inherited some furniture from my family- one of which is an upright piano that had been bought by my great-grandmother in 1959.  The piano is in pretty decent condition for its age, although it hasn't been tuned in years.  This piano was in our childhood home before I even existed, and after my mom died, it needed a new home.  None of us had the heart to get rid of it and I'm the only one of my siblings who can play- so I took it.

From a practical standpoint, it's very expensive to move and maintain, and I don't really use it anywhere near enough to justify keeping it.  I've been keeping it for almost purely sentimental reasons- I think it reminds me of my childhood and family.  Plus, it really is beautiful- even after all these years.  I do have the original bill of sale and thank you note from the piano dealer (printed by a typewriter and everything, and addressed to my great-grandparents). 

I hate the idea of selling/donating the piano, but I don't know if I can justify the cost of long-term storage or moving it repeatedly (I'd like to move back north within the next year).  It's not really worth anything, and I may or may not find a good home for it.

239,"So me and this guy have been on and off for almost 2 years. We were first together for 8 months but then we ended things due to my mental health getting in the way and other personal issues influencing the relationship.  We took a couple months off but the last few months we’ve been talking again and things are going good. We’re both on a mutual agreement to not rush back into a relationship. 
With that being said, when me and him were together, his family ended up moving to a different city but things didn’t work out, and he wouldnt be able to stay with them without it causing problems. 

So my mom took him in and let him live with us instead. When we were together he lived with me for about 4 months but after a while we began having issues like I mentioned before.  We  started arguing a lot and it became a very unhealthy relationship. His family ended up moving back to our city so he moved out of my house and moved back in with his family. 

We ended up breaking up and we had a lot of issues. So his family no longer liked me. 

That was about 7 months ago, and I have dealt with my mental health, and a lot of the issues we had at the time have been solved. 

Now, in this moment of time, things are beyond good between me and him. We’re both happy with one another and enjoy the way our relationship is ( even though it’s not official.) 

I feel like things have never been better and I truly feel like we’re on the right track. But his family, his grandma in specific, doesn’t like me. 

Even if I haven’t done anything. She hates me and hates the thought of me being at his house.  It’s caused her to get in the way of me and him on many occasions and she’s been very disrespectful towards me  in the past. 

After a year and a half of  being their for him in a way nobody else has, she refuses to call me by my name. I’m continuously referred to as “ that girl” or “ friend” even when  me and him were in an official relationship, she never called me by my name. 

She claims that I irritate her and make her very angry even if I haven’t done anything.  

It’s gotten to the point where if I go to his house, I don’t leave his room unless it’s to use the washroom. I avoid her as much as possible to avoid any problems. But now, even with me doing that she still has a problem with me being around. And I’m worried that because of how she feels about me, she well say things about it and it will influence the way my “ boyfriend” feels. Because it has happened before. 

His whole family is bi polar and there’s days where she doesn’t care I’m over and is super nice but I don’t know how to deal with it anymore. 

How do you handle being in a relationship with someone when you aren’t completely accepted by the other people around him? 

I’ve thought about writing his grandma an apology letter for the mistakes I have made in the past, but I’m worried it’ll upset her more. I’m not sure what to do anymore. 

But I’m tired of not being accepted in his house and leaving unexpectedly in the evening  because she doesn’t want me there anymore, due to “irritating” her. When I haven’t even done anything let alone leave his room. 

What do I do? Do I let her be mad for whatever reason, do I apologize for the past? Do I just accept that she’ll never accept me or like me?",16Jul2019,1

244,"Disclaimer: This is an anonymous account because this is obviously a pretty large sub-reddit that I am choosing to post to regarding my intimate problems. Also, sorry for the length. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I need some pretty big advice about some pretty big decisions in my life at the moment. To be clear, I have come to terms with the fact that I have a really hard time making decisions, so any advice is much appreciate. Additionally, I'm currently recovering from a sever phase of depression (medical treatment has significantly improved my day-to-day mood, objectively speaking, i.e. I can get out of bed in the morning finally).

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so right now, I am currently a Masters student in a social science. I used to be decently passionate about the subject as I have my bachelors in the same subject. Now, as a veteran graduate student, TA (Teaching Assistant), and general academic, I have grown to absolutely hate the professional environment and my field in general. The people, the day-to-day hours, and all the bureaucratic and political non-sense. Not to mention, the institution I am currently at has had some major political upheavals, and has made things considerably worse for me to actually conduct meaningful research. It had really put a sour taste in my mouth, and I question if I will ever truly be happy doing this in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I like being a TA, but that is pretty much it. That shouldn't be how it is. Being a TA should not be your top priority as a academic researcher, as you won't produce good research. Which is what happened: I haven't produced good research and failed at that. It doesn't even pay minimum and I'm fresh out of undergraduate as well, so I have no financial stability. I've only recently been able to get over the fact that I failed at something I didn't want to, despite being in my mid-20's. Before then, I was so depressed from being where I was that I couldn't be productive at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I've taken some extra (fully funded) time to finish my degree, but I have lost almost **all** passion to keep going. It holds such a negative space in my head that I honestly couldn't care less if I had the degree or not. I thought I wanted this to be my career path when I was an undergraduate (because at the time, it was something I was good at). But now, I realize that I should have just done something I loved rather than what I thought made the most applicable sense: be a researcher over a starving artist. 

&amp;#x200B;

During this period of being in graduate school, I stopped doing what I really loved doing. I was a big artist in high school and undergraduate, and wanted to tattoo when I was younger. I half-way didn't even want to go to college coming out of high school. Parents didn't approve of that though, and somewhat forced me into college (I know, its pretty paradoxical considering where I am now). I also have some fiction work I have stored away, but nothing super serious or substantial at the moment (just a handful of ideas that are recorded with not much prose written). I would much rather spend my time doing something that made me happy with some financial stability. Hell I don't care if I have to work a normal 9-to-5 job regularly, at least that will **PAY** and have normal hours. Being a TA and graduate student, all your work comes home with you and you get paid poorly (mathematically, not even minimum). I also have loans to pay off. I'm also gay and live in the Midwest, so I'm slowly realizing that no matter what I do, career-wise or personally, most of the world and my family will see me as a black sheep anyway, so I might as well embrace that and do what I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love some advice on what to do from here though. Its currently summer, so I'm at home chilling until the semester starts back up again. Its giving me some time to really think about it all and recover mentally. Right now I either (1) stay in school, try and finish and move-on, hoping this career path will lead me to a work/research environment that I enjoy, OR (2) forget about it all, work a normal day-job, save some money and pay off loans for a couple of years, move, create what I want to create, and try and move on from there. What should I do?",16Jul2019,1
246,"I dated this girl for 3 years and fell deeply in love with her. Ive dated her over the internet since our situations havent particularly lined up yet. She became one of my best friends to talk to and i started relying on her to be able to talk to more. We went through ups and downs and she had some self esteem issues as did i probably. A year ago from now she told me she wanted to take a break and i did what you would expect and panicked for a good 2 months being a needy spammy ex. She told me she loved me still but didnt feel the need to talk to me as much as she used to. That kinda hurt me a lot back then but i understand that now. Ive gotten better at not relying on her for emotional security or happiness but nowadays i still think about her a lot. Shes the only girl ive ever felt this deeply about and i wish i could tell her how i really feel. At the moment im stuck in a place where she hasnt blocked me but she doesnt willingly message me or try to talk to me at all and she only has done that once in the past year and then dissappeared when i replied. I feel like i need to figure out what's going on with this and be honest at some point so i can move on. I dont feel like i can cleanly move on when im still so clueless about what she wants or how she feels about me. I know i shouldnt rush it and i shouldnt be messaging her at all (and i dont) according to most of the things i read, but it just feels incomplete. I get that thats normal and that a lot of people dont get closure from relationships and have to get it from themselves, but i also dont think its mature not to be honest with one another after such a long meaningful relationship. Im not looking to force anything or manipulate her but i just dont know how to go about getting to that closure. And id prefer to just block her out of my life if i can get to an answer that warrants that but i dont think shes really deserving of that yet and i dont think id get the closure im looking for by doing that quite yet. So basically how do i handle this situation when it comes to actually doing something? I understand that i need to give her space and have been doing so for a while now. At some point id like a mature discussion about this with her. And trying to talk to her normally is just weird because we never got the chance to talk through the break up, she kind of just ignored me for a little bit till i stopped spamming and now she still ignores me a lot but i definitely dont spam or make myself look desperate.",16Jul2019,1
247,"I already posted this somewhere else, I so I guess this is just more desperation. 

I’m not an ugly girl. Now, I don’t like the way I look most times still. But I still like some of my qualities, like my eyes, lips, or hair. I’m a little over weight, but definitely not fat. I’m on the taller side, so I carry my weight fairly well. When I’m with other people I exude a lot of confidence. I hold myself proudly at all times, excluding when I’m alone. 

I have a good personality. I’m not bragging or anything, I have my flaws, but I’m fun to hang around. I’m caring and kind, and I’m often described as a sweetheart. I try to be nice to everyone, even people who don’t give it back. I have a good sense of humor, usually I’m pretty good at carrying and starting conversations, and I have a positive outlook on life.

I’m independent. I have a job, and a savings account, and I pay my own bills. Well, as many bills as a seventeen year old can pay without her parents already covering it by default. 
In theory, I’m a great choice for a partner. Again, not bragging or putting myself up high. But I’ve had one “relationship” and it only consisted of us talking over Snapchat because he was out of town the whole summer. 

I’ve only kissed one guy, and it was a pity kiss. 

I can’t seem to attract any guys, or any redeemable ones. The only guys I attract are kind of weird, and I don’t mean that in a mean way. But they’re kind of out there, you know? Not the kind of guys you want to cuddle up to, because in all honesty some of them have the face of someone who has seen the inside of a cat. (Disclaimer: I am not being shallow, they are genuinely creepy and people I would rather not show vulnerability to)

I guess this whole post is a cry for help. I know I’m young, I know I have time, but this deep burn inside hurts. It hurts to see all my friends going out on dates, falling in love, and having fun.

248,"It’s probably come up a million times but I don’t know how to cope. Backstory first: a little over a year ago my relationship with the girl I thought I was gonna marry. Parents forced us apart over something small. Doesn’t matter anymore. No more than 2 months later every friend I had since middle school and high school decided to turn their backs on me (graduated 2 years ago). So I’m totally alone for the most part with trust issues like crazy. I’ve made one or two new friends but we all work so I hardly get time with them. Now here’s the issue: I started talking to this girl and it’s awesome. She’s great and I might even be in love with her (it’s been 6 months). The only issue is, this is the first week since we met I’ve had no contact with her (she’s on a cruise). It’s only been 3 days or so and I’m already seeing I hate my life without her in it. It’s just pure loneliness and I have nobody other than her really. My only friend now is hardly available and when he is he’s with his own girlfriend. Not only that, but the girl I’m with has lots of friends and is currently a college student not working so she’s always living her life having a good time. I’m so painfully jealous to the point where it hurts in my stomach. I wish I could live that life (full time employee and part time student). I don’t know what to do.

I snapped and had to make an excuse to leave because I broke down and cried. I have no idea what to do at this point.

250,"So I met this girl off Tinder months ago. She swore I was the only person she'd met on there and that a friend had downloaded it for her to try out, and she only had it for a day. I later found a Tinder activation code on her phone that confirmed this. We had sex the first night we met. She became completely smitten with me, gave up heavy smoking and a bunch of other stuff just so she could be with me as I was on the fence at first. She's constantly telling me I'm her first real relationship where she's consistently having sex and that's why she's so infatuated with me.

She told me at the start she was a virgin. Later on she let slip that morning-after pills cost $5 in a different town. When I later asked how she knew, she told me a story of there being one guy that she hooked up with at a party when she moved to my city for the first time a couple months ago. She told me she had a relationship with a guy for 6 months at 16 when she was in an all girls' boarding school but only kissed, which I find hard to believe. She later told me she'd been raped at 16 and counted him as someone too. She also lets me look through her phone and have her password and doesn't even ask for mine.

I found that she'd been talking to some guys on Snapchat before she'd met me. She told me that she used to be a ""non-sexual"" hoe (w/e that means) and talk to people on social media before we met me but never do anything with them. I looked through the convos with these dudes and was shocked to see her telling the truth, for example stuff from the guys like ""so when are we gonna meet for the first time?"" before she'd then give an excuse or stop replying. She knows I've had much more sexual partners than the 2 she has admitted to and it makes her very jealous. I'd expected that would make her want to open up a bit more and tell the truth to ""even the score"" with me but it hasn't. She's a bad liar and gets nervous or smiles uncontrollably when she tries to twist the truth even a little. Yet each time I've asked about her ""number"" she's told me seriously without a flicker of nervousness.

254,"Alright, this is my very first post on Reddit and I already have horrible grammar and formatting as well as me being very tired while writing this so please bear with me. Also, as a warning, this post also deals with the very serious issue of abusive relationships and assault.

Ever since I got together with my current girlfriend at the beginning of our freshman year of high school (9 months and 2 weeks ago, not a long relationship but both of our only serious ones) she mentioned how her ex was abusive and even stalks her. There have been a few times were he has gone to her house, logged onto her social media, and even physically hit her and groped her while we were dating. Even worse is while they were dating he would make fun of her body, hit her, cheat in front of her and has held her at gun point before. Yet every time she tells me about this, she always tells me to not get upset or call the police on him. she has given multiple excuses as to why but all of it just boils down to ""I don't want to deal with it."" or ""his friends are dangerous and will hurt us if we do anything"" and she always get upset with me for seeing it as something very important and trying to talk about it.

She's said she doesn't want to deal with it legally because she doesn't like or trust police, no matter how much she needs them. She also claims that she has friend in multiple gangs that could simply deal with him but says she doesn't want to do that either. She also says she is willing to call to let me call the police if he ever does literally anything to her again but I don't want to wait until next time in case something worse happens and I can't help in time. I also worry she simply won't tell me next time because she says she didn't even want to tell me the last few times because I would make a big deal about it.

How can I convince her that it is simply for safety and not to just prove that I'm right?

Every week I wrote him to ask him how he was doing and after two weeks he sent me 3 bibliographic reference attachments to use in my project and he tells me that the something about the title that he sent me, I checked the files and I saw that There was nothing more than those bibliographical references, I reply to the same email (thread) telling him that maybe he forgot to attach something because I did not see anything related to the title, he did not replied and I write another email (new thread) to which he responds quickly apologizing and telling me who is going to review it, but 7 days has passed, 7 days to review a file that supposedly was ready and that he forgot to attach.

 Obviously I think it is suspicious and delaying tactics, but I do not want to accuse him of anything, I just want to make him see that it has been 1 month and I have not advanced anything to graduate I should do two internships and this project, I postponed the internships because I practically studied at a distance and after starting an internship in a company it is difficult to ask for a day to do paperwork in another city, time is running and this semester is my last chance to achieve it and I think he knows that.

267,"Hi there,

I’m pretty desperately reaching out for help because there’s nobody else who I know I can talk to. I (19/M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (24/F) for 1 year, and we met through Tinder. At the start, I wasn’t too sure about how I felt about her, but as I got to know her more, I started to feel a very strong connection. Our relationship has had a fair bit of ups and downs, which unfortunately I am mostly responsible for. Being my first relationship, I have had to identify a lot of my flaws and areas of improvement. My girlfriend has been very understanding of this, and has helped me through it.

We met in May, and it has been mostly fantastic up until about March this year. The down parts have been a result of me being unable to accept certain issues with myself when she raises them, and unfortunately there have been two occasions where I said she was being ridiculous. Aside from that, I have also been struggling with porn addiction for a few years, however it has recently gotten significantly worse, and I have started to neglect my relationship. I have become increasingly lazy, and am also neglecting my health a little bit. I have been staying up until ridiculous hours playing games with friends, and my girlfriend is very much aware of this. I have started to see a psychologist to address these problems, but it’s a slow start with only one appointment every two weeks.

What made things blow up was some recent financial trouble where I accidentally overpaid a debt repayment, so last night I had to borrow $15 from my girlfriend to pay off my rent. We were having an active conversation through text, and then she sent me a screenshot of the money being sent. I saw her screenshot, but at the time I was getting off the train and heading to the supermarket. I didn’t end up replying to her until 2 hours later and she was upset that I disappeared while we were talking, more so because she was helping me out with something. She said she got worried that I was in an accident because I stopped replying so suddenly. Again, regrettably, I got frustrated and said she was being ridiculous. This was basically the straw that broke the camel’s back because it reminded her of the previous events where I said that to her. We ended up having a long talk and she said it was the third time she voiced her concern about me not caring enough about the relationship since around March. There were a lot of tears, and it wasn’t a great end to the evening to say the least.

The aforementioned porn addiction showed its true colours after our discussion, and to deal with my emotions I ended up relapsing twice. I felt like complete shit. That night, I had very vivid dreams involving being intimate with two girls, one of them had the surname of my girlfriend. In the dream, I had very strong feelings for one of the girls, but I woke up feeling an overwhelming sense of lust for my girlfriend. We haven't really spoken much at all today, so it's been pretty rough.

My girlfriend is really amazing. She gives me massages, cooks for me, helps me with my finances, and basically ticks all the boxes of who I would want in something, but the biggest battle I'm facing at the moment is deciding if I should continue to restore the damage I've done, despite some constant back and forth in our relationship. She is going through a lot of stress with university at the moment, and is approaching her final semester with upcoming exams. The last thing I want is to trouble her.

Sorry if this was all over the place, I'm just looking for overall advice and I'm having trouble collecting my thoughts when my head is such a mess.

Not sure if this is also worth noting, but despite my young age, my circumstances are a bit different. I moved out of home when I was 16 to go overseas for a year, and upon returning to my home country at 18 I have been working full-time since then. I do not live with family.

Thank you.",16Jul2019,1
268,"I’ve been friends with these people for about a year and all year they’ve made nonstop fun of me. The first half of the year I kind of just played along and brushed it off. The second half of the year came and it got worse. I got into a relationship with a girl who was a grade lower than me and they started spreading rumors that I was a pedophile. Eventually, a good part of my school believed it and I lost a few friends over it. Even then, I was still respectful to my “friends”. I told them that I would never spread rumors or talk bad about their name and I asked for an apology, and they never gave me one. So I brushed it off again and kinda stopped thinking about it. That is until they brought it up the next week, and then the next day, and then later that same day. It got to a point that it was super frequent. I ended up exploding on them, but in the end we resolved things.

Recently, summer broke out, but one of my friends made a meme about me being gay, and this time I asked him to not post it because last time he did, it had a pretty negative impact on me. He said that I was overreacting and that he would still post it because it was funny. That pissed me off so I blocked both of them, and I ranted about it on my Snapchat story. 

Well people are responding to me and they keep saying that I’m overreacting and it was just a joke. I think they aren’t respecting me as I have respected them, it should go both ways, right?",16Jul2019,2
270,"So my ex just dumped me about 2 weeks ago. We were together nearly 3 years and imo I thought and felt like things were awesome. We spent literally every second possible and really had a great time. But she says that recently she has been feeling less towards me but that she still loves me and she still thinks we are best friends...but that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore. 

Now I'm devastated. We recently came back from visiting my parents and family and really had a great time. So in my mind, things were really going great and I honestly thought I would get to be with her forever. I never wanted to break up and this happening has really left me feeling very depressed. Sucks even more cause she is probably the most perfect gal ever. I hate the thought of having lost her...it really makes me sad. 

What do I do now? I know I have to move on, but how do I stop thinking about her and all the wonderful times. 

I just want her to realize that this was a mistake and I'd take her back in a heartbeat.

Me and him are close but it wasn't what it use to be. When I met him he was a huge fuckboy not going to lie. After me and him got to know each other we earned each other's trust. But later he fucked another girl. I respected him telling me immediately but it was probably because he was high too lol. But he told me he regretted it and he couldn't stop thinking of me when he fucked another girl. He also blocked all the girls he tried hooking up with and I didn't even ask him to do that. I've been sort of jealous since we both agree we could hook up with people and date other people. I've been real anxious about this whole relationship from the start. If I were to have a boyfriend in real life I feel like I'd be cheating on two people. We tell each other every night we love each other and stuff. I really have feelings for him and I do believe I love him. It's just tough. I don't wanna dump him because I love him. The issue is I don't think me and him will ever meet.

275,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but here goes nothing. 

The backstory:

My best friend of a few years texted me tonight asking if she could come over. I said sure as I wasn’t doing anything else important. When she gets here we go to a local lake to just chill and she breaks down crying. She tells me “I had sex today and I didn’t want to and said no.” then proceeds to tell me the course of events which I will spare here except this was a person she had hung out with before and never had any issues or red flags prior. 

I asked if she wanted to get authorities involved and she said she didn’t have a case (hence why I didn’t go to r/legaladvice) and how she just felt disgusting and guilty (she had just gotten out of a 2+ year long relationship and had a messy breakup). I talked her down a little bit but didn’t really know what all to say so we ended up just going to my house, making food and watching YouTube to distract her mind. 

The question:

Where do I go from here and what more can I do? I offered her what advice I could (get std and pregnancy test) and offered myself if she ever needs anything but whenever I had heard about other friends with their own sexual assault/rape stories it was always in the past not the day of it happening. I feel lost. 

Like I mentioned she just got out of an ugly relationship and on top of that has other issues in her life. I often worry about her mental health and physical health and just want to make sure she’s okay and to be the best friend I can. 

Any advice? Thank you in advance.",16Jul2019,0

So I as approaching his apartment next day, he rolls up in someone else car and he and a new friend are dropped off. Once he saw me it's like I fucked up his day. All he said was ""I really can't hang out right now"". No hello and doesn't introduce me and overall acted cold to me. He handed over  my laptop from inside and I left to my car.

288,"Backstory: 

About a year ago my band decided it would be best to pass social media management to a former member of the band's father. so we handed over the login details and he made himself and no one else admin of the page. This was okay for about a month or so while he was making posts (pretty cringe ones). 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short some shit went down and we decided we didn't want him as our ""manager"" anymore. A role he practically assigned himself and started making important decisions without our consent so we put a stop to it. Since then, I have been the social media guy and its looking healthy but unfortunately he is still the only admin and its really annoying as I can't make new changes to the page that are kind of urgent.

&amp;#x200B;

We have messaged him numerous times as a whole and singularily and he just sees the messages and doesn't reply. What should/Can I do to get our page back peacefully?

290,"Well.. Hey people or who ever decided to read this.
 I actually really just need some advice on how to move forward with my life. With the things you're about to read I suggest you use your own discretion in if this is real or not. 
 I'm a 18 year old who has extreme depression, is very bipolar, low self esteem, dislexic, and having a major life crisis. Many questions may pop up in your head like how are you able to text people at all with those many issues. Well for one I push my self but currently have someone I talk to who guides me but extra guidance is what im looking for because I dont want to overwhelm someone I love and then their motives of advice will be from pitty and sorrow.
Story starts a couple of years back leading to the future in an odd way.
As in some or most (which ever one fits) peoples life their parents are the main struggle in their life and its hard to get past them or even move on without any form of financial help and with the feeling as if they are setting me back on purpose. Now I can't get into full details on my life because well .. Things will be in pieces and out of order thanks to my wonderful memory, but the summary is I felt and now I know I was getting used by both of my parents for their own needs. I have father who when you meet him is very kind but when you get to know him more he gets in this state where now its ok to ask you for ""favors"". This at first became apparent with cornerstores or mini markets where I would be made to ask the owner if we can take something and give them money later which was common for liked people and trustworthy customers which they found me to be not really knowing my dad until he came to the store with me a couple of times. Being the kid I was then I was nervous and didn't want to do it because it felt wrong but again in a black neighborhood things like that are more common than what it should be. So I go off to the store and ask for some things and they said sure wrote what I got on a little note pad and everything and it gets paid off (by me because I felt guilty ). Then one day he goes to the store and ask for a buck load of item equated to a grocery bill and at that time I couldnt pay anything off on my own let alone get what I wanted. Now my family has been on food stamps family first and stuff like that ive been sent out to get food multiple times because mt father didnt want to go out and thought hey maybe its a good idea to send me out there. I thought to my self since my father asked for the stuff I wouldnt be effected. At the time I was living with my mother and twin siblings at the time and needless to say I actually wasnt happy living with her. A black Christian mother is worse to deal with on any day but her it sets a whole new meaning of being fake. Personally I felt like a powerless slave who should be greatful that she even dared shared her food with me let alone give me a room to sleep in I would cry at nights but had to hide most of my emotions because 1. Gender &amp; 2. She didn't approve so emotionally deprived child for most my life and how some disorders came to be and if I'm honest child protective services was brought into my life a couple times over abuse but I was too scared to even stand up against myself and got told by my dad that I had to stand up for my self without coaching how and expecting an emotionally deprived child prone to staying quiet and secluded to figure it out. (This context was far away from plot sorry..) A couple of times I was told to go to the store for her and the guy who works there asked me about some money I had no clue about because my father owed it. My parents are ate that super sour point with each other and she immediately turns me against him for using me to get free things and at the time a little kid was very impressionable and I usually agreeded with whom ever I lived with. Over some time again she ended up paying it because I would get questioned and my father originally asked the guy not to talk to me about it but we can't blame him for money he earned. (At this point I forgot the reason for telling all if this snd where I was going ... Oh nvm I was giving context on how my parents are from then ). Ok so zooming through the future from then more fights between parents court dates me having to spend most my life watching siblings whom ive been forced to watch with no questions asked since their second week being with us. More emotional break downs secretly and mother quits her job for a business she could hardly keep up with and took care of the business before family she couldnt keep with rent I got kicked out of the house she gets evicted and ends up living with me and my dad, dad is obsessed with her all over again and to the day I got into a fight with her over this business... Now this business isnt big but causes a lot of work to be done. Its a cleaning service snd from the start I wasn't happy because I would work school days and struggle but forced to deal with it. So ive dealt with this for years thinking I would get paid what she said she would pay me but only came through when she was in a good mood too. With her being my mother I don't think much of it and would continue to work without pay looking for a new job but no sucess because I was a minor. She starts acting as if im supposed to do those things and help her this that and the other when all I did was help and asked for the little tbh I didn't really mostly because I was scared. Now to the actual current story. One day at work actually The whole week I was treated like crap I had to sit in the back of the van instead of front every question I askes resulted in her giving this are you stupid or something look followed by either no responce or I regret talking to you and I was getting annoied because its late at night and im out here without pay the building we clean was a 2 story  warehouse but gladly we had section that still required some walking distsnce (sweat coin was very useful there ) I had full bottom section which I do pretty well over the years but I forget some things because late nights arent my thing especially after school but she would become up in arms about it while I didnt care much. My section is almost finished but I needed the key so I go up stairs look in the spot where the spare key would be and see it's not there and at this moment im like oh no because this means I have ask her or rather in her mind grase my incompetent being in her view. After looking in other places for it I ended up asking she told me to look in the spot I already looked and im like where with her responce I said look for it in a agravated tone and im already upset because I looked already and it wasn't there when I come back to tell here it wasn't there she get thr keys and throw them at me and at this point im like wtf did I do so I grab the key and storms off but she says stop and I ask what because I didnt do anything to her but ask a question but she states ive been bull shitting all week and making things harder for her when I didnt even ask to work for her in thr first place and when I did I aked for pay that she declined but I still ended up working. She yells at me for a while and then marches up and instinct was the march up too and when I did she said I wish you would and started grabbing me and I grabbed back pulling her away and ended up putting her in a head lock (first time ive ever snapped like that ) I didnt hurt her regardless of her trying to poke out my eyes and sqerming but I let go when she said to let go (after 3 times when deemed she was close to calm than before ) by that time she was till up in flames and kicked me out of thr building and told me to find my way home now I did the estamate and it would hsve been a 7 hour or. Little less walk from where we were so o called my dad and told him what happened and he was like what and told me to go to him which was 2 hours away which yes I walked with thr help of a gps on a lg stylo 2 which atm are crappy phones with unpredictable battery life. I made before my phone died and he gave me thr run down of how I'm not supposed to hit my mother which in mind I actually didnt I didnt even choke her which I could have but didnt she was unmarked and I had redmarks on my face and bite marks from her but his problem is that I can go to jail for doing something like that even if I didnt hurt her but the fact I put my hands on her was enough to send me , and 18 year old boy who doesn't have an id but still in high school, to jail 

Im sorry for thr long story but I need advice on how I should have acted let me know what you think if this is real to you or not and just little support if possible

           He then told me he first came out to his close friend. Who greatly supports him and he says they are basically brothers he fell for him but. His friend wasn’t, he then tells me how his girlfriend got stolen from his “Best friend” and then that dude got his other friends against him and that they kept on telling him to kill himself. And he hurt himself constantly but his close friend stopped that.
           Then he asked me whether or not my family knew. I told him no and that I was scared, nobody knew I was gay. Except him, I did act fruity but my friends thought I did that for fun. Which is true but not the full story. He said it was cute and how it was amazing how I trusted him on this. Which kinda made me blush.
            We then started talking about stuff then it quickly turn in to us talking about doing stuff with guys. I told him nothing much all I did was in high school which was kissing and having give a hand Job. He then tells me he has been top bottom and has sucked dick. He says he loves sucking the tip and teasing and how fucking loves cum in his mouth. I then horny af ask him how it felt to be dominated and he basically tells me he loves being like a toy. He’s only done it once but it felt amazing to him.

As soon as they see my MAGA hat they snicker under their breath and call me racist. One barista even said we don’t serve your kind here. I had to go to the closest gas station to get my coffee from a machine! I pay for it at the counter with money I earned from working 60 hour weeks, feeling proud that it wasn’t a hand out from other working people’s taxes. I go home to my stay at home wife and new born child he’s the cutest and it makes my day to buy him nice things and put money into a college fund for him. I eat dinner and go to bed ready for work the next day. I try again to get my non soy latte only to be met with the same distain. Only this time it was from some woman I just gave 10$ too who said she was homeless holding a sign on the side of the road. Well I said that’s not nice I just gave you money to try and help you how can you call me a racist. She said that’s what my professors at school tell me you are. I said hey mam I’m sorry to hear that but I’m glad you’re in school hopefully you will get back on your feet. She said whatever and don’t assume I’m a woman. Shocked and in disbelief I just decide to go to work. On my way to work I see a black woman drop her groceries in the street. I stop my car and try and help her and she said she would rather starve then eat food my racist hands have touched. I can’t believe my ears what is happing to this world.

301,"I started the process of cutting her off and it hurts pretty bad and is making me feel so much guilt, and I don’t know if I’m just perceiving her as toxic and making a mistake. (Sorry this is long—TL;DR at the bottom.)

But my friendship with her has been exhausting for the entirety of the time I’ve known her, even though I consider her one of my closest friends and have talked to her for hours on end.

However, all this talking has always ever been about her. Her crushes. Her school life. Her friends and family. Her problems, her interests. If I asked her she wouldn’t be able to name more than five of my friends or musical artists I listen to. On the other hand, I know where she was born, raised, when she moved, the names of every friend and crush she’s had, and what happened between them. 

She always forgets things I tell her about my life. She forgot THREE TIMES that I had clinical, diagnosed depression, she doesn’t even know my background except that I live with two siblings and a parent. When I sent her paragraphs about how horrible I felt because of depression, she responded with “just be happy” and “idk how to help.” I know this part isn’t really her fault but it hurt me so bad to realize she didn’t care about me enough to say more than “maybe you should get a therapist.”

I want to tell her all this and probably will, but I know she won’t change. I’ve already hinted at the fact that she only talks about herself and her life and though she did throw out questions for me to answer about how I was doing, her responses were barely a sentence long and forced, full of ‘aww that’s too bad’s and ‘yay I’m happy for you’s. No emotion, just forced empty words. And then I’d feel embarrassed and go right back into asking her questions to answer, which she’d do with sudden vigor and write entire paragraphs for me to respond to.

But she has also told me that she loves me and I am the closest friend she has ever had. The fact that I’m taking this away from her is making me so guilty. But I can’t deal with her problems and be expected to provide advice (when she had problems with her crush she would type out entire paragraphs and would tell me to react to it and would get irritated when my responses weren’t long enough or satisfactory) when I myself am in a fragile state. 

But even after all this I don’t know if I’m making the right decision because should I have tried harder? Should I have just pushed through and told her about what went on in my life, though she was completely uninterested? Also, she’s the only person I feel comfortable with in the entire school and without her, I’d go back to having almost no friends and I’m not sure if my mental state could deal with this.



TL;DR: She never, ever asks about me and when I say something I barely get sentence responses. I know everything about her but she knows nothing about me. She forgets important details about my life and doesn’t care about my wellbeing unless it affects her directly, as in I’m not able to hang out with her or stay up till 2 AM to talk. It’s exhausting but I’m scared of losing one of my only close friends, and with her I’d lose more than half of my mutual friends because I met them through her. Without her I’ll miss out on school dances and football games because I have no one else to go with.",16Jul2019,1
302,"I have known him since I could walk. His wife I'll call Carol and him have been married around 5 years and have 2 wonderful children. They have had some issues before and she has been caught being unfaithful a couple years ago. He was devasted but decided to stay and forgive her. Recently someone close to her, I'll call her susan, was hanging out at my place and drinking and two names come out her mouth. 2 guys. I was a little intoxicated, we both were. But the names stuck and from my memory she said that my friends wife had fucked them and something else about dirty messages she personally saw between them. The things I am struggling with is what I should do. This was a lil while back if I heard her correctly and their marriage seems to finally be getting better. I'm afraid of how my friend would react if I told him directly. Hell I think  Susan even said my friend knows about them but I don't know if I believe that or not. I really don't know what to do. I've contemplated telling him directly, telling her that I know and giving her the option to tell him, sneding an anonomous letter to him, confronting the guys who were mentioned and give them an altimatum to come clean to them, even thought of talking to Susan and getting a sober run down or even telling Susan that she has to talk to Carol about me knowing.. I just don't know what to do. It's eating me up. Any advice would be awesome. Thanks",16Jul2019,1

304,"So, I am a 17 year old girl, and my parents divorced 7 years ago, my mom found emails my dad was sending to another woman the day before valentine's day. So two months after that me, my brother and my granny and mom, went to FL  for my brother's Marching Band trip to Disney. When we got back he was gone, he took off to Georgia with his new wife. Before we knew of the affair he took advantage of my mother, my Mom has a history of seizures, she had surgery when I was a baby to remove the tumor that was causing it, my granny had to convince him to let her have the surgery. years later when our hot water tanks broke, he forced my mom to walk up and down the stairs with boiled water so we could take baths, even though we had a perfect spare water tank, Then he said that he was going to redo my room, he never did, he tore up my room, and made me sleep on the couch, but when he wanted to watch boxing or a movie, he forced me to sleep on the loveseat, He would also beat me and my brother, he was caught slapping me by my grandpa, who told him to never do that again, that's when i was 7, then back to the divorce, in divorce court he consistently lied about Mom, saying she abused her prescription seizure pills, saying she was a junkie, he called my sweet Mawmaw a bitch outside of court. so post-divorce he didn't see his mom (Meemaw) when she died from pancreatic cancer, he lied about coming to my school's Veteran's Day event, saying his car broke down, and when my brother almost died twice from a burst appendix, when he was in physical therapy as he had been in a two month coma from it, regaining muscle, Dad tried to visit with his whore wife, my Mawmaw saw this and called security, Mom pulled the phone on his bedside table out of the wall and threw the cord out of the window, as Dad tried to call, and I tried and tried again to talk to him but he lies so much and i want to figure this out before i move from OH to NYC after i graduate.",16Jul2019,1
305,"My grandparents have had these dogs for quite some time now, about 6-7 years from what I can remember. One was a Christmas gift (Sharpei) and the other was found roaming the streets by my uncle who left it at their home (Weiner dog mix). These dogs aren’t kept in horrible conditions, they’re fed and have their own space in the backyard which is relatively clean, but haven’t been in the outside world much. They’re not good with other dogs (even fight with each other when there’s too much excitement) or people for that matter and not house broken since they rarely come inside. Due to my grandparents age they can not take them for walks, bathe them, play with them, etc, they just sit in the backyard for days on end. I live out of town so when I come in to visit I make sure I do the things mentioned above but it breaks my heart to see them live the way they do. I’ve talked to them about trying to find them new homes but can’t seem to get through to grandpa who is the main caretaker. I can’t take them since I have 2 dogs of my own and my landlord won’t allow anymore pets. Is there anything anyone can recommend to helping these dogs out? I understand it might not be the kindest thing to take their animals away from them but they’re not being taken care of in the way an animal should imo. Thank you for reading!",16Jul2019,1

Everything about our relationship is great since we both been on the same page of commitment. One thing about this guy is really triggering. He always asks irrelevant annoying questions. Half of the time i know it's just reassuring questions but it's starting to get really irritating. I notice when i hang around his family his mom gets pretty frustrated with hin as well. I just need someone to tell me this is normal and how to handle it. Lol please.,16Jul2019,1
307,"I have a 13 yr old daughter who is very responsible for her age, and can be trusted to be left alone for a few hours a day while I work. There is a park &amp; public pool not far from our house. I allow my daughter to walk to the pool with her friends. I don’t even have to ask, she will call me when she gets to the pool, when she is leaving the pool, park or wherever she is going. I have GPS on our phones as well. I can see where she is &amp; she can see where I am. We live in a pretty safe neighborhood, but I’ve had conversations about paying attention to surroundings &amp; if anything or anyone seems “off” we have steps to follow. now my daughter has a friend, we’ll call her Lily. Well ever since the summer started, I noticed Lily has been over my house quite often, and my daughter &amp; Lily get along great. The first couple days Lily was over I fed her lunch &amp; dinner, since I was feeding my daughter &amp; the girls were having fun hanging out so I didn’t mind. Well every day since school ended, little Lily has been coming to our house around 11am and the girls will hang out at the house or walk to the pool or go to the library, ride bikes, etc .I feed this child lunch &amp; dinner. I’ve paid for both girls to go to the pool &amp; this past Friday my daughter asked if Lily could sleep over. I said “no” because I had work that night &amp; didn’t feel comfortable having Lily at the house if I wasn’t there (accidents can happen) I also told Lily that I needed her mother’s number in case of any emergencies etc , Lily stated “I don’t know my Mom’s phone number” 😐 hmm 🤔 I thought that was pretty odd because I made sure my daughter remembered my number in case of an emergency by time she was 3 . I told her “well next time, before you come over give you Mom my number and have her text me please” she agrees, then walks home. I get a call an hour later from my daughter she says “Lily just came back over, can she stay until you get home? Please! We want to watch a movie”...I was hesitant but then agreed, I would be home in a little over an hour so I said it would be ok. I get home. My daughter is sleeping. I go to pull up her blanket and kiss her on her cheek &amp; I notice another lump under the blanket 😲 this little girl Lily is fast asleep at my house 😐 I wake up my daughter &amp; Lily and they said they fell asleep watching the movie. I say “ok, well time to bring Lily home! Let’s get ready, I will drop her off” (it’s about 940pm) we get ready, get in car, I drive to Lily’s house, lights are off &amp; it looks like no one is home 🤷🏻‍♀️ I Ring Bell, no answer 😐 I knock on door, no answer...Lily doesn’t know her mom’s number soooo I leave a note at door with my number explaining Lily is at my house, and tell her to call me when she gets message. Lily ends up spending the night 🙄...I feed her breakfast 🥞 🍳 ... girls want to go to pool again, I drop them at pool. my daughter calls me around 1pm says they are hungry, I pick them up &amp; feed them lunch 🥗 🍔...after lunch they decide to give each other makeovers (do hair, nails etc) I’m still wondering why this child’s mother has not contacted me. I tell the girls I’m running down street to get some milk &amp; since Lily’s house is right by the corner store, I stop there again. I bang on door, ring bell...FINALLY a young woman answers the door in her bathrobe, hair all messy like she just woke up (it’s now 2:30) THIS is Lily’s mother 😠 I introduce myself &amp; she says “oh hi 👋 thanks for taking her last night, I really needed a night out! It’s been forever! “ I give her this blank stare 😐 she says “is Lily in the car?” I said “no. She’s still at my house, girls are giving each other makeovers...I’m assuming you didn’t get my message? (I point to note still stuck to her door) she says “ohhh no I didn’t I’m sorry!” .. I said “well while I’m here, let me get your number, this way I can reach you in case of an emergency” she agrees, I text her from mine so she has it. ..I explained that I didn’t plan on having her daughter spend the night. She says “oh Lily told me she was invited over” ...I said “uh huh...but you didn’t speak to me, are you not concerned about where or who your 13 yr old daughter was? You’re lucky she was safe at my house, but you don’t even know what house I live in and didn’t have my number, I’m not going to interfere with your parenting, but in the future, please confirm these things with me before you take off for another ladies night, ok?” ... she apologizes for the “misunderstanding” and I tell her I will bring her daughter home after dinner around 5:30. .,which I did..fast forward to yesterday..my daughter is at my mother’s house &amp; I am on way home from my part time job. My phone rings, it’s Lily’s mom. I ignore it because I’m driving....rings again..I ignore...again...still ignoring 🤷🏻‍♀️...finally she texts me “Hi 👋 I’m looking for Lily” ... I ignore the text. Another one comes in “she was supposed to be home at 5” (it’s 935) ..”is she at your house?”! I ignored her messages until this morning...AITA? I was trying to prove a point",16Jul2019,909
308,"We were both drunk when it happened. No intercourse took place, but there were a few kisses and some sensual touching. I apologized to her today for my inappropriate behavior since she is married and I am her supervisor. She apologized too.

Is there anything else I should do? Should I tell my manager or HRBP? The more I think about it, the worse I feel (guilty, angry, confused, sad). I work in a call center environment so rumors move fast, should I try to get out in front of them (as far as management is concerned)?",16Jul2019,1
309,"I’m a graphic designer, mainly worked on UI/UX and branding for 3 years after I graduated in 2015. I quit 6 months ago when I turned 29 and I haven’t been doing anything since.

I saved up enough money in those 3 years to live around 10 years without having a job, so right now, not getting paid for 6 months, or a year or two, isn’t really an issue, I’m more concerned about my morale and what I’m doing with my life.

So yeah, I’ll be 30 in a few months, and I’ve been hanging out for the past 6 months, seeing a few friends, traveling a little bit, but mainly watching Netflix, reading mangas and playing Nintendo. The first 4 months I was fine with this, but now I’m starting to feel like I should be doing something with my life.

A note: I have been pretty much depressed for the past 2 years and it’s not really getting any better honestly, so anytime I start looking for a job (the last month) it makes me really unhappy, as I don’t want to get a job or hats going to be stressful and be in an environment I don’t like. I don’t think I can take a design job right now and have big responsibilities...

So hI at I’m trying to say is what can I do to improve my morale if I don’t want a full time hardcore job in my field?

Im already working out, cycling and running and eating healthy, so I at least am healthier when I finish this little « no work » break of mine, I already lost 30 pounds in 3 months, I was 240 pounds (6’5 tall man) now around 210.

Should I keep just hanging out if that makes me happy in a way because I’m not really stressed? Should I look for an actual job to build my career? (I also have the pressure, that everyone around me has a career and is getting promoted etc. And that a lot of people I know are either getting married or having kids, and I don’t have a girlfriend even... so this really doesn’t help with my depression, and in turn, doesn’t make it easy to actually meet a girl). Should I maybe try to find an easier job, not in my field, maybe part time or working at a café or something, just so I have something to do (not for the money)? If anyone has suggestions of what little job I can do without having a degree please tell me (I live in Paris)...

Anyways, I know my thoughts are a little all over the place and I jump from one to another but I hope you guys were able to follow.

I’m just lost, depressed, lonely. What can I do to improve my life...

Thanks for anyone reading",16Jul2019,2
310,"So for some context the girl I want to ask out works in the same place as me but a different position so I don't see her a lot. Thankfully, she does know me and we talk and whenever we do we're just messing with each other, but she is like that with everyone she talks to so I'm not looking too deep into that. One day I decided that someday this week is gonna be it, I'm gonna ask her out, but I have no idea what to say when or anything lol.

Here's some additional info that may or not be helpful:

One time she pulled me aside with some coworkers and asked me ""If someone asks you out for coffee is that just being friendly or is he interested?"" to which I replied that I do think that if someone asks you out for coffee and it's a guy that yeah he's into you most definitely, to which she just said ""dammit.""

313,"Hey,

I‘m a student and my dream has always been to work in academic research, get my PhD, hopefully become a prof. 
But now I’m seriously wondering why I am doing this. I like my course and I like my job as a research assistant. But what am I really doing this for? It’s so stressful. I should work and study a lot, instead I just stay in my bed and drink. I have no motivation to do study anymore, which I used to enjoy. What’s the point of all this hard work? Why should I speak three languages, be interested in politics? What kind of life is it to get up, study, work, get drunk and black out? I don’t get to enjoy the sunset or time with friends and family. I’ve stopped caring about uni. 
Tbh I was in Portugal in a small fishing village and I’ve been thinking about their lives. Mine is so fast-paced, stressful, full of responsibilities and only about performance. Lately I’ve been getting worse grades because I just don’t want to study anymore. I want to live a more slow life as a fisher for example. The funny thing is, when I talked with these Portuguese fishers, they pretty much wanted to live my life. But even if I got my PhD, what’d be the point in it? Everything is too much effort for me. People tell me I waste my potential but do they know how exhausting it is?

324,"For context, I'm a high schooler, &amp; my friend group consists of 2-3 folks whom I've known for years, along with a few more whom I've met during high school. 

Theres this one person whom Ive known for before HS who's kinda mercurial. Sometimes, he'll be a great friend, and the next minute, it'll get really toxic. He's somehow gotten anyone new I've managed to befriend in HS to hate me, and just like him, it can be on and off, at his whim. 

Sometimes they'll be cool, other times, dicks. Its like a gang mentality in a way. Like I'll make a joke or something, and then immediately it would be greeted with a comment like ""shut the fuck up, youre not funny, followed by a personal attack on my appearance or athletic ability."" 

I seriously cannot think of one way I have slighted them, or any reason that could warrant this treatment. And Im really conflicted bc these are ppl that I've enjoyed spending time with and vice versa, when they arent like this that is. And believe me, ive tried mingling with other folks but there just isnt that synergy. 

Being in the latter part of high school now, Im beginning to question if engaging in friendships is worthwhile at all, especially when my presence isnt welcome half the time. With school starting in the following month, Im thinking if I should just not speak to them, e.g not showing up to hangout spots during lunch, or cutting off all verbal communication, which is something Ive tried before. Usually its at this time that they behave friendly again. But soon enough, they fall back into the cycle.  

I really havent the slightest clue as to why they do this to me. Ive asked them why they hate me on a few occasions, all times met with a sardonic remark that leaves me with no way to counter. 

I really am dumbfounded. What do I do? What can I do?",16Jul2019,1
325,"I have a friend who I went to high school with, and now we go to the same college, but she's one year above me and recently graduated. We have a very big campus (35k+ students) so it's not too common to run into people, and in 3 years I've run into her maybe 4-5 times and usually we just wave (depending on how far away) or we stop and say hi in passing/on the way to class and hug and say something like ""it was good seeing you, see you soon"" etc etc

One week ago we saw each other at the store and started talking about her living situation and what's going on in our lives, what we've been up to and so on. We talked on the way to the self-checkout and I ended up walking with her to her apartment which was near by and after I went inside, we talked on the couch for about another approximately 2 hours. I played with her dog while we talked about food, life, some of my personal stuff, her roommate/living situation, tattoos (and she showed me how she has a hidden tattoo that she hasn't told her parents about), about changing majors in college, about past times in high school, and other stuff.

On the way out we hugged a couple times, I told her how I appreciated how accepting she was, and then she said, ""you're welcome anytime."" And then she told me the number part of the address which I forgot lol (I still know how to get there though). A couple days later I messaged her and wished her luck on her exam and told her the same, that she was welcome to come over if she's ever in the area, and verbatim she said, ""you're welcome anytime !""

Mind you that was the first time that I'd ever hung out with her and we don't/won't have any classes together which is why it's been a bit more difficult for me to discern whether her offer was an honest one, or more of a formality. For starters I don't know if, to begin with, I was being overbearing by walking with her to her apartment, but since we were talking, I just kept walking with her and then we ended up at her door. 

She's honestly one of the sweetest and most genuine people that I know and she's the type of person where the conversation just comes naturally. I didn't even realize it'd been 2 hours when I was leaving. I just want to go back a couple times before she leaves in a month and a half (since she just graduated) and just talk about random stuff. She's just someone that I genuinely enjoyed talking to and would like to talk to again before she leaves.



She told me that her food situation is tight because of her living/rent situation due to stuff that happened with people who were splitting rent with her. ~~So would it be overbearing if maybe in a few days or a week or so I asked if it was okay to go over, and then offered to like take over some food of her choice like burgers or Chipotle?

328,"Hey everyone so bare with me as I try to put my thoughts into words. 

Basically I started this new job position in May with the same dept I’ve been with for over 3years. Government agency ok place to work. Well I left my last position and accepted this overnight position because I thought hey less office politics and drama. At my old job I was the only guy on a team of 13 women so the gossip and drama got tiring. 

I was excited to start this new position that pays more but the hours have taken some getting adjusting too. Midnight-8am but it’s fine now. I’ve been here since may. Work with a team of four guys. One of those guys started a day after me. 

Everything’s going fine for the first few weeks but the new guy that started a day after me began to show some issues I picked up on. He would always need to try to be in charge, go after your work to “check” etc. and a horrible obvious kiss ass to the supervisor.  I ignored this and have been trying to for the most part. One of the other employees came to me and verified that he was seeing the same behavior. Me and him work on sundays together alone which will be important later. 

We work with print production and manage batch print jobs which is super slow some nights. Even the older employees said he doesn’t know why the supervisor hired two extra people when they barely have any work to do. 

So let’s start with the issues. The new guy is a fucking slob and aggravating. Speaks to you while you have in your headphones just randomly blurts our stuff and does this weird chuckle thing even though u have no idea what he’s talking about. He takes up four of the work stations (2are the print production software) with his tablet stand and various food. He burps and farts out loud. Have videos of him diggin his nose etc.Just aggravating all around. Having a convo with him he will try to argue with u or be a smartass about anything.  

Anyways he likes to be mighty man even though he is severely obese and stinky. One weekend we were working alone he tried to maneuver a pallet jack alone with bundles of paper and fell and yelled for me to help knows nothing about it. He changed the printing trays on some printers which fucked up a lot of jobs but the supervisor thinks it was the software smh. 

. My issue is the supervisor is riding my case heavy due to things said by this guy. Supervisor came to us after the tray issue and was like “never on theshelf” probably got bored and changed some stuff haha” when it was him. He literally fucked it up. 

I’m not the one to throw out their racist cards but it’s starting to seem like it. Supervisor and new guy used to be in the military. (Idk how new guy was being this big and out of shape but hey) 
 
I asked new guy one day the password to one of the stations (it was on a sheet next to the station I didn’t know) instead of him just saying hey it’s on this sheet he typed it for me and went to the supervisor and I guess made a statement about me not knowing the password. Supervisor came to me and was like me and “fatfuck” we’re talking and this Sunday I want u to open everything up. I was like ok and did it. 

Anyways aside from that the older employee who’s been here just pulled me outside and was like the supervisor came up to me and was like he’s always on his phone. Uhhh yeah because I can’t even check my email at a workstation because Lard ass. He even said something about where I charge my phone at lol. “Like I’m hiding something” older employee also said that fat fuck came to him and basically called me lazy etc. if I see two people already loading prepping the printers why would I fight for room to do what u are already doing?

My question  is when the supervisor comes in should I just flood gate everything? Would this make me seem bitter even though I’m being attacked? Or should I just start being more assertive?",16Jul2019,1
329,"Day 9 of a 15 day vacation to see family, and I get a series of messages from the cat sitter. They start off weirdly alarming - she’d like to take the cat to the vet as she’s getting “so thin.” She can’t tell me if the cat has eaten only a little or not at all in the last two days, and she keeps emphasizing that she wasn’t interested in the “cooked chicken and other cat food” she tried to give her - without checking with me, who could’ve told her she’d have no interest in either.  It’s weirdly difficult to get straight answers from her; I’m trying to identify changes in her habits and she’s just speaking to things my cat never really does. I can tell she’s trying to be helpful but she seems overwhelmed and is giving only piecemeal replies. Ultimately, cat is still drinking and peeing and moving around like normal, so I figure it’s an abandonment hunger strike and we’ll keep an eye on the situation. (It took her a few days to even tolerate the sitter cause, y’know. Cats.)

Then she sends me a video, titled “watch her breathing.” For two days, she’s been breathing in short breaths that jerk her stomach. Of all the things to not mention...

I try not to freak out - it’s the middle of the night for me, and I don’t trust my judgement. I wake up a family member and have them watch the video. They’re half asleep, brush me off. I ask them to text a family friend to check on her in a few hours, and ask the sitter to come back in the morning. I email a vet hospital down the road for advice. There’s only so much I can do. The sitter did say she was still moving around like normal... 

Welp, the family friend never replied. No one replied to my FB post asking for help, either. It’s the middle of the night and the vet by my house is now closed until 8 AM — having had a technician review the videos and say she should definitely come in for her breathing. The cat sitter will need to bus over, find the cat carrier in our disaster garage because I forgot to set it out, and somehow wrangle my cat into it before setting off. I feel helpless and worried and like I can’t advocate for my kitty. I’m scared of the costs, as well, but it’s difficult to think of that when the whole situation feels so surreal. 

Considering the sitter’s poor communication skills, how do I stay involved as things develop? Should I call the vet? Email? What kind of information should I give, or ask for? My cat has never been ill before - no medication - still very spry for her age. Any thoughts on what I can expect? How worried should I be...",16Jul2019,1

339,"tl;dr — How smooth/fluid is the name ""Casey Jonathan-LaVae [Last Name]""?

I need some outside opinions. As a transgender individual, I'm coming to a point where I have the chance to change my name legally. 

I'm fortunate enough to have supportive parents where I'm able to talk with them freely on the subject. Since they were the ones who originally named me, I feel as if I owe them some say in what my name is changed to. This, of course, would be a say as to my middle name's change. 

My middle name currently was in honor of my late grandmother, a name my mother had passed on in her family and she then passed on to me. As for my dad, he gave me my birth (first) name, which—rather than push it to my middle name—I would like to replace. 

In a conversation I had with him earlier yesterday afternoon, he commented that ""second place"" for what my name would be was ""Jonathan"". In short, I'd like that to be hyphenated with my current middle name, so both of my parents still have a part of my name that they ""designed"", so to speak. 

Both names that would be/that would stay my middle name are meaningful to both of my parents, having their respective backstories, and I am more than willing to have this as my full name (meaning I'm not doing this because I feel like I am pressured to have my parent's permission on what my name should and should not be). 

Which begs the question: How smooth/fluid is the name ""Casey Jonathan-LaVae [Last Name]""?",16Jul2019,1

345,"So I am ( M20) and I am currently in final year of my bachelor's degree.
So there was a girl that I liked in our University and I was pretty sure that she liked me too cause whenever we used to see each other there was something dazzling chemistry going on between us and we would always steal glances At each other whenever we were in cafeteria or library.
And I assumed she must be in 2nd year or a fresher.
This happened in the 3rd Sem of my College.

Fast forward 4 months I didn't see her in college or cafeteria.

And then one day during my final term exams I was studying in the library and suddenly she enters the library and our eyes meet and Time just froze for me.
Everything just stopped around me .
At that moment it was just me and her smiling and happy.
At that moment I decided to go and talk to her .
So I gathered enough courage (I'm shy and introvert) and went and started an conversation with her.
 We exchanged names and what we were studying (I'm an Advertising Student and she was studying Design) and I told her that I'm in 2nd year and then came the literal bombshell that has broken my heart in pieces.
She told me"" Hi I'm Rima* (name changed) and she's a final year student of design and she's just graduated last week and has come to return the library books that she borrowed.

346,"My husband and I have been married for over two years now and we live in an extended family home including his grandparents, parents, and siblings. I feel like my relationship is getting more abusive and I’m not sure I have enough to leave.

My husband has struck me twice - once drunk and once sober. This was off the back of his mother saying that I was an issue. Soon after he apologised and said it was his mother’s fault and wouldn’t happen again.
Since the beginning of our marriage we have had a rocky relationship, with him even beginning our honeymoon by saying he was pressured into marrying me and now he’s stuck. This then spiralled into emotionally hurtful words such as being ‘a failure of a wife’ because I (as a vegetarian my entire life) would not clean cut and cook meat dishes.

The turning point for me has been when his mother slapped me as ‘I wasn’t doing enough around the house’ and ‘I have been the problem since day 1’. This happened in May.

I’ve since told my husband that I am extremely upset and hurt and would like to move out. I understand that me and him have problems but I also feel like the additional pressure of his parents stop us from even trying to work on our marriage. I’ve given him a “deadline” of December - I think 7 months is more than enough time to get everything in order or at-least in place.

351,"Backstory: 

I (16) met this girl (17) in 9th grade because we were assigned seats next to each other in one of my classes. Throughout the year we started to talk more and more and by the end I developed a crush on her. She felt comfortable around me/talking to me and I felt the same. 

This ended when 10th grade came around. I didn’t have any classes with her and rarely saw her. Near the end of the school year I saw her in the halls a couple times but we didn’t even say hi because it had been such a long time. 

Now it’s 11th grade and she’s in one of my classes. I still rarely talk to her because of the way the seats are arranged (we sit next to our friends) but when we do she starts the conversation.

Here is a list of what has come up during class:

*keep in mind this is a quiet girl*

-She asked me about a class assignment while she was sitting next to her friends. It struck me as odd because her friends could have easily answered the question but instead she asked me just because we were assigned as partners.

-One day, the seating was arranged differently for some reason, with desk partners. When I came in, my friends were already paired up so I sat in an empty pair in front of them. Then she walks in. Her friends are all paired up as well, so she sits in the back of the class at first. Someone says she should move up to an open seat farther towards the front, and that was the seat next to me. As she walks up, she whispers to her friends “now I have to sit next to ___(me)” and her friends giggle. Then she sits down, says hi to me and smiles. At first it was kind of awkward, but then the ice broke and we were having comfortable conversations. To me it seemed weird since we haven’t talked in almost two years. This seating only lasted one more day. 

-This to me is the most interesting. One time, the class was split into groups (I was not in her group). Because of how desks were arranged, groups sat close together. I sat down in my group, and she sat in her group, but next to me. As the class was coming to an end, I was finishing up the assignment when out of the blue, she starts a conversation with me. She told me that when she was talking to our old teacher (the class where we sat next to each other), he said that he remembers that she and I chose to “sit next to each other like- every day.”   I laughed and said that he assigned those seats. She agreed and said “I was having flashbacks of when we joked around about him in the back of the room.” 

-She mentioned (to me) how we sat next to each other in our 9th grade class on an earlier occasion (I forgot the specifics). 

The next things confuse me though... 

-To walk out of class she has to walk by me (it always takes me a while to pack up), but instead she chooses an obviously longer path. It seems like she’s almost avoiding me? 

-She literally NEVER looks at me. Almost like avoiding again?

-We rarely talk. 

Now there is a small chance that she found out about my feelings that I had for her in 9th grade. Would that explain something? 

I’ve come up with three possibilities: 

-She is shy but likes me.
-She is interested in being friends again but nothing more. 
-She just wants to tease me (if my feelings were leaked). 

Which one of these seems to be the case?

TL;DR- I met a girl two years ago, became good friends but then lost contact. Now we are in the same class but don’t talk often. Not sure about her feelings based on her behavior.",16Jul2019,1

  Around two years after the split I met a girl who I fell in love with. She also has a child from another relationship. After around 6 months of being with each other I introduced my kids to her and vice versa. Everyone gets along great.

  Around two years in to the relationship she became pregnant so we planned on moving in together but finding a house was a bit of a problem because all of the houses in the area were 1 or 2 bedroom. So for now i stay with her 4 nights and at mine 3 nights when I have my kids over.

  The part I need advice with is now that we have found a potential house when I move in she wants me to cut the time with my kids to one night. I don't think that is fair on them. I have told her how I feel  about it and she has given me an ultimatum, either cut them down to one night or we break up.
I asked what about school holidays and such and she has said it still has to be one night. I asked her why it has to be like that and she said because it's not fair on her. She will have two kids of her own and four is too much for her and she is sacrificing one night for me to have them so I should sacrifice the two nights for her.

  I don't agree with her and feel like I've lost o bit of respect for her after all this. I just feel a bit lost at the moment and don't know what to do. I can't do that to my kids.",16Jul2019,1
375,"Lately I've come into a bit of a difficult situation at work. For a bit of background I started working with my boss three years ago when he was just a sole trader by helping him out with emails, documents etc. We grew very close and began to grow a business together. Now there's 6 core members of the team and I'm seen as the 'manager' with my boss being more a salesman. I talk to every member of the team individually, handle clients directly and keep on top of work we need to complete as a team. My boss recognises the work and commitment I've put in and very much values me as his equal at the top of the hierarchy.

At the start of the year we took on a young lad on a year off from uni to help us with social media for us and our clients. He's quite a cool, urban guy and generally we get on well. Because we don't have an office we all have work phones that the company pays for, initially this guy declined as he'd just purchased a new personal phone, then phoned me a few days later to ask for a new phone. This did annoy me somewhat, but as his main focus was social media, it made sense for him to have two phones.

The main issue started to come in when he was asking to accompany my boss to London more and more for work meetings, our boss is usually quite extravagant with work clients on meals and drinks so will of course take any team member with him for a nice lunch and a few drinks, but if my boss is running late and asks if the guy can get lunch by himself, he'll say he's not hungry and just wants a sandwich. The other people who work for us have realised that this young guy enjoys a day off work to go to London and have posh food and free drinks while most of us when invited will say no because we have important work to finish.

After all this the lad has come back and asked if he can be paid more money, which, given he's to date not made us any money, we've said not at the moment to. I just feel like something should be said as we're a very small company and we don't have that much money to pay for his weekly trips to London. Should I say something to him or am I just overthinking things?",16Jul2019,2
377,"It is not really dropping out, as I would get an apprenticeship instead, but that’s what is commonly referred to as. I am halfway through grade 11 (think 16 &amp; 17 year olds) and  only this year have I thought about dropping. I have started to not enjoy the school lifestyle. FYI, I have plenty of friends, I don’t get bullied, and my grades aren’t horrible (B’s/C’s with 1 or two A’s). I am finding the pressure and workload is becoming too much for me to handle. I believe I would prefer to study for 2 days (to get my certification) and work the rest as it would be more relaxed and I would have more freedom.

Because he's so far away, we've had two opportunities to go on a date but I keep bailing due to anxiety and we set a provisional date for this weekend and I'm thinking of bailing again because of anxiety and making up a stupid excuse. I hate myself for it because he's everything I wanted and I never thought anyone would be interested in me like that.

380,"My folks have worked in education all their lives. My dad retired a few years ago and essentially had to take over the frail care of my Grandfather who suffers dementia - this completely eliminated his lump sum payout - he now has a monthly pension, almost a 10th of what he used to earn.

My mom retired a few months ago, so now both of them are living off a severely reduced income. I wondered if there was any good advice I could offer to them?

I feel like encouraging them to sell the house and pay off the mortgage is a good start. Maybe they could find a smaller retirement estate and use the house income to set up there?

They have two cars, one is a decade old SUV. It's paid off, but it is a drain in terms of upkeep, and a gas guzzling monster. Perhaps they could sell that? Pay off the second vehicle.

I'm worried that advising them to liquefy their assets is not a good idea given their old age, is that a pitfall of retirement?

The girl will be moving out of town in less than two months and my friend told me they made a mutual decision to break up so they have no strong ties when they are apart. I find this method particularly dumb because he is seeing her every day and plans to do so until she leaves. 


I tried talking to him and convince him to find a better method but as mentioned he has a mental capacity of a high schooler. The girl is clingy and is one of those people that gets jealous when you don’t give her much attention for 10 seconds. 

My question is, why are they spending so much time together even if they will eventually break up? Are they hoping to get back together in the future so they think it’s a smart idea to let out a long leash? 

PS. The girl cheated on her ex to be with him because he is “rich” and baby sits her 24/7 smh. She gave me a bad impression right from the get go. It’s why I wanted to discuss with him about ending things earlier to prevent further damage.",16Jul2019,1

386,"As the title implies I've done some really dumb stuff...the main ones being I smoked weed a few times and did some drinking. All well and good except for the fact that I just turned 16. Both experiences were pretty awful, especially the weed as I was anxious and was having auditory hallucinations throughout. Ever since that I've definitely been a bit off, I've never really been the guy that everyone looks up to cause he's always happy but I've also never felt really down for long periods of time either.

Lately I've definitely been feeling more anxious and the joy from everything has kinda faded. I don't really enjoy doing much and I've realised that my friends aren't really that great to talk to. I have no-one I would really feel comfortable talking to except for maybe my older brother (19) who's gone through this and moved on to become the great person he is today. However I still wouldn't feel comfortable enough to talk to him about my mental state and where I'm headed.

392,"So, I was vacationing with my parents, I went to sleep after a day of sun and beach, and then they knock at my door and tell me that one of our neighbours just called, and our house was burgled. 

They busted the door, took the tvs, consoles, laptops, headphones,  speakers, the sheets of our beds and, apparently, a box of Kinders delice from the fridge.

Honestly, I'm more surprised that it took so long for this to happen considering the kind of neighbourhood we live at. Through the years we've been robbed time and again, sometimes even in front of our house, they've took cars, electronics and a lot of other things from us, but this is the first time they ENTER our house while we're away and take everything from us. I'm not even talking about the material stuff, but about my sense of security inside my own home.

For me, this honestly is the straw that broke the camel's back, but I'm not so sure about my parents. For some reason they've never considered moving somewhere else, even though our actual house is in an awful zone, we've experienced awful things, and I know the burden of moving is something that wouldn't be so difficult (economically speaking) for them.

397,"So not too long ago, a few of my closest friends brought up the idea of going away together. Unlike the others, I wasn’t prepared to do this. I was helping out a cousin with his business, but this was very sporadic work and was certainly not enough to cover the costs. So initially I declined the offer. 

The following day, they tried to get a 4th person to hop on board and join them, but they couldn’t find a 4th, so they came back to me. They sweet talked me, hit me with the “we will pay for you, then you can just pay us back when you can”. I can’t reiterate how much I HATE this, but no matter what excuse I have, they wouldn’t take it. They wanted me there, or wanted me to be the 4th so they could go, who knows.

Anyway, eventually I caved in. Why, I do not know. Shortly after they booked everything, I broke my right hand. To the point where my 4th metacarpal needed surgery in order to be used again. Consequently this put me out of work with my cousin. So things got bad. The worst case scenario of me not being in employment whilst carrying the burden of the holiday on my shoulders, was looking likely. 

I tried multiple options, considered signing on to the job center to receive a Jobseeker’s Allowance however that would interfere with the housing benefit that my mum receives (she’s a single parent). I’ve applied for a range of jobs, gone through interview processes but I’ve fallen short. 

Now I must point out that my friends are supportive, during this whole time they have been looking out for me and have stuck to the “you can pay it back whenever you can” agreement. And so because of this, they’ve said that not to worry about the payment for the holiday, instead to focus on getting spending money together.

So now I am in a predicament. We leave on the 21st, and I have nothing to my name. I have resorted to selling things I own, but even then that’s not guaranteed. I have looked into Universal Credit but according to the gov website, the funds take up to 5 weeks to go into your account. I am still exploring and going through with that option because it will help me out afterwards, just not now. I have a family friend who runs an employment agency and he has found a job for me, I am going in tomorrow to discuss the details. 

But as of right now, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what my options are, I need advice.",16Jul2019,0

Forgive the formatting since I'm on my phone but I'm pissed that I have 2 offers on the table (one is from a corporate company while the other is from a startup which has established itself for quite a time now) and both my parents always say that the salary is low. I'm actually fine with the startup's offer because it has extra allowances for food and transportation while I'm on probationary period and other more allowances + benefits will be provided once I'm considered as a regular employee.

Admittedly, the amount isn't enough for me to say that I can fully sustain myself but it's good enough to cover some expenses to start things off. I've tried asking if the basic salary could be increased but was told it was their baseline salary for new hires (fresh graduates like me). Again, my parents think it's too low but it's actually the average you can get here. I dont know if they think that it's actually possible to easily get a higher pay because expenses are increases - but no, its almost close to impossible unless I guess you have good experience and background.

I don't know what to do because I've been trying to explain that reality to them - and it seems like they want me to look for a job in the corporate setting because benefits are supposedly better (though it's not always true btw - the corporate offer was just basic pay almost the same as the startup's offer but has 10hrs working when regular is 8, and has no other allowances). I know people will always say that it's my choice in the end but it's also hard when the people around you don't really support you.

I realised that it's a very hard industry to break into and I never had the true passion for it.

But in high school, that changed because I realized that if I wanted to be comfortable in my later life, I needed to go to college and start a career. My family has been pushing me pretty much my whole life to go to college because they want me the best for me. I hate to sound conceited or stuck up, but I was accepted into a very competitive university and I definitely feel the pressure. 

I am on the road to pre-med, and am probably aiming to go to med school. 

But I want love- medical school takes years, and although I want to be a successful person, deep down I just am not patient enough. Life is too short. 

I fall in love too easily because of this. It is my biggest downfall. I am afraid of dying alone with no one, and ending up in a Citizen Kane scenario- *successful, but lonely.*

I was not only his sister also his friend and like second mother.One day while playing he saw my cleavage and said sister I want to drink your milk.Because he had seen our mom  breast feeding our third younger sister.But he is afraid of mom.I just laughed what is said as he was a kid.I said I had no milk.He cried at that.And then I breast feed him.After that he got obsessed with that till she 15.But after that he himself left that habit and began to concentrate on his studies.He respects me a lot more than our parents.I am married now and had a son.Whenever I breast feed baby he left the room.Only one question am I wrong that that time.If I had not done that my brother could have lost his teenage and and studies and carrier either he was a kid.but my decision had made him  a successful man.he is 28 now and I am 32.My whole family knows this.Because either it is a baby a child or a man once realise a women's breast he get obsessed with it.",16Jul2019,0

An A-tractor is like a car but for people under 18 where I live. They aren't as fast and cant have more than 2 seats. But you can drive them if you are 15+. Which I am. My parents never liked the idea of me having one of those or a motorbike. Since they think they are dangerous. But yesterday I managed to convince them that they are safe as long as you get a safe one. I can agree that some are not safe and really not suitable for minors. But my argument was that we just have to buy one that is safe or make it safe. After a pretty long talk, they were convinced that it's pretty handy to have one. Also could be a good learning experience for me. 

Now, this is what I need advice with. My sister told me that they planned to ask me to choose between selling my PC to get an A-tractor or to keep my PC. They still haven't asked me this, but I can imagine it will end up not in my favor. It's a lose lose situation here. What do I do now? How do I avoid this from happening, I'm not gonna choose between my PC and an A-tractor. How do I convince them otherwise? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I want an A-tractor. Parents agree but I have to sell my PC. I don't wanna sell it since its unreasonable to do so.",16Jul2019,1

423,"I won’t go into all details because it’s long and complicated but short story, my mom and I moved to a different state in 2013 and due to some circumstances, my grandmother moved in with us after 2 years... and she’s still living with us.

For the past 5 years, her things have been in a storage facility and in the past 5 years she has done next to nothing about it. She trys to pay that storage every month but I do not believe she is giving it her all. 

I believe this because she comes home at LEAST 4 days a week with something she brought from the store with the claim of her “buying things to decorate for when she moves out”. Or “buying these things make me happy.”

This shopping habit of hers has gotten so bad that she has completely filled my room with different things she’s bought in the past 5 years. She has a rented garage where we live where the majority of the stuff in there are things she’s bought for an apartment she doesn’t have yet. Mind you, we live in a 2 bedroom apartment. After almost a year of all 3 of us living together, my mother gave me her room while she’s taking up sleeping on the couch due to my grandmother constantly complaining about sleeping on the couch, it being too noisy in the living room, etc. 

She does not make a lot of money, she’s working at a minimum wage job just as I do, so I have no idea where her mindset is to keep spending the amount of money she does. Especially since she doesn’t bother to buy groceries. How can you justify coming home and buying whatever the fuck kind of table set from your job but won’t even bother to buy food every once in a while that you eat everyday?

Whenever we bring up her storage or tell her she has a spending problem it’s met with “I can do whatever I want with my money.” or “it’s not about what I need, it’s about what I want.”

Honestly, I’m at my wits end. I already have enough shit going on with my life and this is just the icing on the cake. She texted me this morning asking me to pick up 2 things for her at my job. They’re completely cosmetic things that she absolutely 100% does. NOT. need.

She comes back to us and explains how she goes thrifting and that everything she buys is usually clearance or she got it for a great deal but the way we and literally everyone else in the family sees it, these things she buys are absolutely nonessential. She complains about nobody helping her with her storage and how much of a setback it is but I truly believe no one bothers to give her money towards it because of the fear of her turning around and spending it on yet more furniture for a nonexistent apartment.

She is not that old yet, she still has her wits about her, but for the love of god I truly do think she’s delusional. Sorry to say, I didn’t realize she was like this before she moved in with us. I love her but it’s absolutely grating to watch her buy all of this shit and come back like she’s the victim.

Neither of us thought she would be here for as long as she is and if I’m going to be honest, it seems as if she’s not leaving anytime soon.

I have not replied to her text from this morning yet, and I seriously don’t want to because I feel like that would just be enabling her. She has a serious shopping habit. She always has, but now it’s affecting 2 people in the household and it has been for the past few years so I really just don’t know how to broach this situation.

427,"Hello, I'm a 20 year old guy and I have no clue how a condom is supposed to fit and feel like.

I bought the standard EU size of 52mm first, but I'm not able to roll them down completely (There is always condom left, because my dick is not as long as the whole condom), but on the other side they are so tight that they leave a red mark where at the ""root"" of my penis, the widest part.

So now I bought XXL condoms with the size of 62mm, but they are 20cm long. I don't have a 20cm dick, my dick is about 14 to 15cm long.

Will this still fit ? Are you even supposed to roll it down completely ?

And so far I always had the problem that the condom sucks itself onto my dick after a while if that makes sense. Kinda like if there was a vacuum, and that shit hurts and I always have to change the condom mid-sex, which isn't nice. Could that have been caused by the tightness of the condom ? I watched 100 of videos on how to put condoms on correctly, and I swear to god I'm doing everything right.

428,"I rent an apartment in Georgia. It's been great so far, but now that it's summer there's a huge problem with people using the pool late at night. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a night swim as much as anyone, but this is way beyond that. There are loud groups out there every single night for the past few weeks from about 2 AM till sometimes 4:30 AM. Unfortunately for me, the pool is right outside my bedroom. Also unfortunately for me, I have to be up for work at 6:30 every day. So, this has been an enormous pain in the ass. I'm not sleeping well and it's starting to impact my work and general well being.

The pool is supposed to be open only from dawn to dusk. The landlord did send out a letter reminding people of this, but otherwise has done nothing. I try to politely ask folks to quiet down, but that doesn't always work and I don't think I should be expected to do that nightly at 3 am. Cops say they can't even ask people to leave unless the landlord is there to give them permission since it's private property.

What can I do to deal with this? I don't care if people swim, but I do want to be able to get a full night's sleep in my own apartment.

First post ever here.. sry for my spelling i learned french in school and english through coding so it is a bit weird.

&amp;#x200B;

We where friends since we were born.. we lived in the same village and were out everyday.

In school he was a nerd like me but I tried to hide it.

I was an asshole to him\*  so I could be one of the ""cool"" kids 

\*I smashed his head against a wall because he talked sht about me ( he was joking but yea.. ) lucky for him he had ""only"" a minor concussion.

I could still kms for what I have done to him. Normally I was one of the frendliest person and never harmed anyone before.

No one liked him until 7th/8th grade then he got kinda popular for whatever reason.

Karma hit me like a truck and i suffered from depression ( private reasons ) and switched schools many times until I was 17 and then just quit without a graduation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm 19 almost 20 have no friends outside from the internet and my parents spend me a subscription for ILS ( correspondence course ) I even fuck that up because of my depression but still I try my best to do it.

I wasn't outside to do something social for 3 years 

I help my dad with his company so I see the sun every other day so dont worry about my health.

In my freetime ( I have alot of freetime as you would guess ) I code private cheats for cs:go, ow and a bunch of other popular games so i can get some money. //dont butcher me for that pls 

&amp;#x200B;

But now I think alot about my old best friend i just miss him and if I could I would change everything but I cant so I need your advice what I can try to reunite with him.

\- I know where he life

\- Can easily get his number

\- He tried many times even after the sht i have done to him to be my friend again

\- I feel way to ashamed so I need to get rid of that first I guess

&amp;#x200B;

Yes I visited a psycholist many times but I couldnt open me fully to him  so he canceled the sessions. 

No I dont suffer from anything else than depression. 

Yes I'm a loser

Yes Ive almost fucked up my whole life but I try my best to change it.

I had several real IQ tests which came out way above the average I'm in the \~10% field and to know that doesnt help at all.. my father is very intelligent and he made it through life like it was riding a bike and I just dont get it why I do so many things wrong.

We all have that one person at a school, college etc. who never seems to be interested in what you do, their only interest is what you can do for them. I can give some examples:

People who use you for entertainment :

-they only talk to you if their friends are not around or if they are bored. They dont ask how you feel or what you are doing outside school. They also try to avoid you if they are with their friends.

People who use you for an advantage :

-They only talk with you if they need something or need you to do something for them (example: homework). They also do not care what you do or what you feel.

Well, how do you deal with these people, especially if they are in your year/class? Do you just avoid them? Do you try block them? Do you try to talk things out?

432,"Hey all,

My wife and I took a one night stay in a hotel last night. The hotel has a $250 deep cleaning fee if you smoke in the room.

My wife and I don't smoke. When we got to the room, there was a heavy smell of cleaning supplies, and the carpet was slightly damp like it had just been cleaned. The smell went away pretty quickly, so we didn't think much of it.

I woke up this morning to use the toilet, and I noticed a VERY strong smoking smell in the bathroom. I think it's either remnants from a previous customer or it's coming through the vent from another room.

I want to tell the manager or desk staff about the smell because I don't want to be saddled with the deep cleaning fee. My wife thinks the smell isn't that strong (I'm bewildered by this) and thinks we should just ignore it and hope for the best.

435,"I (19f) have a friend group, one of which includes four of us including myself. We’d hang out a lot, organise stuff on our group chat. I’ve recently fallen out with one of the girls in it - another completely different story I really don’t have the energy to go through. She cut me out because of something I’ve said on Reddit about her that she saw when she was stalking my account. I said something about us drifting and how I’ve grown indifferent towards that now and I’m happy for her at a distance, and she decided to completely blank me in person and through contact on social media, and I was left feeling really awful and confused about her behaviour for weeks, only to find out that it was because of something I said that wasn’t even rude or degrading nor did it justify such rudeness from her. I thought the whole thing was immature so I’ve ignored it since and have tried to get to a point where I’m comfortable being around her again, her and I were best friends for years, and it sucked a lot for me when she just became indifferent towards our friendship this year for whatever reason. 

I can see they’re all together on the Snapchat feature snapmaps, I just feel pathetic. I’m almost 20 and I’m sitting around crying about high school shit. I just feel like an absolute loser and I’m so incredibly hurt that none of the other two even thought to say anything to me that they’re going out. As recent as last week, on our group chat we all chatted about meeting up altogether as four of us including me, and now that they’ve sneakily gone without me without even asking really hurts because I was under the impression that the girl I had issues with was okay with hanging out with me in a group still, and I even made it clear on the chat that I’d be keen to see everyone. It just makes me feel very lonely, I don’t have many friends, and the ones I did have hate me now, and the others are happy to go out in a group and not even tell me. 

I’ve pretty much spent the last hour balling my eyes out. I’m feeling incredibly hurt and confused too, I had my suspicions that they went out without me last week but I asked one of the girls in the group whether they did or not and she said they didn’t, which honestly was a big relief for me. But I know they did today and can’t help but feel absolutely stupid. 

My mum isn’t home at the moment, she’s someone I vent to and talk to about everything going wrong. So I’m just sitting alone crying my eyes out overthinking and beating myself up because what if I just brought this on myself, but deep down I know I don’t deserve to go through this. I just really need some kind words/advice through this because I probably have never felt more lonely in my life as I do tonight, and Reddit is a favourite place for me to get some advice.

Last october my mom had to quit her job because her boss sexually assaulted her at work. It was very emotional, tough thing for us to deal with as a family, but were getting thought it. When that happened I stepped up and started paying all the bills for the house. I'm 25 making $14 an hour, so supporting her my sister and It has been tough but you gotta do what you gotta do. 

Fast forward to today. My mother still doesn't have a job and it's really starting to get to me. I've drained my entire savings trying to pay rent, utilities, feed the family, and car expenses. Shes worked in chiropractic most of her life so shes trying to stay in that field and make as much as she was but I keep telling her she needs to expand her options and accept less pay. We got into an argument last night because it's really stressing me out and I told her just to go an effing job at McDonalds. Any money is better than no money. Am I wrong to expect that of her?

I'm pushing so hard for her to get a job, I got her a job application at the hospital but she won't quit smoking cigarettes long enough to get the job. I've set up appointments at job placement services for her but she doesn't go. I've destroyed my credit and have 0 dollars to my name because I can't support a family on this pay. I feel like I'm doing everything to try to keep this family afloat and shes doing nothing. I'm almost to the point where I'm about to say screw it and leave and let her handle her problems, but I feel like I can't leave my mother and autistic sister in a situation like that because they're family.

Germany -  cheaper option (by quite a bit), in a smaller town (not as much to do), includes a NYE trip to Berlin, the actual unit looks a bit boring and more intense,

Spain - more expensive, in Barcelona (more to do), more interesting unit, more difficult and expensive to get there from Scandinavia,  will not be as cold (I am Australian and I’ve never been in snow before). 

Thanks for any advice",16Jul2019,5
446,"I'm kinda at a loss for what to do...
My younger brother (lets call him Craig) is 16 and is extremely violent and aggressive towards everyone in the house, im a 21y/o female (im much smaller than he is both in height and weight) who lives at home still, and next to him i have two other siblings (a younger sister and brother, both younger than Craig) .

He was diagnosed with ADHD and ODD (and possibly has depression but thats just a guess here) and he acts out when he doesn't get his way.
My mother works a lot to support our family, shes a lot smaller than he is and hes gotten increasingly more violent towards her to the point of leaving bruises. I'm afraid one day he'll cause serious damage.
He's destroyed the house before, smashing anything he can get his hands on as well as literally kicking the babygate off its hinges and putting his fist through a kitchen stool. He's smashed game systems more times than i can count.. 

My mother is afraid Craig will hurt someone while she's at work, and with good reason as he's pulled knives on me before when he was younger, but i don't think he'd be stupid enough to try something like that now (hopefully at least!)

He's only gotten violent with me once that was intentional, but he's hurt the two younger sibs before and caused my father to get a (admittedly pretty badass-looking) facial scar...

Everyone walks on eggshells around him for fear of setting him off, and im not sure what to do anymore. (I'm afraid to leave the house when he acts up, and moving out isnt really an option for me at the moment due to some mental health issues)

We've had the cops intervene before but they usually give him a warning and leave, my mother usually defends his actions and he just gets off with a talking to about respect. It drives me crazy, he has no repercussions or consequences for anything. My mother gives in to anything he asks for because if she says no he flies into a rage and hurts people..

Im not sure if theres anything I can actually do, he's on medication right now but isnt taking it as regularly as he should, and his sleep schedule is complete havoc.. 
My mom is terrified of him but won't do anything to get out of this situation, and honestly its putting everyone else at risk.. 

Any advice would be super helpful.",16Jul2019,10
447,"I was raised in a financially instable household and my biggest fear is not being able to live a financially comfortable life.

As I get older I am realising that life is tougher than I'd even imagine and I need to be more realistic. I have come to terms on not being able to afford to go to medschool and my perspective in life has been changed drastically. Not to sound cliche but my goal now is to make money and lots of it. I want to be rich. It is extremely personal to me because of the situations in which I grew up in and the current state of my family. 

I've always been interested in economics and I know that it can lead to financial jobs, banking etc. However I've heard that it is kinda a useless degree unless I pursue a masters (which i don't mind but probably won't afford to do immediately).  I want to be able to earn well enough to support myself from a Bachelors degree until I can afford to do a masters. I've been looking into alternatives and landed on a finance, accounting &amp; management degree where I will be CPA, ACCA, CIMA and ICAEW recognized. Does doing this sound better than an economics degree? 

I just need your honest opinions. All the problems my family and I have faced has been because of lack of money and now that I am old enough to understand I want to put an end to this.",16Jul2019,1

After the help I said I really am thankful for you helping me. She said no problem sweety, and before you go do you want to earn extra credit? I said sure. But she said she will tell me about the extra credit later because she had to go coach the cheer team. Then I went to my gym teacher (female) because I had to see if I made it to the football team. She said ill tell you know and we went to the girls lockerroom because she had to look over the papers. So we were in there and she went to her office for a good 5min. Then out of nowhere my math teacher cuts from the back of the lockerroom. She was suprised to see me in the girls l.r. and she was standing there in just her hot bra and sexy thong. She thought i snuck in so i said no ms. (not saying gym teachers name) brought me in here shes in the back. She walked up to me and she said your lucky theres cheer or i would- then my gym teacher walks back in. (my math teacher is miss and gym is ms) So ms. said theres no cheer today... then miss said i need to show jake a punishment for coming in here. ms. said he brought me in so it was ok. then miss said how about u help me punish jake. we walked in the back of the lockerroom and ms stripped to her bra and thong.i had my math teacher with her amazing big rack and big thick butt and my gym teacher with her averege rack and round bubble butt. they both got naked then they pulled my pants down. then we had sex. after that they said we should do this again.

452,"I have a 2nd job where i work part time as a front desk receptionist. I've been there for almost 1 year and I get along with all my co-workers there. We joke, chit chat, make convo, and most importantly we help each other out. I typically get along with most people in general.

They hired a new (full time) person to work the front desk with me (2 people are supposed to be assigned there). She's been there for 3 months now.

This new person ignores me most of the time unless she encounters an issue with something work related that i did. She doesn't even call me by my name, but instead sorta ""leans over and talks in my direction"" or taps near my desk. In the beginning i used to say good morning and good bye, she would never initiate it, and i tried to break the ice a couple of times but i stopped after i realized shes very cold and wooden/robotic when communicating with me specifically. As a matter of fact, im going to refer to her as 'Robot' for duration of this post, since that how she chooses to act with me.

Robot is the total opposite with everyone else, including the coworkers I've been getting along with since day 1. She will chit chat, joke with them, discuss her life, etc. And they get along with her.

When i returned from a 2 week vacation, the boss told me they changed the checking-in process for appointments/cases. Apparently Robot is responsible for assigning the cases to our colleagues in the back office. Meaning she has a list on *her* desk of who gets what next and Im supposed to follow along.

So i was doing just that. Last week i guess she got annoyed (?) And told me i could just look in my computer to find out who is next to get what by counting how many cases are assigned to each associate at a given time.

And i was doing just that up until yesterday when she asked why i assigned someone a case when it wasn't that person's turn to get one. I reminded her what she taught me last week and she said but you still have to go by the *order* of the paper list on her desk. 

Things got more weird with her as the day went on. I went by her stupid list and assigned someone a case. Not 1 min later, she asks me why I didn't assign that case to anyone. I coldly replied I just did and ignored her. She said nothing. Then there was a couple times where she didn't 'update' her list and she blamed me for skipping people on the list. Well how the **** am I supposed to know? Im being forced to rely on YOU in order to do my job! Thats what i felt like saying but didn't :)

Before i left, One of the back office associates came over to chit chat and jokingly said ""i thought you guys were trying to punish me earlier lol i had like 5 cases at once"".

Instead of addressing the issue directly to me when I'm sitting less than 2 ft away, Robot decides to tell our colleague that it's because i am doing it incorrectly and she ""doesn't know what's going on with me"".

At this point my blood was beginning to boil but i didn't wanna be unprofessional. So i firmly replied, for everyone nearby to hear, ""what do you mean exactly?"" She paused before repeating the same thing, about me doing it incorrectly. I reminded her she told me to go by her list but she said no its supposed to be her list *and* the computer, which makes zero sense. I asked if she could explain what she means by that. She didnt reply. So i left it at that.

Any advice on how i should handle this? And any idea why she might be acting like this towards me but treating everyone the opposite? My wife thinks maybe she is intimidated by me for some strange reason(?)",16Jul2019,1
453,"So I recently posted this in relationships but I wanted to post it somewhere else to get some other feedback. Everyone who replied on my other post was very helpful, so thank you to everyone who has helped. My Dad and I for as long as I can remember had issues but still got along when we were not arguing. Growing up he would hit me on the arms and spank me etc. but it was not just spanking. I am 21 now. I would be threatened to have the shit beat out of me, threatened have my head bashed against the wall, he would smack me on the leg hit me grab me whatever which definitely caused me to be more angry with him as I grew up. We would always get into arguments whether it was my fault or not him and my Mom and him would blame me for ""starting it"" even if I was not the one who caused it. My Dad I am confident has ADHD so I don't know if this is what causes him to have such a short fuse or if it was his fathers upbringing because I know his Dad hit him for a fact, probably even abusive to todays standards. He would tell me that I made him hit me and that I caused it and he never wanted to do it. I am in college and still live with them. They have done a lot for me and I am grateful, but occasionally we disagree. Tonight we were about to watch a movie and I was like ""guys don't look at my password since its my password for everything"" my Dad continued to look which I know is not the worst thing in the world but I was like ""can you please look away"" and he goes ""I don't care about your password I am not remembering it"" with an attitude like he was getting annoyed and I can tell when he is starting to get pissy, which led me to just say ""Okay okay its fine can we just not lead to an argument"" WHICH IS ME TRYING TO NOT GET INTO A FIGHT WITH HIM but then he has to start his tantrum ""you are the one who is arguing"" because he has to make it known that he is right and I am not.I went onto say ""why do we have to do this?!?!"" I am pretty sure he said again something along the lines of ""you are the one doing it"" and then I raised my voice and said ""why do we have to do this, you literally do not know when to stop. I said lets stop arguing and you didn't leave it"" Maybe I am the cause of part of this argument, I don't know, but the issue is that all of the blame is thrown on me even if he was wrong too . I am in a serious relationship with my boyfriend and am at his apartment very often and if I ever had to move out I would be able to live with him, I am there very often. I love my parents, I REALLY love my Mom which is why it is so upsetting that I have to go through these arguments, especially when she wants to take his side. My father has never hit my mother, he has never been a wife beater etc. he even talks down about people who do this, however I guess he felt it was ""alright"" to hit me because it can be passed off as ""discipline."" The anger in how he acted definitely was not discipline, it was a result of being plain angry.He however can have his huge asshole moments and I have seen him be a dick to my Mom, which could be seen as verbal abuse or something probably,  on so many occasions. Example: My Mom states ""I saw a guy speeding on ice slipping everywhere"" his response ""Well yeah, because he likes doing that shit?"" You could tell he was in a mood and had to act that way as a result of it, which leads me to believe he may have other mental issues such as a mood disorder or just something that makes him susceptible to getting mad over stupid shit and acting like a complete asshole. I would find myself thinking about how much I hated my Dad at moments when I was in middle school and highschool to the point where I could not even focus. I had a sister who passed away when I was 10 years old, she would be 23 now, 2.5 years older than me, I would love for her to be here because I feel like she would feel the same as me.  If I was not living with them I would go see them often. I am going to try my best to get along as best as I can until college is over with and I have a better/good job but can someone please help me here because I don't know what the fuck is the problem.

EDIT: The hitting and threatening stopped by the time I was like 16. I would have preferred that it did not go on at all or at least that long, but it ended mostly. Our relationship feels much more healthy now that I do not have to deal with that shit anymore.

TL;DR: My Dad and I argue a lot but he and my Mom place all the blame on me. (It would be way more helpful if you read the whole post).",16Jul2019,1

456,"Ok I've been talking to a really pretty girl at my school for a while now. I asked her to prom and she said yes! The holidays came round and we messaged each other for 2 weeks straight.

Last week, while I was at work, my mom took my 90y/o grandma out to lunch (who is also visiting from Mexico). My grandma tripped on a folded carpet in a restaurant and broke her hip.

My mom has been suffering and under tons of stress as we were planning on moving out of our house this week and she’s had to put everything on hold. She needs help and she’s asked me repeatedly to stay home. 

I’ve been extremely torn on whether or not to call in sick on Sunday or not. I was thinking about asking coworkers to switch shifts for then, but the schedules only come out every week so it’s hard to ask a coworker with such short notice.

459,"Preface: Parents paying a lot for kid's colleges has become a lot more common. Here's an article from Poets&amp;Quants about parents paying for their kids's MBAs. https://poetsandquants.com/2014/09/06/more-parents-paying-for-their-kids-mbas/

Background: Asian parents make ~ 300k and highly value education, want to make sure my older sibling and I get a good start. 

Both my older sibling and I were at the top of our high school with 99% SAT score. Our parents said we had to go to grad school since a bachelors degree now has become so common now (They have 3 masters degrees combined). Because of this, we both decided to go to our cheap state flagship instead of prestigious expensive private schools (200k cost difference). We didn't want to pay 250k for undergrad and then another 150k for grad school.

My older sibling is now at med school and parents are paying for most, maybe all of it. I am planning on getting my MBA at a top school, but it will be after I work for 4-5 years. My parents said they would pay for my grad school when my older sibling joined med school. However, my situation is a little different as I will already have a stable job and good income while my older sibling literally has $0/

What should I expect to happen when I go get my MBA? I will probably be around 26-27. Should I let/expect my parents to pay for it? I'll be a young adult by then but it would be fairer for them to pay for mine as well and it would barely affect their retirement date.",16Jul2019,1

We have so much in common, from the exact same taste in music and movies to the same sense of humor.

Now, both of my parents were in the military. My mom was in the coast guard and my dad was a master sergeant in the corps for 20 years, so a big chunk of my life my dad was deployed. A week ago, I got high and finally told him I liked him cause I thought it was weird he hadn't asked me to be his girlfriend after weeks of going on dates and kissing. Then, he told me he doesnt want any long-term relationships because of boot camp. I freaked out, started crying, and asked him why he asked me out in the first place. He said he doesnt know.

They text lots of people and are sending the same pictures.  This person behind the account knows where I work and has been keeping a close eye on me for a while now, I imagine. More than fifteen people have contacted me letting me know that someone is making fake accounts of me. With consent, I made a tinder of my brother-in-law in hopes of matching with the fake account of me. Yesterday I discovered that they are sending pornographic videos to people and claiming to be me. I have always taken this issue with a grain of salt but lately I truly feel I am in danger. I also feel that this could ruin any potential professional career I choose to pursue. I have already reported the fake Snapchat. I have tried to get the catfish to meet up with someone but that obviously has not worked. I have contacted Nev and Max from MTV Catfish to see if they can try to help figure out who is behind these accounts and put an end to it. I have no idea what to do next. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",16Jul2019,6

473,"So, bit of a long story. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started my current career 10 years ago, roughly seven years working for companies/in positions. My longest tenure was with a company for five years, that job wore me down and burnt me out on the job. I got made redundant in the end and had to find a new company to work for. I did and have been here coming on two months now, and I honestly want to quit but feel like if I did so, I'd be chickening out.

&amp;#x200B;

My new goal (I think) is moving into a programming role, have been self teaching at home when I get time, but there is little time for me with a job. I am doing okay, so I feel it is something I want to pursue a fair bit. There is also no scope for me to progress within that career path with the new company, so that's an annoying factor. Onto why I want to quit: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- The new company are very badly run, like no processes at all, and missing a lot of the basics that other companies use that make everything run smoother. I'm trying to put new stuff into place but I'm getting a lot of push back and people saying no. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I feel no connection to the people, the company or the product - it's just a job for me right now, with a commute and expenses to travel to work every day.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I feel fed up with the job role in general - I had hoped a change of company may reinvigorate me, but so far it's just made me feel worse. Tired, fed up and not looking forward to going to work, kind hating my job. Equivalent to working retail for me.

&amp;#x200B;

\- some of the people I have to work with are very stubborn and degrading to my role as a department. I feel like I'm looked down upon by them. Others are rude and strict at times 

&amp;#x200B;

\- My direct boss himself said he doesn't care about the job as he doesn't need it, he's just doing it to try and structure them. Hearing your own boss say he doesn't care doesn't fill me with confidence for the company either. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I also worry that I may not be able to do the job as well as they want, which makes me feel uneasy everyday. I feel like a fraud, impostor syndrome.

&amp;#x200B;

\- there is very little work for me to do at times, nothing is ready for me and the work I am doing is getting pushed back as a ""we can't do that"" or  ""no you can't do that"", etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My current thinking is to quit, take a year off and self teach programming, try to find myself again and work out what I do want to do with my life and what makes me happy, as I honestly haven't felt happy in a long time. Yet, I feel like I have no valid reason to give for quitting, other than ""I don't like it"" which is a weak excuse, feels like I'm just running away from my problems. I don't want to annoy the company either by leaving them, but I don't know why I care as I will likely never see them again and I can't see it impacting my career going forward. 

I also want to value my happiness. But other people have been here far longer and can endure the company and the difficult employees fine, so I feel like a weak person to run away so soon into my employment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel scared to leave and pursue my new career path, as if I fail to self teach myself a new skill and change careers, I may find it harder to go back to my current role after a year out of work. I fear the unknown, I fear the failure, but also fear being stuck in a role I hate and a company I hate. 

 I  am fortunately in a good place financially, as I don't need to worry about being out of work as I live with parents and don't need an income at the moment, I can get by on savings, etc. But I don't know what is the right thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Current: I just graduated college and started working full-time. I am married and have a 5 year old son. Up until this point I have always made it a point to be there for my son any time he needs. Even previous jobs I have been fortunate enough to take off if needed.  


My company does a retreat for newly graduated engineers every year and this year it'll be in LA which I would have to fly too.  I'd have to fly out there for 3-4 days, but if I do I will miss my son's orientation and first day of Kindergarten.  I was there for him for his first day of Pre-K so I've already had the"" first day of school"" experience, but I'd hate to miss this first day also.  My company has stated in emails that attendance is mandatory.

More info: This retreat is a part of the engineering training program in the company.  I have been working with the company full-time as an intern for two years. My skill and knowledge is well above what the program itself teaches so most of the classes and things they teach are irrelevant to me at this point. I don't feel its necessary to go. I have a really good rapport with my local office and most of the people here are my friends so it wouldn't really be weird for me to be asking for time off (I have 60 hrs of PTO from intern time anyways) . Also, it wouldn't be up to my local office on whether I go or not. It is up to corporate to make the final decisions.

480,"Well this is something I never thought would happen. 19 M.

You know that episode of black mirror ""shut up and dance""?

That situation basically is happening to me right now. I've decided to sit and do nothing about it but I'd really like to start/have a conversation here about predators like this.

Here's what happened:

I have pretty bad insomnia sometimes and I for whatever reason could not sleep tonight. At about 4:30 am I got a phone notification for a match on the app ""badoo"" (which can go screw itself). I had a conversation with the girl who seemed somewhat normal about why we were up late, etc. It seemed super normal, I've had conversations like this before. I even checked facebook and instagram for this person's social media and they exist and do live in a city near me. So I thought ""screw it I can't sleep, I'll talk to this person"".

Now we'll see all the lovely red flags my sleep deprived horny dumbass should have stepped around. The first being the match asking ""if I live alone"".

Basically, they did the classic ""let's video chat"" crap that you will commonly see instagram porn bots do. When I realized this was a scam, I thought it would be funny to try and bait them and screw around with them. However, I am a dumbass.

So I said ""what's your snap"" like a normal human being. They replied that they use google hangouts because they deleted snapchat. That was a dead give away that this is a scam, because who the hell uses google hangouts. But I still decided to screw around with it, since I am used to the person asking for you to pay for some site, etc. where I assume they pull a bunch of money from your card. This was a new one.

They asked to face time and I assumed it wouldn't happen, but they actually called me and had a face.

Now I understand that it is super easy to take footage and make it look like your calling that person, which I could tell because of the cuts that would occasionally happen.

However my dumbass thought ""what if this is a real person"". Like seriously.

So the predator tries to get all sexty with me, and me thinking that I am smart try talking with them. They basically just used footage I'm guessing from some cam site, since they got pretty frisky. I remained shirtless and they kept asking to see my member.

Now I've seen black mirror's ""shut up and dance"" and did not want to be put in a black mirror situation. However for some stupid reason I wanted to try and bait the person, see if I could get them to run out of footage, or something like that.

I had a shirt on and was in my underwear. I decided to flash my underwear to see what would happen. Unfortunately I did have an erection (any sort of sexual stimulation at 5 am will do that to you) and was holding on to my member. Sorry for these awful descriptions but I don't know how to describe this stupid situation.

Basically the ""girl"" started texting me to take it off, etc. Which made me again very suspicious, so I ended the call. A conversation ensued where I tried getting the person to prove some realness by saying a word or touching their elbow, etc. They did the classic ""how could you think I am a scam"" thing that scams do.

I told them that I've seen that black mirror episode ""shut up and dance"" and wasn't going to expose myself to a 50 year old man on the internet. I thought I was pretty funny.

Thennn they sent me a picture of a video of my underwear boner stroking footage and a list of all my family and extended relative's facebook contacts.

This is one of the worst feelings I've felt in a very very long time. Like holy crap I haven't felt an actual stomach drop in awhile.

Basically they wanted 100 bucks via paypal. I told them I would work on it then sat to think while they called me over and over again. I ended up just blocking them. If I paid them (and I did consider paying them) they'd just ask for more which is pretty reasonable to think.

So right now it's 8 am, I have no idea if my relatives have received this video or not and I haven't slept and I'm writing this post as a way to vent and because I wanted to talk about the pieces of shit that do this.

If this person does send this video, my reputation is tarnished. However, I remained clothed. Now there are plenty of kids, and especially teenagers that I'm sure have fallen for this in a much more drastic way. In fact I read about a young teen suicide who died as a result of freaking out over a super similar situation. So I'm coming to terms with the fact that this is one of the worst things that you can do to someone over the internet.

It's not like a tech support scam or something. They are giving you the choice of being humiliated or giving them money, with zero guarantees of what might happen.

&amp;#x200B;

 You are getting your life fucked with in a way that makes me furious.

490,"I'll start first with a bit of context. About 8 years ago my single mother and I moved into a new house. The neighbour was living there with his ex and daughter for a while but they moved to Australia shortly after we arrived. My mother got into a relationship with the neighbour and he moved into our house while he rented his out. They planned to move to Australia together so my mother quit her job, got her Australian visa and sold her house and we moved into his.

 This is where the problems begins. Me and my mother went to stay in a holiday cottage while he done some work to his house before selling it. This is when he found out I'd accidentally burnt a couple cigarette holes in the carpet of my room. He went absolutely bat shit and said to her I was never aloud to stay in his house again, and after my mother stuck up for me he said the same for her and that he'd be going to Australia on his own. This was 4 days ago and I've not seen or spoken to him since. I know I really should have apologized by now but he was incredibly angry according to my mother and I don't think he would have been willing to hear it.
 
So now I'm not sure what the plan is. How should I apologise? If he doesn't accept it what should we do? Even if everything settles and they move to Australia together I can't be certain they'll stay together. We don't have a home and my mother has no job and already has her visa. She wants to live close to me, which wouldn't be bad if she went to Australia alone as I plan on moving to New Zealand. However I feel pretty awful as she'll be living in a foreign country all alone.

492,"* **My childhood:** A little emotional blackmail, forcing their views, saw my brother get beaten a few times (I got hit only once in my life, but so vigorously that the giant wooden spoon broke – when I was about 12 – for hiding a bad grade and using computer too long), them lying, me not telling truth in order not to get criticized.
* **Extremely short background**: I'm from Eastern Europe and live here. I moved out 120 miles (200km) away and was quite happy with my gf. I study and attend job interviews, she works. Never really told my parents that they were terrible. And they don't know it, surely.
* **What's happening:** A child arrived for my brother and his wife. I respect them and wish them the best, but they're searching for a godfather. Now, here in my country it's a little different than in US probably – all you need to know is that there's a multitude of Catholic rituals and preparations, and giving them presents in the future – I don't want to take part in that, for my own good and for child's good. (The g-father must also promise with an oath to bring up the child Catholically – not planning that)

My brother (whom I respect and wish him well) didn't even ask me yet, but yesterday mom called and told me about it. After i told I don't want it, she freaked out (""GOD..."", ""Why are you so anti-this?"", ""But they will be sad"", ""It's just some"").  My points didn't reach her, like she was deaf:

* I'm not gonna make an oath and all rituals on this child (I respect them if they want),
* I'm not gonna buy him expensive presents (this is actually a HUGE assumption here in my region)
* I'm not ready to take a role like that,
* I just don't want.
* Honestly, I just don't want to see them for now. I feel free without their shit. (I didn't tell them this one)

Now I'm alienated away from the family. They are religious and my mom, dad and Sis think I'm some Satan or what. They're probably gossiping about me (like they always do about others) ""too much internet and big cities"". All of a sudden, my achievements, getting to best school and everything is invisible. I'm a bad person. Brother still doesn't know, they forbade me to tell him yet cause they don't want him to be sad. Sis probably understands but is too blinded by family.

First, I understand that not all women are the same and none of you would truly know what this girl thinks.

I really like this girl, I think she's super pretty and she's really really sweet. I would love to be able to become closer to her and eventually date her in the future. I have known her since high school. After high school, she moved across the country. Anyways, I wanted to know if you guys think that she might be interested in me or is just simply being really nice. I'll list out all the things that has happened between us so I can get some accurate opinions :)

&amp;#x200B;

\- I am a programmer. There was one time where I created a program to help complete a lengthy assignment back in high school. I posted it on Twitter. She later tweeted to her thousand followers something along the lines of ""When @\[myhandle\] makes a program to do most of your homework!! \[happy emojis\]"". She never really tagged people in her tweets, they consisted mostly of how she was feeling or what she was doing

\- I released an app on the app store and (without me asking) she tweeted a screenshot of my app and told everybody to download it

\- When we graduated high school, she messaged me on Twitter ""You are a talented and genuine soul. I hope to see you do great things in the future!""  
\- 1 year after graduation, she sends me a facebook friend request. She just made a new facebook and added me, while ditching her old one. This new one didnt have as many friends as her old one either.

\- A few months ago, she messages me on Facebook and says ""Hi! Was just thinking about you!! You’re probably doing great things, hope you’re doing well!"". I havent spoken or interacted with her since high school graduation btw.

&amp;#x200B;

We've talked during high school for a little bit. We got to know each other and she was super friendly to me in person and online. I've never made any move towards her to indicate that I'd be interested in a relationship with her either.

Do you think that she might be interested in me? Or is she just super nice? I would like to get to know her better. I do plan on talking to her more in the future too, but I am way too nervous to do that right now. I'd also like to note that she's probably the prettiest girl I've ever seen. She's been the really popular girl in high school, while I was the complete opposite. She's definitely out of my league.

&amp;#x200B;

I've sort of come to realize that my self-esteem is very heavily reliant on being sexualized and objectified. Only recently did I actually admit to myself that I'm maybe kind of smart. I desperately need male attention and sex to have any sort of confidence or self value. I've been single for a few months and it makes me feel incredibly unwanted and like I have no value. No matter what my friends tell me, it doesn't help.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my job and sometimes I feel like I'm good at it, but once I leave work it doesn't matter. I work out and people are impressed by what I post on instagram, but I only really feel good about myself if a guy says something. I get upset if I didn't get a photo or video that is good enough to post on SM. I can't stand my friends talking about their happy relationships because I get so jealous. ""I'm the hot one, why can't I be happy like her? What am I doing wrong?"" kind of stuff. It's come to the point I avoid some of them because I know how upset I'll get.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently deleted my dating apps and instagram, hoping that those would help me branch away from that kind of unhealthy validation and maybe find a healthier way to feel good about myself. It's only been a week and clearly I'm not doing much better. I know this stuff doesn't happen overnight. I've considered going back to webcam porn because it's fairly easy and gets me the male attention I need, but it's also not helping the real problem at hand.

500,"CW/TW: Childhood sexual abuse. 


This is difficult to talk with anyone around me, and unfortunately my therapist and I can’t meet until next week. I think I need this off my chest, at least a little bit now, and to maybe get some advice from my fellow redditors. 

I have been cleaning out my grandparents home for the last couple weeks. They’ve both been very ill the last 10 years and hoarding got way more out of control than anyone realized. We are fixing this together now and I hope in the next month or so they will have their home back and far more accessible for them. 
For areas like the garages, attics, and crawl spaces, I’ve been working alone because it requires wearing safety gear and both of them are on oxygen and not well(lots of mouse poop and 95 degree weather). I’ve been carefully combing through boxes of files and paper, careful not to toss anything important, the mice and bugs have chewed through a lot of it. It’s been wonderful finding old family photos and neat objects, but nothing prepared me to find the file from when my mother was abused by her biological mothers boyfriend. It started when she was 11 and continued until her father (my grandpa) finally got her out of there. It was one of the most horrible times for them. 
My mother’s biological mother, was a huge piece of shit during the situation and blamed my mother, a child, for “tempting” her boyfriend. She told us about it when we were older and questions came up about the estranged part of her family. My mom is one of the strongest people I know and has attended therapy and worked hard to put the past behind her and enjoy her life. She’s an excellent mother and I’m proud to be her daughter. When I realized what I found, I was very overcome with different thoughts. In that headspace, I took the file and put it in my car. 
My grandparents, my mothers father and her step-mother(only mother she acknowledges) are both dealing with severe illness currently. All I could think about was, “this isn’t something anyone needs right now.” 
“They don’t need to ever see this again..” 
When I got home I felt so off about it. I hate the idea that I stole something from my grandparents home but I was so caught up in my feelings in the moment, that I just acted. My initial thoughts were to get rid of it and just pretend like it was something too soiled to save, but I just couldn’t do it. It’s physical undeniable proof of what happened to my mother all those years ago. I’m debating sealing it and just filing it with my own paperwork until/if it’s ever brought up again. 

I do think some of what I’m feeling stems from my own experiences. I was also molested as a child and when it came back to the surface years ago for me in the form of old psychiatric evaluations that were sent to me from my high school records department, reading those documents was like reliving what happened all over again. It took time and additional therapy to work through the emotional upheaval. I just don’t want that for my mother or my grandparents, especially when things are so serious with my grandparents health. 
Am I selfishly projecting my own feelings on to this situation? Or Am I doing the right thing by not letting this come back up? 
Was I wrong for taking this file? 
What should I do from here?

508,"I’m 25/f with a bachelors degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (Child services, Psychology). I spent 4 months post-graduation applying for hundreds of jobs, none of which I got a call back for- except one, that required home visits, travel between 6 counties and paid $9/hr. I declined.

Last year I was working as a retail store manager for the boutique I worked at in college before I transitioned into real estate. I live in one of the fastest growing cities in the us, so it seemed like a good idea to get my real estate license. I’ve had one closing so far this year, which isn’t even enough to cover my desk fees or realtor dues so I’m still in the negative. It’s been about a year since I started and I’m so burned out and tired of not making anything. I made more money in high school working in restaurants. This is a high-profile office, with over half our agents making more than a 6 figure income. With just one sale this year so far that they basically handed to me, I’m surprised I’m still here and they haven’t kicked me to the curb yet. But I’ve put in a lot of time and a lot of money here. It’s just not paying off. It’s all commission based, and I’m nothing like these people (think country-club, married to doctors, my father was the mayor type of people.) I don’t have the connections and my friends/network certainly aren’t buying houses right now. I feel like I tricked them into hiring me because I don’t fit in, and I only got this job because my retail boss knew an agent here. I’m sick of the unpredictability of this job. I miss having a salary.

I feel like I need a masters to make real use of my degree, but I have a low gpa from messing around in college and there is basically zero chance I would make into any graduate program. I would have taken things seriously and majored in something different had I known what the working world and applying for jobs was actually like. 

I’m thinking about going to back to school for something different. I’m tired of being directionless and the burden of having growing debt is eating at me. I’ve managed to survive this past year on savings and help from others, and I feel pathetic for doing so. 

Anyways, I’ve thought about doing a two-year dental hygienist program, or medical sonography, or even accelerated nursing. Something with a promising job market that is stable. I’m tired of feeling lost out there. I want to have a skill that someone will actually pay me for.

What is your experience with going back to school, or not being able to find a job in your field? Any advice is much appreciated.",16Jul2019,5

However, recently, I've become disinterested. There are a lot of people I interact with on a daily basis however, right now, I barely speak to them because I don't want to. Infact there's only one person I really talk to when I'm at university and the other conversations are usually, ""Hi how're you doing?"" and ""bye"". It's usually a handful of people and my girlfriend with whom I really interact with.

514,"This might be kind of long, apologize in advance, but for the past 9-10 months or so, my boyfriend has been really struggling with his inner demons. We lived together and he hated his job and started coming home everyday just completely tired and pissed at being there. So finally he got another job (a great one) about 3 hours away from me. So now we are longish-distance but I happily agreed because I thought this job would make him feel more fulfilled.

But now he’s constantly apathetic to everything. He is meh about his job, about anything going on. He doesn’t get excited about things. Just generally BLAH. He feels like he doesn’t know his purpose in life and it’s frustrating him that he doesn’t have any serious passions like most people. He literally isn’t passionate about anything (except with me, we have a very loving relationship). 

I honestly don’t know if he’s depressed or not. His mother committed suicide about a year ago and although they weren’t close, it had him thinking about “why are we anything at all”. I think he realized how his mom didn’t really leave a lasting impact and that scared him to think he won’t leave anything behind. 

As for his day to day- he’s not lethargic. He goes to the gym, gets up every morning, never overeats or over sleeps, extremely healthy and keeps himself busy until bedtime. I know a common attribute to depression is being always tired? 

I studied philosophy and actually have a really good understanding of questioning your existence but I’m not sure if this is something he needs to talk about with a doctor or if he just needs to “find himself”. Either way he refuses to be on antidepressants (the antidepressants made his mom suicidal) and he dislikes therapists.

Hello! I have just started using the WeChat app for me and my dad to be able to communicate via internet and/or data.

However, my account in WeChat is “blocked” because according to them, “unusual registration was detected, such as registering many accounts at once or using unofficial software.”

I did the necessary steps they asked me to do: verified through SMS, and it took me to a step where I have to ask someone to do the necessary “Help Friend Log In.”

Unfortunately, I have to find someone who is able to meet the three (3) requirements in order for me to be able to “unblock” my account.

The 3 requirements that WeChat posted were: 1) Your friend’s WeChat account age should be 1 year-old at the least.
2) Your friend should have WeChat Wallet account.
3) Your friend shouldn’t have verified another account in last 6 months.

All these 3 features are required. If they are missing one of those, it is not possible for them to enable your account.

It feels like there's this big bad monster screaming at me horrible things, so much so that I can't focus on anything else but that mistake. Failure or mistakes to me in my messed up little mind when I was a child meant that my parents would be mad at me.

522,"I want to preface this by saying that I know this sounds like a fake Hallmark movie plot, but this is my real life now apparently.

When I was about five years old, my mom divorced from my father because he was abusive to the both of us and definitely having an affair with his secretary.  I spent the vast majority of my life with just my mother and have only a few memories of my father because most of it happened when I was so young and I probably have repressed most of the bad memories.  My father ended up marrying his secretary and continuing a life with her.

All things considered, I ended up relatively well-adjusted and graduated from a pretty good college.  While in college, I was super involved in my dorm as a resident advisor for a couple years and remain close friends with the majority of the professional staff in that building.

Apparently, I have a half-brother who was born to my father and his second wife, which I didn’t know until I got a text message from the professional staff asking about someone with my father’s first name and last name from where my father moved to.  My half-brother is moving into the same dorm that I lived and worked in for three years while in college. What are the freaking odds?

Now, here’s the dilemma.  I don’t really know if I ever want to have a relationship with my father, but I always wanted a brother as I grew up an only child with a single mother.  I want to reach out to him and have a relationship, but I also don’t know if he knows that I even exist or if it would be fair to ruin what he could perceive as a normal life.  As much as I would want to connect with him, I don’t want to ruin his world, especially when he will be an 18 year old freshman in college.

What should I do?  Should I reach out to him or just pretend like I don’t know he is literally less than a mile away from me?

But she was obsessed with him and stayed with him despite him cheating multiple times as well.

Finally she finds out he has been in a second relationship with a married woman for the last year or so of their relationship and the other woman knows about her. So yeah he was living a double life, he is an asshole etc. She finally broke up with him and has not seen or spoken to him ever since. 

Now over a year down the line she is still moping around, with a really depressing and defeatist attitude and it’s honestly draining. She complains that she has put on weight, she doesn’t bother with her appearance anymore, she doesn’t go out anymore etc but if she’s not willing to put the effort in then what can anyone else do about it? 

She constantly complains about being old and tired but fuck I mean she’s 31 not 81 she has soooo many good years ahead of her if she would just wake up and seize them! She’s always complaining about things but never makes an effort to change. I am trying my best to be patient with her but this far down the line it’s becoming quite a burden and I would rather not hang out with her because I know she will bring her ex up into conversation and start delving into the ins and outs of their relationship again.

She told me I should look for a specialist, who accepts younger girls.).

And so I started my search. The closest hospitals didn't have the right obgyns, so I searched more and found two specialists. The only problem is that they are both about 2-3 hours away from home and they work in private clinics, meaning that we might have to pay for the consultation. I shared this info with my mom and she flipped. She started calling my doctor stupid, because of her we will have to drive so far.

536,"So, I’ve been trying to find a part time job in my area for the remainder of the summer and for the upcoming school year. I applied to Starbucks and went in a couple of times to check in on my application and subsequently got hired. A few days later, I called back and asked for my manager who told me she would call me by that Thursday (this was almost two weeks ago) to set up a time/day for training. 

That Thursday came and went with no call so I called the store and was informed by another employee, after she took my name and number down, that she would tell my manager to call me as the manager was unavailable. 5 days go by, no call. I call again and was informed that she’s not there but he told me he would send her a text asking her to call me. I called again today, almost two weeks after she said she would call me and 4 days after the last call, and the girl on the phone asked for my full name twice and then told me that the manager is in a meeting and she would tell her to call me. At this point, I’m getting fed up with going in circles like this. Am I overreacting and should give the manager more time to call me or should I move on and find another job? 

My friends have advised that I go in on Monday (I can’t now since I’m out of town) and try to talk to the manager face to face before giving up. What do you guys think I should do? I’m not trying to become annoying/persistent but I also don’t want to lose this position/seem uninterested. 

Any advice is welcome

During this whole point I have lived with my mother since my parents are divorced and my dad is not well off enough to support me financial. Afer fixing  my grades to a 3.7 and getting my AA I got into the University of Washington Seattle, which is the top schools in Washington, and one of the best public schools in the country. My mom found out I smoke weed for probably the 10th time but this time she said if I don’t quit smoking she won’t pay for my housing (wants me to prove I quit with a drug test) I have been using weed for self medication for several years and am very aware of what the drug does to me and how to schedule it into my life after completing my responsibilities. I never let my weed use come before my responsibility and I have the GPA and college acceptance to prove it.
I have had poly drug abuse problems for years as well and it makes it hard for me to be sober without getting anxious and depressed and suicidal so I am doing Xanax in the meantime because it won’t show up on a drug test ( I know this is a short term solution since Xanax is highly addictive after even one week of daily use). Weed is kind of like a pacifier that keeps me feeling good. I know how horrible that sounds to a non drug user but that’s how I am.
I was wondering if I should take out a loan to pay for dorming (7000$ a year for two years) so I can smoke weed and attend school at the same time because my mom will. Or budge with this weed thing.

544,"Background: I am in high school. 

So basically I have a lot of ""friends"" at school (People I say hi to and can ask them how a test was). However, when it comes to inviting someone over, there are only a few people that I would consider inviting over, and most of them are busy/on vacation or something.

Essentially, everyone wants to hang out with as many people as possible and be able to use everyone for when they need them (Ex: A kid who's good at a subject, pretend to be good friends with them so you can be their partner for a group project in that class, and then make it easier to get a good grade). On top of that, most people are on snapchat/instagram but I don't want to get distracted/waste my time by using either of those.

On top of that, we have a group of a few kids who meet whenever we can, but there are a few who live in the same neighborhood and never have a ride because their parents don't give any time to their kids (As they are always at work until the evening), so we always have to go 15-20 minutes away if we want to meet (cuz as I said my friends want quantity, so they won't meet unless we're meeting with those guys as well because then its a larger amount of people).

Also everyone is competitive so no one will share anything, as that could mean someone else gets a higher grade/someone tries to get leadership in a club that they didn't know about but now do because someone told them, etc.

Anyways, I feel like it might be some common interest or something everyone has (might be something idk about cuz competition). Like I used to play mobile games a lot a couple months ago (now I stopped) and I would play with a few of my friends (they count as the ones I would invite over). Meanwhile, the others (the people who do whatever is the ""new trend""), would be on a different table with other kids. Basically I don't know why everyone wants to be friends with everyone.

Another theory I have is that those kids on the other table hang out with people outside of school more often, as again, everyone wants to be with everyone.

So what can I do to make better friends? My school isn't that big, so I can't just ""make new friends.""

My parents and I haven’t always gotten along either. When I started dating my husband, my parents made it known they did not approve. My dad even tried to set me up with someone else that was much older than me. When I did things they didn’t approve of, such as my husband, then boyfriend, staying with me overnight at my dorm, they would threaten to kick me off health insurance or make me pay more bills I couldn’t afford. I eventually took over all of my bills except for health insurance. 

I got married back in April, and my parents were barely involved in planning or helping. My mom went to one shower and helped set up some decorations the day before the wedding. Her excuse is always she has to watch the kids, which I understand, but I don’t believe it’s fair she casts me to the side.

As I’ve gotten older though it’s got worse. I haven’t had an engaging conversation with someone in years. It’s gone from not wanting to socialise to not being able to even when I try my very very hardest.

Whenever I talk to someone, I can’t focus on what they’re saying no matter how hard I try. My mind wonders and I start daydreaming, i daydream a lot, not even about anything in particular, I can just easily waste hours sitting at home in silence, daydreaming. I seem to prefer daydreaming over being in the moment, but it’s incredibly lonely. When I do try and focus, I’m unable to keep up with the conversation, it will go back and forth a couple times and then I’d just forget what we have been talking about halfway through the conversation, or completely forget what I’m saying halfway through a sentence, or forget a simple word. I can’t seem to piece together my thoughts and then say them out loud, all I can manage to say half the time is ‘yeah fair enough’ or ‘haha true!’ because I feel so overwhelmed. Then I get home and realised I could have easily had a great and in depth conversation with that person. I can’t speak to someone for more than a minute or so without needing to get out of there and take a breather. This goes for family as well. I just can’t say more than a couple words without becoming kinda...confused? 

I don’t really have any friends because of it. This isn’t just a  recent problem.

Although i am in final year, i've still failed a year and i took a break from it last year since my mental health is not good last year. And i also am not good at it.

Now, i have to rejoin again this year but the worst part is i haven't been there for the whole month and my attendence is like at worst...... I didn’t want to go to uni coz i am scared...

It is not expensive to go to medical university in our country.

577,"I have a ""friend"" that I hang out with. However, I don't feel like I want to be around him anymore for the following reasons: 

1) He smells like body odor. It is really repulsing especially because we work out together.

2) He is into BDSM. Although, I do not have a problem with that. He just talks a lot about how he likes women with big behinds (and just women in general) in a sexual way. This makes me really uncomfortable.

3) He is very insecure which annoys the shit out of me.

What I like about him: we get a long as long as he does not talk about those sexual stuff.

So my questions are should I stop hanging out with this dude? and am I a bad person for asking this question? Is this normal to feel like this towards someone? What should I do?

579,"I work as a remote freelancer for an agency that has this client which I have worked for many years. Everything online in their business was basically built by me and other guy who works with me in this project (which joined a few years after it started).

It's been around 8 months since the people responsible for this project (on the customer's side) were replaced and we started having daily scrum calls. I always felt insecure speaking English, but this routine ended up making me feel a little more comfortable with it.

The thing is I've always felt insecure speaking in public, specially in my native language. I always sucked at meetings when I worked presencially in companies. I get always very nervous before them. But since those daily calls started I kind of lost a big part of this fear.

But now the problem has became into another thing that is really bringing me down: I can't find a spot during the calls to speak! And just to make it even worse, my colleague talks A LOT. He never stops talking. Good for him.

I have even been warned by the project manager that the clients find it odd that I don't participate much in the calls and they feel like I'm not doing anything.

This really sucks because I was the one who started this project, taught everything about it to the other guy and now it seems like he is the master at everything just because he speaks more than me. Even worse, people usually direct all the questions to him, because they are used to.

The agency owner has already said to me in the past he wanted me to be the leader if this project continues to grow and there are more people working, but what sense would it make now? I'm sure they feel like the other guy is much more expert than me.

And in the calls I just keep waiting for a little break to be able to say something, but usually when I find that spot everything I had to say have already been covered. Most times when I feel like I can add something I end up speaking upon somebody and there's that awkward moment.

The web is full of guides and self-help articles for this kind of thing but they are always the same bullshit.

Can someone advise me on how to turn that table and lose these fears to get more noticed on my work?

Thank you guys!",16Jul2019,1
580,"Hey guys, 

So basically i'm (22)  trying to figure things out as i'm getting older day by day and i'm literally just trying to figure out how my life will turn out to be with my boyfriend of two years. I see an entire future with this man, like moving out one day, have his kids and just traveling the entire world together as one. One thing that's holding me back is his mom and I have to say she loves me to death but I just I cant believe i'm saying this but i hate her and i hate that she one day will take my boyfriend away from me. She uses him like her own assistant he does every single thing for her, and i do get that that's his mom. but she exceeds the abuse of brainwashing him he is now 25 yrs only and till this day she calls him about 10 times to check up on him when we're together asking him what time will he be back home or that it's getting to late. He's a whole adult and she still sees him as a teenager. he is the only child she has but don't yall think that's too much for mom to do especially at his age? ive even told him to put a stop to her doing that because to me that embarrassing  I feel like in a way it's stopping him from growing. The everyone around me keeps saying that he will never move out his mom won't allow that. Like at this point i feel like i'm wasting my youth, i feel like there won't be a future with him because i really don't want to live with his mom. I have spoken to him about this but he tells me everything i want to hear, but i don't know who to even believe at this point. I need advice.",16Jul2019,1

588,"I'm usually a glass half full sort of guy. Always optimistic and make the best of things. But in the last few months my life has taken an absolute dive.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an intern at a big company. I was initially super happy to get this job as I applied to a lot of places and I really like what this company did, so soon as I got an offer I signed up. This internship required me to move a fair distance from my University and home for a year, but in the grand scheme of things, it seemed worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2 months ago. My girlfriend and I broke up, mainly due to this move. We didn't think we'd manage long distance and thought it'd be best to move on.

&amp;#x200B;

So I found a place, it's a houseshare with random people. Initially looked great. Nice area, close to the job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I move here, super excited about a new chapter in my life, and it all goes downhill.

&amp;#x200B;

The city I'm in has NOTHING to do. It's a common thing people say, ""Lovely to live in, if you're retired"". The house I live in is hollow. I can hear my upstairs neighbour walking around LOUDLY, and snore. He hardly ever leaves the house too, so always noise (I've had talks with him, but it's more how hollow the house is). Also, nobody of interest living here how I can hang out with, just some random foreigners and old people (I've done my best to socialise, they want none of it). It's also costing a well over half my salary to live here.

&amp;#x200B;

Worse part, is the job I was so looking forward too is not at all what I expected. It's over a month since I started and most of the day, I try and stay busy. I'm meant to be working on projects, but they're WELL beyond my experience and knowledge, the managers know this so just let me sit in the meetings as my 'involvement'. There is hardly anything I can actually get involved in. Any tasks I get hardly challenge or use my degree knowledge. I heard from the last intern that he'd often disappear and just take 2-3 hours lunches, his line manager hardly had anything for him to do all year. So it was just keeping yourself sane for a year. My Line Manager also seems to not like me very much, not sure why, but perhaps because she was forced into supervising me and 'create work' for me, when she didn't want to, nor is doing so. I ask her regarding future things, and she says, there isn't anything suitable for me just yet. It's understandable as to why, but they bring a person in to learn, and have nothing for them to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't move a considerable distance, break up with my girlfriend, move into a shithole house and basically put my life on hold to get this job experience to DO NOTHING! Yeah they pay me. But its terrible. I could utilise my time to get ahead for next year at Uni, while I do nothing. But it's so upsetting that my life is in shambles, I'm on the verge of tears each night because I miss my (ex)girlfriend, my friends and my family. I can't afford to go back every weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I try and busy myself with exercise and working on personal projects. But the majority of my day is just full of reminders how much I've messed up and ended up so damn miserable.

Any advice? I know this is a very personal situation.",16Jul2019,1

590,"I'm 22 years old and still living under my moms roof. Our relationship is complicated, I love my mother dearly and she's a good person, but there are times when our relationship becomes so unhealthy i feel like i can't cope. She's a narcissit and if ever I'm having a problem, she completely makes it about her, like it always has to be her fault and then becomes furious that I'm even upset in the first place. 
Last night, at the time of me writing this, she had said something to me which stirred up a lot of old emotions about my trauma from being bullied in school and a relationship with a person I'm no longer friends with. I know thats what made me upset in the first place, and it was something i needed to deal with, but when she saw i was upset, she immediatly assumed it was about her. Even when i explained it was a problem that had to do with me, something I had to work through, and it had nothing to do with her, she lashed out and said i was emotionally blackmailing her.
This isnt the first time something like this has happened between us, and growing up it was hard to confide things in her because i was scared about what would happen. She would always get angry and react in a way that only hurt me more, and the worst part is that when she does this, i have to be the bigger person. I have to be the one to apologize for getting upset, and she'll never say sorry, and if she does it feels more like a sorry because she wants me off her back or because she feels she deserves the forgiveness. She's 55, I'm 22, I shouldn't always have to be the bigger person. I'm tired of apoligizing for my feelings when she cant own up to messing things up too.
 Theres also this unhealthy co-dependancey we have on each other, but its gotten worse lately. She keeps making jokes that sound more like thinnly vieled threats that I'm gonna have to take care of her until she dies. She's in full capacity of her bodily and mental facilities, but she just doesn't want to take care of herself. She doesnt want to be responsible for herself, and honestly, I'm scared of what will happen if i do leave her alone. I feel like, emotinally and finacially, I'n trapped with her. I want some kind of distance between us so we can both learn how to live without leaning on each other, but I'm in no place financially to move out. Even if i cant move out, i want some kind of healthy emotional distance from her, but i dont know if either of us knows what that looks like. What am i supposed to do?

591,"I just got back from a weekend trip with my best friend to Colorado. It was her idea to go and do some hikes, which I'm not overly into, but figured it would be a good experience since we had fun the last time we went there.

Anyway, over the last month, maybe six weeks, I feel like she's been annoyed with me for some reason. Maybe it's just me, but she's also been dating this guy for about a year who she recently seems to have gotten more obsessed with, so she seems less available.

When we were at the airport yesterday, I happened to glance at her phone while she was texting her boyfriend, and saw my name in a text. I didn't see all of it since she clicked off of it quickly, but it went something along the lines of ""I told Richte36 I didn't want to go anywhere...(didn't get the rest)"". When we got on the plane, I saw something that she said to him that I also only got a quick glance at, that said ""I want this over with"". I don't know exactly what she was referring to, but I freaked out that it was about trying to get rid of me as a friend. I broke down crying over this after that on the plane. I have bad anxiety and lost a couple of good friends a couple years ago over a very screwed up situation, and I'm scared I'm going to lose this one now too.

How do I approach this situation? What should I say or how should I bring it up? I know it probably sounds irrational, but I've just had some hard luck over the last few years, and I don't want to screw things up with a great friend who has become a big part of my life.",16Jul2019,8

Fast forward until about 9pm that night I get an alert from my bank that a $500 charge to Applebee's was attempted and declined because the card was locked. They tried twice. Being suspicious I didn't click on anything in the email and immediately checked my banks official app and lo and behold the attempts appeared in the recent activity. So I called the bank and had the card shut down. 

My wife said I should call the Applebee's to notify them that it was in fact a stolen credit card number someone tried to use, in hopes that they were still there and could call the police. I declined because I didn't want to drive 45 minutes to fill out a police report, and was high (weed) at the time.

It’s hard for me to pretend to be engaged in a conversation but at the same time I still want to be nice. It never works out. My lack of interest in the person/conversation makes me not pay attention to the conversation at all which is interpreted as being slow. I don’t care to have conversation with you, you bore me and I’m not in the mood to deal with your personality. But if I say that I’m the asshole. 

I know for a fact this is not how I’m viewed across all people. With my friends and family my attention comes naturally. I listen, I retain info, and it doesn’t take much effort to know and remember what’s going on in their lives. Because I’m actually interested. They matter in my life.

601,"TL;DR at end

I started a job about 18 months ago. My friend got me the job - at the time I felt so grateful and I thought she was a really really selfless and lovely person. I was wrooooong. She knows I worked in a job where my boss undermined me and gaslit me. It really impacted my mental health. This job was supposed to be great. Working with my friend, doing the work I like. 

It’s been a complete nightmare. Since I’ve started she’s constantly undermined me. She tells me people don’t like me but won’t do anything to help repair the team. She takes moods with people and until recently I’ve avoided that but now she is subjecting me to either silent treatment or passive aggressive comments. She talks about me to other staff members. She won’t help me set objectives to be promoted. She takes credit for my ideas. When I tell her I’m having problems she basically ignores me. 

My dad died while I worked there and she was very passive aggressive about me taking time off - then when I came back she didn’t even ask how I was. Meanwhile however in the background she constantly relies on me for emotional support - she’s going through fertility treatment and her partner has an alcohol problem, both of which she talks about with me near constantly. I don’t expect better treatment because we are friends but I am actually treated worse! I feel like at any time I could be sacked. Work is thin on the ground and anything that does come in doesn’t come to me. 

Now another friend has asked me to consider working with her. It’s in another part of the city and would involve a commute. It would pay nearly half. There are potential opportunities but no guarantees. 

Sooo - do I stick this well paid job with suitable hours which kills my soul or do I take a risk for far less money and no guarantees either. Bonus question - what do I do about my “friend”/boss?

TL;DR- someone I thought was a really close friend got me a job where she is my boss. Since then she’s gaslit me, taken advantage of my time and help, undermined me and lied to me. There are very few jobs in my field and I’ve been offered one but its a long commute, half the money and not a sure position. Don’t know what to do.",16Jul2019,1

My father lost his job last night, my FAFSA is now totally wrong he used to make over six figures, and so I was only expecting to get \~$5000 from loans, I didn't take advantage of a lot of possible programs in my area, because he just made too much to let me get many of the state run programs. Also I have about 8 grand that is stuck in limbo -ill likely never see this money but it's totally possible I run into it at SOME point around my 18th birthday (I turn 18 in September) - my father has decided to move to Washington (Im in Oregon) and to be honest kinda just abandoned myself, my little brother (to a lesser extent, he will be going with his mother), and my grandmother - his mother, to go and remarry -one year after a divorce- to some stranger with kids - essentially he has been TOTALLY mentally absent since about January last year (talking to this woman mostly) and I've been on my own for about a year. My mother did the same thing when he worked abroad so Im used to mostly managing myself.

  
Here are a few questions, PLEASE help me... im so lost right now.  Please forgive the random nature of the questions, they're not in any good order - im freaking out, ive never felt so alone and lost... I dont want to admit it but I almost wanna cry.

I won't have a home after July 31st, I need to get my grandmother prepared to move to Idaho mentally -she still wants to live in this High COS area with me... im staying for college - the computer science degree program at the school im going to is REALLY good and so I would LOVE to stay here if possible - and she cant seem to let me do this.  I need to prepare her for this, so question 1 is how? She is mentally deteriorating and I don't know if I could care for her?

I know I can talk to student loan officers, but what do I do to prove that my father is now unemployed, living in another state, and essentially doesn't give a shit? How do I make the more nuanced nature of my finances clear to them? How can I apply for need-based scholarships this late in the game? What can I do to make a decent amount of money while the summer is still in? What do I do with any money that I do get? My rent isn't mandatory, but its the TOP of my priorities and ill explain why that is. My girlfriends family have offered to let me stay with them for $250 a month and they'll waive that if It's impossible but they're great people and I REALLY want to make sure that they are taken care of in anyway that I can help them. So question 2: How do I make money, pay for college, and manage finances in a way that will get me through this?

How can I alter my fafsa, if at all, to get more aid?

&amp;#x200B;

What are some of the costs of living on my own suddenly that I'm not expecting? Can you just give me some things that I maybe don't know about, being a young'n, and that I should use to put together a budget? I don't know if I need health insurance, but I 100% need car insurance -I could just not use the car honestly, which is probably best as it will run me another 190$ a month in cash that I don't have.   


I have two computers at the moment. Both custom machines, one worth about 800$ and the other maybe 350$ - they likely wont sell quickly in my region but do I sell them both and purchase a laptop? Or do I keep one to make sure I'm  not computerless? 

&amp;#x200B;

How am I even going to be able to manage a work-life balance? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have 200$, a 2002 Toyota corolla, the two computers, two monitors, a little bit of clothing (not NEARLY enough, but its mostly in good shape), and a phone to my name. that's about fucking it.  thank GOD I have one or two nice sets of clothing.

How do I keep myself physically fit? That's something that is really important to me, but be honest is there a way to do it while taking care of all of this? 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is nuts and i haven't spoken to her in over a year, so she is out of the picture. I have an elderly disabled grandmother with me at the moment, but I believe she can move to Idaho to live with son (my uncle) and hopefully she can build her life from there but I need some serious advice on how to continue.

608,"Recently, I was on the plane to Germany and I was a bit furious with this one guy who filled up the overhead cabin with his hats. It's this kind of summer hat where it would take up space and he has like 4-5 of them. He puts them on top of our seat and then across as well where his wife and 2 kids are sitting. I was trying to lift my baggage because i know it will fit but he closed it and said it's fragile it's full. All the overhead cabin was all full so the stewardess offered to put it in baggage bin outside. Is there anything that I could do so they didn't take any advantages of this? I just feel like we all paid the same price so why does he get the luxury of putting his stupid hats on the overhead bin and made other people miserable.

Here is the link to a sample of the summer hats.

609,"I’ve always had blotchy, red skin on my face and frizzy, dry looking hair. As a way to still look “attractive” I’m constantly applying light foundation and straightening my hair or wearing it up.

About 6 months ago, I traveled with a friend who has great hair and skin. I asked her what her secret was and she told me that she has good skin &amp; hair because she never puts on makeup and she never puts heat to her hair. Sounds reasonably.

Currently I’ve been in between jobs since the first week of May and decided to give that her advice a try. I stopped using heat on my hair and stopped wearing foundation. 

My new regular routine is to wash my hair with Aveda shampoo about every other day and I use a regular face wash in the morning and exfoliate every 2/3 days.

However, I still have blotchy skin &amp; dry, frizzy hair. Any other advice? Or maybe suggestions on another page I should be posting this? Ive tried googling the this but it feels like more advertisement based reviews rather than honest reviews.",16Jul2019,1
612,"My husband and I (30F) have been married for almost two years, just bought a house, and are starting to plan for our first child. We have a 12-13 (adopted from a shelter) year old pit-mix. She’s never been around an infant really, I don’t let her around toddlers because they’re unpredictable and id never use anyone’s child as a guinea pig to see if she tolerates them. We have two nieces and a nephew that are 4-7 in age that she quite clearly does not like/is afraid of because they’re black and our dog has always had an aggression toward people of color. We keep them separated or leave our dog home with a sitter.  
She’s old, she’s had both ACLs torn/repaired, and has arthritis. She’s not the most patient dog and has her own quirks. As I’m typing this I feel like I already know this is a recipe for disaster but my husband thinks I’m over reacting. I’ve already been adamant that if we get pregnant and she’s still alive that we will get her in house training to be less reactive/aggressive/and better trained. But I just don’t know if that’s enough. I’d never leave her alone with an infant, but if she lives 2-4 more years and we have a toddler and she snaps...I’m all over the place and thinking worst case scenario. 
Here’s what I need advice on - I’ve had my dog for 10 years, she’s a part of my soul. I can’t imagine leaving her at a shelter or trying to rehome her. She’s mostly healthy but we have decided to not take further preventative measures should something go wrong with her health. I’m turning 30 very soon, we want two kids and there is the over hanging biological clock that keeps ticking in my ear. I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR: We want to have a baby but I’m not sure training our dog to be tolerant is enough. Any advice is welcome.",16Jul2019,2

614,"I know this sounds silly but anyway.. 
There is this girl in my high school back in the day I had a crush on. She had done some crazy things to me. Things like She made me lay in my bed and listen to songs while visualizing her sweet face. She taught me never give up on things you love. She made me chase my dreams. God!! you(that girl) made me over come my fears, like that one time when I happened to literally chase your vehicle in that darkest street just so I can know your place,but sadly i got lost in the traffic after reaching roadway.
I thought of proposing her at numerous times I mean it is always there in my head but me being a shy kid that I am always worried about the aftermath. Like, Is she going to slap me in front of her friends? Things like always dragged me backwards. So one day i decided to go to her place with my friends hoping that I could see her and my idiot friend decided to shout her name so loudly that his neighbours heard and decided catch us because they thought we was doing some crazy shit, which we weren't. So, next day the parents gave complaint on us to the principal, we get called from him and fair enoughly my friend took the shots,because I'm this polite kid in the school. After that im starting to lose hope that she ever loves me back. In the final year of high school he changes the school and that was the last time I had seen her for 2 years. After another 2 years later i saw a photo of her on fb, days later she deletes her profile as well.
Today, after 5 years I found her on Instagram while randomly clicking on one of my school friend's profile in the suggestions. I was shocked when I found her. Where have you been all these years? I used to search you on social media every now and then hoping I could find you, now today finally I found you. Should I get in touch with you? Will you accept my words or just thrash them ? Do you even know there is a person who is secretly loving you ? Fine, let me just ask reddit.

I downloaded a game and it was a slow download, but it worked. After beating that game I wanted to download Call of Duty BO4. I started downloading it and it was working fine. Then my stupid sister took the game out and put in the disc version of Minecraft, even though I had the digital version already on it. She screwed up the download so I tried to start it up again. It started downloading fine but it said the game needed an update. I clicked ok but that just stopped the download process. I tried to delete the game to start it over again but it would not go away. I unplugged the Xbox and rebooted it to see if it was gone and it was. I started downloading it again but it wasn’t working. I kept restarting the Xbox (probably shouldn’t have did that) and now it is super slow and won’t open any apps besides settings.

617,"I'll try to make this as short as possible, but I'll have to provide a little background. I dated the same guy (23M) throughout middle school and high school and eventually married him, but after getting married he never worked or helped out around the house. When I would ask him to he would punch the walls or punch me. I begged him to work time and time again, but he never would, so I eventually decided to become a stripper in order to make enough to support us. Romantically, my life sucked, but I did love stripping. I loved the feeling of empowerment it gave me. Some strippers get caught up in the lifestyle, but I was using it to save up enough money to move to LA. My dream is to be an actor, so I began taking acting classes and going to auditions. My plan was to build my resume for around a year while I saved money. My job worked great with that because it allowed me to make around $2000 each weekend. Sometimes more. I could also choose my own schedule and even just not come in at all for a week or two if I didn't want to. 

At the club, I met this guy (19M) who kept coming back in to get dances from me and only me. I led him on hardcore, that's what I was supposed to do.. but he kept coming in every time I worked and I could tell he was actually trying to peruse me. I liked him, but I was married. I decided to meet him outside of the club, tell him the truth about everything, and give some of his money back. Things didn't go as planned. We started drinking and I told him everything about my life with my husband. We had one of the best nights of my life just talking and getting to know each other. We continued to be friends for a few weeks until eventually I left my husband for him. This happened around four months ago.

At first he told me that he was fine with me continuing my job as a stripper for a few years and that he wanted me to follow my dreams and move to LA. We had so much fun laughing together and he did so much for me. He bought ne anything I needed, took me anywhere I needed to go, he did everything for me. I did see that he was a little jealous though, and he wanted to be very serious very fast. I was living with him within the first two weeks. 

Every time I would come home from work it would start a fight and he would ask how many dances I sold and stuff. I understood that, so I quit my job and began working as a waitress out of respect to him. I lost a lot of money, but love was worth it. That wasn't all he did though. He also kept my Facebook logged in on his phone, he would go through my phone all the time..not just the messages, but my search history and YouTube history as well. He would even look through my old stripper accounts while showering and make himself sad. He started out making little jokes every now and again about my outfits, but then he got to the point to where he would yell at me for wearing a crop top and get upset over almost every little thing I wore. Even just a sleeveless shirt. I see girls who wear what they want and do what they want as empowered, but he does not. He even once said he doesn't understand why someone would want to be with Selena Gomez because she ""shows off her body too much."" SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST MOFEST CELEBRITIES. Be bas mentioned having problems with me continuing acting because of love scenes and kissing scenes as well. He also said that he does not want to ever move to LA, so I went along with it and said we didn't have to. On top of all of this, I've just felt isolated from the world. Every time I try to go out he asks where I am every few minutes and will not stop texting me.

It's also worth nothing that I've always been an activist and very into social issues, but he is not. He does not believe they concern him. I am also very emotional and have horrible anxiety, but he doesn't u understand that. He also expects me to get a better job, but still do his laundry, clean the house, and cook sometimes. I've never been a housewife though. That's never been what I wanted to be. 

I finally told him that either his mindset on my outfit changes or I'm out. At first he said I could wear what I want around him, but to cover up more when he isn't around. I was okay with this at first, but then I wasn't. I told him he needs to stop thinking everything I wear is ""too revealing."" I almost left.. I tried telling him in person but he wouldn't listen, so I packed my bags, lied and said I was going to sleep, and left, but he found out my car was gone from his friend and called and asked where I was. He said to just stay until the morning. I did, and we talked things over and he promised to do better and try to make things good. 

Things were better, he said he only asked that I do not strip, have guy friends without him being there, or show my boobs or butt. That was fine, I suppose. So then I tried to make plans with a friend from work and he asked a million questions, like where she lived, what we would be doing, if I trusted her, if she had a husband or boyfriend who would be there.. all kinds of stuff. Then that night we started talking and he said something along the lines of ""I'm not trying to be mean, but I just feel like I keep compromising so much for you and you aren't doing anything in return. I'm trying so hard to just be okay with everything that you wear and stuff, but you just aren't giving anything in return or trying to compromise at all.."" I asked what he wanted and he said I could stop wearing crop tops all the time..but I had only worn them three times that week and all of my crop tops show about two inches or less of stomach. I wore them with jeans that week too. I asked how he'd feel about me posting a bikini picture and he said ""if you want.. don't expect me to comment though. Whatever.""

I decided that our differences might be too much and left again yesterday. He kept blowing up my phone begging me for another chance. I told him i just needed some time and i was going to my mom's house three hours away. I guess my snapchat location said i was somewhere else, so he got upset about that. I really was where i said though. He called me saying that he was sorry and he explained that I have helped him become a better person and that he was slowly changing for me. He said that sometimes he acts like he cares about things more than he actually does (like bikini pictures and outfits) because he doesn't want me to think he just doesn't care like my ex husband didn't. He said that I'm his world and he never wants to lose me. He's saying that he wants to show me off and wants other people to think I'm beautiful and he wants me to shine. Ge even said ge secretly wants to move to LA, but he's scared to leave the state because cha ge scares him, but that he will do it and enjoy it with me. This is all stuff I've told him I wish he wanted before though, so a part of me is afraid he is saying anything to get me back. He made a bunch of posts about me on social media too. Just sweet things. 

What should I do? I do love him and I know leaving him would break his little heart, but sometimes I'm afraid we just aren't meant to be. That we're too different. He has done so much for me though and he says he will never stop fighting for me. He said if I'm not home today he's driving here and proposing.

Tldr; I am in love with someone I find too controlling, but I'm afraid I'm over reacting. He says all the right things now that I've decided to leave. Please help?",16Jul2019,2

He recently came down to visit me we’ve talked about pretty much everything. I knew that at some point we would end up having sex, so I asked him how many partners he has  had, if he has been tested. Etc.. this past weekend we got a little tipsy and ended up having unprotected sex. 2 days later he calls me and tells me that a girl from his hometown texted him and said that he should be tested because she thinks she might have something. He’s now saying he had sex with her 2 weeks before we started talking, and he had unprotected sex with her. We’ve been taking for about 4 weeks. When I asked how long ago he had sex he said “like 4 weeks ago, a while ago, like 6 weeks” I got upset because I had specifically asked him all these questions, knowing him and I would at some point have sex.

I haven't talked to this guy in years, but he reached out regarding a couple thousand dollars my cousin borrowed from him a few years back. In the text, he also said that my cousin is on a lot of hard drugs, including heroine. This guy seems half concerned about the money, and half concerned about the my cousin's health. But he's been trying to get ahold of my cousin about the money, but he hasn't responded in over a year (which is why this guy is reaching out to me.)

I couldn't care less about the money, but I'm worried about my cousin's apparent addiction to some bad drugs. I'll be seeing him next weekend at a family event, and I want to reach out to help him. What I don't want to do is forward this to his parents who, while they love him, aren't very good at situations like this.

627,"Ok so I will just launch into, I am genuinely worried. Anyway, earlier today I (14M btw) was coming home on my bus when I heard a classmate (call him H) talking on his phone urgently saying things like ‘whatever you do don’t tell anyone’ and ‘I’ll pay you the £15.00 tomorrow if you keep quiet. H later explained to his friends that earlier that day, when he was lining up outside to go to the local sports centre he saw a male and female teacher (call her L) walking together (these two have previously beenrumoured to been dating or at least fairly close, they do a lot together, work in the same department, etc.). H said that he had urged his friend to wolf whistle at them as they were walking along the path. Apparently the male teacher started yelling at them and L looked (understandably) upset. After they came back from the sports session, the group found the welfare officer -our assistant headmistress-, L and another unrelated teacher. They started interrogating the group, and because nobody wanted to miss their respective buses H ‘snitched’ on the guy who whistled. He also claimed to the teachers that while he laughed he didn’t instigate it, and stated to his friends that this as because he didn’t want to get in trouble, which is stupid considering he metaphorically threw his friend under the bus.


I personally think that this is unacceptable, especially as later in the bus he was claiming L and our assistant headmistress are ‘Feminazis’ and even that L should have taken it as a compliment which is honestly sickening. He revealed that he had been talking on his phone to the offending guy, bribing him with money so that he wouldn’t tell, and saying as long as he stuck to his story, without any sort of video evidence, he would be fine. Now here’s where the uncertain bit comes in. As he was saying thesethings I took a couple of voice recordings that are a little bit janky and quiet, but clearly work near enough as the video evidence I would need. I’m planning to put it in an anonymous email to L and our assistant headmistress, as well as details about the bribe. I’m doing this because I don’t know what H might do to me if he realised it was me, and so it would be my safest bet. However, I’m still unsure because:


School ends in about three days, and as this might be considered in some way sexual harassment, it would ruin H’s last few y9 days, his holiday and the start of y10

I feel like a part of me is doing this in vengeance- H has always been a bit of a bully to me even on that day, and I feel like he would possibly be getting what he deserves. He even supports Tommy Robinson and the EDL so I really don’t particularly like him.

Using an anonymous account might convince H to go after another member of the sports group instead of me- and revealing the evidence may get them in trouble for not telling on H.

631,"I'm turning 17 on July 18th, which signifies my independence a bit more, I live in London with my boyfriend and his mother. 

I moved from my mums at first just after my 16th due to verbal and physical abuse, which didnt help with problems such as depression and an eating disorder, and other problems with my emotions. This seemed to be a good choice as at the time because I thought it would stop the abuse. 

I then moved into my nans, with my dad, who introduced me into heavy drinking and I began to smoke more cigarettes and weed. This caused me to do some irrational and rather dangerous things which eventually lead me to meeting my boyfriend of today. I would go round his everyday from the first day we met and things seemed fine at first. Until I was admitted into a psychiatric unit:

This was when I was introduced to heavier drugs like MDMA. And I would often come back to the unit drunk, if I had been out with my father. I rarely saw my boyfriend until I found out I was not under a section 2 or 18 which meant I was informal (dont count me on that I never knew my section if I had one). Soon i was forced to move back with my mother after this, where the abuse eventually continued and not even my twin sister could help me at this point. 

My family and my boyfriends family had never gotten along since my dad and mum and one of her friends turned up at the house assuming I was somehow held against my will after my father (who was high on cocaine and drunk) started on my boyfriend at a pub. So eventually I moved in with my boyfriend and his mother.

Everything seemed fine at first, I was in education (provided by the unit in small groups) this was untol me and my boyfriend started arguing, it began when I (being stupid) smoked behind his back, and he threatened to kick me out just before I moved in and I was going to stay for the weekend, he threw my backpack. Which didnt seem like much then he threatened to punch me after that which made me cry. 

My boyfriend sticks up for me a lot, and frankly hes the only person I have left and love him dearly he is my everything literally. But when he doesnt the world is against me. 

I started having these awful attacks of constant crying which were treated as if I were looking for attention, as well as continued my self harm. My boyfriend found out what I had done in the past, and I hid him from that to make him happy. He looked down my phone, and his mother also came upstairs and shouted at me as I curled up beside the spare room bedroom and cried my eyes out, she threatened to hit me. So I tried to talk to a friend about how sorry I was. There are a lot of things I do not remember from September through until November which was the time where my mental health was the worst and I was admitted into the unit. Apparently I had flirted with someone else through the internet. When my boyfriend found out I had spoken to this friend which i had known for the majority of 5 years, my boyfriend stated: why are you speaking about our problems, and his mum added ""why dont you go and live with him"". 

My boyfriend has taken things I've said the wrong way, for example he thought I said I wanted to smoke and harm myself by stating ""what else am I meant to do"" in an argument and threw me down the stairs, then hit me in the head a couple of times in front of his mum who said ""stop crying you will wake up the neighbours"".

My boyfriend has also stuck up for me when his mother has started on me, one time I panicked because my boyfriend had broken his arm on a bike ride and then proceeded to hit me in my face 3 times. Then I went to see my boyfriend, he stuck up for me at first then proceeded to say that I apparently pushed his mother because she told him I did. 

There was another time where I fell to the floor and broke down, stating that I wanted to end it, my boyfriend slapped me in the face a couple of times and told me to man up. His mum again told me to stop crying and kept on saying how pathetic my crying was. I eventually ended up leaving the house and cutting my wrists in a toilet. I was planning to jump off of a bridge when It was dark so nobody would notice me, but the police eventually found me. 

Recently I haven't been able to sleep, and I do quite a lot around the house such as clean, always go out with my boyfriends mum shopping, make everyone beverages, go shop, clean the dog crap in the backyard, pay rent and try and find education. In all honesty my boyfriend does things to like give his mum money and stuff, but I feel like I do a lot more (he is her carrer by the way so it's not really fair I do more than he does) then again he has a lot going on for himself like trying to find work etc etc. On one of these days where I had stayed up all night my boyfriends mother called me to go out with her, and for once I said no, she got angry with me, and when I explained to her how depressed I felt and how tired I was she said it was bullshit and that I just wanted to be with my boyfriend and lay in bed, she called me a waste of space, my boyfriend then woke up and stood up for me. 

I can not stand up for myself as I would either flip like I did with my own mother which landed me in a police cell and then get me kicked out, and I guarantee both my bf and his mother would argue with me. 

This doesnt happen constantly appart from me doing a lot, but there are a lot if arguments. Not to mention the thoughts I have sometimes that lead me to break down and cry. I love my boyfriend dealy and I think he treats me well, we go out sometimes to the cinema, we sometimes play games together, we cuddle and so on and so for. I get along with his mother sometimes as well. 

I am told a lot that I should leave and sometimes I occasionally think about it after an argument. 

Sometimes I'm in the wrong too, I get upset when my boyfriend goes out, because I worry about him, I overreact at some things like when me and my boyfriend are play fighting. 

But sometimes I can have a friendly conversation with someone and i cant say certain things or if I dont say things my boyfriend and his mum get angry. I cant have my boyfriends password to his phone or social media but he has mine and neither can I really talk to any boys or such. 

Things aren't bad, I'm just saying what bad has happened, at the moment I need advice as to what to do because I'm getting to the point where I am quite suicidal but living for my boyfriend. 

I dont know what to do",16Jul2019,2
632,"We have been best friends for about a year now, but we've known each other for 4 years. She never texts first in general with most people, so I didn't think of it as a big deal. 

Our conversations are always fun and aren't usually dry, but I always start them. We usually text daily. We hang out often our friendship is strong. 

I decided to see how long it would take for her to text first, and I am not going to text her until she does. I was hoping it would take a day or two, but it has been well over 2 weeks.

636,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

Hi all, 

4 months ago, I moved 1,000 miles away. My job there offered to transition me to a remote position instead of having to find someone to replace me. Flattering, right?

I've noticed recently that I seem much busier, behind, and overwhelmed than I have been in the 2.5 years I've worked for the company. I can only assume I'm not working as efficiently now that I'm in my home instead of physically at the office. 

I made some adjustments already... I made myself a daily routine, same as if I were going to the office. I shower, drink coffee, dress in business casual clothes, wear pants (Working in your underwear is freaking amazing, LMAO), etc.

I have a designated office that keeps the bulk of the house out of sight so I'm not stressing over housework. Even so, I'm responsible for answering the phones so I don't step away from my desk at all. 

How can I get my focus back? I *literally* replaced 3 people when I was hired, so my workload is heavy and falling behind causes a horrible domino effect that is hard to come back from...

Any tips or advice I'm not aware of?

TL;DR I need tips on how to maintain my A+ job performance after transitioning to a remote position 4 months ago.",16Jul2019,1

There’s one girl in particular who I’d even consider my best friend. We all met because we’re fans of a particular singer and that singer will be having a concert in the U.S. soon. My best friend and I both got tickets and are excited that we can finally meet in person. She suggested sharing a hotel room to save money and to have even more time to spend together and I thought it sounded like a good idea. When I brought this up to my parents though, they freaked out. I’m paying for all the costs of my trip and they said they’d pay for my hotel room if it meant I didn’t have to share with a stranger. I understand their concern, but like I mentioned earlier, we’ve been talking nearly every day for months now. I trust she won’t do anything dangerous but even though my parents believe she is a girl my age (we’ve shared pictures and talked on the phone) they don’t trust her. Am I being irrational in thinking it wouldn’t do much harm to sleep in the same room or do my parents have a point?

645,"I’m a 19 year old girl and for as long as I can remember my mum and dad have always drank and smoke. My mum and dad drink around 2 litres of alcohol every day 7 nights a week despite health concerns, as well as smoke. They don’t class themselves as alcoholics as they assume alcoholics drink during the day time up until evening. When my mum has to stop drinking (if she takes a course of antibiotics) she tends to not be able to sleep well, she gets night terrors as well as the sweats in the night. When I was around 7/8 my mum and dad typically went to sleep around 5am in the morning (they were unemployed) this meant that they never got up until 5 in the afternoon. This resulted in me and my brother not being able to make food for ourselves and there was also no food in the fridge or cupboards so we couldn’t eat until they got up, and even when they got up in the evening we only ate toast. This also took a toll on my mental health as my mum and dad were verbally abusive towards each other which resulted in me crying all night. Fast forward to 2019, my mum is employed and spends 1/2 of her wages on alcohol and cigarettes combined. My dad has a car business but it doesn’t seem to be going well as there isn’t many customers so he isn’t raking in any income at the moment. My mum and dad still prioritise their horrible habits over everything else. I’ve lost nearly a full stone in 3/4 month simply due to the fact that they never buy food in the house. I’ve currently left college and looking for a job to be able to support myself. My brother currently has a job so he can financially support himself but my mum gives him money when he asks for it but when I ask she simply complains. I can’t stand being around my parents when they’re drunk it simply infuriates me because of the way they act and how they slur their words. I feel like I’m the only normal person in the house that can see what’s going on. My advice is has anyone else struggled with anything like this, and is it possible to be an alcoholic if they don’t drink during the day time. I wish there was a solution to it all but they’re 99% not going to stop their habits and I’m going to continue suffering.

648,"I don’t usually go for advice from strangers, but I was wondering if anyone had gone through anything similar:
I have this friend I really like from church. She’s been talking to another guy and she says she really likes him (obligatory height difference for Reddit even though she doesn’t care about looks and all that: him 6’1” &amp; myself 5’6”). He’s really spiritual and is very active in his church (I’m pretty active at ours and I’m always seeking to grow my relationship with God, but I’ve been busy with classes). They’re not officially dating yet.
Should I tell her that I like her before they start dating? Would it be imposing?
She’s unlike anyone else I know (I don’t know many girls in the first place though so take this with a grain of salt). She’s so strong and independent, she truly loves God, she loves art, and I think she’s mildly interested in what I’m studying (robotics and tech). 
Both of us are part of a very close knit group, the other person being my best friend. She said a long while back that she’d never think of either him or I as dating material, but a while later they told me that they had considered dating because they both came to realize that they liked each other. Ultimately they decided not to date though. That whole situation made me feel like crap though. I was trying to see what in particular made him attractive to her and what it is in me that prevents that. “Why not me,” kinda deal.

I’ve not told her anything yet because I’ve been afraid that if we were to break up, that it might make being friends impossible (I know that many people manage to stay friends, but what if). 
She is incredibly intelligent, creative, and absolutely kind. In all honesty, as it stands she could probably do better than me (fortunately she doesn’t care about looks too much), but I don’t think it should be for a lack of trying. I don’t want to hate myself for never seeing if she would even say yes to a date.
If this were someone else I’d probably come up with the perfect answer, but I can never see the answers for myself. I’ve been praying, but I’m not exactly getting a burning bush telling me, “Yeah! Totally! Go for it! Ask her out!”

I asked my dad if he thinks I should at least tell her I like her and he basically said yes. 

They aren’t dating yet so should I let her know that I like her? 
Should I let her know at all?

The guy who lives in the apartment above me is nice, that being said he is nosy and too much for me. He will go outside when I go outside just to chat. I went to my car to grab something one day and turn around and he's just standing there by the main door.

 I literally called my dad just so he wouldnt talk to me and when I went inside he followed right behind. My husband and I are too nice to be mean to him but I feel like I can't even go outside or walk my son to the park without fear with he will come outside or be outside and want to be in my buisness.

Lucas is constantly made fun of by everyone and I'm not gonna say that I haven't done my part either, but I've only toned it down to things that he is okay with. He doesn't have social media and my other friends continuously send rude messages on there behind his back.

658,"Hey all, 

I used to have a high level mgt position as I'm good with ideas and execution. I'm not very technical, but I know what needs to be done. 

I lost my job due to a family emergency and due to my level it was extremely difficult to get the same or lesser position. 

Eventually, I decided to change careers and got trained with a placement agency for an entry level job that has promising future and ability to climb the ladder. Technical expertise is gained with experience. 

My job agency told me they would revamp my resume and market me to get placed within 30 days. I was geeked bc I was basically homeless by month 6 of being out of work. I was living in a car for some time. 

The agency took like 2 months to place me. I was doing some gig work to survive. They told me I had to leave the state I was in and basically go to this really nice corporation. 

The day before I arrive they send me emails and basically I realize I'm f**ked. 

The ""revamp"" was total shit. They basically marketed me as a senior position with excellent work history. 

At this point I'm already in the job and I have to basically lie about the last job I was doing bc I really dont want to go back to being homeless. 

The project I'm working on is already underway and I was promised backend support.... now the agency won't even answer my calls for backend support. 

They were assuming I'd get acclimated within a month and they'd have plenty of time to guide me thru things. Unfortunately, I'm being asked to take up a task I've never done before and I'm afraid that my name will be tarnished. 

I dont know what to do and I dont wanf to come off as a liar... i never knew they would lie on me to land a contract with this client. 

My manager is awesome and I dont want to disappoint him. I'm at a loss. I really cant think right now bc I have been living rough for the past couple months and lack of sleep plus the move. It's a lot of pressure.  

I need a solution. Can anyone help?

659,"Hey guys, I have big need of advice, and I need to know if I was at all in the wrong for what I did. It's kind of a stupid situation, but I just need some clarification. 

So a little backstory, I knew my best friend for a year, we always hung out together, I'd spend a lot of money to make a bus trip to Seattle to see her and spend time with her, and she'd sometimes buy me food and we'd go for drives in her car. 

Well she invited me to a group chat with her and her friends who she had met personally. Keep in note I never met any of them personally as they were from different states that I had not been to. What I noticed in these chats, a lot of the time she's usually the center of attention. But it was different for me and this one dude. Well eventually me and that dude began to talk, and it escalated to us talking a lot on the phone. We both have a lot in common, and we hit it off pretty well. 

Well, I was straight up with her at first and told her ""hey, I've been talking to this guy a lot this past few days,"" and she got jealous(?) I eventually assumed she had feeling for him as she talked about him all day, talked about how ""if she could get a chance to fuck him"" and stuff like that, so I sort of kept my mouth shut that I sort of liked this guy. Nonetheless, the both of us began talking, we were just talking as friends. 

Well, eventually we did get our feelings across, and we did admit that we both indeed had feelings for each other. I wanted to see how things panned out before telling my best friend the big news as we were going to make it officially a relationship when we came to visit. Now, I'm a 20 year old, grown ass woman. I don't think, when speaking in the group chat, I'd have to announce that I was on the phone 24/7. I'd say what I was doing when they asked what's up, but I didn't think I needed to add that I was on the phone.

Well, she got mad at me for some God knows what reason, called me a liar even though I don't know what I was lying about. She says I hurt her. I understood, though I was still confused as to why she was mad at me since I didn't tell her that I was planning to be in a relationship as it WASN'T official yet. 

So, I understand on my part, I wasn't really reaching out to talk to her much, either through one on one or through group chat. I don't really like group chats since, as I said, they usually focus on her, and it annoys me. She tells me this, and I fully apologize,but yet she never made an effort to speak to me first. 

I kept apologizing, I offered to take her to the zoo, and to buy her a cute ring and some iHOP with the money I don't always have. I began trying to speak to her more often, but what annoyed me was when I did, she would give 1 word responses, and eventually talked about killing herself and dying. I told her I wouldn't want to see that because she was special to me, and that I would be sad. She told me she ""wouldn't mind seeing that"" even when she KNOWS for a FACT I am struggling real hard with depression. 

So I ignore her messages. And she gets angry. What I don't understand was, how come she takes back a person who literally dumped their friendship (my boyfriend's abusive ex) without a blink of an eye, but when I try to keep my life private from people besides family, I'm the fuck up and I'm the disrespectful one, and yada yada? 

I did unfriend her, on everything. She then blocked everyone (now unblocked) and is playing the victim saying we blocked her. I've only blocked her through text. 

She became the type of person she hated the most. I don't see why I have to tell her every aspect of my life when she has told me she has not told me everything about hers. So, am I in the wrong here?",16Jul2019,1

# [I apologize for the length of this post, but I want to make sure I include as many details as I can. Maybe that’s unnecessary, but I also just tend to be a very long-winded writer, so bear with me. I’ll include a TL;DR at the bottom and you can just go straight to that if you don’t need all the details.]

My sister graduated a few years ago from a very expensive private college (which my parents and student loans paid for) with two bachelor’s degrees in engineering: one nuclear and one mechanical; as well as an AS in physics. She is one smart woman! While she was in college she seemed very happy. She was always hanging out with friends: going hiking, spelunking, drinking at the local pubs, etc. She seemed very outgoing and rather bubbly. When she graduated, she got a job without much trouble at all and still seemed to be doing pretty well for herself. She had a nice apartment, adopted a dog and a cat, was making pretty good money, and overall seemed to be enjoying life. We visited her a few times and she seemed totally fine. About 9 months later, my parents paid her a surprise visit and found her depressed and her apartment in squalor - the animals were using her spare bedroom as a toilet and the whole thing was just a huge mess. My parents wanted to know what was wrong and she admitted that she had been laid off a few weeks prior. Well, that seems like a normal thing to be depressed about.. but now it has gone on for TWO YEARS. 

She insists that nothing else happened and that she was only laid off, but she is almost like a different person now. My parents moved her back home to help her out while she searched for a job, but she has done absolutely nothing since then. She barely leaves her bedroom, she hardly takes care of her animals OR herself, and she has made ZERO effort to find a job. All she does is play video games and talk to people on an online forum. Reminds me of me when I was an emo 14 year old. A phase that I grew out of a LONG, LONG time ago. She is 26 years old. 

We - my two sisters and I, the older brother - received inheritances from my late grandfather amounting to $25,000 each around the time that she moved back. Since then, my sister has relied solely on that to pay her bills, which include a car payment, car insurance, health insurance, and student loans (not to mention video games, a trip to see A BTS concert in another country, and who knows what else). Needless to say, it’s nearly gone now and she only has $500 left. My parents, who, like good parents, refuse to let my inactive sister crumble under debt, are at their wit’s end to not only figure out how to get her to get a damn job and get out of the house, but how to pay for all her stuff that she is imminently unable to afford. My parents are in their 60’s, and in the last two years they taken on a lot of unneeded stress and it is beginning to affect their health. My mom already had some serious heart problems which are exacerbated by stress and they have only gotten worse. It upsets me greatly because I love them dearly and want them to be around as long as possible, but I’m worried that my sister is going to usher them into an early grave. And she doesn’t even seem to care. Not only that, but we are all beginning to resent my sister, which is a sad thing to see. We’ve all mostly had good relationships with each other over our lifetime as a family. We’ve always been a very normal, level-headed group of people with no serious issues to speak of until now. My parents are wonderful, supportive, and kind.. always have been. We weren’t mistreated or anything.

When my sister is hanging out with everyone, she seems totally normal. She laughs, jokes, smiles, and seems generally happy.. When confronted about finding a job, she completely shuts down. She won’t respond to questions, won’t look anyone in the eye, and usually just goes to her room where she stays for hours on end. My dad has helped her to put in countless applications (she won’t do it on her own), but when they call her or email her to schedule and interview, she doesn’t respond. My aunt and uncle even had a friend who could basically HAND her a job.. all she needed to do was pick up the phone when they called and go to an interview - AND WHO IS THAT LUCKY?! I WISH that was all I had to do - but she couldn’t even do that. Friends of mine in F&amp;B have tried to hook her up with a regular job, but she won’t respond to them or even me if it is at all pertaining to employment. I can text her about a job but she totally ignores all of my messages.

We’ve had two “interventions” on her, where we all got together and let her know that we are HERE for her.. that we love her and that we will do whatever it takes to help her get out of this funk and get a job. We do our best to not make her feel like she’s being cornered or attacked. We’re all very mild-mannered, non-confrontational people, so it was very hard for us to even do this. We go around, each of us, and tell her how her behavior is affecting us and how we think it is affecting her. It is met with silence. And we ask her, “what’s wrong? What can we do?” Nothing. No reply, she just ignores us with the face of someone who’s being mildly inconvenienced. When pushed enough, she says that she’s depressed and flees to her room, and nothing comes of the intervention but more frustration, stress, and tears. We are all left wondering what the hell has happened to her to make her this way. Where did the outgoing, ambitious girl go and who is this sedentary slob left in her place? She still insists - *swears*, even - that nothing has happened. Nothing traumatic.

Eventually, my mom convinces her that therapy would be good for her and she agrees to go to an appointment and at least test the waters. She makes an appointment for her, and when it comes time to go she locks herself in her room and won’t come out. This has happened twice.

My theory is that she also has avoidant personality disorder, and to an extreme. She goes to such lengths to avoid any kind of discomfort whatsoever that she ends up doing nothing at all beyond playing games and laying in bed. As someone with social anxiety, I can understand this behavior and have even felt the same way at times.. but I’ve battled against it my entire life. I refuse to let the fear of discomfort hold me back and I wish she could do the same.

So.. what the hell do we do? How do we get her to understand that she is not only messing up her own life, but causing us all a huge amount of stress (especially my mother)? How do we get her to get a job? Or at least to go to therapy and confront the underlying cause for her inaction? The longer she is unemployed the harder it is going to be to get a job at all.

Some of you may suggest that my parents kick her out, but trust me they *will not* do that. My mom is considering reaching out to Dr. Phil, which I was unsure about at first, but maybe he can talk some sense into her if they can even get her out of her bedroom to go.

On behalf of my family, I will *greatly* appreciate an advice you have to offer. We have wracked our brains for two years and we have not a single clue how to help her.

**TL;DR:** My 26-year-old sister has been living at home with my parents for 2 years, jobless with three degrees, and carrying lots of debt and bills. My parents are struggling to figure out how to get her to get her shit together as well as how to take care of her if she doesn’t. The stress is causing my parents’ health to decline and their relationship with her to deteriorate. They will not simply kick her out. What can we do to help her?",16Jul2019,1
662,"Last night I asked the guy I'm dating to do something today, he was enthusiastic but couldn't tell me when we could see each other - he was going to be cleaning the kitchen at work in the morning. I thought he'd be finished by lunch and maybe see him around 6pm...nah, he's still there now and it's 7:30pm. 

I sent him a message about an hour ago to let me know when he's done and if we're still doing something tonight. When we go out on a Tuesday night it does tend to be late, but I'm concerned he's going to be too exhausted to do anything.

We don't get to see each other often, I might have to wait until next week if I don't see him tonight. I spent all day running about making sure I would be ready, and he didn't even need to go on to help out today so it's a bit frustrating he's been there all day while I've been waiting.

663,"After over a year of employment, it’s become very difficult to deal with one of my coworkers and this last week he told me something that can’t be unsaid.
My coworker is a very difficult person, there’s no way around it but I try my best to stay positive and understanding with him. From what I can gather he has a very tragic back story including abusive or neglectful parenting and now he’s stuck in what he calls a dead end job with countless health problems he can’t seem to get over. I try to help him find solutions to his problems like suggesting research on healthy diets that might help his health but it’s become clear he’s only purpose of starting conversation with anyone is to complain about his life. After that I decided to simply avoid him and keep his negativity out of my life. But recently I have accepted a leadership role at my job and have to talk to him multiple times a day because of it. Our conversations typically start with him complaining about a new symptom or financial problem he’s facing and follow with him saying his life is horrible or a new saying he’s developed “everyday I live is worse than the last” I can definitely tell he’s taken a turn for the worst and as much a she can be a negative person I still worry for him and his family. I let our supervisor know that he had definitely been saying some dark things and he assured me he would keep an eye on his behavior.I want him to get help but he’s the type that doesn’t trust doctors. 

Anyways before I ramble too much, this past week I had a conversation with him and it started in the typical negative fashion but I’m guessing to drive his miserable point him he starting talking about how much he hates our place of employment and how they treat him.  He than took it a step further and said “if I’m a terrorist in the future I would bomb or burn down every [employer] and the businesses associated with them” I quickly told him that’s a very serious thing to say and asked him if that was his true plans and he said “idk I can’t control where my life goes”

I guess I’m not sure how to handle this, I know I need to tell someone higher up but I’m worried the wrong action could send him spiraling and I’m one of the few people he talks to so he’ll know I’m the one that told, and I’m afraid for him and his family.",16Jul2019,1

I wish I would have tried harder to find anything, though. I started noticing odd things indicating my parents were having money problems, but didn't think it was urgent in any way, plus I figured they'd tell me something if I needed to know. I'm not exactly a kid who needs the truth hidden from them. Well my mom went to court on the 8th. I used the state's public court information system to look up what was going on. She had lied and told me it was something related to an old nursing job she had, patient related.

Turns out it is related to the house/mortgage. I found the judgement and it says ""Plaintiff shall have and recover from defendant: immediate possession of the premises known as (our address)"". So I guess we're getting kicked out. I confronted my mom about this today and she admitted what was going on. She implied that it wasn't a 100% sure thing that we were losing the house, but it seems pretty sure from that court document. Plus a police officer came to the door today.

Since we haven’t argued we haven’t really spoken much until yesterday when she said she had a problem.

Here's the truly annoying bit however, the company has been the worst regarding time scheduling. They'll have people come at random days and times of week, come hours after appointed times, to fix one thing here or there and then leave. (The workers are hired by the company so contractors I think? and even they are unsure of why the company sent them here). My family and I are getting fed up with all of this but don't have much of an option since our insurance company basically gave us a check to pay off this company. What the hell should we do at this point? We're very frustrated, please help!

P.S. Adding this here because I forgot to mention, whenever they do finish repairs it's done in an unsatisfactory manner where we have to ask them to come again to fix things.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/c5q62o/i_think_my_girlfriend_might_have_hurt_her/) is my original post.

As suggested, I got in contact with James family. I reached out to his Mother on Facebook and sent her a message that essentially said I was an old friend of her sons, I'd recently moved back to the location I'd seen him in last, and no one seems to have heard from him. I told her that everyone seems to think that James had moved back home, and was just wondering if that was true. I was blocked. 

Later that same day, one of his sisters got in touch and asked for my side of the story. I explained everything in my previous post and then some. His sister, we'll call her Jen, went on to inform me that she hadn't seen James in person since he left the church in 2006/7 and her last contact with him was a happy new year text in 2011. She said that he hadn't been in contact with their parents at all for a few years prior to 2011 and their relationship was very, very strained, as I'd suspected. However, Jen had been in contact with him via social media and text messages from 2009-2011. 

We agreed to meet up and plot out our timelines. They match up, and it seems that no one, not even his family, have seen James since 2011 when he disappeared. We've both done some more digging, and found out his old landlord actually remembered him. From what he remembers, there were a few noise complaints in the weeks leading up to his disappearance, and when he ghosted he hadn't paid rent for the month which was out of character. 

So, Jen and I reported James as a missing person. The police have been investigating and I made a statement about Chloe's odd behaviour. The police assured me that they'd talk to Chloe. So far, this hasn't happened, and I'm still living with her. It's a really uneasy living situation. I haven't told her I went to the police but it's only a matter of time before they come to speak with her. 

I'm not sure if I should tell her I've reported him missing. Any thoughts on the situation or suggestions for how to move forward would be really appreciated. Thanks.",16Jul2019,62

685,"TLDR: My neglectful mom is being abused by her wife and won’t leave her. Am I obligated to help her and how?

Apologies for the format, I’m on mobile. 

Some background: my mother, let’s call her Caren, started dating this woman, let’s call her Barb. They got together soon after she divorced my father and soon, Caren invited Barb to live with her. I was just about to start middle school and was excited to have more people to call family. 

Barb then started verbally and emotionally abusing me and treating me like her personal servant. To make matters worse, Caren would watch Barb abuse me. Making excuses about how Barb’s bipolar meds weren’t getting absorbed by her stomach, or her sinuses were acting up. It got so bad that I almost jumped off the bridge by our house, and into traffic. Thankfully my high school had a lesson that made me realize I was being abused and left to live with my dad. 

I thought that my leaving and suicidal thoughts would be a wake up call to her that she also needed to leave there, but she stayed. She also denies the abuse ever happened. 

Caren also cut ties with the rest of her family, save for one of her brothers.

Time skip to now. Barb recently threatened Caren with violence and while Caren was smart and had the police take her away and filed a thing for protection, they are now back together. 

After everything that has happened, I don’t think that she will ever leave Barb, and I don’t trust Caren as far as I could throw her. But as an abuse survivor and her daughter, I feel the need to help get her out of there.

Should I just be more active in inserting myself into conversations and plans? That’s definitely not in my nature to do. Or should I bring this up with my manager? If so, how should I approach it? I don’t want to cause any tension, but I don’t want any resentment to accumulate.

701,"So a few weeks ago my Dad (parents are divorced since I was around 1, both sides are remarried) got mad at my political posts and or responses to his political posts and sent me a long message in FB messenger that started out annoying but then there was a P.S. about how his father (my grandfather, recently deceased) was so great... even though he was literally never there for me, never sent cards, gifts, phone calls, nada. That would have been plenty to start a drag down fight from me, but then he tells me that he convinced my mother through his famed ""sales"" technique to not get an abortion, implying along the way that I basically owe my life, and the life of my children to him and this my mom didn't want me. All news to me. I responded that I totally support her right to choose and ultimately he must have been a totally shit husband for her to have ever considered it in the first place, and also that my grandpa's death meant literally nothing to me and that my great uncle (his uncle) was far more of a grandfather to me than he ever was. Apparently (according to my stepmom) he threw the remote across the room and was furious. He messaged me ""have a nice life"" and I responded ""don't be such a drama queen"". After which he blocked me and I haven't heard anything since. I talked to my stepmom via text but I am not sure what to do - I can't imagine him apologizing, and I certainly don't want to.

712,"So I’m recently experiencing episodes of derealisation, which is basically me feeling like I’m dreaming. It’s not as easy as it sounds, the feeling is very very suffocating. It feels like I’m observing everything from inside a bubble and my surroundings seem blurry, not in visually but like mentally. I try to convince my self that every thing is real but then the feeling hits me really hard and I get these irrational thoughts that I may have fainted. And when I try to talk during this episode I sometimes talk about my self in the third person. 

The first time this happened to me was a year ago during my exams when I pulled a total all nighter before my exam, like not even a second of sleep and a cup of coffee. But I am 100% sure that was because of sleep deprivation and that experience wasn’t that suffocating but it was trippy. 

More recently, a week ago I was smoking up (hash) with my friends and when I came downstairs with them I started feeling extremely disconnected and nothing felt real, I felt a weird numbness in my whole body and I was having extremely irrational thoughts like maybe I’m actually dead and this is my final dream and stuff like that. The experience was extremely suffocating because I couldn’t convince myself no matter what, that everything was real. I slept and it was all okay in the morning although not the best sleep.

 Two days ago, I was with my friends and we were planning on smoking up again, they pass me the joint and as soon as I took one puff, I felt that sensation creeping towards me gradually and I stopped immediately and it didn’t take over me and stopped. I drank that night but that didn’t cause any effect. 

The real problem was today. I was just casually hanging with my friends and eating out when I got hit by that feeling again. I thought I wasn’t going to survive and I didn’t want to drive my car and just wanted someone to save me and just take me home. I told my friends and they didn’t understand my situation fully although they tried their best. They made me laugh which gave me a grip on reality. 

I looked this up and initially attributed the episodes to the use of recreational drugs but after today’s experience I am very worried. Can you please help me avoid this? Or control this? I hate this sensation and I cannot bear it again. Thanks for any help in advance!!",16Jul2019,1

These crusty ass bitches went shopping in NNs room. They took a bunch of her jewelry and some clothes. They were asking N about ysl sunglasses and certain pieces of jewelry. 

At one point, one of the girls offered money for a straightener. They were shamelessly going through my dead sisters drawers and looking for things and taking whatever they wanted. They took all but one of her rings and when one girl saw that the other had 2 rings, she went back up to my sisters room to get another ring.

716,"I recently started a relationship with a woman who by internet standards you might consider to be pretty vanilla. She seems open to new ideas, but pretty by the books otherwise.

It's kind of apparent pretty quickly that I am not by the books myself. I don't value traditionally masculine things. I'm meticulous in my grooming. I'm keen on weight but don't care for muscles. I've slept with guys. I like cross dressing. And then some.

Now, I've told this woman about everything up to the crossdressing. She's been really curious about the guys thing, and I can't tell if it bothers her or she's interested. A part of me is afraid to chase her away but the other part of me recognizes these qualities as an essential part of my identity. In my mind, I think that it is more important to be honest with myself than to fit a mold I'm clearly not, even if that costs me the relationship.

That being said, I'm not sure when to bring somethings like this up. Here is my dilemma: It seems strange to bring up early on in a relationship, but it also seems maybe fruitless to hold off hoping for better results later.

719,"So I finished my first year of college in the united states recently and I never really had a lot of luck with guys in high school (had never been on a date, etc.). I had kissed a lot of guys before (im not american, so keep in mind cultural differences), and been attracted to/had crushes on many boys before, but i only had my first boyfriend my second semester of freshman year. 

The problem is, I feel like maybe I was trying to make something out of what wasn’t really there, since we were literally best friends before we dated. I did crush on him at some point but I feel like because everyone was telling me “it’s only a matter of time before it happens” those feelings might have gotten mixed up, because around a month in, I began to lose interest in him romantically. The relationship felt more like a friends with benefits situation, since we didn’t change our mannerisms and friendly habits, we just hooked up sometimes and called each other boyfriend/girlfriend. I’m pretty romantic, enjoy PDA, etc. so this was disappointing especially since I had wanted a boyfriend for so long. 

We broke up mutually and amicably over the summer and at first I felt okay, even relieved about it. But then after three weeks or so I began feeling nervous. I have literally never been attracted to girls before, but one day my brain decided that I could be bisexual or even a lesbian because of my one and only failed relationship. I’m pretty liberal, so I even entertained the idea. I took quizzes online, read accounts of people discovering their sexualities, and tried to see if I had ever even subconsciously been attracted to another girl before, but all my research (lol) pointed to me being completely straight, and I feel comfortable with the label. 

The problem is, now every time I see a movie/hang out with friends my brain keeps asking me if I find the women attractive. I can obviously aesthetically appreciate when other girls are pretty, especially since I do have a low self esteem and compare myself to other women physically quite a lot, but that’s really the extent of my feelings towards them. No desire or attraction whatsoever. I’ve been to a therapist and she says all of this is just a way to process the break up, and provide “reasons” (even if they’re nonsensical and not factual) for the reason it’s over, because I had placed so many high expectations on my first relationship that weren’t met, and rationally, I agree 100%. 

I just wish those thoughts would leave because I can feel them festering and I’m afraid they might affect my future relationships with guys and even my current relationships with my girl friends. It’s so weird because this all started out of the blue (I had never considered/thought about any of this before in my life) and now I’m worried it’s never going to go away :( I just wish I could go back a month in time so I could go back to not thinking about this and so I could continue to enjoy my break with friends and family.

About a month ago, my wife was out of town on business, my son was at my wife's parents house for the evening (he has dinner and sometimes spends the night there once a week), so I met up with an old college friend of mine visiting from out of town. She is a photographer and also identifies as a lesbian and she also knows my wife pretty well too. After a couple drinks, I confessed that our anniversary was coming up in a month and I didn't know what to get my wife. My friend suggests hey, what about taking some ""risque"" photos of yourself as your gift? We've been married for almost 10 years, so I thought hey this might be a good way to keep the fire burning. This quickly evolved into going back to our house, and having her take photos of me around the house. They ended up pretty trashy. I was kinda tipsy, and ended up getting pretty naked. Afterward my friend and I had a pretty good laugh about it. She sent me the photos a week later and I was pretty mixed on if I should send them to my wife. Firstly, she'd have a lot of questions about who took them and why. Secondly, I'm just straight up not sure if she'd enjoy them. Thirdly, I do not personally think the photos look good.

730,"Both of my parents were sexually abused as children. I do not consider my dad's behavior towards me sexually abusive, but it was and still is at times sexually inappropriate. 

The first time I remember feeling off about my dad's behavior was when I was 10. He tended to start with normal affectionate touch, like rubbing my back and increase it to the point where it felt like sexual stroking or fondling (either because it strayed into a sexual area like my inner thigh or just the manner of the touch). He once pinched my breast as a ""joke,"" and used to walk in to talk to me when I was in the bath until H.S. when my mom says she read him the riot act about this. It also had a exhibitionistic element, in that he used to open the door naked when I brought friends over in H.S. My dad once spanked me in front of a friend in a way I now think was sexually sadistic when I was 17, and way too old to be spanked on the butt. 

Something that really bothers me about this still is that this behavior was always directed at me and never my sister. My mom and my sister both acknowledge that my dad has boundary issues but think I am making a problem out of nothing.

I now have 2 daughters, ages almost 1 and almost 3. I don't know whether &amp; how to overtly set boundaries with my dad about what kind of physical contact is and is not ok with my kids. I should say I live out of state and my kids only see my parents about twice a year.

Complicating this is that if I tell my dad something like ""hugs are okay, but stroking types of touch are not,"" I probably have to have the same rule for my mom, their grandma. My mom was always physically affectionate with me growing up, and I enjoyed that. She would be hurt if I insisted on limiting her contact to hugs. 

So, I was thinking that, and then started going down a whole rabbit hole in my mind, second guessing my mom's physical affection with me, and wondering if there was also something weird about it. She did tell me that I was not pretty, but I was sexy when I was little--like starting in first grade--and this confused me back then. I would say she patted me like a cat basically, never in sexual areas, and always in a way that made me feel good, such as tickling the insides of my wrists. It wasn't ""bad touch"" but I now am unsure whether I should ask her not to touch my kids in a similar matter. It is so difficult for me to know whether the way my mom touched me caused me any problems or was just normal affection (undoubtedly the ""you're ugly but sexy message did). Again it was only me and not my sister.",16Jul2019,0

I now have to decide what to do for high school. I can either do online school, or go to a public school. I would really like to do online school. I am not socially stunted, Im pretty normal. Its just a big leap to go from were i was to 1,300+.  i just scared and confused. Ive had people tell me that they dont like this public school and people tell me its okay. My family is heavily suggesting i go to public. I asked if i could try online for a year and they said thats a bad idea because ""i wouldnt know anyone if i went later'"" im just really alone. thank you for your help.",16Jul2019,1
739,"Just got hit with the news today that my mom is going to have to go for surgery. Initially I thought she said surgery on her throat, which scared the fuck out of me. I thought she was going to need a tracheotomy, but then she clarified to say that doctors found a small growth and that she would need to get it removed but that it wasnt her throat.


I've dealt with cancer in the family before... but not with my own parents. Given that I don't know if she's downplaying how small or big the growth is, nor do I know when she is scheduling this or ANYTHING like that.. how do I keep myself mentally intact while being there for her? I have a tendency to overplay things that aren't big issues, but this is cancer we're talking about. I don't know the survival rate, I don't know where they're operating all I know is that they found a small growth and that it can be removed. My parents have been fighting a lot lately, threatening about a divorce, meanwhile my mom works late a lot for work and I'm in my final year of college. I really don't know what to do other than tell her I love her and spend time with her. I just... I hear ""cancer"" and I think the worst.",16Jul2019,1
740,"I'll start by saying I know I need to be in therapy, I'm waiting for my insurance to kick in. Al-anon meetings near me are impossible to get to right now since I have no child care.

I am the black sheep of my family because I don't use drugs, or as my family would say, ""I'm too good for them"". Both parents are alcoholics and have recently taken to using heroin/fentanyl and anything they can get their hands on; older brother isn't using (pills) currently; and younger sister is recovering (but frequently relapsing) heroin/fentanyl/meth/alcohol user. She's overdosed over a dozen times, been to more rehabs than I can count, and served jail time. She has a felony and the judge was so sick of seeing her probation violations that they cancelled her 5 year probation 3 years short. I cut my parents off 7 years ago, they don't know my kids and I don't ever plan on letting them. I don't have much of a relationship with my brother, but my relationship with my sister is a problem.

I've allowed her to cross so many boundaries that I don't think they're there anymore. SO much is expected of me, but when she promises me something she ""just forgets"". I want to help her, I think she has potential to thrive and enjoy her life, but I see zero effort on her part unless it's to get high, drunk, or have sex. I want to cut her off, but I fear the worst. Our parents use her for drugs and abuse her daily. Our dad is emotionally incestuous and sexually assaulted her as a child. I've been her fall back for too long and she has stolen from me multiple times. I know this is all over the place, but I'm emotional right now.

A few months ago me and a buddy of mine lost a lot of hours, I lost half of mine, the reason I was told was that it was slow and we didnt have many animals coming in so they didnt need us to have as long of shifts.

Needless to say this pissed me off, and so im looking for help with what I should say, im pissed so I dont want to come off like a firework but I still want them to know that I wont stand for this.

745,"Sorry if that title comes across as offensive or doesn’t make sense, but please let me explain.

For more of my childhood I was neglected and abused by both of my parents, on the grounds that I was “different”. I was raised to believe I wasn’t like anybody else, and should therefore be punished just for existing. It doesn’t help that I have 3 siblings who were all cared for and loved, while I was ignored.

At 14 years old I told a friend I was suicidal and she told a teacher who called my parents. My parents then backed off because they didn’t want to get arrested for child abuse. However, I have lived with many restrictions since then. I am 18 now and still trying to be able to live in my own self expression.

I am a creative person but me creating is considered taboo. If I did something creative as a child I’d be shut down for it. But nowadays if I do something creative they won’t force me to stop. They just try and push me away from doing it. This also goes for self expression.

I feel like my parents are trying to punish me as if I’m some kind of evil lifeform that isn’t human.  It’s like I’m a minority and they’re oppressing me for existing. What’s hard is that I haven’t met anybody who’s been punished like this to this extent simply for existing. Is there a name for what I am? Somebody who’s self expression and creativity causes some sort of negative effect?",16Jul2019,2

748,"Two years ago i dated a girl online for like, one month. I was 18 and she 16. Everything was nice and all, the only problem was that she refused to show her face. In that time i didn't care why, i just wanted to see what she looked like. In retrospect i was too stupid to fall in love with some stranger online, but she was a real girl with real voice and stuff, so anyway...

Ours relationship quickly became a mess, two difficult persons fighting for trivial stuff.

Then we broke up tho we still were friends. But her jealousy really made me mad, so we discussed again and again, until one day shit was so intense i blocked her from all social medias. I blocked and deleted her number from my phone so we would never talk again. Finally i was free.

I moved on and buried the feeling of guilty for that abrupt decision. Maybe what i did did hurt her, but that's it... i didn't intend to talk to her anymore, so...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But today, all of sudden, she sent me a message with another facebook account saying she wanted to talk to me and be my friend again. 

She said she uses to DREAM about me a lot and i was like ""wtf"" so out of curiosity i replied. Stupid!

We talked a little, i apologized and she did the same, so i gave her my number.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she sent a bunch of audios with a loud song in the background. Her voice was almost inaudible. She was coughing a lot, saying that she DREAMS about me

That the band playing in the background REMINDS her of me

Then she apologized for all the cough, saying it was her friend smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

So i, creeped out, asked what kind of dreams and where was she

She said she was at home in her bedroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

So she's smoking whatever that is with her friend in her house! I asked her what she was doing, what she have been doing all this time, but she refused to answer. She only wanted to know if i was ok and then she said bye. 

I didn't replied yet, i'm freaked out, i don't know what to do! There's a girl on the other side of the country obsessed with me while i was living my life clueless all this time!

&amp;#x200B;

Now i'm 21 and she must be 18 or 19. Did i leave her with a trauma?  Is she on drugs or smoking? Wtf are her parents doing,

755,"I'm currently in an executive position of an organization on my college campus and manage the chairs of a committee. The hierarchy goes me, then the two chairs, and then a handful of committee members. I've been working with the two chairs (let's call them john and bob) for a few months now in preparing for the upcoming school year: One of them (john) I have no problems with and we're actually good friends now. The other chair (bob), however, has been slowly making me feel uneasy.   


I've worked with Bob in the past and there have been times where they've blatantly lied to me about inconsequential things. One time I asked Bob if they wanted to grab food with me and some other people in our organization, and Bob said no because I'm tired and am going to take a nap. But less than 30 min later, Bob posted on social media a picture of them grabbing food with someone else. I was a little surprised since Bob knows I'm a very straightforward/impersonal type person and if they said they had plans/didn't want to grab food with us, I would have understood.  


Anyways, fast forward, I had assigned the chairs to meet with someone and Bob suggested a time that worked best for him and John and the other person they needed to meet with. When I followed up with their meeting, it turned out Bob didn't attend the meeting and left John to take care of everything. But the meeting was held on a Sunday night and Bob's excuse was ""I was stuck in a work meeting."" Bob works as a part-time intern at some random company: When I heard Bob's excuse, I was suspicious because (1) Bob's just an intern so I doubt that would ask him to work on a Sunday night and (2) Bob suggested the meeting time so they knew they'd be free at that time.  


One last thing is that Bob's been given an assignment for about a month and a half now: But just last week, Bob started to hint at the fact that they can't finish the assignment because they're ""too busy."" But the assignment is something that you could work on for a couple hours on a weekend for a few weeks and you'd be done (I know because I've done it in the past). But they implied they were uncertain about their ability to finish the assignment: I told them to keep the effort up and check in with me in a couple of weeks.   


In essence, Bob has been showing increasing signs of laziness and dishonesty which is making it hard to work with them; I don't know whether I should confront them, in the case that my suspicions were ungrounded. What should I do? Am I just being paranoid/looking for reasons to blow up on Bob?  


I just feel as though I'm being taken advantage of/Bob is treating me as though I don't notice them being dishonest/lazy, and it does not feel great, and I don't know what to do.

756,"I just had a job interview and i may have competition. The first thing the hiring manager told me was he was impressed with my initiative throughout the whole process. He mentioned not many people walk in handing in hard copy cover letters and a full resumes. I feel like I did well since I was able to gear the interview into more of a conversation. It wasnt just question answer, question answer, question answer. And i also got to talk about skills from my current job i could bring to the group. He said he appreciated my honesty as well after the interview since I talked to him about having high functioning autism. I have the prerequisites for the job im assuming otherwise idk y hed interview if i didnt. The only thing im worried about is my age. Im 17 and that job is normally for those entering college. He said hed be willing to give it a try if i get hired and wouldnt mind starting at square one knowing i dont need square one. I feel like it went really well overall. Im just worried about my competition. 

Would they hire them instead of me because they can give more than 4days a week including weekends? Will they hire them instead of me because theyre older thus more trust? Will they hire them instead of me because they use higher vocabulary? Will they hire them instead of me because they answered with what they’re looking for? If yes what were their answers? 

I need to stop stressing. I worked hard to get to this point and someone had to have seen that. I need to shut off until the end of this week or next week. It was a big risk to tell them I’ll be out of town for the rest of summer after July28th.

I also work 1 day a week at a local Kroger seeing as construction can be unreliable for work sometimes, I think it's smart to keep my foot in the door in case I do need the money.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways, on the the advice. I want to find a fulfilling career. (as we all do) and I guess my lack of fulfillment comes from me dreading carpentry work, and not getting very many hours to operate, I'm still pretty new at it. but once excavation is done, who knows when there will be more operating work to do. All the people I meet around my age seem to be going to college, but I've always been scared of college debt. I was also home schooled so I'm not sure how I well I would keep up with the content.

I tried learning programming for about 2 months with some online classes. I feel like after those 2 months I can say It's not really for me, cause I tend to like work that I can just come and work away at, and not think much about it (operating?). But not as dull as factory work. So at this point in my life I'm not sure what I should do. I kind of feel paralyzed. I still live with my parents, so my near future goals right not are to -

Before you wonder why I dropped out, my family went through a devastating accident involving my father and we lost everything, there were affairs, my brother left us, and now we are sort of back to normal with everything but there’s a constant black cloud in every room. As far as college, I work full time to help take the burden off my parents after we lost our home, and so I can’t afford not to work during school. All this and a few other things led to me dropping out in my senior year and I regret it but there’s nothing I can do until I get back on my feet.

Now for the job portion, I’ve been in restaurants for 8 years, I’m now 22. I have been in this particular spot for 3 years, and I’m trying desperately to find a way out. I’m well paid and well known in town for what I do, and I love my coworkers but it’s just not the same and I know we aren’t going to last as a business.

What are some ideas to help me step out of this funk and join the real world, maybe a kickstarter to get me going in the right direction? I’m doing just fine, I’m happy and I have food shelter clothing etc. but it’s just time for a change. I have to start moving forward.

I am applying to the police department here soon, but I’m about 60 pounds overweight so I’m trying to use this summer to work hard and eat right come fall I’ll put my 2 weeks in. That’s the plan so far.

768,"I have been working at my job for 10 months. My boss is the only other person in accounting with me, he is the sr accountant and I am the jr accountant.

I noticed from the very beginning that he is not great at explaining things, and I often have to rephrase the same question multiple times to get an answer from him. Its like he thinks I am asking a different question.

Thats not a huge deal, but lately, since he has been teaching me a lot of new things and I am asking a lot of questions since it is all brand new, he has been starting to be a little rude about it.

He’ll say things like “I just told you” a lot, even though he definitely didn’t already tell me it.

Often when I ask a question, he’ll pause, kind of laugh, and say something like “What do you mean? I just said....” with the air of “How do you not get this?”

It makes me constantly question whether I was really listening closely or forgetting things, and makes me look stupid in front of my coworkers (many of who sit right next to us and can hear everything we say and probably think I’m an idiot).

At first I thought it was me, but I have never had this problem before and don’t have this problem with any other employees. For all I know, I am being an idiot, but I don’t need to hear that in his voice, I just need him to answer my question so I can do my damn job.

How do I talk to him about this? I’m afraid any conversation will come off as “you are bad at explaining things” which I cannot imagine will come off well. I imagine that if I ask him to say things like “I just told you that” less often, he would just respond with “Well you need to listen better.” Because of course he thinks he is being clear.

How do I phrase this? How do I talk to him?",16Jul2019,1
769,"I'm not normally one to write up a post for this sort of stuff, but it's a serious topic and I don't know what to do. To give some context, I am a twenty-two year old man, and I've been working since I turned eight-teen. I've worked in a lot of fast pace environments from kitchens to popular retails and to date, work in a large and popular casino chain. 

However, none of these jobs has paid a wage that one could live off of without having to either starve one's self or work double shifts every day until I eventually die. Due to this, I haven't managed to move out yet, and have nobody to move out with for a variety of reasons(mainly because everyone went to college while my poor ass went to get a job). 

The reason why I'm writing this is for career advice. At the moment, I work for security and only make $11/hour USD. The cheapest apartments I've been able to find have all ranged from $900 to 1000+. Working a fourty hour week makes this an impossible option, and I can feel my life stagnating by the day. I work with a lot of folks who are retired and have the job simply to have something to do, and many of them tell me about how they worked their asses off, and everything just kind of...Worked.

But I've been working my ass off for four years in multiple jobs, each one paying a bit more than the last but none paying enough for me to become independent. I'm at a loss, and their talk has begun to make me feel like a total failure. Some of them saying they were making 100,000 a year at MY age!

I managed to get in a transnational corporation as a Junior Social Media Marketer without any prior university education (I had a somewhat good case of my own business in the internet, which earns me about 130% of my counry's average salary per month passively). Having no education in this industry is not a big deal. It's more about experience. 

I felt I got stuck at home after 2 years of freelancing and I thought working at office at least a year should be a good experience for me, so I can change job for a better one or start my own big business. But after a month I feel like leaving this place. My managers are quite toxic, I can't ask them for help without having passive-agressive replies, we sit in the same room, in fact, my boss is across the table, but talking in real life is real pain in ass, all replies or dialogues are full of passive-agressive expressions,even though she have to mentor me. 

So I am not sure, should I endure for at least half a year and then leave, I don't think it will give me a good working experience, in fact, I think sometimes I know how to do things better, but I'll be able to say that I worked with big brands and worked in a such big company (it's a part of 1 of the top 3 multinational media and digital marketing communications) company), so I feel I could find a job much easier after half a year, especially if I want to move in Project Managing. 


So, I am not sure, should I endure and suffer half a year to get ""experience"" and start looking for Junior Project Managing positions (they usually require some working experience in marketing agencies) or try to find another Junior job, but in a company with better managing, though less famous?",16Jul2019,1
773,"I'm a straight man, and I don't know why this is but I have a hard time building lasting relationships with other men. I find women are much easier to get along with. This has often been a problem in past relationships because some of my girlfriends would get jealous of my female friends.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've had maybe 2 or 3 close male friends in my life and each sort of faded into the background as we got older and chose different paths in life, yet I've managed to remain friends with several women. During my last breakup, it was a female friend whom I called to vent on the phone for hours, and it was a different female friend who took me out for drinks and food and made sure I was ok. 

&amp;#x200B;

I often try to include my guy acquaintances in things I do but it always feels weird, especially when hanging out one on one. I'm not a big fan of football, baseball, basketball, etc. We never have anything to talk about. I recently started to notice that whenever I go out with friends I'm often the only guy in the room, with the exception of someone's boyfriend, who will often look at me with suspicion (thinking I'm either gay, or trying to bang their gf). 

&amp;#x200B;

None of my female friends have said anything about this, but I feel like women who don't know me find it weird if I invite them out with my friends and all my friends are women, or if I have a dinner a home, and the only people that show up are women. To make it worse, some of these women also invite their female friends so the contrast is even more drastic when I'm the only guy.

I know plenty of women that only have male friends and growing up I always find it weird, but now I find myself in their shoes and feeling a bit awkward about it.",16Jul2019,2

But always with this jam business, I see new labels consistently made that have imagery I know for a fact they did not create. I also know they did not get permission to use the picture as her general strategy is Google and find one they like.

I have tried and tried and tried to tell them how fucked up and wrong it is to use someone else's work, particularly if you are using that work on your product you are selling. I've sent God knows how many articles about copyright laws and the dangers of doing this but they just do not seem to get it. Last night I saw some new labels and low and behold, it is art they found on the internet once again.  

The issue is, I don't know who the original artist is, and my stepmother dislikes me so much she won't allow any sharing of information with me. My dad, being the idiot he is, is listening. I don't know what else to do. I really don't care if they get a lawsuit or not. I'm just disgusted they are using an artist's work without permission on sellable product.

779,"1.5 years ago me (25 M) and my girlfriend (24) moved city as she is doing a masters degree.

She's coping well, as you'd expect she's made friends on her course etc. I  work in an office where the next youngest person is 40. I do not find it hard making friends (in fact I pride myself on being able to walk into any group of people and getting along with them, but the people at my current job aren't who I'd want to go out for a beer with etc) but at my current job it's not possible.

My light at the end of the tunnel has always been that when she finishes her course we would move closer to home, I'd get a new job and I'd be closer to my old friends. She now would prefer to stay where we are (because she's absolutely smashed her course and the job opportunities here are endless, I am so fucking proud of her).

I've gone from feeling popular and always on the go to forgotten about by my old friends and have no real opportunity to make new friends.

I've just started a part-time job and I was wondering whether I should use new income to buy things I don't have(new clothes, shoes, headphones, skincare, pillows etc.) or replace what doesn't work(laptop battery, new phone). The problem though, is that I own so few things that if I were to buy all the things I could rationally say would make my life easier it would push back my exams by like 1.5 months.

I want to earn an IT certificate. I've already studied it so I'm more or less ready, give or take a week of studying. But it costs $150 per exam for $300 total. While I have confidence in taking the exams, the price still makes me leery. But it's a way into helpdesk roles and hopefully a career in IT.

I could possibly pass the first exam and only take the second exam after I get a job offer. It would be a half-measure and give myself some flexibility, but there is no guarantee of passing, no matter how confident I am.

The reason I want to take the exams so quickly is because I have studied for a long time and know the content. I also know that'll it'll probably take a 2-3 months to acclimatize to my current job.

796,"I'm going to start out by saying I'm not a big fan of vacations (especially when they're with family), I'd rather stay home playing video games or making music and whatnot. My brother also shares this view.

&amp;#x200B;

About half a year ago my dad asked me and two of my siblings (and my sister's bf) if we wanted to go on a vacation in the mountains. He didn't give many details aside from the rough location. We agreed because it sounded kinda fun, plus he was pretty pushy about it. Fast forward to last month, my sister couldn't make it due to school. Now it's just going to be my dad, his wife (I refuse to say stepmom), my brother, and me.

&amp;#x200B;

We found out a month ago exactly where we're staying and how long. It's planned to be seven nights (six in a cabin, the last night in a nearby city). We're due to leave in a week. That sounds uncomfortably long for the four of us in the mountains with no mountain biking allowed, no internet, and no cell service. I asked my dad what we had planned and he said we could go hiking and that's basically all they had planned. I suggested we bring playing cards and some board games and he agreed. I feel like my brother and I didn't really have a chance to talk about how long it was because we had assumed things were actually planned and there were more people coming. The length of the trip wasn't really talked about and the reality of how it's going to be has just become clear since we're close to leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically the only things we'll have to do is hiking and tabletop games, plus a few of the amenities that are small activities. In the past our vacations will hit a wall quite frequently due to lack of planning, so my siblings and I end up going on our phones (reddit, etc) to pass the time. My dad and possibly his wife end up getting frustrated because we're on our phones, and they come up with some half-assed ideas of what we should do off the top of their heads that aren't very fun, and I feel like we get pressured to come up with things to do when we'd rather just stay on our phones.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I would enjoy this vacation if it was just three nights, maybe four. The way I see this going is we're gonna hike a lot the first few days and then run out of things to do, which will probably lead to forced activities, lots of sitting around, and tension for the last half of the trip which is going to drag on and siphon the remaining light out of my soul.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since my parents divorced, I feel like my dad always wants to spend time with us, even if nobody is going to have fun. I understand him wanting to be with us and I put in the effort to see him regularly, but it honestly sometimes seems selfish of him to be wanting to take our time that could be better spent for his own obsession.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the advice I'm asking for is if there is anything that could be changed about the trip for the better or if it would be worth it to communicate any of this to my dad. Ideally I would love it if the trip got shortened to three or four nights, because I don't want to leave my live for very long. If they were to cancel the trip now it would be too late to get a full refund, so I don't know if the booking could easily be shortened. I don't wanna bail because I want to keep my promise of going, but I would be fine if the trip somehow got cancelled.

&amp;#x200B;

Should my brother and I even bring any of this up to my dad? Would it just make things worse if he knew we didn't want to stay the whole time but the trip couldn't be cancelled? I'm 85% sure he is going to get offended if we tell him. I know it's not super cool of us to want to change it so close to the departure but I feel like it was unfair of him to lock the handcuffs on us before we even knew exactly what we were getting into. Plus he's blind to seeing that the trip is gonna suck when we run out of things to do with nothing planned.",16Jul2019,1
797,"Hi,
Earlier today, my dad called to tell me that he and his girlfriend of three years broke up two weeks ago. She wouldn’t tell him why - she just said that she needed to think some things over and take a break. 
My dad has dated a lot of women in the 18 years I’ve been alive, none of them have been as amazing as Keri. He’s really broken. I’ve never heard him so sad before. It breaks my heart to know that he’s hurting so much. 
Personally, I don’t think this is permanent. Just before this happened, they were talking about moving in together and getting married. Plus, my dad is the only real father figure that her young son has. 
They were so perfect for each other. I really think that she just needed to take some time to make sure that all of this is right. She’s a mental health specialist, so I also think that she removed herself because my dad has a lot going on right now and she didn’t want to be a distraction. 
My dad thinks it’s over for good and that there’s no hope. I don’t know what to do to help him. I have Keri’s number and was toying with calling her myself, but it’s really not my place to interfere to that degree. 
I come back from my vacation tomorrow and don’t know how to get him back on his feet. This really destroyed him.",16Jul2019,2

799,"Sorry if this is long! I just need some advice on what to do. 

I’m a senior in college and about three months ago I got a part time job at a grooming/boarding facility as a kennel technician. It was honestly a godsend because it helped me out of a tight spot financially. 

However, there’s been so many issues with this place that today was the final straw and I have no idea what to do. 

A heads up, I have severe anxiety and depression that I’ve struggled with for a long time. I go to therapy and I’m on medicine but working with people can tend to heighten those problems. I use to work two jobs in high school and then dropped to one my first two years of college, but after my grades were so bad I decided to seriously focus on school and quit my old retail job that I didn’t hate but I didn’t love. Which was a mistake that led me to where I am now. 

Anyways, I thought that this job might be a nice change of pace because I’d be working with animals instead of people. And the animals have been great so far! I’ve only been bitten by two dogs (one was just super scared, understandably, and the other was blind) but all in all I’ve loved the animals and the relationships I’ve formed with them. 

However, the issue lies with the owner. It’s a small business that only has four employees. The owner is the groomer, she has an assistant groomer, then there’s me and another kennel technician (who literally does nothing at all so I end up doing everything). It doesn’t sound bad until you see the amount of animals that are there under our care. 

A normal shift for me is 7-5, and I work that usually 6 or 7 days straight. On my days off I get called in and usually end up staying the full day. I also work by myself until the owner and the assistant groomer comes in, which isn’t until 10-11 o clock, and then the other kennel tech doesn’t come in until 12. So before they even come in I usually have to by myself: 

1) check the grooming dogs in for the day (they are all scheduled at different times which is very difficult when you’re walking a dog answering the phone and then having to check someone in who INSISTS that the dogs poof be kept on the tail)

2) let out boarding dogs, clean their suites, bedrooms, or kennel trays

3) feed the dogs 

3) answer the phone, schedule appointments

4) bathe the dogs that are supposed to be groomed 

5) see which dogs are going home or being dropped off to board with us for that day and plan accordingly (deep clean a suite or bedroom, make sure a kennel is prepared, or gather the stuff of the dog that has been staying with us and make sure it’s clean) 

6) bathe boarding dogs that are going home 

7) clean the whole building (sanitize tubs, food and water bowls, kennel trays, etc.) 

Which doesn’t really sound bad. But. We usually accept 12-14 dogs to groom a day, and currently we have 20 dogs boarding with us. 

So. Being the only person there to check out, bathe, clean, walk, feed, do laundry, answer the phone, make appointments, etc. has really started to take a toll on me physically.  Last week I went to doctor because I just felt like shit and I found out I was severely dehydrated and had to be hooked up to an IV. I’ve lost 10 pounds since working there because I don’t have any time to eat (like at all) and whenever I get home I’m so tired that all I do is sleep. 

I was hoping to try and keep this job as at least a weekend gig for when school started back until today happened. 

First, I was by myself like usual and I had forgotten that a boarding dog needed to be bathed until I got to him for his turn to walk outside and be fed and I saw on his suite tag that they had requested a bath before pickup. There was no pickup time (usually there is) so I had no idea when the dog was going home that day and I dropped everything to rush back and bathe him. I didn’t have time to wash his bedding or anything, and as soon as I finished I walked to the front to dry him off and I noticed his owner was waiting at the counter. She was very pissed (understandably so) and proceeded to curse and say that she had called yesterday insisting that her dog be ready first thing in the morning and that she had been waiting 14 minutes for me to get up there (because I’m the only one in the building, and we don’t have an alert system to let us know when a customer has arrived). I apologized profusely and offered to force dry her dog, after I handed back her bedding and food container, and then she gets mad at me because the food container was empty. I proceed to tell her that they had been fed that morning, and they had plenty of food. She retorted with “that’s what you should have said in the first place. I expect a full report when I come to pick up my dog.”  I politely said nothing and proceeded to force dry her dog. 

Well. Apparently, the cats that live permanently in our facility had thrown up by the grooming table and I didn’t see it because I was too focused trying to force dry her beagle. The beagle didn’t like the noise, most dogs don’t, and proceeded to run and i dropped the leash because my grip was lax which was my fault. He then runs in the throw up, tracks it everywhere, and I offer to clean up the dog but the owner has had enough. I manage to towel most of the throw up off of the dog while she proceeds to take her phone out and video me and the dog and then leaves after I check her out. 

I thought that was the end of it. 

I told my boss when she got in because I knew the lady would probably put a bad review online. My boss proceeds to pull up camera footage, she criticizes everything i did, tells me that it was mostly my own doing, and then gets upset because i didn’t check her out correctly. I ask her how I messed that up and she tells me that the owner was in the military and I didn’t give her a discount for it. 

The lady who came in never mentioned a military affiliation, she never showed me her ID, and nowhere on her paperwork did it say to give a military discount. So I was honestly baffled. My boss then says “I answered the phone yesterday while you were in the restroom, and I told her her dog would be ready first thing. I told you when you came out before you let the dogs out for the night to make sure that he had his bath first thing in the morning.” 

I, who couldn’t remember if she did as the days now blur together, simply nodded and said “Yes ma’am, that was on me. My bad.” It wasn’t written on our pickup time list what time he was going to be picked up. All it said was that he needed a bath and that he was leaving today. But again, I probably should have written it down immediately to remind myself when she told me yesterday and it would have prevented all of this fiasco. 

The lady who owned the dog then calls the business and wants to speak with my boss. She then tells my boss that I failed to give a proper report of her dog, her dog left covered in throw up (which was untrue because I used a towel to clean the dog off and offered to bathe him again for free but she was furious and refused), she complained that his nails weren’t trimmed (which was true, but that is not my job as I was not trained for grooming. That’s the grooming sides job- so they failed to trim the dog’s nails before they left yesterday), and then complains and states that I have no business working there etc. 

After the call, I get pulled into the office and chastised for everything that went wrong. I am told to do better, be better, etc. and to be early tomorrow for my shift if I need more time to do the job. 

I asked to leave because I was really stressed out. The owner let me and told me to relax after everything and she was super nice as I was leaving, she’d had a complete change of attitude. The second I got in my car I proceeded to cry the whole way home lol. Now that I’ve had a beer and relaxed I’m trying to figure out if I want to go back and try again, turn in my two weeks, or just straight up quit. I don’t know what to do from this point. Any advice on this situation is greatly appreciated.",16Jul2019,1

He has very rasping breath, cannot walk well anymore, coughs a lot. He is still a happy old man, but I feel like he could die any day now, at this point.

Now, while this is really sad for me and I am definitely not looking forward to it in any way (I grew up around this good boy, he means the world to me), I have come to terms with the fact that he is very old and will die eventually and I would rather not have him suffer for too much longer.

Something similar happened when our rabbit died last year - I felt that he was going to die soon, and when the time came, I was sad about it, but I came to terms with it fairly quickly.

So, my dog's death itself, while (as I said) very sad for me, isn't really why I'm posting here. It's more all the stuff that comes with it.

I am absolutely terrified of being the one to find the corpse. I am home alone quite a lot now, since my parents are at work and I work from home. That means that it is very likely that I will be the first one to notice when my dog does die.
What do I do then? Who do I call? Should I tell my parents while they are still at work, or would that just upset them unnecessarily and I should wait for them to come home? What do I do with the actual corpse? I can't exactly move it (as I said, our dog is very big) - should I even touch it at all? Throw a blanket over it? How do I deal with a dead animal?

So, that's the first thing - what do I do if I'm the first one to notice that he has died?

The second is: How do I support my family (especially my mother) after it happens?

As you have probably noticed at this point, I'm not very easily moved when it comes to death. My father isn't exactly stoic, he definitely cries as well in these situations, but he doesn't seem to need much help handling it. My mother, however, is a lot more emotional. When our rabbit died, she cried the whole night and couldn't really function the days after. Maybe that is entirely normal and to be expected, but I just simply don't know how to deal with it. I ended up leaving it to my dad last year and pretended to go to sleep, because I couldn't stand seeing her so helplessly sad. And yes, I feel like an asshole for that, but I simply didn't know how to react or what to do for her, so I just stood there awkwardly - I felt like that made it even worse.

I'm very scared of that experience repeating itself. Especially since, even though my mom loved our rabbit a whole lot as well of course, our dog has been with us for a lot longer, we share a lot more memories together, and I think it will hit her even harder. I believe that at the moment, she is trying to push the thought away that our dog will die fairly soon, but I can already see how much she worries and how sad she gets when she hears how hard simply breathing has become for our dog. What can I do to comfort her? Is there a ""best way"" to tell her about what will have happened? Is things like hanging pictures of him after his death a good idea or does it come off as insensitive?

So, to summarize my questions:

1.: What do I do if I am the one to find our dog's corpse?
2.: How do I deal with / comfort grieving family members?

I'm thankful for any tips or experiences you might have. Thanks.",16Jul2019,1
802,"I’m 30, I work in a creative field and I’m not “making it”. I don’t have the right PR and I don’t get enough jobs and money. I am my biggest critic when it comes to my work, so I say this very objectively. I see my friends’ work closely, they don’t do their jobs with passion, they put the minimum effort, and I can easily say they do a bad job. If I get the chances they have I’d do one hell of a job...

806,"This is my first post here. I apologize if I sound silly, but I have no one to talk to, so I figured this was better than nothing. 

So I graduated high school almost two months ago. Let me start off by saying high school was never my thing. In fact a hated school. I didn’t have any friends in most classes, I wasn’t involved in clubs or anything, I skipped half my senior year, I absolutely hated school. During my high school experience I was never popular, I had a group of about 7 friends freshman- sophomore year, after that we all kinda went our separate ways. I was on and off with those friends for the rest of high school. By the time I graduated I was left with only 3 friends. When I graduated I was so excited to start a new chapter in life, I had got registered in college classes and was starting a new job. I was also beyond glad to be getting away from school and everybody in it. Although I will say that since graduating I do feel more freedom and care less about others opinions. So over these past 2 months since graduation, don’t ask me how, but I’ve managed to lose the only 3 friends I had. The thing is, I’m not really sad about it. They weren’t people I wanted to keep in my life forever. We were all completely different people and we kinda all just realized that the only reason we were friends for so long is because we saw each other 5 times a week. Honestly, not being friends with these people feels like a weight lifted off my shoulders. My problem with this though, is I’m left with no one. They were all I had. I’m 18, it’s summer, I feel like I should be out having fun with my friends and making memories. But I literally have no one. I have social anxiety and I’m a pretty shy person in general. I have trouble keeping conversations. I don’t know where or how to even make friends. So that is my main dilemma currently. It’s just I feel like life is hitting me all at once. I’m not having suicidal thoughts or anything, but I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I feel like the only thing I have to look forward to is getting my degree and working for the rest of my life. Which isn’t something I’m particularly excited for. Also let me mention that I’m not going to a university, I’m attending a local 2-year community college. Not only this but my job I have right now sucks. Not so much the job itself but the pay and hours are shitty. And “getting a new job” isn’t easy for someone like me, with little experience and terrible anxiety. 
I just want so much more out of life. If I had the choice, I’d attend a university hours from my town and just start over there. This might sound bad, but I don’t want to end up like my parents, but I feel like when I see them, that’s how my life is going to end up. They aren’t terrible people or anything. But their lives are boring. My (divorced) parents are both single, lonely, and their life revolves around their job. I don’t want that. I want to love my life and have fun. 
I feel like I’m so lost. I know I still haven’t found myself. I don’t even have any hobbies. Ive experimented here and there but I haven’t found my passion in life. So here I am, 2 months out of high school, no friends, no life, shitty job, no hobbies.
I don’t know the kind of responses I’m expecting from this. But if you read this far, thank you.",16Jul2019,1
807,"I don’t know if I’m in the wrong for being so pissed off about this, BUT. My friend texted the group chat last week, inviting us ALL to the local swimming pool. I was quite excited and replied saying I was up for it. I saw her at the pub on Friday, and she was talking to the others about the pool meet-up, saying “I was thinking Wednesday, as the weather will be good”. I chipped in, saying “yeah, can’t wait!”, to which she looked mildly annoyed and started talking again in a low voice to the others. Obviously, I said nothing. I’ve heard nothing more about the pool meet-up since, and am now certain that she has created a separate group chat, without me, to set up this event. And I’m just so sick of it, because I have literally done NOTHING to her. Nothing to make her possibly dislike me. I’m literally hosting her and 9 others for a week at my Dad’s apartment in Lisbon. I invite everyone to everything and I get nothing in return. It’s starting to really, really get to me, because I don’t know what I’ve done to be so universally disliked.

811,"So I was at work this morning and get an interesting phone call from my wife. For reasons I don’t know, my wife went through my eldest daughters cell phone and found messages she was sending to her boyfriend that she was pregnant, she needs him, etc.

Now first at foremost, I wasn’t really upset that she was pregnant. She’s only 19, but I would obviously provide and help for her as she needs it (what’s the point of working all your life if you can’t take care of your children when they need you) but when my wife and I confronted my daughter, she said she wasn’t pregnant. Her boyfriend broke up with her (or something, whatever teens do these days) and to try to keep her to stay with him she falsified the pregnant test to scare him. 

Now obviously I was pretty upset that she would do something like that, and told her she was being crazy, obsessive, etc. My wife on the other hand disagreed with that and said it was just girls being girls. She then turned the argument at me and said I wasn’t angry enough that she was pregnant. We got into this argument where I in essence told her that I’ve worked my ass to get where I am and my one and only goal is to help my family and that’s all I intended on doing. I told my wife that by not reinforcing how obsessive and stupid her little pregnancy scare was that she was inviting more of that behavior. 

Look, I was a kid once. I smoked weed, made poor choices, disobeyed my parents, things like that. But the way I see it, that for the most part is normal behavior for a young person. I feel like my daughters behavior could be a sign of something a little more serious, like she could have some clinginess issues and things of that nature. Am I overreacting?",16Jul2019,2

He had a daughter (2.5 F) with his ex who has custody of the girl 1 out of the 7 days during the week because he works 2/3rd shift. He had difficulty getting custody partially because of his work and because Hawaii favors the mom with full custody. I am concerned about some of the things I have been seeing. What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Does this sound alarming? 

1. There have been over five indications over the past year that my future daughter in law has come in with bruises on her arms, legs, face, stomach, etc. The mom's stories don't line up with the bruises in my opinion. 
2. My fiance came back after 3 weeks away and noticed these bruises.
3. She covers up her privates when a male comes into the room and is uncomfortable going to the bathroom with her to go potty. 
4. The mom says she is incapable of speaking but the little girl has been trying to speak when she is with us. I don't believe her mom has been trying to help her with this. 
5. The girl screams for her dad whenever we drop her off at her dads house and screams she does not want to go.

After about an hour, we asked for our bills to pay up. He looks to me and says “how old is your daughter?”  Puzzled, since my wife is 8 months pregnant, I say how old and his response is: “I can’t wait to fuck her when she comes out.”  Visibly upset and caught off guard, pay my bill and head out. I did not know how to respond or react and I find myself repulsed and upset about the situation. We have not spoke since and I keep replaying in my head what happened.

Midterm: 30%
Final exam: 30%

Assignment 1: 15%
Assignment 2: 10%

820,"I'm lesbian. My mom found this out a few years back when she was going through my room. Life has been super stressful with her ever since and I have to hide everything. My adult brothers live in the same house as my parents and I. It is a 2 bedroom house with 5 people. One brother is a total asshole and it effects my life because he keeps all his things in my room and trashes the place everyday. 

My parents are extremely religious and conservative. I am forced to go to church sometimes multiple times a week where I am told to 'obey my husband' and that gay people are sick and abominations. They are extremely controlling, to the point of homeschooling me until high school so I wouldnt be influenced by liberal public schools. I still have to have permission to leave the house for anything not related to work. 

Someone is almost always fighting or yelling in the house. I have a job and an supposed to start community college in the fall. The only reason I am staying local is to get a year of free college classes. But everything is so toxic I don't think I can stay here anymore. 

I have depression and struggle with suicidal urges, almost always brought on by family caused stress. I have no support system and everyday feels suffocating. 

I have maybe $1.5k as of today. I love 4hrs away from LA. I can probably find a temp shelter until I get some housing. California promise free college can be found.

821,"I dont even know where to begin, I'm not the best at putting thoughts into words but I just really need advice. I'm sorry if this comes out in a jumbled mess.

Last october my mom had to quit her job because her boss sexually assaulted her at work. It was very emotional, tough thing for us to deal with as a family, but were getting thought it. When that happened I stepped up and started paying all the bills for the house. I'm 25 making $14 an hour, so supporting her my sister and It has been tough but you gotta do what you gotta do. 

Fast forward to today. My mother still doesn't have a job and it's really starting to get to me. I've drained my entire savings trying to pay rent, utilities, feed the family, and car expenses. Shes worked in chiropractic most of her life so shes trying to stay in that field and make as much as she was but I keep telling her she needs to expand her options and accept less pay. We got into an argument last night because it's really stressing me out and I told her just to go an effing job at McDonalds. Any money is better than no money. Am I wrong to expect that of her?

I'm pushing so hard for her to get a job, I got her a job application at the hospital but she won't quit smoking cigarettes long enough to get the job. I've set up appointments at job placement services for her but she doesn't go. I've destroyed my credit and have 0 dollars to my name because I can't support a family on this pay. I feel like I'm doing everything to try to keep this family afloat and shes doing nothing. I'm almost to the point where I'm about to say screw it and leave and let her handle her problems, but I feel like I can't leave my mother and autistic sister in a situation like that because they're family.

I dont know if this is more me venting or what but I just dont know what to do. Do I just get more stern with her and tell her to get off her ass? Do I suck it up and do it because its family?

823,"Welp... internet. Help me.
For 4 years I've been spending a lot of my time with my uncle since he moved to my city thanks to a better job. He's my mom's half brother and they've always gotten along despite having a different father.
I live with my mom and my sister who's a college sophomore. My dad is an alcoholic and I haven't seen him in 6 years. I hate the man. 
I'm 13 and since I was 11 things have gotten really weird between me and my uncle. He's 29.
I have to add that I have a latino heritage, so it's common for family members to kiss each other on their lips. But one day my uncle kissed me for way too long. It didn't bother me, but it felt off somehow.
I started to have pretty bad mood swings at that time. I was angry for no reason and I went to my uncle's apartment every weekend just to give my mom a break from me. My uncle helped me focus my anger and I stopped treating my mom so horribly thanks to all his advice.
In his apartment he only has one bed, so when I visit him we sleep together. One night I woke up feeling his hands rubbing my stomach and chest. Again, it didn't bother me but it was weird.
One day I was taking a bath in the tub and forgot the towel. I asked him to bring one for me and he saw me naked for the first time. He didn't say anything... neither did I. I was super embarrassed because I'm a very small boy... insecure of my size...
Another day I had a morning wood right next to him. I freaked out and got up immediately. I thought my dick was going to explode and I woke him up to take me to the hospital. He chuckled and explained all about it. The next morning the same happened... but I was dripping a thick clear liquid. My uncle gave me a speech and when he took me home he, my mom and me had a conversation about growing up and shit. It was torture. I didn't want my mom to talk to me about that, so we agreed I would only talk to my uncle and he would report to me mom with every damn detail. I really didn't want my mom to know but I had to give in.
The dripping didn't stop after a month and I was losing my mind. I didn't want to go school because I was afraid that it would happen in class. My performance at school was going down and I desperately asked my uncle how to make that thing stop. He said I had to release it... I asked him to teach me and so he did. He just explained. He didn't touch me.
2 days later I was home alone. My mom working, my sister in class... so I did it... and God dammit I made a mess. I begged my uncle not to tell my mom about it and he agreed just this one time.
For weeks I didn't have the need to repeat that, but once it happened again, I had to. And... I always thought about my uncle while doing it. I felt nasty. Guilty.
My uncle was getting closer and closer to me. To the point I didn't want to go back home anymore.
2 months ago when I was visiting him I woke up feeling his hands again... under my belly button. I didn't say anything. I let him go on but he went too far down and I told him to stop before he touched anything. He stopped. 
I set up boundaries for a while but then I just let him do it. 
I seriously don't know what to do. I know what he's doing is wrong but I don't want him to stop. He's never done anything I didn't want to. He respects my rules and I love him more than anything in the fucking world, but I'm scared.. not for me, but for what may happen to him if someone finds out. If I tell him how scared I am he's gonna stop and probably distance himself from me and that would legit be the end of the world for me. I can't talk to anyone about this because what he's done with me is illegal. I'll be 14 in November and despite looking like a 10 year old I think I'm mature enough to decide for myself. But him... I can sense the guilt in him and he once said we should stop. I cried when he said that. We never had sex. No. I'm not ready for that. I haven't really done much for him either and I feel like that's so selfish of me but he says it's fine. 
I can't hate him for what he did. I was alone, aggressive and sad all the time before he moved here. My dad fucked up my family. He was drunk all the time. He beat up the three of us all the time. When he left my uncle saved my mom from depression, saved me from becoming a bad kid and relieved my sister of having to be the one to put together a family in pieces. I'm doing great at school and overall I'm happier than ever... but I don't really know if he is. He always says that my happiness is more important than his. I know he groomed me and slowly dragged me into this but I never felt bad or used. I feel like I'm the one using him to please me. Again, he told me before that we should stop. But I can't. I don't want to.",16Jul2019,1

They decided to be on a reality tv show about moving and down sizing! The women needed extra time in the house (supposedly to go to Greece for her daughters wedding and move afterwards) but it looks like she needed time to get the crew out there and film. The problem with this is they filmed INSIDE the house that at that time my cousin owned, without asking or anything! And it appears the woman made a sob story about how cruel my cousin and her realtor were to her and that she’s disabled and they’ve made things hard for her. That is not true at all.

830,"My dad has a child that my sister (18) and I (25) have only seen once when we were young, and he was an infant. His mother didn't want any of us involved in his life, so she moved away. His mom has never let my dad see him, even when my dad has reached out. Dad stopped trying and never tried anything in court over it. My brother is now 14, and I've heard that he wants to meet all 3 of us - which his mom seems to be okay with. When I talked to my dad about it, he said he's not interested and that he'd prefer my sister and I to not meet with them either. He didn't say why. My dad is a very chill  and reasonable guy, so I'm sure there's reasons he has that I'm not aware of yet. He doesn't seem open to talking about any reasons though.

I have the woman's phone number now and would like to reach out just to see if we can connect on FB or something. I really want to know how my brother is doing and what he looks like now.

831,"I've recently seen some videos of downhill hurban mountainbiking, and I was like ""damn, thats pretty cool""

Since then, ive became interested in it, always keeping up on the news and winners. Going to my local woods to do some jumps and ramps etc. 

It got to a point where I wanted to go out every day. And now, I want to pick it up as a sport and get right into it, properly. But a few things create problems preventing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Where I live, alot of the areas are flat and there are no downhill areas. No trails, no large forest areas to cycle around. 
* The correct bike. My current mountainbike is average, its tailored around mountainbiking as a sport, but im not too sure if its even suitable (Carerra Vulcan is the bike)
* The financial side of things, paying for these venues and the bike, transport to these areas, maintaining my bike etc.

On the instances where I have to take my order and leave, I’m annoyed for a good 10 minutes after. 

 Recently ordered a pasta dish for pickup online but switched the pasta from spaghetti to fettuccine (it says switched to fettuccine on the receipt), however they didn’t switch the pasta types and gave it to me with spaghetti.  I didn’t find out until I got home and opened it. These situations bother me the MOST. When I’ve already left the establishment and the order is wrong/missing something. It’s my fault I didn’t check before I left, but I wanted to just TRUST they would get the order right and prove to myself I didn’t have to be so anal about everything. I know it’d be almost comical for me to drive back or do a complaint now, over a pasta type. But these things really bother me and I don’t know why- do others find themselves having these fleeting emotions? 

I think it’s because I believe I’ve done my due diligence with making a clear order/ asking politely/speaking slowly if ordering in person and it upsets me when I feel like the establishment doesn’t do their due diligence in their part of the bargain (making the correct order) I feel like an entitled brat just typing that out.

I was recently made homeless and stayed with him for a few weeks, which wasn’t easy and I was very thankful for. He didn’t cope very well (OCD) and I was worried that he was in a bad spot because of this.  I put a lot of stress on him without meaning to and want to let him know I really appreciate what he did. I also realise that I probably annoyed him a lot (I’m autistic and didn’t realise I was being offensive etc on a few occasions).



A third friend was very involved during this time and we argued a lot. He didn’t like me picking up litter and we fought about it. He also kept asking me to think about going home as my mom didn’t do anything wrong (they don’t know each other). I no longer talk to him. I am worried he is actively telling my friend that I am doing or have said things in order to cause issues.

I’m 19M and my family is having a lot of issues. Our family has always been really unstable (both emotionally and financially) ever since I was born but it has reached the point these last couples of years where there is constant tension and arguing one day and calm another. It has affect my little brothers a lot to where they lose a lot or motivation to be content with our family, and I believe my brother may have developed depression as a result. My parents hold a lot of remorse toward each other because of trust issues that stemmed from my mother possible cheating. My dad is also constantly stressed out due to barely paying bills and not being able to afford other things.

I am planning to drop community college and getting a job so that I can move out as soon as possible. I currently don’t have money saved since any I had would go to bills and food. I do have a bit of clothes and manga I collected over time that hold value of approximately $1000-$2000 in total. I am willing to sell it all but it will take some time. 

I don’t really know where to start besides getting a job. I don’t have family here in Texas that would help me with housing in the meanwhile. Although probably not plausible, I want to move out with my two brothers. I feel as if my parents aren’t very responsible anymore.

857,"Hi everyone,

I'd be grateful for some advice in my pretty unique situation. I will try to summarize as much as possible.

So basically, I am completely inexperienced in relationships and love life, and I have not had any serious crushes up to now. It all happened when I traveled to another state to visit a friend, and I met a girl there through my friend in two different parties. First night we kind of hung out initially and I had no intention to approach her, but I believe she got drunk and showed some interest in me. Eventually by the end of the night we were cuddling and touching each other. This night passed and we went to another party together. This time we had some good conversation before the party starts, and then we both got drunk and pretty much spent all the party together cuddling until the night. Then I happened to sleep next to her. While sleeping she came onto me and touched me until I pay attention to her, then eventually things got hot and we made out and kissed each other before falling asleep (that was my first kiss ever). I saw her for a short time next morning and that was it. I came back to my state and now I have developed a big crush for her. Couple of times we had a short conversation through snapchat, but none of us text each other that much.

Now I don't exactly know what those nights were and if that's just her nature of hanging out with boys, but the only thing I know is that I cannot stop thinking about her and I have no idea what I should do since I don't know if she likes me or not.

How should I approach her and tell her that I like her? I really have no idea what to do. Also another problem is that we don't live that close that I can visit soon again, maybe later.

We're both about 20 if that matters.

Are there any specifics on school that I could follow that would be the best for gamedevelopment?
I currently have ‘graphic design’ in mind or ‘’spatial design’ I really don’t want to go in depth about it but I just want to have a degree of some type. 
I’ a smart person but my mental me just doesn’t accept it to learn, unless it’s something i’m actually interested in, zo it’s very hard to find something and I need something that would help me with ganedevelopment to keep me motivated.

About the gamedevelopment itself, I went there and their way if talking was already a red flag to me, they were acting like ‘design’ wasn’t meant for that thing but only ‘coding’ which is very bullshit because I know that coding is very important, the direction itself literally shows that the lessons you get are mainly about design&amp;sound stuff, when I told them that I liked coding stuff but also ‘loved level designing’ they told me that I should go for some type of architecture shit which made me instantly mad in myself, that makes no sense at all, so anyways I’m kinda happy that I got rejected eveb tho it was my only ‘hope’ that I thought.",16Jul2019,1

The duties of the Ship From Store Lead position are equal to and possibly higher than that of my duties as a Logistics Manager except I will not be directly overseeing staff and it also pays more. In the interview I was informed that I will be under the forfillment manager. However, the main reason why I feel like I am taking a step back is because of the difference in title. 

To me the title of a ‘lead’ is lower management position. I have conducted some research online and I have found that some companies label senior positions with the title ‘lead’.

Afterwards he kept asking friends if I was ok. Fast forward 2 days after the “sister bomb” we meet up to talk. I ask why this was never said before and he claims I look more like his sister than he thought. He said he even talked to his mom about me and she said we did look alike but wouldn’t tell me what else she said(Why y’all to your mother if you didn’t care for or have feelings for a girl like that?) I asked again if this was never going anywhere and he changed it to “I can’t say for sure, I can’t predict where we’re going to end up”.

865,"My dad (58m) is divorcing my mom (47f) after twenty years of marriage. He is incredibly verbally abusive to her, telling her she came from nothing, that she’s a f’in b****, a primadonna, etc. He leaves family dinners in both public and private. 

They’ve tried therapy and he left because the therapist told him he was a narcissist. My mom asked him to continue therapy and he said she’d never change. The other two my mom has seen have also said he’s a narcissist. He can never be wrong and also never apologizes. 

I found out this year that he has been cheating on her since I was at least six (college-age now) and probably for the duration of their relationship. He’s the one leaving her. 

Now, he’s never been that bad toward me and my sister. He yells a lot but doesn’t treat us like my mom. However, he constantly complains about her to us. He says she’s trying to make us broke by spending money on nice hotels, but he takes a ton of stag vacations. The divorce isn’t going well because he doesn’t want to give her her share. 

He is also extremely misogynistic and covers it saying that it’s his biological right to stare at women and engage with them. 

But with all of this, I forgive him. He doesn’t know I know about the unfaithfulness. But I’ve told him I forgive him for his actions, and I always act like nothing’s wrong when I’m with him; I’ve called him out calmly and sat down with him but he leaves.

871,"So I finished my first year of college in the United States recently and I never really had a lot of luck with guys in high school (had never been on a date, etc.). I had kissed a lot of guys before (im not american, so keep in mind cultural differences), and been attracted to/had crushes on many boys before, but i only had my first boyfriend my second semester of freshman year. 

The problem is, I feel like maybe I was trying to make something out of what wasn’t really there, since we were literally best friends before we dated. I did crush on him at some point but I feel like because everyone was telling me “it’s only a matter of time before it happens” those feelings might have gotten mixed up, because around a month in, I began to lose interest in him romantically. The relationship felt more like a friends with benefits situation, since we didn’t change our mannerisms and friendly habits, we just hooked up sometimes and called each other boyfriend/girlfriend. I’m pretty romantic, enjoy PDA, etc. so this was disappointing especially since I had wanted a boyfriend for so long. 

We broke up mutually and amicably over the summer and at first I felt okay, even relieved about it. But then after three weeks or so I began feeling nervous. I have literally never been attracted to girls before, but one day my brain decided that I could be bisexual or even a lesbian because of my one and only failed relationship. I’m pretty liberal, so I even entertained the idea. I took quizzes online, read accounts of people discovering their sexualities, and tried to see if I had ever even subconsciously been attracted to another girl before, but all my research (lol) pointed to me being completely straight, and I feel comfortable with the label. 

The problem is, now every time I see a movie/hang out with friends my brain keeps asking me if I find the women attractive. I can obviously aesthetically appreciate when other girls are pretty, especially since I do have a low self esteem and compare myself to other women physically quite a lot, but that’s really the extent of my feelings towards them. No desire or attraction whatsoever. I’ve been to a therapist and she says all of this is just a way to process the break up, and provide “reasons” (even if they’re nonsensical and not factual) for the reason it’s over, because I had placed so many high expectations on my first relationship that weren’t met, and rationally, I agree 100%. 

I just wish those thoughts would leave because I can feel them festering and I’m afraid they might affect my future relationships with guys and even my current relationships with my girl friends. It’s so weird because this all started out of the blue (I had never considered/thought about any of this before in my life) and now I’m worried it’s never going to go away :( I just wish I could go back a month in time so I could go back to not thinking about this and so I could continue to enjoy my break with friends and family. Most of all, I’m just frustrated with myself and my brain for overthinking so much and ruining my day over what’s essentially nothing. How do I keep these thoughts away from my mind so I can go back to leading the normal life I had around two months ago?",16Jul2019,0
872,"It’s starting to get really embarrassing and I don’t know what to do. The urge comes on suddenly, and strangely I don’t feel tired at all once it completely passes. Just to name a few situations, I’ve fallen asleep in work meetings, my brother’s graduation ceremony, football games, in social situations while out with friends, college lectures, and even once mid-sentence while answering a professor’s question. Sometimes it reminds me of when I have sleep paralysis — like my body is asleep but I can still hear everyone talking. Most times I’ll eventually just jolt awake, feeling hot and jittery. I go to bed at a reasonable hour, and even though I wake up a lot throughout the night I’m not really groggy in the morning, so I don’t think it’s sleep deprivation. 

Am I just someone who needs more than 8 hrs of sleep? Make dietary changes? Anyone else experience this? Any advice is sincerely appreciated.",16Jul2019,1
873,Since I was born i haven't been much in contact with my biological father. My mother and he split when I was born and she got together with my step dad who I like. For 6 years my father and I haven't talked at all. Early on he tried to keep up with me but I didn't care because of my mother. All he does is send me pocket money and the occasional gift for Christmas. Years ago we tried to reconnect but because of reasons which i blame my mother for we fell apart again. She always made him look bad and 13 year old me trusted her.  I'm now 19 years old and I've been thinking about really reconnecting with him again. My life right now is a total mess and I found out that I can't trust my mother anymore. I'm rethinking everything she said because most of it was just a lie. Would it be fair to him to reach out to him? I'm curious about him and sad that we haven't talked in years. I guess its worth to mention that he has another biological daughter and was married twice in that time. Also he has some other stepchildren. Do you think he would like me to reach out to him? I guess it wouldn't feel right to continue to never talk to him.

874,"Honestly, I just don't understand how other guys manage to get girls.

Numerous friends have told me that it's not hard at all.

They've all told me to just be confident, don't put her on a pedestal, stay cool and I took their advice.

I don't treat girls like queens nor goddesses.

I always practice good hygiene (shower, shave, use deodorant, etc).

It feels like I have to know exactly what to say and have to act correctly or she'll lose interest right away.

I've managed to get a few of their phone numbers and tried to set up dates, though I always get flaked on or stood up during a date night.

875,"Hello all,

Just looking for some advice on a recent situation I've encountered. At the beginning of the month I was taken to the hospital for non-life threatening reasons. I ended up passing out and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance where I received bloodwork, tons of fluids, CAT scan, and an MRI on my brain. They let me leave same day and when I went to checkout they said that I had no healthcare coverage. This was a complete shock to me, because my employer pays for my healthcare through healthcare.gov every month set up on an autopay plan. Basically I thought I did not have to worry about it since they have access to my login and take care of it each month.

Fast forward to Monday, and I look into this further. Apparently the credit card which my company used for autopay had expired and they didn't update it to the new one in my healthcare.gov account which they have access to. I never log in to look at payments since my employer has been on the hook for that since day one. That being said I am in the middle of an appeals process to get my healthcare reinstated given the circumstances. I had not received any e-mails or physical mail stating that my plan had been terminated previously. The only way I found out was by logging in. My employer forwarded me an email from this past month which was an invoice for my healthcare, but they said they had not received any prior e-mails regarding termination.

Long and short is if I do not win the appeals process, I will be on the hook 100% for the hospital visit. That being said, would it be my employer who must pay this bill or am I completely screwed here?",16Jul2019,1
876,"So since I am getting older I have become more opinionated about things and some people think I am way off base on some of my thoughts.  I think usually I am spot on so I thought I would post issues I deal with every day and see if people think I'm right or wrong. At least seeing another side would help me a bit. So here I go.

My niece just told me she is pregnant. She is quite upset.  In our discussion she mentioned that the guy asked why she didn't tell him she stopped taking birth control.  My wife and everyone says it's his fault equally.  Yes it takes two to tango but if someone tells you they are on birth control and later stops taking and never tells you, would that be more their fault. I dont think that blame is shared equally as they say.  It's like if a guy took a condom off in the middle of sex, doesnt say anything then when the girl gets pregnant says it's both our faults.  Am I wrong or right?  Would women defend that arguement if the roles were reversed.",16Jul2019,2
877,"Hi there,

I'm a really shy person when it comes to blaming people where I just bring it up and just let it slide but this time, a person whom I don't like this much asked to borrow my vape so I let her do so. She dropped it by accident and returned it to me and never mentioned such a thing. I did figure there's something wrong since the button was a bit wiggly and the tank has shifted from its position; however, no damage has been done.   
Thing is, I like my stuff always perfect and it unsettles me to know that one of my things aren't in a very close condition to how I bought them which is why I take good care of them. I figured out later on that it was dropped cus one of my friends brought it up to me.

Disclaimer: I'm sorry for grammar, spelling, format, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been offline from Reddit after I posted a question on r/AmItheAsshole. I since then decided I needed some advice. In the post previously mentioned, I had talked about a friend named D who I was told was being toxic. One day, I sorta blew up on her. Our ""fight"" was kinda underwhelming. It really depends how you interpret our ""fight"" to determine if it was full-blown or just arging in hushed tones. Though, I do admit, I was being insensitive and really sharp-tongued. At least, from my usual self. Anyways, after a week, she texted me asking me how I was. Our conversation was awkward to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of a couple days, her queries were strained and so were mine. She sometimes just stopped responding and I did the same. So, I thought our friendship was over. But, then, she texted me saying that she wanted to meet up. We have never met up outside of school, having been busy and because we were just recently aquainted. I was confused. Before, she told me that I'd have to meet her mom to be able to go and hang out. Now, she just wants to come over? She said she had a gift for me. I was uncomfortable, knowing our friendship was on thin ice, but still said she could come over. I told her next week is okay but I don't know what to do. I just don't think I want to be friends with her but I am very non-confrontational, WHICH is why it was unlike me to have started our previous argument. I guess I just want advice as to what I should do. I really want to save our friendship but if that isn't possible, then I'd like to know how I should distance myself. I just don't want it to be awkward when we meet up.",16Jul2019,2
879,"Hi everyone, I feel extremely broken and betrayed. I had an online relationship with this girl (lets call her T) for 10 months who lives in the US (I'm from Canada), we had to plans to be together, because I would be attending an optometry school which is close to her. We were friends for over two years, T helped me through my depression and anxiety, I was suicidal at one point and T helped me through it and I credit her for saving my life. Me and her clicked in every way, I truly thought she was the one for me. We helped each other through everything. The plans to go to that school fell through because I didn't receive a high enough grade in one of the prerequisites, luckily I had another school as my backup just in case something happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

So me and T decided that we would just be friends. During the beginning of our relationship there was this guy who would make thirsty/pervy comments on her instagram posts and always try and flirt with her. I told her that I was uncomfortable and that it made me anxious. I felt like it was a threat to our relationship. She ended up blocking him to make me feel better. We ended our relationship about a month ago, and I still had not moved on and couldn't even think about dating anyone else just yet. She told me she felt the same way. 

&amp;#x200B;

However last night I completely broke down and told I was still in love with T, and I started asking her if she was already moving onto other guys and she told me that she had started a ""thing"" with the same guy who used to leave those comments. This felt like such a disrespect to our relationship. I felt so betrayed, she knew how much he made me uncomfortable. I told her that the only way I would feel comfortable being friends with her is if she stopped talking to him and she would have to pick between me and him. She told me that she couldn't pick, and me asking that of her was unfair and I told her that I can't be friends with her anymore knowing shes with him, it would be horrible for my mental health. She then called me crying on the phone saying she still loves me and that she can't believe I'm doing this to her. The worst part was earlier on the same day this other girl i know in real life asked me out and I told T that if I dated this girl I would feel like I'm betraying T, and I asked T if she would feel the same way if a guy asked her out and she said yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've blocked her on every app, except her phone number and told her if she ever feels suicidal or absolute needs a shoulder to cry on she can contact me but otherwise I don't want her talking to me. Getting over her was already hard enough, this has made it so difficult. It's only been a day and I already want to unblock her and talk to her, but I won't because I don't deserve this kind of treatment. I just don't know how to get through this, I still think about her constantly. Any advice would be appreciated.",16Jul2019,1

882,"I am really sorry if this is a really long read, so please bear with me, i would appreciate any opinios or advices

So my family isnt really a ""family"", it was pretty dysfunctional, my mom and dad hated each other, my brother (28) doesn't really like talking with anyone since i was a child, even until now (im 21), my sister (29) and i though are very close on the other hand..we haven't been that close lately cuz life but i think we're the only resemblance of family to each other i guess.


long story short (sorry if this all over the place), my dad and mom finally got a divorce, a really messy one, that was around 7 months ago..dad is narcissist, a liar, childish, controlling, all the good stuff, never likes adimitting he was wrong, goes batshit crazy when confronted.


his relationship with me and my brother was fine for the most case, my mom got used to it i guess so i dont think it was that bad for her, my sister on the other end had it worse imo, dont wanna get into details to make this post any longer or sth but he was really never supportive, always demeaning her, he made her life hell, some examples: he blamed her for the divorce (its all your fault cause you had depression and was sad all the time so you made mom sad and now we're divorced), he didnt want her to go to a psychiatrist cus he thinks ""nothing is wrong with you what happened for you to go to a psychiatrist"", he burned her clothes once cus she was too tired to clean her room, broke her phone cus she had male work colleagues numbers on it and if that's the case then she's a slut (religious, i guess)..anyways you get the gist.


after the divorce they had us pick who we wanna live with, my brother said he'll live with mom for the most case, i said ill split (i sometimes feel sorry for him, i dont think he is ""evil"" sometimes, just doing what he thinks is right according to the enviroment he was in)..then he asked my sister, and he must have been dreaming if he thought she was gonna live with him, well she said she won't, he was just yelling at her first so i was just waiting for his tantrum to be over and my sister to have some fucking freedom, then he wanted to go beat her up (or fucking kill her who knows what would have happened if i wasn't there), i got in his way and fought him off, got him out of her room and told her to pack, he didn't like my stance against him, and was like ""oh wow you pushed your father away, you should beat her up with me to teach her some manners"" he then proceeds to kick us both out, telling me to pack too cause im leaving with her..so i pack my shit and leave with her, decide to cut ties with him, at least until he apologizes to my sister.


it's been around 7 months and i think my sister hasn't been doing that well lately, i hear her cry in her room alot, it honestly breaks my heart, she keeps the door shut and lights off all the time, my brother is working all day so he can't help, mom is not understanding enough to help her, only i can talk to her i guess, but i also tend to be busy most of the time. she doesn't wanna go to therapy, doesn't wanna take pills, she's been having seizures for the past 2 months, i don't know what it is exactly but she told me its from the trauma/stress, her body just convulses throughout the day sometime, sometime it gets really bad and her brain hurts to the point of her scremaing from the pain..its really bad, she also doesn't wanna take pills for that cause they make her numb and it doesn't fix the problem for her, she quit her job around 2 months ago (doctor), and wants to do a career shift, thing is, she doesn't really have experience in anything, and i don't think she's in the mental state to work anyways.


she doesn't have much money saved up from her other job so i think that's stressing her out, she's also stressed out about dad, since she can't get married without his permission (religion/culture thing), also can't get in a relationship because she thinks its ""haram""..we as a family never go out or do anything together, my mom doesnt cook, everyone jsut eats on his own, we don't watch tv..we're literally roomates.


i guess ill stop typing you guys might have a general idea about the situation now, i got a fully funded scholarship to study in china for 11 months, but i don't know if i should take it or not. i'd love to go of course but it feels wrong leaving her like that, on the other hand i dont know if i would be able to help even if i stayed, since i'll be gone 11 hours for work, study for college and maintain a social life..


sorry about all of this, if you're even still reading, i guess i have 2 options right now, stay home, make some money and help my sister out with money so that she doesn’t have to stress about it, try to get my family together somehow and help fix things. option 2 i go abroad, help fix things virtually i guess? I only have 2-4h classes max if i travel, and i won’t really have to work since i get decent pocket money, part of it which i decided to send to my sister, it should cover her monthly expenses, video call them everyday and plan to watch movies or something? I feel like my mom is trying somewhat to get us back together but noone is helping her out i guess? My sister is too down to, my brother is out most of the time, i’m busy most of the time and when im not i just want to chill really..downside of option 1 is, i don’t really know if it will be helpful, since i still wont be around that much for her, or for my family in general, i dont think ill have the energy to do anything after 11hs outside everyday, and on the weekend i have to catchup with studies and my social life, it seems really hard to do, i’m also scared i wont be able to make any difference, its really selfish of me i guess but i feel like i’ll regret the decision if i didn’t, i could have never dreamed of me going abroad, not to mention on a scholarship, 

Downside of option 2 is, i wont be physically there for her, or for my family in general, i feel like the energy at home is gonna die without me (its almost non existent but things might get worse i guess?), i don’t know if video calling them everyday would be similar to me being physically there, or if it would also make a difference..i’m just mostly concerned about my sister, i don’t know what to do. Should i talk to her about this? Also should i get in touch with my dad again? I really don’t want to, at all, but i dont think he will ever change, my mom keeps telling me to cause then i might be able to help convince him to not interfere with my sister’s marriage, im his favorite son.

TLDR: dysfunctional family, sister’s mental health is really bad, don’t know if me staying would make a difference or not. don’t wanna stay here cause i wont be around that much most of the time cause of work, i also feel like being around physically and trying to fix things might help out, want to leave cause i want the experience, it would be good for my career if i go, and i don’t really wanna miss out, can help out from abroad since i wont be busy there like i would be if i stayed, so can hangout with them more and maybe help fix things over video chat.",16Jul2019,1

Ever since I graduated high school I haven’t done much with my life. I took a “year” off school. Which ended up being 3 years. I was set to go to college after graduation, but things changed. And here I am now working a job with no future in sight and not doing anything useful with my life. 

I’ve applied to other jobs while I’m working, but it’s hard to get something when everyone now a days requires years of experience in said fields. My work history is mostly restaurants, a bit of retail, some warehouse and now security. I’ve applied to a lot of different things in hopes of a call or response. Understandable that’s it’s summer time and everyone is trying to get a job while schools out. But I’ve always had this issue. I’m the one in the family that got stuck with these kinds of low effort jobs. While both my other brothers work labor extensive jobs and get paid very well. 

I understand I’m still young, but I just don’t think my life is going in any decent direction right now.

886,"Just for reference I'm a 30 year old female.

I grew up poor...really poor. Like - taking cold showers in the winter, going for weeks without electricity, my mom would spend my lunch money on drugs - poor. I was constantly teased at school about this. I always told myself once I left I would NEVER be poor again.

When I was 19 I got a decent paying job. And, I got credit cards. And racked up tons and tons of debt. I did this because I was so miserable growing up poor and deprived, so I made sure to do the exact opposite and instead buy pretty much anything I wanted. Unfortunately, I really never stopped doing this and now I am in massive debt, and have become somewhat of a shopaholic. 

I know it has been incredibly stupid of me to do this for such a long time but now I'm not sure how to remedy it. I just had a baby and don't want to deprive him of anything just because I have to pay $1500+ a month towards my debt. I am also in the process of finding out if I have multiple sclerosis, and if I do I have no idea what I will do to pay for the treatments, or what will happen if I eventually have to stop working.

Both me and my boyfriend make decent money and if I didn't have this debt we would be well to do. So I know we can't apply for any type of assistance, and frankly I know I don't deserve it because I did this to myself. 

I'm at the point where I can pay bills but just barely. And all of my other purchases I'm putting on credit cards. Does anybody have ANY advice of how I can fix my situation? Besides stopping the shopping, which I am trying my best to do. I don't have anything valuable to sell (unless you count some pokemon cards lol but that would barely put a dent in my debt), I can't get a 2nd job right now because of my baby. We are renting our house and I have about 3 years until my car is paid off. I don't have a college degree so I don't think I could find a better paying job right now. Should I maybe file for bankruptcy at this point? 

Also if you know of any other financial subreddits where I could post this could you please let me know? I'm a little hesitant to post this other places because I sound like a complete idiot for getting myself into this situation, but I feel desperate.

888,"So I'm a 21 year old college student and I'm on summer break for a while. My mom was all excited yesterday talking about how she wanted to get a dog and asking me if it was a breed I liked would I be willing to take care of it. I told her no as we already have two cats and a third cat, I'm cat sitting over the summer. I agreed to cat sit for a friend because she has an extreme case of depression and she wanted to get a therapy animal. I told her I would take care of her for one summer until next year when she could find alternative boarding. I also wanted her to adopt a cat because that means there is one less cat rotting away in a shelter. I didn't think it would be a problem since I basically provide all the care for our cats myself. I feed them, brush them, and change their litter box every week even when I don't want to. Mind you I never asked to have these cats my mom did. A cat who I was extremely close to and loved very much died and my mom just brushed it off and said she was going to get more cats. My mom complains all the time that it smells like litterbox even when it doesn't. I feel like it's her way of trying to get me to clean it when she wants me to rather than when I have the time. Sometimes I will just finish cleaning it and she will come home complaining it stinks of litter, obviously not realizing that I already cleaned it. When I tell her I cleaned it and put the trash outside several hours ago she just changes the subject like she didn't say anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

God forbid I'm in the middle of doing something when she wants me to do something for the cats. Then she threatens me by saying she is going to get rid of them if I don't do this or that. I don't want the cats to be put out because their living breathing creatures and they would be terrified if she ever gave them away. My mom has separated me form so many of my beloved pets in the past. Sometimes because we were moving somewhere that didn't allow pets, or they got sick and we couldn't afford to care for them, and one time because her boyfriend at the time said I couldn't keep them. Every time I have been devastated. I never asked for these pets she just gives them to me, and of course, I grow attached to them because I love animals but I realized that it's not worth having pets if someone is using them to hurt you again and again.  I basically told her no, that she couldn't get a dog and I wasn't going to take care of it. Every time she decides to get a new pet I'm stuck doing all the work and having my heartbroken when she inevitably gives it away. I'm not just going to keep letting her get these pets she inevitably won't take care of. Furthermore, she can barely make ends meet now and she is trying to take on extra responsibility this family doesn't need. She doesn't have money for medical bills, or tags, or really anything a dog would require but I'm the bad guy for saying so. I have to admit I live with my mom rent free. I don't have a job as school is basically my full-time job. I don't help with bills or buy food or litter or anything. If she was to get a dog the expenses for it would be all on her. However she wants me to take the cats with me when I move out so idk if she would expect me to take the dog too. I think it's unfair that he keeps trying to put a bunch of responsibilities I didn't ask for on me, but then again she buys my food, pays for the apartment and buys my clothes, is taking care of whatever animal she wants the least I can do? Am I being ungrateful of all that she does for me? I feel guilty about saying no because she is my mom but idk if what she is asking me to sacrifice is reasonable or not.",16Jul2019,1

When we met and I told my parents about him, I told them that he was an old friend I had rekindled a friendship with, so that they didn't think he was some psycho murderous serial killer trying to prey on some dumb kid. That was fine. Then, my parents (mainly my goddamn stepmother who never shuts her mouth) talked for me, and some of my relatives found out I had a boyfriend who lived in a different state, and I had to lie once again. I love my boyfriend so very much and I really would like to spend the rest of my life with him if I get the opportunity, but this secret I've been keeping is eating away at my soul every single day I let it stay a secret, to the point where I've considered killing myself just to escape it.

901,"Background: I am a Graduate Civil Engineer working full time on a major infrastructure project in Australia. I am married with a 1 year old child, living with my parents (to save up money for a house deposit/pursue dream?). My wife has stopped working since she was pregnant, but is wanting to find a job very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since young, I have always wanted to be a pilot. I have a deep fascination for aviation, spent a lot of time playing flight simulators (my friends call me a geek because of this). After finishing school, my mum told me to get a degree before trying to become a pilot, just so i have something to fall back on if for any reason becoming a pilot doesn't work out for me. I agreed with her and last year, completed a bachelor of civil engineering. I am now making around the $70k mark, with no rent or car payments (debt free - except for the Aussie HECS study loan). Because of this, I am saving half of my monthly income as i get paid.

&amp;#x200B;

I initially wanted to save up for a house deposit (20% - approx $100k). But everyday when I am at work, I cant seem to get my dream of being a pilot out of my head. On my daily commute, when i see a plane in the sky, i cant help but imagine me flying those planes for a living.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is this, do i;

1. Forget about my dream for now, and make my way up in the construction industry, buy a house, and maybe become a pilot one day when my pay is $140k+ and can afford it.  (My only worry with this is, with house payments and my child getting older, i may let go of my dream)
2. Start my flight training now (without quitting my day job), fly on weekends only, pay as i go and take out no loans for this. This will take approximately 4-5 years, and no guarantee that i will get a job as a pilot. I wont be able to save for a house deposit as I will be paying for flight training. But my wife will hopefully be employed and can help save for a house deposit.

I am a person that believes that anything is possible, and that if you have a dream, you should go for it. But on the flip side, I am aware that I should think of the future of my family, and that i shouldn't make selfish decisions.

I would really appreciate all your thoughts on this, because this has been bugging me for months now. Appreciate the advice!",16Jul2019,1
903,"I learned that I was donor conceived at the beginning of January, at the age of 25. I took an AncestryDNA test and was confused about the results of some of the countries I had originated from, so I asked my mom about it. She ended up coming to my house that night and told me the truth that my dad was unable to have children so they used sperm donors (different ones) to have my sister and I. My sister is 3 years older than me. It was shocking and a very strange thing to find out, but I think I've dealt with it pretty well. The hardest part of dealing with it is that I've been holding in this secret and haven't felt like I could share it with many others... keep reading to understand why.

&amp;#x200B;

My family has always been a disaster. My parents got divorced when I was 13 and my sister was 16. I was always the one trying desperately to hold the family together. My dad turned my vulnerable teenage sister against my mom when this happened and so my sister and mom have not spoken in like 13 years. My mom tried for years to reconcile their relationship but eventually gave up because it caused her so much anxiety. My dad's new wife has kind of become her new 'mom'. I've always gotten along great with my mom and pretty good with my dad and sister. My dad has made some really poor decisions but I always still wanted to have a relationship with him so I looked past that stuff and I just try to think about the good things he's done for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I found out this news, I really wanted to tell my sister right away. She lives across the country and I preferred not to tell her over the phone. I also figured that she would want to discuss this with our dad right away, which she also unfortunately have to happen over the phone. She was in the process of finishing her Master's degree and she was always telling me how incredibly stressed and busy she was and that she barely had time to eat. She was supposed to be graduating in July and then she would come visit home, so I planned to wait until then to tell her when all 3 of us could discuss it together in person and she would be done with the burden of finishing college. It sucked that this also prevented me from discussing the situation with my dad... he lives close to me and we talk quite a bit but he doesn't know that I know the truth about my existence. I just felt that I needed to talk to my sister about it before I talked to him about it because I don't trust that he would be honest with her about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She ended up moving to another state with her boyfriend right after she graduated a few weeks ago for a new job. Right after she moved there, her and her boyfriend got engaged. She must be really excited about it because she just called me tonight and said they've already set a date to have a small wedding in another state in September. I'm very frustrated to be in this situation where I have this life-changing news that I know will turn my sister's world upside down, and that I have to be the one to tell her about it. She has had issues with depression in the past and it's going to be really difficult for her to realize that the only biological parent she knows (my mom), she chose to shun from her life and never let back for seemingly no reason. My mom is a good person and the situation is baffling to everyone that knows her and my mom. I was young when it all started and I thought the situation would have resolved itself by now, but it hasn't, so I guess I wish I would have done something in hindsight. 

&amp;#x200B;

This wedding will probably be the only time I see her for the next year, and that would be a horrible time to break the news to her anyways. It makes me sad that my mom won't be invited to this special day of hers and it would be difficult for me to see her up there getting married without knowing the truth about her existence... this is really important information for my sister to know. I can hold it in longer if I need to but I'm getting pretty tired of having this secret. I could video call her tonight and tell her but I feel bad doing that too because she's probably never been this happy about her life and this might change everything for her. The timing and distance is all just a mess. What the hell should I do?",16Jul2019,1

905,"My mom has always been suspicious that I'm a bad kid or something. I don't know. She doesn't trust me and I don't know why, I've never lied or snuck out or anything. My mom is constantly trying to read my phone over my shoulder. She demands my passwords for everything, even my school stuff, but today she sat me down and forced me to download Life360 onto my phone. If you don't know what that is, it's an app that lets you see the location of other people in your circle and it's extremely invasive. I'll be moving 4 hours away for college in a month and she told me that she wants me to have this on my phone for my safety. She also threatened to stop paying for my phone if I didn't download it. She claims I don't understand what it's like to have to worry about a kid moving away but I told her that she doesn't get what it's like to have someone control your life and then she got mad at me.

I feel that I shouldn't have to worry about her breathing down my neck all the time. I chose this school because it was the choice furthest away from her. She almost didn't let me go because she wanted me to go to the local tech school that she works at. I love her but I don't like her and I don't want her to try to run my life anymore. I'm sick of it.

906,"I’m down on really bad times , just as I’m sure as the rest of us have our own trials and tribulations . But it just seems to me that life is working against me at all angles . 

I (24m) dropped everything took care of a very dear family member for ~ two years . The evolution from my first memories, watching their health plummet, to seeing them in a nearly vegetative state and eventually watching their soul leave their body put me in the most depressed state I’ve ever been in. I know they are in a better place, but I’m the type of person to think ‘what could I have done better’ and it’s a burden on me that I try to shake everyday. 

Anyways, It’s been about a yeAr, and I still think about it everyday. I wanna say that same weekend, or the following weekend , I was employed already working back full time. In retrospect, I know that was a mistake. But at the time, I figured getting back into a regular life (24/7/365 in home hospice care) and just socializing everyday would help me get over it. It did for awhile, but as time passed, it really hit me a few months down the road. At this point, I’m bawling my eyes out everyday. I don’t talk to anyone about it, so I eventually got into therapy. However, something happened with my insurance, and I was left with a 700+ bill for maybe two or 3 sessions. I have a child , and a few other expenses. So not only did I let that one go to collections, I just gave up on therapy all together. I began going out and trying that route of masking it with drugs and alcohol, and that’s when it took a turn for the worst. The feeling of depression ramped up and it was taking a toll on my everyday life . It got so bad that I had to request to take a day off work, which my employer met with negatively. Don’t know if it was the best decision , but I quit on the spot. I made it clear what was going on, and was scolded anyway due to a short staff. I quit on the spot because out of the 9 months I worked there, it was maybe the 2nd time I’ve called out. 

I’ve always experienced slight neck pain for reasons unknown to me, but as time passed, it got to the extreme . I was working full time, and also a very avid weight lifter. Over time, the pain got so bad that I had to stop working out, and before I quit, I was already looking for a new job where I didn’t have to look down all day. I eventually went to the dr, and I have neck spasms and diffusion. 

On top of all this, my car starts working for an unknown reason . I’ve tried YouTube videos, having friends who work on cars see what the problem is, and no luck. I can’t rely on doordash or even going back to a 9-5, so for the last few months I’ve been really assed out. I’ve been finding motivation to work again, but I’m in so much pain that I can’t even partake in my own hobbies. If I were to make a gofundme, to help get myself out of debt (don’t even have a bank account anymore, credit score plummeted due to not working) what would my chances be?

TLDR: I need some help financially . I have a desire to work, but I’m in too much pain, mentally and physically . Can’t afford physical therapy , meds or even to fix my car to get me there. Is this a viable reason to make a gofundme?",16Jul2019,2
907,"Some background: My parent is a hard-worker who's worked for many years in retail stores. They work their butt off when no one else does. I know this because I've seen the stores before, during, and after a work day of theirs and the differences are stunning. My parent lost their longest running job a few years back because of structural issues at the company and recently lost the job they got afterwards, this time for simply being too busy to remember to take her lunch break on time again. Now with no funds coming in at all, they are quite, quite worried and stressed. Basically, it's been tough for them because although they give jobs their all, it has blown back in my parent's face. 

Here's where I want some advice for them, perhaps someones been in the same shoes as they have and knows what to do. Currently they are trying to find a job with a similar title *and* pay that they were getting before. The problem with that I think is that places may not hire for the same pay, but my parent is determined to get just that. Is that a perfectly fine goal that to have? Also, they've already been denied for being overqualified for positions. How crazy is that? So that obstacle just seems hard to get around, so maybe someone knows how to jump this hurdle better than us and stick a job even though you're ""overqualified"".

908,"So i’m just gonna lay it all out. I’m looking for advice. I’m a 21 year old guy in university studying medicine. My personal life is in ruins. I am down and out but having to keep it together. I’m gonna list the facts.


21 year old guy. Quite goodlooking, but not very built. never had a problem with girls. Studying Medicine and it’s going fine but I’m not achieving Honor results. I am passionate about the career and don’t want to give up. I have 4-5 years left.


 I have a girlfriend. This is where things turn bad. She’s in my college course. She’s very pretty. We were together for a few months last year but ended when I told her I was having doubts about us which I was. We didn’t get along so well. I was abusive to her and I actually slapped her one time. This left my reputation and relationship in tatters. And it was entirely my fault. I admit I was very sorry and wrong. I begged her back for months and we would frequently sleep together. I had also had a girlfriend before this who I was very bad to not physically abusive but mentally abusive and I cheated on her many times after I took her back after finding out she’d kissed a boy behind my back. These are the facts. I had a terrible reputation with girls leaving that as I recklessly cheated on her for 1.5 years. I’m in a normal size city so it’s not like everyone knows but a lot of people I know do. But that relationship ended two years ago.


I love my current girlfriend but I can’t see past her being with other people when we were broken up for several months even though it was my fault and I was too. I don’t mind so much that she was with others just that she slept with a guy in the course and I have to see him and I feel awkward around him as he’s quite popular and I feel like second best even though she never cared about him just did it to stop me asking her back. She eventually came back when I gave up on her.


I’ve been such a dickhead to everyone. I have a bad reputation in my college year. I amnt that good at making friends. I am confident at times but shy at others and a bit arrogant and stand offish and a little awkward at times. I find it hard to properly maintain a good relationship. I always find I listen more or they find out i’m a pretty bad person. or that’s what i think. or i’m boring and not sure about myself because i believe I’m not a good person.


I don’t know how to salvage it. I have friends, but I don’t really like them or feel too close to them. I love my girlfriend and I wish I could see past her having sex with that boy from the course but I can’t let myself fully open back up to her and I constantly worry if the relationship is right and want to leave it but fear I’ll look even more of a dickhead by leaving. I have a wandering eye still and find myself not really being the best of boyfriends to her still and every time I scold myself and think I’m a terrible person. and I just feel I shouldn’t be in relationships as I’ve pretty much been in them non stop since I was a young teen. I can’t stay loyal. I find it hard to be good. I find it hard to trust people because I believe I am a bad person and worthless and I feel awkward and disliked by people in my university year.


I have relied a lot on weed and a lot of my friends are stoners. I would like to improve myself a lot I just need advice objectively because I fear the echo chamber above is all just negative and I might be swayed to the dark side and consider suicide. I want to be liked. I want to have girls but I also want the girlfriend. But I still play the facade of everything’s fine in life to my family who I am detaching from. and to my girlfriend who takes up a lot of my time and I haven’t put much effort into friendships. I play the facade it’s fine but constantly consider breaking up because I feel embarrassed by the whole thing and also like my reputation needs to improve and I think removing myself from that situation nicely and quietly (unlike the first breakup) would help. But am I throwing a good thing away because I have too much pride? and I don’t want to go through the heartbreak of having to see her all the time because she’s in my course and maybe having to worry if she’ll go back to that guy or one of my friend or something else. so i consider breaking up and just saying fuck it to everything and not caring about any of it or anything to do with her or I’ve even considered telling her the truth that I can’t see past the other boy. But i don’t want to seem insecure and like he won. I’m all messed up.


I also have shit going on mentally I’m in a dark place and I constantly want to be alone. I think therapy could work but it’s expensive and I don’t have that much money and the only free ones would be only a monthly basis in the university. If anyone reads this I’d be so grateful, I’m at rock bottom and need advice.


ideally I would like to be in better shape, more popular, get better grades, have a better reputation with girls and people, maybe drop my relationship if it’s holding one or both of us back a lot even though she’s very set on marriage and is very nice, loyal and pretty. It’s hard to leave her if she’s so into it and she’s such an objectively good catch. But i feel awkward in my year with her being with that other guy and it’s a relatively small uni course. I would like to make real friendships and be more confident in myself and not rely so much on drugs. I would like a drama free breakup should it come to that and not obsess over her after it like the last time. I would like to meet s girl I don’t constantly have doubts with too and can finally actually love and respect and not be unfaithful and awful to. I want to be a good person but I don’t know where to start or how to maintain it.",16Jul2019,1
909,"So, an hour ago I was hungry, and I only have sweets in my bedroom. I took a small ""box"" (not really, but I don't know how to call it) of Chocolate candies (from Heidi). The expiration date was April, 2020. I turned off the lights (because it was almost 2 AM) and took 2 candies. After that, I realized that my bad had like 100-200 ants in it. I spotted out the second candy, and I saw ants. I then quickly drinked some water. My room is very clean, I never saw ants in it, and nothing like this ever happened before. It took me quite some time to clean everything after the mess, and like 5 ants might still be in my bed. Anyway, what should I do? Can I sue them or something?

910,"I was the same way when I was a teenager, but now in my twenties I learned to be open to everything, and be accepting of things that I don't necessarily enjoy. I used to think certain types of music and art were crap because they didn't fit my tastes. Now I give things a chance, and if I don't enjoy it I can at the very least see why others might. My father just calls it shit because it doesn't fit his definition of music, art etc.

Imo this is a limiting way of thinking. It makes it harder to learn about new things and find new influences. I learned to not think this way, and I believe it made me a better person. There's so many interesting creative I never would have seen or heard if I kept being closed minded.
