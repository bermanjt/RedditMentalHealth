2,"Sometimes my friends will jokingly bring up the topic of foot fetishes and I will just laugh along to it. But I actually do have one and I'm terrified to ever bring it up and probably never will. Alot of the responses I see online are mixed and I understand that completely but feet are literally the equivalent to boobs and ass if not greater to me. I feel like it might ruin any potential relationships I have in the future if I ever mention it to anyone. Obviously, if I get into a serious relationship and this ruins it then she isn't the one but if this happens I'm gonna be pretty bummed out regardless.  ",07Apr2019,1
3,"I'm not the type of person who likes to work hard or achieve things in life. I rather have it easy and enjoy my days on this planet while putting in as little effort as possible. I also don't believe in competition and I think it's bad for society.

How do I still feed myself and pay rent while putting in close to no effort in life? What are the easiest careers for people who are lazy and don't believe in hard work? I take a strong stance that life shouldn't be about working and instead about relaxing. Any advice would help. Thanks.",07Apr2019,0
4,My 26 yr old son is great guy. College grad. Hard worker. Musically gifted. Clever and witty.  Kind hearted.  He was in a long term serious relationship throughout high school that ended badly. Since then he has only dated briefly a couple of times.  He has a couple of good buddies but a really lacking social life.  He hasn’t put himself out there to meet girls. ( he’s not gay). I think he’s waiting for true love to fall thru the ceiling into his arms.  I think the best bet would be for him to explore online dating.  What dating apps/websites should I suggest?  Any other ideas. I don’t want him to be alone. And I don’t believe he wants to be alone either. ,07Apr2019,1
5,"I'm going to try not to waffle and get to the point, so here it goes.

Firstly, I (18M) don't have friends as such. And the ones I do are 28+ (3 of them), or the ones which I have at college (3 of them) who are my age (roughly) I only see once a week, due to working in different companies. During the week I don't mind not seeing people as I'm busy, however, when it comes down to the weekends, I feel pretty alone. I don't have anyone to talk to who I could relate to during the weekend, hell or even make a call with. All 4 of us live 30km apart, and none of us drive, or 3 of them busy with life in general.

Secondly, I'm not a very confident person and perhaps this is due to my parents splitting up when I was 12. And perhaps this closed me up inside. Anyways, I was talking to one of my very few friends from college, about life and relationships in general; I concluded to myself that I'm not confident. Here is everyone getting into relationships and I can barely make friends.

I noticed pretty soon that I definitely liked her a lot and we tested the waters a bit, went on some dates and felt we had something good going on. Today she dropped the hammer on me and told me she didn’t really want a relationship, and she didn’t have a particular reason. She just wasn’t feeling it. I haven’t liked to many girls, probably like 3. At first, I took it pretty calmly but things have escalated and I’m feeling pretty garbage. No idea what I should be thinking or doing or anything.

10,"So my sister [30] and I [26] haven’t been close in 15 years. She is a very manipulative person and lies about so many things. Our mother died when I was 8 and she has always tried to use that to get people to feel bad for her. In reality we had a sucky thing happen, but we were taken in by a family member and pretty much got everything we ever wanted (private education, newest phones, cars, etc.). She had always taken advantage of that and when she didn’t get her way she would blow up and cause a big scene. She stole from me many times when I was younger, would take my car (without asking in the middle of the night because she got hers taken away). She became heavily addicted to drugs and that made her toxic personality even more toxic. She is just a terrible person, lies to so many people about me. She has faked pregnancies to get guys to stay with her, faked suicides to keep friends around.. she’s not only stolen from me, but from her closest friends and other family members. One night I had to pick her up from the police station and she was so strung out. She lashed out at me because instead of bringing her to my place, I took her to a family member’s house. 

I know it’s not the drugs that is making her this way because she was acting like this before she started using. She has bounced around from rehabs to half way homes.  It is hard having a real conversation with her because it is always about her. It is always about what a hard life she has had. She cheats the system by pretending to have a disability and will not work. She is currently “pregnant” (i say that in quotes because it wouldn’t be the first time she lied about it) and I cannot take it anymore. 

She is making me go crazy with her toxic attitude. It is more than just sister fights with her. I have stopped talking to her before and it honestly has been the best moments of my life. I just feel bad doing it because she constantly reminds me that she has no friends and we do not really have any other family besides each other. In reality, the rest of the family has just cut her off, not me.  She just makes me feel so bad about myself and I’ve told her before but she doesn’t care. 
i need outside opinions.. should i cut her out completely? If so, how do I?

my sister is a toxic person and constantly manipulates me into feeling bad for her, should i cut her out, how should i do it?",07Apr2019,1
11,"Hi all,

I'm 21, a junior in college, trying to build my dream career in the Bay Area and you know what...I hate it.

I don't even know if the thing I want to do is the thing I want to do anymore. On top of that, Bay Area living is way too expensive and I'm paying $1200 for a shitty bedroom in someone's home that I share with 3 other people (I can make a whole other thread on that).

I have college now as a bounce board, and my parents are extremely supportive, but I worry if I continue down this path I'll become extremely depressed at the grind of life. Underpaid, overworked, not being able to afford to have a family or even live alone, being in denial of all this, etc.

I want nothing more right now than to live in the suburbs, own a home, and explore my hobbies at my own pace while working a 40-hour job that pays my essentials. Is that possible? How do I do this? Do I move to Wisconsin and work at Wal-Mart as a manager? Do I pick-up a trade like electrician or plumbing? Does this idea not even work anymore?

I also worry that, maybe I'm just reacting to my bad situation and looking for a way out. What if I did move to Wisconsin and hate it in a year? I could always move to Washington, never been but I hear it's nice.

My parents are paying for school (I'm paying for rent and food and all that) and I only have one more year left so I figure I'll stick it out, but I seriously cannot see myself staying here and living like a college student well into my 30's.

Sorry for seeming a little whiny. I realize I have the opportunity of a lifetime, and people wish they were in my shoes, but I realize now this isn't sustainable. I've been feeling this way for a few months now.",07Apr2019,1

16,"A girl I met two months ago in class seems interested in my opinion and my friends think so too. I’ve asked if she seems into me on here multiple times and most people said yes. 

However before I ever showed any sign of interest, she mentioned she’s studying abroad next semester and that she’s going alone because she wants to grow. Another time when I asked if she’s trying to be single, she said yes so she can grow. She recently mentioned again that she’s trying to work on herself so no relationships and also no dating for her right now. Before she was telling me about bad past relationships and being insecure so I’m also thinking long distance is out of the picture for her. 

Since meeting me, she has done things like ask nosy questions about my dating life, my type of girl, the age range I’d date (she’s older) etc, hinted at hanging out and how we should do this and that, I’ve gotten lunch with her twice (her idea), she wore makeup and dressed up, saved me food over the weekend to give to me in class, constantly teases me even though I’m sure by now she’s at least a little suspicious I might like her, called our lunch a food date, etc. She’s a natural flirt, has many guy friends, and is very popular so Idk why she would suggest doing so many things with me and act like this if I was nothing but some classmate she’s friendly to

What’s she doing and what should I do?

TLDR: girl seems interested (highly doubt it’s just friendliness) but said she’s trying to be single and doesn’t want to date either to work on herself and grow (she’s studying abroad alone next semester for this reason too. Also think she’s against long distance since she has trust issues about cheating).

21,"I have had my car for a few years now, and I love the thing to death. It's a 2006 Honda CRV, so a smaller SUV with a backseat and a nice big trunk.  I was loaned money for it by a family friend and I'm paying $230 a month for it, 200 for the car and 30 as ""interest."" I owe about $4,000 more. It's got some cosmetic flaws and the a/c is broken but I really love the thing. 

My husband got a 2005 Honda Pilot as inheritance with the passing of a family member, and it's a great car. Squeaky clean, 150,000 miles, great condition, 3rd row seats, working a/c and heat, the whole shebang. 

I am a stay at home mom and my husband has a work truck. Since we have a baby I have been driving the new car with a/c, and the CRV just sits in the garage untouched. 

I love my little car like a dear friend and it has always been reliable. But insurance is expensive and the payment is expensive, if I gave it back to the ""lender"" we could put about $300 a month toward ourselves and our kiddos. But I have this nagging feeling like we should have two cars, like I am going to need it or regret getting rid of it. 

I'm just looking for some outside advice or maybe to hear a pro or con I havent thought of.

22,"So I (24F) decided to stay in the city where I went to college, across the country from home. I want to be out here and I have goals I want to achieve but I can’t help but feel shitty about it because I feel alone like I don’t have friends. 

I really only hang out with my boyfriend (25M) and he’s extremely popular and has connections all over, just a really friendly guy. Most of my main crew from college moved away and I’m realizing I did a terrible job at making real friends and maintaining relationships throughout my time here. It’s making me insecure in my relationship too, like I don’t really have people to introduce my bf to. I feel like in other relationships it’s common for friend groups to join and hang out and I feel weird not being able to offer that. I make sure I give both of us enough space so I’m not ALWAYS with him. but I want friends to do things with and explore and have a full life outside of my relationship.

I’m an all around easy person to get along with, funny, and supportive. I’m just a bit shy which is proving difficult in making friendships post-grad. 

Please give me advice and tell me it gets better? Has anyone else been in this position? How do I make friends after college? What’s the best way to rebuild a social network so I have other people to spend time with and make meaningful relationships?

23,"( I haven’t been on Reddit on a computer or anything so I have no idea if the formatting really is that bad but if it is I apologize In advance)

Ok so where to I start? Growing up my childhood was stressful not enough to be abuse or anything, but you know father problems. My mother and my dad never really seen eye to eye, he had a lot of financial problems and too many kids ( 7 ) 2 with my mother and the rest with my step mom, he cheated multiple times on both of them with the other. Eventually my mother grew tired left him and served him childhood support papers. He couldn’t pay them so he frequently was in and out of jail, and when he wouldn’t pay them my mother wouldn’t let us see him. 
     He was a good man still a good man cares deeply about me. After my mother and father broke up around me being 2 , my mother found her new and current boyfriend ( we’ll call him d for safety reasons ) for Years he was a father figure I loved him like he was another dad, till I grew up and became more aware of my surroundings. It was around the time he moved in with us, at this point I was around 11-12. This is when problems began. It never got to more than shouting and cursing at each other from what I seen and by the next day they were always ok, so I never payed it any mind. It wasn’t until I turned 17 I realized how bad it actually was. He would get drunk whenever she went out with friends and berate her and accuse her of cheating. She slowly stopped going out and hanging with her friends all together , the only time she did was with him.  
      My birthday last year , she went and hung out with friends the day before. Derrick came home drunk I don’t know what was said but my mother refused to sleep in the same room as him and came to sleep with me. I had never seen her so tired, drained and miserable in my life. So we laid down and I comforted her , now me and my mom haven’t really ever been close she was extremely strict and messed up in a few ways but I love her all the same and she’s never done anything to hurt me on purpose ( she has hurt me while trying to do good but that’s another story ) everything was calming down until he popped up again and started mess my mom just sitting there staring at the wall the whole time, I don’t really ever speak up I was raised not to with adults because it was “ disrespectful “ but I kindly asked if he could leave. His response was to tell me “ you shouldn’t be on her side she’s a sl*t go ahead ( moms name) tell her who her real dad is. “ long story short found out my dad isn’t my biological father, damn near devastated me.  
      But recently it’s gotten worse, around  August of last year I met my current boyfriend, he was respectful and 100% truthful with anything my parents asked .  The only negative is that he has a felony ( weed charge ) so he can’t get a office job quite yet, but he works multiple jobs that pay great and has an amazing work ethic. When my stepdad found out he immediately switched gears. Started to disrespect him, talk shit about how he smokes weed and is a deadbeat. Which obviously enough pissed me off but also in another way. I wanna say I was around 10 when I realized d sold drugs, never thought anything about it a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do to support his family. My mother obviously didn’t care about my bf smoking weed seeing as both her and d do it as well. But he started to put pressure on her about it and eventually she started to shit on him
Too. This upset my boyfriend and made him extremely uncomfortable around my parents. It wasn’t until he heard d say something about me that he flipped his shit. So at this point d hates my boyfriend and my boyfriend hates d. Now this is where my current predicament starts. 
   One day I Was having a private conversation with my boyfriend   taking shit about d ( he had just told me I ever wasn’t going to amount to anything because I took a gap
Year from college and that I was going to be nothing and on the streets) so I was pretty pissed. D had heard my boyfriend at one point call him a b*tch , and he went off about how next time he see him
It’s going to be on-sight and that he was going to fuck him and make him his b*tch ( ? I know right )  and started calling him white boy and cracker and other shit ( D and I are  black my boyfriends white     ) boyfriend was like cool alright. My boyfriend was still heated from what d had said to me so he was ready to fight eventually though he calmed down and was ready to make amends again. But d wouldn’t let him set foot in out driveway which is a personal problem for me because we have a long driveway and he’s my ride to work and for other things. Me and d haven’t been cool since then on my birthday of this year he didn’t apologize but asked if we could go back to normal and I was like sure yea why not . 
     It wasn’t until two weeks ago that he ended whatever relationship he thought we was going to have. Long story short my mother went out again he got mad , then got drunk , drove out to find my mother and put his hands on her.  She didn’t come home that night, or the night after or the night after that. She called me told me what happened and I relayed it to my younger brothers ( 17 and 14) that she wasn’t coming home but that she loved them and would be getting and apartment soon away from d where we all could live. During the days she was gone Derrick played victim , it was then I realized how manipulative he was, telling our mother anything to make her come back home ( the kids are disrespectful and the house is outta control please come back, etc..) the worst thing tho is during an argument he had when he got home over the phone with my mother my little brother heard him say he wanted my mom dead. Which set off something in me so I told him off, and instead of apologizing he came back and told my little brother that he never said he wanted my MOM dead he said “ I wanted to die and I still want to die “ I found out the next day after my mom had called and told me that he put his hands on her which set both me and my boyfriend off. So we pulled up at my house and started going off on him. He retreated and said nothing it was 1 am so I can see why not . So the next day we did it again. Just the two of us , the neighbors called the police and he gave a statement saying three big guys and my bf tried to jump him. And ever since then he’s been an asshole to me but I just ignore him. But I cannot quell the extreme amount of hatred and violence I feel towards him. 
        There are so many things I want to do to him for putting my mother through what he has. I want to call the police tell them about the abuse and the drugs ( I currently think he is on drugs which is negatively affecting my mother who has mental issues ( been to a therapist and prescribed medication for other things but I firmly believes she has bipolar depression )) but that going to negatively affect the rest of my family seeing as he’s the main source of income.  Or I want him to get beat up. I want him to feel pain the same pain he gave my mother cause apparently this is t the first time he’s put his hands on her. My boyfriend wanted the same thing and knows some people who can and will do it. And as much as I want it to happen my conscience won’t let me , I want to ruin his life.  
      Sorry for the long post but any and every bit of advice is going to be appreciated, I’m a generally non violent person , I hate violence but this has pushed me over the edge.  If you have revenge help, how I can help my mother , who I should  talk to about it, general advice, or even would like to share your own story so I can gain some insight. All of it will be appreciated ",07Apr2019,1

26,"For a while now, I've been planning to move into an apartment with a friend of mine, and I've been researching two bedroom apartments. However, he's been making it increasingly difficult for me to move in with him. I am frustrated and need some advice.

First of all, I really want to find an apartment in Batavia or Geneva, IL. However, it *has* to be an apartment in the DuPage County area. My friend is required by law to live in DuPage County, due to a recent incident with his mental health and court (he didn't go into full detail). 

Later on, he then updated me and told me it's going to be hard for me to move in with him anyway, because of his bad background with trespassing. He also recently got fired from Uber because they did a background check, so yeah...you can see where I'm going with this. 

Just last week, when I told him I've decided to look for one bedroom apartments, he got mad at me and now thinks I don't want to move in with him. He actually seemed kind of hurt, but I didn't mean it that way at all. It's just very frustrating because I feel so limited in my apartment search, due to his poor choices and shady background. Moving into a one bedroom apartment would give me more freedom, but I don't want to put a rift in my friendship. 

I did explain to him my reason for researching one bedroom apartments instead, but he still seemed quite bothered. His exact words were - ""You don't want to move in with me"". I need some advice.",07Apr2019,1
27,"I (F17) am in a two year relationship with my girlfriend (F17.) 

Throughout the relationship, it’s been hard to see my girlfriend at all. Anytime I wanted to just hang out with her, her mother would only allow her out for a few hours, and wouldn’t allow her over the rest of the week. Whenever it came to sleepovers, her mother always complained of her not being home all the time, and would often say no. When she would say yes, she would get angry if my girlfriend didn’t leave at an early time, and would stop her from seeing me for a while. After our sleepovers, she wouldn’t be able to see me for a week. My girlfriend has had a hard time leaving the house without her mother complaining. If we asked her mother weeks in advance, she’d still be hesitant to accept. She says her mother isn’t homophobic and that she likes me, but I always seem to have a run in with her.

Also, my girlfriend is often left to do everything in the house, despite her having an 18 yr old brother. She has to bathe, feed, walk the dog (They had another one she was training to be her service dog, but the mother got rid of it,) clean the kitchen, the bathroom, the dishes, mainly all the housework. Her brother isn’t expected to do anything. He also goes out overnight without warning the mother, and even though she has an issue with it, she doesn’t set restrictions on him. 

I spoke to my girlfriend about this, but she says she’s used to it. I really don’t like how she’s getting isolated, while her brother can do whatever. She loves her mother to death, so I understand why she doesn’t want to confront her about it. However, I feel it’s not right; she’s getting limited to her house most of the time, right around the age where you should be going out and living your life.

It’s been causing rifts in our relationship, where I get upset because I can’t see her for a long period of time. Other people our age see their SO all the time, meanwhile she has to basically fight with her mother just to see me. I feel so alone most of the time, it feels like a long distance relationship.

28,"I'm the oldest of 4 siblings and right now me and my sister are both in college. Long story short in the Fall of last year we found out that my father would no longer be able to pay for us to go to college anymore. My siblings and I were always told we never had to worry about paying for school so this came as a huge shock and has caused us a ton of stress. We grew up incredibly privileged, never had to worry about money, and now it's all we can think about. My sister goes to a very expensive private college, and even though she's been working with the financial aid office, she still owes $20,000 for this semester. My father is basically out of the picture now and my mom has bad credit so my sister would have to take out hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal loans to finish her last 2 years at this school. Her option is either to take on that debt or to move back home and go to our local college. She's not sure if she wants to take on the debt but is also incredibly depressed about leaving her life at her current school behind and has worked so hard to get there. I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation where an extreme change in financial situation caused them to have to drop out of school/change schools and how they handled it. I'm really afraid that if she comes back home she'll be lonely and depressed.

29,"Hey all,

Currently a junior in college living in the Bay Area.

I pay $1200 for a single room in a house with 3 other people. I get access to the laundry room, a bathroom I share with two other people, and the kitchen.

The landlord lives in the house, and she owns the house, but she sucks. She acts like she's in her 20's (she's 40), always claims she has ""anxiety"" when confronted with anything, and does not take responsibility for her own home. Pretty sure she only owns the home because it was her parents or her grandparents.

She has a dog and a cat that just roam anywhere. They're very untrained and leave a mess that she never cleans. She has this automatic feeder for the dog who just spits it out on the floor. She never cleans that.

One of the other roommates is in his 30's and has lived there for about 5 years. He's extremely forgetful, has broken a lot of stuff, and is generally self-centered and rude. My landlord complains about him a lot but does nothing about it. Also, super shitty she talks behind his back and I always avoid saying anything and try to leave the situation. She even installed sensor lights just for him because he never turned the lights off. These lights suck and turn off if you aren't constantly moving, meaning it's hard to do anything in the house at night. 

The last roommate is in graduate school and generally keeps to himself but is super passive aggressive towards me. He accused me of playing music and movies too loud all night for months, even though I ALWAYS wear headphones when I watch or listen to anything. I even had him stand outside my room while I listened to something with headphones to make sure he couldn't hear it. He has never brought it up again and never apologized.

The two guys I share the bathroom with have no interest in communicating about what their shower schedule is, but then get passive aggressive when I take a shower during when they want to take a shower. HOW THE FUCK WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW? All of our schedules are wildly different and changing every week. Some weeks they leave at 6am and other times at 2pm. 

Nobody ever takes out the garbage, ever. Maybe once in a while, but it's always me when I'm fed up with it being too full. Then they forget to take the garbage can out on garbage day, meaning the trash can gets too full and raccoons start picking at it. One time I got an extremely passive aggressive text for taking out the trash because my landlord had to clean up all the stuff from a broken bag a raccoon opened up, and she said if the trash can is ever full I should ""do something else with it.""

The kitchen is a fucking disaster. I used to cook every week and deep clean the kitchen afterwards, but I've since stopped cooking and stopped caring. On top of the garbage problems and ant problems caused because of it, people leave shit all over the counters and dirty bowls in the sink for days on end. As I mentioned earlier, the dog spits his found on the floor and it's NEVER cleaned. I tried for a while but it kept coming. When I asked my landlord if she ever fed him something different, she changed the subject and it was like she wasn't even listening to me. So now I worry about stepping on dog food pebbles whenever I walk in the kitchen. I also think she's a hoarder so there's too much stuff everywhere and I have no authority to say anything because it's technically her house.

Also, for some reason both the Wi-Fi bill and PG&amp;E bill has doubled in the past few months. I've been accused of this, but I'm never home (in fact I actively avoid being there) and used no more than I did a few months ago when this wasn't a problem. She usually agrees with me afterwards, but it's always so accusatory. I'm sure she does it to the other roommates too.

I also have a car and street parking is a nightmare. I live in a more suburb-y area right outside SF but there are ALWAYS cars everywhere. It's so fucking frustrating. There's street cleaning two days a week and I ALWAYS see older people move their cars right when it begins and ends. It's like they have nothing better to do, and they NEVER move their cars during the week. I have to walk 10-15 minutes after I've parked if I get home anytime past 6pm. The other roommate my landlord complains about? He gets the parking spot on the driveway all too himself because of seniority. He also pays for it, but honestly I'd pay for it too and I've expressed this. He would obviously become resentful of me if I took it from him, so I haven't pushed.

The worst problem is that I've gone on Craigslist to look for a new place and most ads are just as bad. I let a lot of red flags go when I moved into this place because this was my first time not living at home or on campus dorms, but now I know what to look out for. I also don't have all the money in the world to rent even just a studio. Most ads are for rooms in people's homes with a lot of rules about what you can and can't do. My parents were less strict, even they let me use the kitchen.

I also don't even know where to live next. I work at 45 minutes away from the campus, and am starting a summer internship in downtown SF in June. Do I move closer to my other job? Do I stay closer to school and the job this summer? Will the summer job stay my job during the following school year? Should I move out east and take the super long commute everywhere?

I realize this is more of a rant than anything, but I'm at such a loss. Hopefully I'll find a reasonable place soon and can move. Also applied for on-campus housing again so we'll see if I get in.

I have one more year of school so I'll probably stay, especially because my parents are paying tuition (I play rent and food and all that). But after that, I hope to get the fuck out of the Bay Area, unless I get a good enough job to sustain myself.",07Apr2019,2

I got hired and was sent an email the other day with my start date and a location for which is different than the one I applied for. This new location is 30 mins away. Now, the distance isn't really the problem, I mean it is a pain (high traffic area) but I have to be in the location A two days a week for a family commitment that I would take care of during my lunch hour. I just don't know if I can get it done in an hours' time from location B.

32,"I met a girl in class that's a couple grades ahead of me. I made a lame ass joke that nobody else was laughing at and she started laughing loudly and at great length and then started talking to me. She asked me to repeat the joke yet she obviously heard it. As I told her it she smiled the whole time then waited after class to pop out say boo and scare me and looked me in the eyes. She doesn't talk to other guys in class. After that incident she didn’t do anything as explosive. She started laughing at half funny stuff I say in conversation to other people or responding to stuff I say or asking me to repeat jokes. After I have a conversation with her she scares me. I was joking around with her and gave her a picture she was laughing loudly and saying my name a lot and I had a gut feeling from her eye contact because she held good eye contact and when I moved close to her didn’t flinch. Her friend asked me to tell the girl jokes and chase her down the hall as a joke. Early when we were joking around she held good eye contact longer than most people and I got a vibe from it and she was saying my name a lot.

The girl gets red while talking to me, hides her face, smiles, makes no eye contact. blushes and smiles when I say hi first. She can’t look me in the eyes and say hi first. She continued butting in my conversations to talk to me. Well her friend asked me to sit across from them. The girl had an attitude but found any excuse to talk to me and when they took turns with selfies next to me she had to be between us and asked me to get closer. She giggles and says my name for no reason. I told her friend I don’t take selfies she said “Me and Tina are going to take care of that”. The next day she comes and gets me when the girl is wearing something that shows cleavage for a selfie next to her. From that she blushed and asked me to get closer. When I talk to her she asks for a selfie with me or scares me. She hovers around me with her friend and approaches me with her friend trying to talk to me. Another friend looks at her and says her name when I enter a room. her friend’s comment nice things on our pictures. When she gets my attention and I talk to her she scares me or asks to take a selfie and to sit with her. She has me get closer every time and sends me the picture for me to post and tag her. She likes it then tells me the next day she likes it. When she sees my in the halls she can't say hi first or look me in the eyes. She can only approach me talk to me and flirt with me with her friend next to her. When I am not looking every opportunity she stares at me. She says my name a lot. When I say something bad she giggles and says my name. She compliments me a lot like new shirts haircut and so on. She has listened to my phone call with my mom and asked why I didn't say I love u at the end. Her friend goes around and finds information to tell her then she tells me what she heard about me. She has talked about me to her parents because she told me something that only they would know. She also has asked me where I live. When I looked at her and she caught me she smiled at me. While talking to me makes long eye contact and smiles the whole time and doesnt stop then when we are done she stands in silence doing that then when I break eye contact continues staring into my eyes at me",07Apr2019,0

After a while of talking he/she mentioned that I should go into therapy because ""I give good advice and have the ability to understand people problems.""

37,"Growing up I was the last child who was always different and rebellious compared to my siblings. My parents always thought less of me and put my brothers on a higher pedestal. 

My brothers seem to have always been smarter than I am, or at least their grades have always been better. I always enjoyed reading and writing but once high school began I stopped writing and reading. Every year in high school my average was only in the 80’s. My brothers both excelled and got 90% averages. They both went into STEM programs in university and to satisfy my parents I applied to sciences as well.

39,"So little backstory, there’s this new girl who moved to my town that lived about 3-4 hours away and she’s pretty cute. She starts going to my school and I occasionally see her now and then. We start talking and to put it bluntly we’re starting to really connect. I’m the only guy she talks to and basically the only person she talks to. She eventually confesses to me and I obviously said yes.

Now here’s the thing, I’m currently in a weird spot with her. We haven’t fought or anything it’s just weird. In public she’s kinda “out there” in the fact that anything she thinks of she just says whether it’s nice or not. Seeing as I’m the boyfriend she usually says the occasional mean thing to me more often, she says that’s her personality and I get that. But we barely talk outside of school like BARELY at all. Usually it’s me sending the occasional message asking if she’s ok and whatnot. 

The question I’m asking is that what do you guys overall think about this and what should I do. Sometimes I get into this little hole of thinking that she doesn’t like me or that I’m just another person she talks to but is a little more affectionate towards. She’s stated that she loves me but she has a hard time showing it. I wanna be with her and you know be the best boyfriend I can but I don’t know what that is to her.",07Apr2019,1
40,"I know that there are some of people in high school that don’t even have 1 friend in school, but I just wanted to talk about this.

I’m in 10th grade and an above average student. I get As and Bs and some Cs, I play sports and a I’m an executive for one of the clubs in my school. 

Back when I started high school in 8th grade, I did have a big friend group and would always go places with them, like watch movies, arcade, going to their house, etc. But after school ended, summer break ended, and no one contacted me through out the whole summer. I saw on Instagram that everyone hung out and had fun without me. It hurt. 

Then 9th grade started and everything seemed normal, I still sat with them at lunch, worked together in class, but still, I was never invited to hang out with them after school. I didn’t know why. And this would go on all year, them having those inside jokes from their time spent without me. I didn’t know what to do. I felt like they were purposely hurting me while keeping me close enough to see them all have fun without me. 

Now in 10th grade, I’m still sitting with them at lunch, but that’s about it. I’ve thought about switching friend groups but I feel like I’m too far into high school that if I leave, I’ll be the lonely one whenever there’s group projects. I hate going to school because I know that everyone time a teacher says “pick your groups”, I’ll be the one that has to go to the teacher to say I don’t have a group, and then I’ll be randomly placed into a group.

Eventually, I got into a more serious relationship, he wished me well, and that was that. I don’t know how he passed, and I don’t know any of his friends or anything. Just hoping he went peacefully, and feeling deeply for his family, they were close. 

I thought of this guy sometimes and wondered how he was, and he’s been gone for like six months. I’m not quite sure how to grieve.

My work place is a tad bit different than most restaurants. It is a privately owned business. Ran and owned by one person. He is the boss. His son is the manager... (we will call him ron) 

In his past ron had gotten into some legal trouble and we all know that makes for difficulty in finding a job. Ron got lucky as his dad owns the restaurant so he can just work there. 

Ron is notorious for being a flirt... honestly regardless of the gender. Ron will say inappropriate things as well.

I had a great job and I got sick/ hospitalized  and lost my job and had to move back in with my abusive parents long story short they beat the shit out of me and I ran away to my aunts. I was in such a bad place I just hid in my room and went to therapy and my psychiatrist for a year. The problem is my aunt is verbally abusive. I was getting some support from my older sister but she just moved out in the middle of the night and seized all contact with all of us. 
So I’m trapped in this house. I really need to get a job and move out of here. My car is dead (battery &amp; a some small things) . The only jobs near me are by a bus. I’ve been applying to all of them for the past 6 months and none have hired me.  I’ve gone job hunting so much I’m running out of money for the bus. I’m starting to sink into a dark place and I’m thinking my only way out is to kill myself. I really don’t like this. 
If anyone’s gone through something similar I’d like to know how you got out? Or if you know of any programs that could help my situation? Words of advice that helped you get out of the dark place anything? I’ve been asking for help to all the people around me and they’ve just been giving me the thoughts and prayers treatment.

75,"I haven't had it in a while (due to ongoing room remodeling), and I have yet to test if it's still a problem, but I thought I should post here for those who are, infinitely more tech-savvy then myself to see if I can figure out this issue.  


So I live in a fairly small room in a fairly small home currently. Before I started remodeling my room, I ran an old CRT Television (Yes, I'm dead serious) in that room, and had it hooked up to a Comcast TV box as well as the usual plugs, VCR, etc. However, I noticed a problem about a few months ago that I had never really noticed.  


Being a 2000s child, I have a Wii in my room (Though since starting room remodeling I've unplugged it and haven't plugged it back in since). I plugged it all into my old CRT (color cables directly to the TV, AC Adapter block plugged into a power-strip alongside the power source for my cablebox, the power box for my signal adapter (booster..? Around the time this was put in was when I noticed the problem), etc. However, whenever I turned the Wii on, the Wi-Fi in my room would immediately go down, if not become incredibly slow and forcing my phone in particular onto mobile data.  


As far as I'm aware this is only an issue with the Wii, but I can't conclude that for certain as I don't have any other consoles to call my own in that room (though I am hoping on getting a PS4/Switch soon). Today I upgraded to a new router/modem duo, so I'm hopeful that the situation has resolved itself, but, in case it *isn't* solved, I'd like to know if anybody has any ideas on what the issue could be. I personally think it might be the adapter (and specifically it's power box), but I'm not sure how to remove it without cutting my entire house's cable/internet access (even though I think we don't even need it at this point, but that's a whole other story to get into).",07Apr2019,1
76,"My mom has never been good at communication. Any time I disagree with her, she gets mad and yells at me for disrespecting her. Even when I’m making decisions that should only involve myself. With her siblings, any time she has reconnected with one, it only takes a few months before they say something she doesn’t like and she promptly cuts off all communication with them. As a result, I’ve grown up pretty isolated from the rest of my distant family. Just me, my sister, and parents. It’s not all horrible, but it’s also a cultural thing for family to stick together and stay close, so it’s been really weird to live like this.

There’s an event my family and I have been invited to to celebrate my accomplishments. I get to take three guests. Initially, I was going to default and take my sister and parents. Then, my dad offered the idea of bringing my aunt instead of him.

He explained that it’s not that he doesn’t want to go. He’d love to go. it’s just that he already knows what my achievements are and knows everything I’m up to. He said he’s thinking of my aunt, who let us live with her when we first moved her and indirectly helped me achieve all that I have.  At first, I was saddened when he told me that, but it makes more sense when he says that he just wants my aunt to see me more. I don’t actually know whether to believe him or not. He’s always missed a lot of my stuff because he’s working, so I’ve never resented him but I was kinda surprised that he wasn’t all that eager to go to this event. It’s kind of big and he’s so willing to not attend one event for one of his children? At the same time, I don’t even want to go to this event that much. We’ll be sitting around the whole time while the attendees (me and nine others) give a speech about their accomplishments and a teacher will each speak about an attendee and all that they’ve accomplished. He hates all the fancy suit and tie stuff and I do agree that he would be kind of out of place there. My feelings are still mixed.

When I told my mom that I’d like to invite my aunt (she cut her off three years ago and they haven’t spoken since then), she immediately knew it was my dad who gave me the idea. She was furious and refused, even after I stood up for myself and stated that the dinner is for me and I should be able to choose who I invite. I didn’t know what else to say to convince her, so I guess my aunt won’t be coming.

Some context: she’s told me again and again how her family is toxic and I used to believe her but I’m starting to think that she may just call them that because they don’t agree with everything she says. However, my mom is such a strong woman and she’s not stupid. Part of me thinks there’s a grain of truth in there. As for my dad, he doesn’t believe that. He thinks that I should have grown up close to our family and that it’s not fair that our mom cutting everyone off resulted in me and my sister being isolated from them. I believe him. I remember when, before we moved to the states, how I’d babysit my cousins and always go to my aunt and uncle’s homes and just, be with others. I kind of started realizing that it was weird that our family was so isolated when I observed that my friends always had a lot of people with them during the holidays while every single year, it was just us four.

So basically, I don’t know who to believe. I don’t know if my dad just doesn’t want to attend this event and that’s why he brought the idea up (which is what my mom believes) or if my mom just refuses to talk to my aunt/her sister and isn’t willing to bend even if it’s what I want.

My aunt is nearing retirement age and her husband died 10 years ago, she doesn’t have kids so she enjoys taking care of her nieces and nephews. When we first moved here, she took all four of us in to her one bedroom apartment and we lived there for a year before my mom and her had a disagreement and my mom had us leave. I haven’t talked to her since, but I’ll be going off to college next year and I want to reconnect with her. Or at the bare minimum, thank her for all that she’s done and show her my achievements as proof that it made a difference.

I don’t know what to think and I kind of just wanted some outside input without dumping this stuff onto my friends. Should I side with my mom or dad? Assuming, I can change my mother’s mind, should I have my aunt come instead of my father?

Also, I’m not sure if this makes a difference but I’m a senior in high school, so I don’t have much influence over my mother, even with decisions that are meant for me to make. 

TL;DR: I want to invite my aunt (who I haven’t spoken to in three years bc my mom cut her off) to an event meant to celebrate my achievements, but it would come at the cost of not bringing my father (who’s okay with that). My mom and father disagree and I don’t know what to think.",07Apr2019,2
78,"So this whole thing started a year ago. I was in a group chat for my university for my ethnicity with about 900 people. My boyfriend is in it too. There was a girl who would post her selfies and she had an really amazing body. I’ll call her Ashley. I  was in bed when I saw her post her pic and I almost thought to show my boyfriend wow this girls body looks so good just because. But I didn’t. The next day I overheard him on the phone telling one of his friend “Ashley  posted herself half naked pics in our school chat. What a slut I’m so glad I didn’t catch anything” I feel like it was a bragging thing amongst his friend. I don’t know why but it would of made me sick if I would have turned around and complimented her and then turn to find out he slept with her.

It caused me to spiral in an unhealthy obsession with this girl. In the beginning I 
I started going through her Instagram, her twitter etc then I forgot about it.
Then a couple months ago I started going through her page more often almost everyday. It’s starting to turn into a daily thing Wanting my body to look like hers. Having her bad bitch attitude about myself. Having the kind of fun she does. Wanting to work at one Hooters-type restaurant that she works at. Having her confidence etc... like just unhealthy obsession and comparison 
Me and my boyfriend have talked about our past sexual experiences. He told me he slept with this ashley girl before and he met her one time through a friend  and never spoke to her again. And it happened it 2015 a month before he met me. 
. The other day I was on  his twitter and when I went to his search he searched for three different Ashley’s and was checking on her page. He very rarely uses his social media’s but I unfollowed her on every single one.  For some reason I decided to go through his old phone to see if they ever talked more than this one time and I saw they had small talk and he also reached out with her to carpool with him to his to her old college 4 hours away for their homecoming. This was a month after we started talking but weren’t exclusive. This was in 2015 but it makes me angry and jealous.
I know this is crazy, it’s literally been near 4 years. I don’t even see they had any communication past 2015 and I’m letting this make me feel some type of way about myself. Like I’m not pretty enough, I wasn’t good enough to get asked on a date after having a one-night stand with him like she was even though she rejected his offer. I was the one pursuing him not the other way around like he was with this girl. I keep my feelings to myself and I’m so aware of how irrational and crazy this is.

alright to set the stage for you folks , I'm in a good University in a comfortable country I have everything I need but to be honest the fees and expenses of living here are taking their toll on my family financially , to add on top of that a feeling of emptiness , depression and disconnect always haunted me Even though I have amazing friends .

A little backstory: Around three years ago, I got out of an abusive relationship, and my current boyfriend is the only one I've dated since. He makes me laugh like no one else can, he handles my anxiety like a pro, and he is SO so kind to me. Basically everything my ex was not. He is a talented actor, and wants to pursue performing as a career. With that being said, he is LAZY. After graduating high school, he didn't go to college, (I understand that in the field of performance, you don't always need a degree, however, he hasn't tried to succeed in acting either aside from one audition a few months ago.) And he's made money since then by cleaning his church where he only makes $300 a month. He tells me all the time that one day he'll do it. One day he'll move out of our city. One day he'll get started, but he hasn't and my patience is growing thin. He still lives with his mother, and although he wants to get out of that house, he seems to be making no effort to do so. I, on the other hand, am working two jobs to have enough money to go to college and pay for my education. I'll be moving about an hour away from where we live, and I have a feeling that unless he moves with me, we won't see each other often at all. It may be a little old fashion, but being a wife and a mother are my priorities. I have no problem settling down in the same town I grew up in, working a steady job and raising my kids. He doesn't want the same thing. He wants adventure and freedom and travel and excitement and risk. That was attractive when we first started dating, and now it's the thing I can't stand the most. Am I selfish for wanting him to choose a different, more steady career path? Does it make me a gold digger if I want him to make good money so we can comfortably live and raise a family together? He brings so much joy to my life but I'm terrified that his lack of ambition will drive me away. I've caught myself thinking that there may be other guys out there who will provide that kind of stability and care that I'm seeking. He says if either of us is going to break up with the other, It would be me because he won't be the one to do it, but then cries when I bring up the possibility of us not working out.

97,"Sorry this is a jumbled mess. 

My dad seems to lack empathy sometimes and does weird controlling things, and I never really had any father son moments growing up, he was mostly doing good own thing while I played with my toys. 

My sis is a narcissist, she's always been selfish, controlling, manipulative, and basically a horrible person to me in general.  

I once had a narcissist best friend for 8 years before discovering what he truly was after he murdered my ex gf's dog and then lied about it trying to hide it for a week. 

My mom would take toys away from me when i was a child to give to my sis even if it made me cry, she favored my sis, and always took care of her first. My dad said I was an accident and my mom wanted a daughter, so that's why they had my sis.

My ex of 9 years (on/off) might also be a narcissist too, I'm not sure, or at the very least she is definitely selfish, as she cheated on me multiple times, and just broke up with me again last weekend. 

I struggle with depression and regular negative thoughts... what hope do I really have? 

I have a decent place I rent, except I rent from my controlling dad, who threatens to kick me out whenever I do something he doesn't like, which is never anything serious. Sometimes he'll send me angry ranty texts late on the day, claiming I take advantage of him and accusing me of lying or other things I didn't do. I never know when he's driving by my house, spying on me. One time my friend from out of state came to visit, she parked her car here for the day while she went to hang out with other friends she hadn't seen, with the pan to crash at my place and hang out with me later. I got a pic text the next day from my dad of her car, stating ""so who moved in?"", accusing me of having someone move in which is against his rules. 

All I do is innocent things: I like to hangout with my friends on occasions, mostly just play video games, drink, and smoke, however he hates it and continually implies I'm a failure, lazy, and a loser, even though I work full time at a decent office job. 

Recently my sis moved in with me, I had no choice per my dad. My sis is horrible, every day she comes home she tries to instigate me emotionally in some way, ignoring her isn't an option because she seeks me out. One time she called my ex racial slurs to entice me. When I tried to ignore her, she came up to me and tried to slam my laptop screen down... when I tried to move her arm away she immediately took out her phone and took a picture of her arm saying she was going to call the police. Another time when I was trying to ignore her she started recording me with her phone, with flash on, demanding answers for things I didn't do.

 The crap part, is I didn't know my sis was a narcissist at first, i had talked to her over xbox the past half a year and i thought she had changed. I think she just manipulated me to help her move down here. Later, she encouraged me to quit my job because I was miserable there and said she'd cover my bills for a couple months while I find a better job, because I helped her out for her first 2 months here... but when I quit I saw her true face once she was in control. 

Now I can't escape. I don't have enough money to move out. Good rental options are super rare, all I can seem to find are scams. I haven't been able to get a job yet and it's been weeks. I only have enough money for like 1 month. 

I feel trapped. I have no support, no family or friends who could help. I'm not really close with any of my other family. My friends are all struggling too and can't help. My best friend lives 2 hours away and rents a room, so no space for me. 

I might just be venting. But... jeez. It's kinda scary. My plan is to try to get a job and a new place asap... but... sometimes I don't know how much more I can take, if I'll be able to make it, or if someone like me, whos been through all I have, even has a chance to ever mentally grow past the damage I've been dealt... :/ I want to try to at least be around for as long as my dog is, she's 8 this year, a chihuahua, so she might get up to 15-18.... but sometimes I just don't know if I can make it. It keeps getting harder and harder. Someone recently explained to me overcoming these issues is like unlearning how to swim.

So the laptop he had finally kicked the bucket, so I bought him a new laptop with better hardware. However, I couldn't find an install file for Lotus, so moved all 5100 of his old PDFs and all of his client folders into OneNote pages. As far as I could tell, that was the best free alternative to Lotus on the market today. I also installed a document scanner app on his phone, so he could capture signed documents instead of having to drive back home to scan them in. All of this was designed to be as simple as possible for him. I wrote down instructions, walked him, through it several times and I've seen him do it with no assistance.

Yesterday, I came in from a grocery run and my dad called me to his office. He was furious at his phone, saying the app wasn't showing a checkmark button that moved to a screen where he could attach it in Gmail. It was there, in plain sight, and I showed him. He was pissed anyway.

Then he started screaming about how he couldn't send contract files to any of his clients. Based on what I was seeing, he spent almost 30 minutes trying to text a PDF to his client's number and got bounces. When I asked if he tried to send it via email, he said, ""fuck that stupid email, I can't figure out how to make it work."" He's sent multiple emails before to me.

The next three hours, I tried to help him figure out where in the process he was going wrong, and he refused to answer me. I would ask him to show me how he opened Chrome on the laptop, he would look at it for a few seconds, then say, ""here's my question: why do companies change all this stuff all the time? There are millions of people like me that can't figure this stuff out. It's stupid!"" and crosses his arms like a child having a tantrum. Everything I tried to do to explain these basic processes to him were met with the same hostility, along with comments that he "" has actual skills, computers don't count as skills.""

I was at my breaking point because he was just being such an asshole to me when I was trying to help him. I told him the world changes over time, including technology, and I asked how he planned to handle communicating with clients if he refused to use these things.

""Easy, I'll print out a copy and hand deliver it to them. It means I lose a lot of clients, but I have to keep doing this because the emails don't work I have to make money to keep the house. So I'll drive."" 

On that day, he drove 4 hours round trip to hand deliver two contracts to different clients. This is a 5 minute task. I was gobsmacked. This man was telling me earlier last year about how he wasn't getting enough clients and how money was tight. Turns out, he's been doing this for weeks, burning gas, fucking up his truck, giving up clients because he can't figure out how to work Gmail.

My parents aren't very well off. My dad is a one man operation, and he tends to undercharge people and just sulk when they don't pay him instead of suing them or sending their bill to collections. My mom is a church secretary and it's steady, but not enough to cover the mortgage that they're struggling to pay ever since the housing bubble burst.

I don't know what to do. Until I find a new job, I'm my dad's unpaid IT guy, and he's acting in bad faith. He doesn't want to learn how this stuff works, he just wants all of technology to go back 10 years and never change. He refuses to acknowledge that he has to change to the world around him. It's going to drive my parents into bankruptcy at this rate, and all that has to happen to fix it is 1) help him believe that he can eventually understand this stuff and 2) get him to actually learn it so he's not blowing off potential clients.

Anyone know of a program for teaching seniors how to use technology? Any words of advice or encouragement are also appreciated. ",07Apr2019,1

105,"So last year my dad returned from being away because of a restraining order from mom. 

   Now you might want to know why. Well before according to my mom, in between those 5 years he was gone, she told us he did drugs, was an alcoholic, abusive and maybe more since we(my siblings and I) dont really know the whole story because I'm still young(14). And why he came back was because he, supposedly, loves my mom and misses us and loves all of us.

   Things were great in those 5 years. We had a dogo( who was given away because we moved from another shitty altercation my mom had with an ex), we had super fun camping trips with my moms family, had cool nights of fun with just mom, etc. 

   But ever since he came back shit just hit the fan. He's super religous, family oriented( to the point of being an asshole in front of company about it), no longer abusive, an alcoholic, and druggie. But my mom and him have *the* most stupidest arguments because he is very arrogant and prideful to the point where insists he is right even  when proven wrong. 

   Cops have been called already and I don't know what to do because he is nice majority of the time but can snap and you dont when he's going to snap and be pissy and argue.",07Apr2019,1

107,"So I have a problem with some of the women at my work. Two just bring drama non-stop and blame everyone for their mess ups. The other is so two-faced that I'm shocked she even knows who she supposedly likes and who she dislikes at any given time. 

Well, today we had a meeting and the drama queens started fights with everyone even our bosses. I tried to deal with it but honestly, I'm just sick of them. I lost my temper and said that to me it seemed like the problem was with them and not other people. 

I ended up having to work with them later in the day. Probably about two hours into my shift I came in contact with a chemical that everyone knows I'm allergic to. It was on a towel and it had replaced the one I had been using. Pretty much within seconds I had a bad reaction. 

Now the only way this could have happened was if  someone had taken the uncleaned towels that sit in bucket with said chemical in it. When you remove these towels, you wash them off around 3 times to get it out. Clearly that towel hadn't been washed off at all. It was like they just grabbed it from the bucket while I wasn't looking and switched mine out.

I believe it was the girl I'm having issues with. Because she had walked over there while I was helping a customer and had seen me mainly using that one machine and towel. 

Now I plan to ask the boss to check the tapes and if she's seen on there changing my towel then I might need to have my shifts changed to never be around her or report her to the cops because in my state, this is assault. She knew of the allergy and on purpose changed my towel. 

My advice needed is what I should do other then those two options. Like I don't want to not get along with them, I just want to make my money and do my job. Yet, I don't know how to handle this while fighting with my depression and now the added stress is making me feel like my depression meds aren't working.

Also, if they see this on here; oh well. Know that I don't want to dislike y'all but you're making it hard not too.   ",07Apr2019,1

So for about 2 1/2 months I have been working with this guy. When I first came there and I was on the cash register he gave me a tip and said it’s hard being new. After that we didn’t talk whole lot until recently when he would like make funny faces at me. He would come up to me and talk to me about girls he likes and girls that he thought was cute and stuff. I would sometimes like spray ice cream on him and he would make a dirty look but then I’d be smiling and say sorry and he’d start smiling. Anyways it was my last night and so he asked if it was my last day and I said yes and he was asking where I was going to work and I said a place then he said he was going to quit soon too and work somewhere. Anyways he asked if I was clocking out and I said yes and he was like aw. So anyways I was too scared to say goodbye or anything so I just left but I got his number from work when I was going to ask him to cover and I wanted to send the link to the new place that he wanted to work because I said I couldn’t find the link should I do that or would it be creepy?",07Apr2019,1

111,"My sister and I fly off to Japan tomorrow and I told her that she better get travel insurance before we do. 

So she finds one she likes, fills up her details and all the travel details before she proceeds to check out. When she sees the online receipt, the travel dates are wrong and she makes a big fuss on how the website screwed her over and sort of subtly blames me for making her buy travel insurance.

Then I asked her whether she checked all the details before checking out and she swiftly redirects and said she asked me about what we’re the days we were traveling and that she remembers clearly clicking on those dates. I ask her again whether she checked before purchasing and she said probably the website had a glitch and the dates changed by itself. I get a little upset because she is not seeing that maybe, just maybe she clicked the wrong date and even if she didn’t, she should check before purchasing. She says that she knows what she clicks and therefore doesn’t need to check. I realise that there is no point in arguing with her and I just go off to do my own thing.

She then calls the company tells them that she needs a refund because their website is faulty. They tell her how to proceed with it and all that jazz.

So basically, I stopped trying to make her see the bigger picture because she’s always been like that. I don’t want her to go through life with this attitude so how should I practice conversing with her?? How do get someone to stop projecting and blaming everything else and maybe take a step back to see maybe they had some fault??

TLDR: Sister blames website for wrong travel insurance purchase. She doesn’t 100% know whether she filled in the right details in the first place but claims she does. She also didn’t check the details before purchasing.",07Apr2019,1

117," My best friend invited me to come to Colorado to a wedding that she was officiating for a friend. When we got there, that is when I met Ken (Ken is a F2M trans person). Imagine a park ranger persona type of person, with tattoos, with a big smile on his face while having his hands on his hips and looking up at the sky. That's Ken. For the majority of the time, we hung out. It was very apparent that we had some interest in each other. One night, we laid on the mountain top, just staring at the sky, talking..laughing with one another.  He then told me passively about his gf, I was kinda bummed out, but enjoyed the friendship, and honestly..it felt healthy to at least be that and see what happens in the future. A few nights later, he asked me what I thought about polygamy. That was unexpected, and I never thought about it. I told him just that and he kinda shook his head and started talking about an old crush of his who broke his heart, who he didn't trust anymore (Sara). I listened to it all in stride, having a fun time..and obviously getting an interesting glimpse into his mind. 

The next few months there was a lot of texting/calling. Casual conversation. This whole time I wasnt sure what kind of relationship he had with Angela (gf). Was it open? Is there interest there? I admitted to him one night that I had a crush on him, he reciprocated and that changed things. I asked him about Angela and he told me he was looking to end things with her, but didnt want to hurt her feelings. I told him not to string her along, and he agreed. He said that she agreed to his need for 'free love', and she was aware of this. The next month I came to visit him at his place, to hang out...or I have no idea. Angela was there 90% of the time, she came over and he would 100% ignore me and get all cuddly and in the zone with her. I felt like I was entertaining myself, or in a uncomfortable situation. I mentioned it to him cause he seemed oblivious, and he told me she wanted to be there so he had to prove all was well to keep her happy. The one day she didnt come over he wanted me to sleep in bed with him and we had sex. He had said they had an open thing going, so I thought it was okay. After I mentioned the fact I liked the idea of a relationship with him and he got scared or...like he didnt want to go there Remember, free-love guy. The next night we all (Angela too) went to the gay club and he was alllllll over this guy there. He was talking to me about him like ""mmm I bet he is really fun ;) I got his number"". That night Angela spent the night with Ken and I slept on the air mattress.  The next night, I got a call from my mom saying that my dad unexpectedly took a turn for the worst and was intubated. I went back home the next day to find he was dying. He died later that night of severe sepsis with all us around him. The hardest moment of my life.

The next few months, me and Ken continued to talk. Him and Angela's relationship was still there, and he kept saying he was intending on ending it...but never would. Then he said he would wait till he got back from California (a trip she pre-planned to visit family/Ken to meet family). Like he procrastinated hardcore cause he didnt want to hurt her feelings. After the trip, he did message me to tell me that happened. I was glad and glad she isnt being strung along. She was PISSED at him. (true story, she is now married to Kens brother). 
Ken came down to my house and we hung out, went to a street dance, enjoyed each other, etc. We talked vaguely about me moving down. At this point, relationship talks were being made..and our interest in each other grew. About 2 days before I moved down Ken told me casually and with positive inflection that he got another room mate...the random guy that he really hit on/wanted to sleep with at the bar. I hung up on him lol. He called back like ""did you accidently hang up?""  I told him I wasnt going to be in that uncomfortable situation again and he reassured me it is just for extra cash and he had no interest. I accepted that. I moved down, and one of the first things I saw was a ton of photos of that Sara girl he previously talked about, in frames, etc. I got a little ill, but he assured me it meant nothing. Quickly Ken became emotionally attached to me, and I to him. He told me he was in love with me. He constantly told me, sometimes at random, sometimes if I asked...that he was not interested in polygamy anymore, that I am enough for him and he just wants me. He was totally uninterested in sleeping with or being with anyone else. At all. For the entire relationship, he intilled that if asked. A year later asked me to marry him...and for someone who was so afraid of commitment, that stunned me. Around this time, I felt my health anxiety perk up. I am a severe hypochondriac with PTSD like issues from excessive, past severe trauma. I am currently being evaluated, but multiple terms have been discussed. I have had this issue since I was 5 years old and it fluctuates or disappears based on current situation. My folks instilled that going to a therapist would land me in a padded room and threatened me with such A lot. They felt it was my duty to figure my own self out and manage it. So I always severely avoided talking to a professional. I told ken openly that I was a hypochondriac with severe anxiety issues and he was understanding. At this point, I hadn't had that side of me appear yet. 
About a month later, I was on Kens  computer for some purpose, I just can't remember what it was. I ended up getting on the internet and went to FB. He was still logged in and I kinda pondered for a minute. I saw he messaged Sara and it was suggestive. Like, talking bout how good she was ""with your fingers ;)"" (they had a minor sexual encounter previously) and other flirty things. The problem was this was RECENT. And she was discussing a trip to Hawaii with him or something. That night, I showed him that I did see his messages, asked what that was all about and I was pissed. He wanted to sit down with me and run through the conversation to clarify he meant nothing. And that it was harmless talk like they always had. That he was thinking about Hawaii, but wouldn't do anything or would segregate out cause he didnt trust her. Just as a means to get an awesome vacation for free. Sara was on my #1 radar at this point. I didn't even understand why he insisted on talking to her though he said she hurt him. I then did the worst thing. The worst thing I have ever done and to this day, I made a faux Sara account spiting me in order to get Ken to stop talking to her. I was a shit for it, a total shit. The whole thing did go through and he deleted her. I didn't feel good about it at all, why would I? I knew I had to admit to Ken that I did it, no matter the cost. I knew the consequences that it bore; leaving me, him talking to her again, getting kicked out, I don't know..but I was prepared for whatever it was, so I told him. His reaction was, like it wasnt a big deal. Like he appreciated I told him but he didn't seem hurt. He told me he didnt have any interest in talking to her anyways so he was going to just keep it that way. 
I was shocked, like, I was prepared for a shit fire, but it never came..and he never ever brought it up again after that. So s few months later my health anxiety kick really started to come into full swing. It coincided with the wedding stress and all compiled just was a really bad scene. I was a shell of myself. My interest, cooking, comedy, piano, composing.. it all stopped. All that existed was my fears. For the next few years the anxiety would come, go, come, go and it would be bad. I would be so mentally occupied, that my surroundings were murky. I would question my irrational health fears to ken which, initially he was fine with...but then it was a regular thing and he couldn't deal with it cause it was bogging him down...and me being that way, like I said, e verything was murky. His personal issues surrounding it werent getting addressed from me. If he were to talk about how he feels and I was all there to listen, it was often he would say something very painful about me or us that I didnt know how to respond other than ""is that how you really feel?"" or ""why do you feel that way?"" and because my reaction was more shock or mild sadness than acceptance, he perceived it as not prioritizing his feelings. I always go all out for his birthday or Christmas or even randomly..with concert tickets, etc making an elaborate dinner or cheesecake. I always tried to spoil him cause I have some urge to tangibly show I value his smiles, but maybe I have a problem identifying and assessing the way he emotes? He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I would always put it off, try and get better on my own, fall back, and repeat. This is something that fluctuated depending on impending major events, or sometimes spontaneously.. I would do the health anxiety thing and he would push me to see someone. I kept meaning to but I just got clammy and scared over it. I tried so hard to keep it in myself and not burden him cause...I didn't want to burden him with it, I love him. Hes my husband, not a crutch..I need to walk with my two feet. I would internalize it all and then eventually ask him at some point. Throughout the on/off bouts..our lives were, good. We both worked at ACE together, a house, a great routine..and we genuinely enjoyed our time together. 5 out of 7 days Ken would wake up, then wake me up with a kiss on the cheek and a snuggle in bed, get in the car and go get breakfast sandwiches, drive to work, work, go to a restaurant after work, try and beat eachothers score in Cribbage, go home and watch Netflix in bed, sex, and cuddle to sleep. 5 nights a week for like...2 years. 
Then, his folks went on a road trip to boise and said they were looking to retire there. They wanted to fly Ken out the next day to look at homes with them cause they wanted us to move up there with them. I was unsure about this, I was comfortable where we were, but it was an opportunity to go somewhere better and with more options. Needless to say, they got the house and we all drove up in seperate cars.  1 week after (Jan 4 2019) Kens mom collapsed in the kitchen from an aneurysm. At first, we thought she was going to die and we all cried. She made it through tho..unscathed, which is rare. It was a long month in and out of the hospital for rehab for all of us, but she did amazing. She's back home and better...everyone is back to normal and stuff.

 I had severe suppressed anxiety from around February till now. A huge one. And Ken was at the end of his rope with it. We still did all the amazing cuddly, fun things together..enjoying each other but if my health anxiety seeped through, it ruined it. But through this all, h e always maintained that I was the one, he just doesn't want my anxiety, loves me, wants to be together, would never let me go...etc. This was literally 2 weeks ago that he told me all that. 
This last Tuesday was the big one. The big Kahuna.  Ken seemed odd. I couldn't put my finger on it. I asked him on Monday in bed what was going on, if he was distancing himself from me and he took a second and told me everything was fine and i was just imagining it. On Tuesday we went to eat dinner at some fancy restaurant, cracked some jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go do the $5 Tuesdays and he was all for that. Like totally excited, holding my hand, you know all the gooey lovely stuff. Which is normal and constant for us. I came home and gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend April and the text was something suggestive of me, but when I politely asked, he bold face lied to me saying it wasn't, I could tell he was lying and asked if it were really about me and he said ""well, yes"", ""well then why did you lie to me?"", ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"" and then I got angry, not cause he was talking to April about me (which isn't a state fucking secret, I really don't care) it was him lying to me. I blew up over it and that started this cataclysmic event. He went to the movie alone, and at the end of it texted me with this

""You've never believed how I felt about you. And you're right, I didn't know how to answer your question last night..thats why it took some time to think about. I am going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with you anymore, I don't want to do things with you anymore, you're not the person I want to be with. I gave you many chances to get help, I am done and I would like you to go""

You can probably imagine how I reacted, bawled like a baby. I called him making a complete ass out of myself saying he couldn't have meant that, he loves me, this cant be, I am sorry, I will fix this, I will go to a therapist, etc...and by god he just looked at me like ..get a fucking hold of yourself. I just lost it. He has never said that or ever even indicated EVER that he wanted that. Everytime, even weeks before he said he would never leave me, loves me too much, etc. On the way home I cried and apologized, and he just was like ""it's too late"".""I don't even know if I love you"","" you don't mean that"", ""yes, I do"" ""do you really want me to leave?"", ""YES"", ""for good?"", ""for now"". He went to bed as soon as he got home, not a tear, not a care, no reaction not even anger...just a fed up-ness. Once I got a hold of myself and processed it all, I wrote him an extensive text stating how I do need help, and I can't pretend any longer that I can deal with it on my own, and how I sure as shit can't use him as a crutch and that I don't blame him for being fed up with it, and to let me prove this and really do 120% by it. That it sucks I needed a massive push but I am going to do it and hope it betters myself as a standalone human cause I can't affect people like this, this bad. I wrote him basically that (summarized). He didn't respond the Wednesday, I contacted every single fucking therapist in town to get an appt in asap...and got one for Friday. My sister was resoundingly proud, (crying actually) that I am really going to do this, to find a way out of my own self. She'd only been pushing me for 20 years lol. I did everything I could to improve at least the quality of my day to help clear my head in all ways. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, got a decent sleep schedule, made dinner. Was it all a show? No. It was a step to trying to improve my habits and get myself back to the person I am when I am normal. Ken came home, and seemed...jubilant...which is normal. Not to me, just with his day. The bizarre thing was him being sporadically extremely nice/normal to me but also very distant. I got 1 text from him ""I am glad you go an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home"". I respected that, and didn't bother him.

Thursday I also cooked, made cupcakes, got groceries, still giving him his space. At this point in my head... I honestly was hoping for the best and expecting the worst. I was done with the 'pining' 'please take me back' mindset and just...trying to find the positive in that, everything happens for a reason, and maybe my stubborn ass needed a slap to put me in the place I really need to be. So I actually in a small way, looked forward to my appt. I talked to my sister of course and she really, understood his need to distance himself, to say ""you know what? I am fed up, I can't do this and I don't trust you will really do this"" but made it clear that if I follow through and really give it my 120000% and he still wants a divorce cause there is nothing there, then that is really shitty. I talked to April that night who basically was like ""I think he is done, like no hope good ole' American try 'done'. I was really excited you were finally getting that help, I just don't think that hope was shared"". The next day was my appointment and fuuuuuuck. Sitting across from a woman staring at you, talking about your entire life story in order to be assessed was bad, I picked my fingers till they bled. She was very worried about PTSD, and it manifesting in some tangible way. Afterward though, it felt...okay. like, I did it, and I will continue to. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me and I took that as it was safe to talk to him too. He was happy I really went, proud maybe..but wary. He was still in that 'place' but he was really seeing I am really trying and have been, and will continue to. He's in this ""we'll see how this goes"" but holds my hand kinda thing. He told me spontaneously then that he started talking to Sara again. My brain went blank. like the blankest stare into nothingness. Normally, I would be upset, but I was composed (but dying on the inside). He literally handed me his phone and said I am more than welcome to look at the texts. I was not ready for it. I just got Ken back and then this sunk me back to an even worse place. I read the texts and I literally could not believe my eyes.

""Why did you add me again?""

""I wanted to apologize for unfriending you years ago""

(proceeded to tell the entire story of when I made that fake account years ago, and how fucked up it was...the one I admitted to and he didn't even seem bothered by/said he didn't have any desire to talk to her anyway. Also told her I 'snooped' on their messages that time and it was totally ""fucked up""....the messages he literally encouraged i read through with and was understanding about and told me I was more than welcome to look at any of his stuff to prove he has nothing to hide )

""Omg! Why would you marry someone like that?""

""I contemplated calling it off when I found out, but I had too much money on the venue. I wanted to add you back all these years but I didnt want to make her mad, and I didnt know if it would really be you I was talking to you this time. I don't care what she sees anymore (see what?).""

""Don't worry, she's out of my life for good, how are you?""

(and literally the following is just a plethora of giddy 6-7am conversations with him talking about how beautiful the sunrise is there, etc and many phone calls.)

I was FUMED. I walked out to have a cigarette to try and compose myself. I asked him to come out and talk with me and basically he just confirmed that what he said about me was true, and to spice THAT up, was actually thinking about DIVORCE ""before"". I am like ""but you love me"" him: ""many people in love get divorced"" me: ""but you literally said 2 weeks ago we were meant to be..like always"" Him: *shrugs* me: ""You literally didn't want to be with me ever again??"" Him: ""the other day yes, but now (holds my hand, kisses my forehead) lets see what happens, cause I love you and I am glad you are going to a therapist, i want to make this work..but I can't live like this"". Then later he got defensive cause now all the sudden, it went from "" I don't have any desire to talk to Sara anymore"" years ago to ...now ""You don't have any right to dictate who I can and can't talk to"" merely because I verbatim said ""I am going to try and be okay with the Sara thing. It hurts, i hate it, I don't understand it, but I am trying here"". I told him it seems kinda odd he added her after all of these years right when he decided he didn't want me and he just shrugged his shoulders and said it doesn't mean anything and he wanted to apologize to her cause he felt bad. They are just friends. He doesn't think anything he did is wrong and it fundamentally is and feels wrong.  I had no idea about him contemplating marriage over something I literally admitted to him I did and chose to accept those kinds of consequences. Something he laid it to rest when I told him. He's talking about it to her like it did irreparable damage and was a huge thing. I thought it was at first, he said it wasnt.   Talking about how terrible of a person I am and just discarding me.  I read these things and it hurts cause he'd be romantic, sweet, and giving to me...through it all? How could he say those things? I have him back, kinda. Now he is in a...'it is going to take some time to earn my trust back but I want the anxietyless you cause I love you and I am proud you will get help' mode. I am going to continue to do my part, to do me, to fix myself...but like...I feel just...I don't even know. The Sara thing is extremely uncomfortable...and I don't know if that is something that I am overreacting over or he really is not doing right.

118,"I am a regular 22 year old tall dude who has no friends. Ive never had a GF and I'm very lonely. I have a pretty big family but I always feel alone. I have no one to talk to about things i like to talk about and only hang out with my parents. I talk to people at school but nothing comes of it. 

I feel like everyone my age is out partying on the weekend while I'm just sitting at home. I feel like I'm missing out because at my age you're supposed to be out with friends on the weekend. 

I very much want to fix my situation. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can meet friends and to put myself out there. Thanks",07Apr2019,1

120,"So, I don't really know what to do beyond what I've already done and if what I've done will do more harm that good.

I live in an indoor apartment complex. I heard crying and pounding, so I went out into the hall to make sure everything is ok. It turns out that the next door neighbor's 7ish year old boy was the one crying and pounding to be let into the apartment. He was out there for at least five minutes before I stepped out to investigate, but I have no idea how long he was actually locked out. I Adult Knocked three times while he stood next to me, and then yelled through the door that I would call the cops if they didn’t let him in immediately. This put him into a near panic, and he shouts ‘MOM PLEASE! LET ME IN, SOMEONE IS GOING TO FOR REAL CALL THE COPS!’ No one comes to the door, and in an effort to calm him down I told him I wouldn't call if he really didn't want me to, and that he could trust me. He stopped freaking out after that, and I told him that if it happened again he could come knock on my door and ask for help. He said we could call someone to make him mom open the door, and two calls to who he said was his dad later, a woman came to the door and let him in, at which point her story goes all over the place. She goes from  ‘oh I put him out for five minute timeout’ to ‘well he was playing with his friends’ to ‘oh I couldn’t hear him knock because of the baby’ all within three seconds of me asking what the fuck. She didn't have an excuse for not hearing my borderline cop knocking. In the mean time, as soon as the door opens, this little boy shoves past her and BOLTS into the apartment like he’s afraid he won’t be able to get in again. I made it clear to the man on the phone that if this happened again I \*would\* call the cops, which in hindsight was obviously very stupid.

Concurrent with this scene, one of the other moms in the building, along with three kids, one of which is not hers, says she is looking for her iPhone which she think may have ended up down the garbage chute. I brought her over to my apartment, and we sit in the hall while I let her use my computer to see if she can get Find My iPhone working. She's on a different phone with her husband, and while she's doing that I took the time to ask the three kids with her about the boy. As soon as I asked if they knew him they said yes, and it was clear they knew what I was going to ask about.  Apparently what happened tonight is not a one-time thing. One of the girls was emphatic about how common it is that he's lock out, and the other girl agrees. She said that when it happens during the day he comes to their house, and not only do his parents yell at him when he's finally let back in, but that he was being yelled at right then while we were sitting in the hall. She said she’s even seen his mother physically pushing the boy out of the apartment while he cries. I asked the kids if he seemed sad a lot and the two girls said yes but the older boy didn't seem keen on answering any of my questions. He seemed a lot more aware of what I was getting at than the girls, and sort of shrugged around my questions. I didn't prod him too much.  Phone Mom, on the other hand, says she doesn't know him or his mother, and that he just plays with her kids in the hallway.  Around this time, Phone mom finds out that her iphone isn't set up for FindMyiPhone at the same time as one of the girls' mother walks up. She says something in another language to Phone Mom. Third Mom and Phone Mom usher the kids down the hall and away from me, dismissing my offer to help if they need it again, and walk off in what is clearly an attempt to be calm but quick about getting themselves and the kids out of range of my questions.

I had called the cops before the conversation with the kids and mothers. Two officers came and talked to me in the lobby, and basically said that unless I had other incidents where I suspected he or the baby were being harmed, the most they could do was wag a finger at the mom for the whole thing, assuming she even answered the door. I asked them not to because I'm almost certain it would have done more harm than good and I wanted to keep him from finding out I called, which was a stupid expectation in hindsight.

Now, this building has from what I can tell are immigrant families from India, and all the kids from these families play together. I suspect that the lost phone was a cover, and they caught me doing exactly what they assumed was going to happen.

How do I help this boy? I know it seems stupid to call the cops because a kid was locked out of his apartment, but he looked to be about 7 and he was sobbing, and pounding on the door at around 9pm. He was in his pajamas, and smelled like soap so clearly he was at least close to bedtime. 

Obviously I can't call CPS/the cops again based off the word of two 6-8 year olds and one possibly neglected boy(who didn't want me to call the cops in the first place), especially with the massive collection of adults who know I called and spoke with two officers already, and who are possibly willing to/already are covering for this kid's parents. Regardless of that, I know that either one of the adults in his house, or the kids he plays with will mention that I talked to the officers tonight, so I don't know that he will trust me in the future.

I just feel like I really fucked up my long-term ability to help this kid and I don't know what to do going forward. What do I do?",07Apr2019,3
121,"Alright so here’s the deal. I live in a house in Austin, TX with two roommates. A girl and a guy. All of us are in twenties/early thirties. It’s a roommate situation that is very chill, friendly....but we all run in different social circles and aren’t really friends. The other girl roommate and myself are often not home (we have significant others that we stay at).....but maybe 2-3x’s a week I’ll stay at my own place. The dude is here all the time. This weekend my girlfriend is out of town, so I’ve been at my place consistently. First I’ve noticed that he has another chick basically living here....she seems wayyyy too comfortable to be a guest but whatever. He also has another friend crashing in the couch, but again...whatever. The girl is super weird and they are having LOUD sex....but again....whatever. Wednesday night they came busting in at 3 am and were hella loud but again....whatever. My concern is tonight, as I’m winding down I hear a baby crying. It appears his lady friend has a child. I’m honestly shook. This isn’t a party house but everyone here def parties. There’s weed like out in the open, and I know more.....potent drugs in everyone’s room. Ppl come and go constantly. Super strange. Like as a parent you clearly have poor judgement, but as a roommate do I have a right to say something? Other guests I’m obviously cool with and my girl has stayed here time to time. I don’t want to be the roommate with a stick up my ass, but also wtf?!? Any advice helpful.",07Apr2019,1
122,"So there is this kid at school who really doesn’t like me (or anyone one for that matter), but especially me. And I don’t really enjoy him either. And about a month or two ago we discovered that he was dating someone in fourth grade (we’re in seventh grade so you get why it’s a big deal) so from that news I decided to spread it all around the school.(now I’m not the most famous person in the school hierarchy but I’m not at the bottom either) and after awhile of talking and laughing, I basically made him a social outcast.(he doesn’t talk to anyone, after he throws away his food he sits at tables with no one at them, he is “friends” with the teachers etc.) and he hates me now more than ever. And now there is talk about a fight that will happen between me and him. Now I know I could easily kick his ass, but there is a field trip that is coming up and if I get in a fight with him, I might not be able to go on that trip. So I need to know how to prolong a fight for an extra 2-3 weeks while still pissing him off.

124,"from the outside, i’m just a normal girl with awesome friends. but thé truth is that i’m currently losing control of my life with nobody by my side. this whole thing makes me wasn’t to end it all. it all started with a boy, we can call him jay for the sole purpose of the story. jay and i had a crush on each other last year when we didn’t really know each other. i never really stopped having a crush on him but that doesn’t really matter for this story. we added each other on snapchat and started talking (a lot) at the time, i had the same friends. i’m just going to use their names because they will never read this. Daniella, Daisy, Miriam, and Maddy. It was perfect. Daniella was my best friend I could ever had. She understood me, told me everything. Daisy and Miriam would always be off making trouble, typical rebellious girls :). Jay and I were close friends awhile later. Once I tilde Maddy what the situation was she started making the situation terrible. She would push him around and yell at him. I had a problem with that, but I never voiced it because I thought it was normal for teenage girls to do that to each other (turns out it actually wasn’t) shit hit the fan when Maddy started being dramatic to the friend group and telling lies that she was poor, abused, etc. Keep in mind that the rest of us girls in the friend group had actual bad lives and she was trying to guilt trip us into caring about her more that we cared about ourselves. After all of this happened, I was fed up with all the things she was doing and I wanted to show her what I felt about her hurting all of my friends and I. She started sitting at a different lunch table and things were chill for awhile with Jay and my friends. After awhile things started changing. Things kept happening in my family life. Basically my family isn’t healthy in which I don’t feel like going into too much detail. I kept going to Jay. He gave valuable advice and he listened like I mattered. This is where things really start to go to shit. Daniella and Daisy became closer and she started leaving me out for Daisy. Miriam separated herself from our group. My other best friend Marissa started thinking she was the only one that should ever have a reason to feel pain and trust me I have ALWAYS been there for everyone. Jay wasn’t comfortable to trust anymore. All I needed was a friend to support me, but he gave me advice that I didn’t need. Maddy started dressing like me, texting like me, watching the same shows as me, talking to a bunch of my friends. and tried talking to me again. (she also stared talking trash about me when I didn’t want to be her friend again) At this point I started self-harming. I was screaming for help. Even told Daniella I was considering suicide. She told me that I would burn in hell and distanced herself even more from me. My “friends” came up to me and told me my flaws. “Really? You’re wearing too much makeup. You’re gonna get more acne than you already have.”  I feel alone. Nobody is there for me at this point and i’m extremely insecure about myself and I wish I had someone to talk to. I really would like any advice except telling me to get new friends because at this point I barely care about school. I still have all of my friends that I had at the beginning, but all of him have replaced me with others and/ or have become toxic and mean.

126,"And not only my romantic life, but it’s affecting aspects of my entire life.

I dated W for two years. We had been living together for over a year. But our relationship became sour shortly after I moved in with him. I was unhappy for a long time with this relationship. He could never pay his half of rent, cheated, and didn’t clean up after himself. I was overly critical and cold.

In the fall W slowly starting changing his behavior and all of his issues gradually got better. He started being faithful even. I was appreciative of the effort. But the fall is also when I met C at college.

I had feelings for C and felt incredibly guilty about that. I even made myself not talk to him for months, but unfortunately my unhappiness in my relationship left room for me to do something shitty. Even though W was changing, I knew I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life with him. I had decided that whether or not C was in the picture. And I didn’t feel much in love with him or attracted to him. So in late February I ended my two year relationship with my live-in boyfriend to leave for another man. It was a huge life change for me. It meant I had to dedicate myself to finding a new place to live (still isn’t working out ugh) and to ending an incredibly important part of my life. It devastated W. I really hurt him but truly felt I had to do it for myself and my happiness.

C was absolutely amazing, saying things about how he never felt so well connected to someone. And I was crazy about him. The connection actually was really apparent. Physically and mentally, we went really well together. I thought I found something special. But a month in he drifted away, made up excuses to not see me, texted about half as much... I tried to wait out what was happening because he told me he was just really stressed. C’s involved in a lot of things  and pretty busy. I texted him after not seeing him for over two weeks, because you know, I’m not dumb. He isn’t THAT busy by any means. I knew I wasn’t gonna see him again. It was just like 4 sentences. I told him I thought he was wonderful (because I do) but I’m going to move forward. And I said I felt like he lead me on. Because... idk. But he didn’t even reply. I don’t understand what happened. I feel quite stupid. Especially because I changed my life for this and felt good about the decision I made. And I was excited. I was so excited for the future.

Me and W started being a little romantic and physical again after this. Just something to do to satisfy our physical needs for affection. But after a week HE drops on me that he met someone and can’t be like that with me anymore. I got rejected twice in one week. I still se no future with W, i wasn’t hoping to get back together, but I still feel hurt? Oh. and tonight his new girl is coming over. I know I ended things with W but I still feel jealous because I was with him for two years.

I took this risk of leaving W for C and it truly seemed  like it was going to make me as happy as I was hoping. Now I feel as low as I’ve ever felt. I miss C even though I hate to admit it. And my ego is bruised. I left my ex and then tried to find comfort in him out of loneliness only to get rejected on that end too. I feel alone. Honestly, I am alone, because W was my only good friend before I broke up with him. I lost my best friend. I thought C was going to be worth it I guess. 💁🏻‍♀️ and tonight I’ll have to let another girl on my bed. Because I made this decision and I’m sleeping on the couch.

I think there’s nobody to blame but me in the end.

127,"As a 20 yr old male finishing his sophomore year of college, I’ve recently adopted an urge to explore. I came back from a spring break trip with friends to Orlando a month ago, and I’m already wanting to open my sails again.

I have a couple thousand saved up from college refund checks and work and so on. I’ve looked into going places, and have accepted that I might be going alone since my friends don’t have the money or time that I do. 

The problem is where to settle on the map. I want to travel locally in the U.S. but I also want to experience the responsibility and magic of international travel. I want to soak up rays on a beach or island, but I also want to experience the “big city life” (think like NYC). I want to see places with beautiful plants and trees like the cherry blossom trees in Japan, but I also want a piece of art to capture my attention like Ferris Bueller in the museum.

128,"So basically, I had this ""acquaintance"" for about 2 years in college. We shared classes for about 2 years, and I had been very interested in her for a while. About 3 weeks ago, I found out that she had transferred schools to another college where I was also looking at transferring to. I decided to message her and ask her about the school because I've got to make my decision to transfer soon.

Fast forward a few days, and we start hanging out together and building an actual friendship. It turns out she's a lot cooler than I thought years prior, and I'm bummed I didn't know her better sooner. We kind of hit it off talking and hanging out, and eventually I find out she's been interested in me as well.

Fast forward another week or so, and she invites me to hang out with her and some of her friends. She never really talked about them other than to say they're pretty wild people. When we all hung out, I found out that was the truth. They are truly insane, and I could never find myself hanging out with a group like that. That being said, it's like the girl changed completely too. When she and I were alone or with any of her friends from her previous college, she was very mellow, down to earth, interesting to talk to, and just an absolute sweetheart. When we're with her ""wild friends"", she's just an absolute party animal, who gets herself trashed, does a ton of drugs, and seems to not care about anything except for your stereotypical party style things.

That all put me in a weird place for considering a potential relationship or even just better friendship with her, but that's not even the most odd thing about the situation. Last night, we all hung out again, and she was talking to some other girl about sugar daddies (don't worry about me, I'm broke and couldn't spend money if I wanted to). It somehow slips out that she's a cam girl, and my mind instantly just nopes the fuck out. In that instant, I was so ready to leave. But I didn't, because there was something in the back of my head that told me that it's not so bad. 

So, that's where I'm at. On one hand, I somehow feel like if I was a girl and I needed money, I might do camming things because let's be honest, that's an easy 5k a week. But on the other hand, she and I are exploring the possibility of a deeper friendship or even dating, and that's just such an odd change for me. I don't have any friends who are camgirls but her (that I know about at least), and it just makes me sort of uncomfortable. Am I wrong for feeling that way? Should I get away when I can? Should I stick it out because I think she's a genuinely good, fun, and down to earth person outside of her party friend group?

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up I didn't really know how to socialize with people. I don't remember much of elementary, and I know I was awkward and weird throughout middle and high school. When I got to college I knew I'd have to really improve my social skills and make real friends. I've been able to learn how to socialize well and I can definitely hold conversations and come off as social and I've been told that I'm interesting to talk to, but it's still hard for me to make what I call lasting friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I've been able to make friends at church and we have a snapchat group chat and we're always messaging. I'm happy I've been able to make a new group of friends cause I definitely needed one. These people are good people and I generally enjoy hanging out with them except for this one thing. I always feel like I'm the one getting roasted in the group, and I feel like this usually happens in all the friend groups I am a part of. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's this one girl - We'll call her Ashley for this post - who is usually really, well, how do I put it, she can be really in your face. It's hard to describe but I know that there are other girls like her. She's kinda like that girl in the group who gets in your face and is ""Savage"" and extremely sarcastic. Normally I like hanging out with her but lately I feel like Ashley is always roasting me. Usually I can take light banter and stuff, and I really like it when I'm out on dates and I'm flirting with my date and using banter and stuff. I honestly think good natured fun like that is hilarious in dating. And like, if im playing video games with friends and I'm doing terrible, I can joke about it you know? I play PUBG (a Battle Royale Game with my Friends) and I know I suck. One day we were playing and we got into a game and my buddy says in a serious voice ""Hey OP, you gonna drag us down today?"" and I laughed and said ""I mean yeah probably man"" and I got the whole chat laughing. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is there are definitely some roasts I can take. However, I think that there is much more to a friendship than just roasting and I hate when I am constantly getting roasted. When I'm hanging out with my church group, I feel like Ashley always picks on me or gets in my face and I hate it. It makes me uncomfortable and it honestly stresses me out. Roasting/being mean isn't really in my personality cause I really try to be nice and friendly to everyone! Also, stress is the last thing that I need because I have an anxiety disorder and this is already a really stressful semester as I am graduating soon and taking very difficult classes! 

&amp;#x200B;

A while ago, I had to end a friendship with a guy, we'll call him Luis, because I felt like Luis was always, always roasting me. It didn't matter what I said or did. If I so much as looked the wrong way Luis was gonna roast me/make fun of me. It got to the point where I always had to be on guard around him and I tried to roast him back but I most of my roasts fell short or they didn't have any effect on him cause I guess he has ""super thick skin?"". Hanging out with luis just started really upsetting me and stressing me out, and I knew because of his culture that he wouldn't stop if I asked him too - rather he'd just roast me more. I didn't know what to do or say so I just stopped associating with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm ultimately trying to get at is that I honestly think I can handle banter and that i'm not too sensitive or that I'm a ""bitch"", I just don't like getting roasted all the time. It makes me uncomfortable and stresses me out, and like I said above, stress is the last thing I need! I don't want to lose my church friends, but tomorrow I am going to ask Ashley to stop roasting me. I'm gonna tell her that it makes me uncomfortable, but I honestly only think she does it cause she doesn't know how else to interact with me. I guess what I'm ultimately asking is: Why do I keep getting roasted all the time? Am I really being ""too sensitive""? How do I better handle getting roasted? And what is the best way to approach Ashley? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR : I feel like in my friend groups I am always the one getting roasted and I don't like it. I don't think I am being too sensitive, I just don't like it and I'm not a mean person/person who enjoys always picking on others. Am I in the wrong and am being too sensitive?

138,"Lemme now if this duplicated it said to repost but I’m not sure if it worked. 

This is gunna be a long post so buckle up if you plan to stay

First, some backstory

I’m the last of four kids, the oldest is 28, my brother, then my sister who’s 25-ish I think, then my second sister is 20, and me; a misfit 15 year old weirdo boy. Our parents are in the early 50s. My father is really manipulative and my mom is always stressed and can’t hold a conversation without becoming really shrill and loud. 

I grew up hating my dad, and so did my siblings. We were all homeschooled, so we were around each other all the time and we ended up being each others best friends. I never had friends apart from them, so I’m emotionally dependent on them to a HIGH degree. However, one by one, they moved out. They now all live with each other a few towns over, about 20 minutes away from where me and my parents still  live (same house I’ve been in since I was 3. It’s the unspoken hub of my existence). I try to sleep over every weekend to be able and spend time with them, because in many ways they are still my only friends. 

I actually haven’t been homeschooled for a few years and have jumped between 3 different schools since I left homeschooling (each year is a new school) last year I went to a private school but now I just go to my district public high school, which I really like. I’m not doing very well, a couple As, a B, a C, and currently an F. Oof, kinda going down a rabbit hole here. 

Anyways, everyone around me has always been very judgmental of everyone else, which has made me self-monitor to an unhealthy level. I micromanage my actions to the point that I act weird. Even walking is difficult to do once I start thinking about how I look doing it. There’s something I should mention real quick - I’m very self conscious about my physical appearance. I’m a little overweight and severely out of shape so my figure is weird af, and so I try to wear clothing to hide it. Doesn’t work very well. 

Anyways - my social skills are highly underdeveloped and it’s only getting worse. I feel like whenever I’m around my siblings I start to act weird, the way I act around strangers and non-family members. It scares me to think that I’m starting to lose my connection with them. They are unbelievably important to me.

I also feel like everyone hates me (whoops! Was that topic change too quick for you? Oh well!). I feel like everyone is nice to my face and hates me behind my back. It’s starting to feel this way with my siblings, too. 

This scares me. 

A lot. 

They criticize me a lot, but they also do a lot for me. They’re all interested in seeing me improve and go somewhere in life. In many ways, they’re better parents than my real parents. 

Or are they?

Thus the overthinking begins. I’m torturing myself by thinking about it. Every time I do, I feel like I’m growing apart from them. By brain is trying to turn me against them, and it’s doing this in part because of how I was raised. 

I haven’t even managed to scratch the surface of things. Stuff like my synesthesia, the fact I’m afraid to admit that I have depression (I don’t think I do), the fact that I have no interest in dating (ever. No, mom, it’s not a phase), my inability to make eye contact, and god knows how many other things. 

If you’ve made it to here, then thank you. I appreciate your willingness to listen and dedicate your time to me, a stranger on the web. 

TL;DR (because it’s required?)
Experiencing distancing with my very close siblings and am having self-conscious/anxiety about my relationship with them. Really, the entire thing is a tldr, but whatever. 

I don’t even know what I intend to accomplish by posting this. Maybe advice? Idk.

142,"Hi all,

The situation is pretty much what the title says. I moved to a new address renting from my fiancee's dad in the next town over. My mom is a person who invites herself over unannounced and forces herself into things. She also is manipulative and has done things in the past with my sibling's in-laws that concern me. She has been fishing for our address in very obvious ways that when we provide a work-around, she is insistent on getting the address. We have thought about getting a PO Box, because most of the fishing is done through wanting to send us stuff in the mail, but it is expensive and we would prefer other options. I REALLY don't want her to have my new address, because I want to be able to initiate the relationship and I don't want to potentially drag my future FIL(who I am on great terms with) into my complicated relationship with my mother. The snag that I'm hitting is that if I tell her the truth, I think she would take it extremely poorly, but I can't think of a lie that is convincing and/or long term and neither can my fiancee. What should I do?",07Apr2019,1

147,"So I just want to preface this post with the fact that I acted like a complete asshole in this situation and I'm pretty certain there is no way to rectify what I did but I just wanted to see if anyone had any ideas for advice. 

When I was in college, pretty fresh off of being dumped by my high school girlfriend, I started hanging out with one of my good friends from high school more and more. I really enjoyed talking/hanging out with her and she was going through some things of her own during the same time (anxiety, crazy ex). She was honestly one of the most genuine and nicest people I've ever met and I really enjoyed her friendship. However, I was also kind of a shit head and still emotionally confused after the break up I went through and started convincing myself that I was getting feelings for her - so I told her. She was surprised by it but thought that we should give it a try. So after a summer of hanging out/hooking up I go back to school and within the first couple of weeks there I get blacked out on a weekend and hook up with someone else. I felt bad about it but at the same time I'm not certain of what my feelings are towards my friend or how I want to proceed. I wind up telling her what happened, she's a little upset but understands how our relationship was never defined and still decides that she wants to keep seeing me if that's what I want. Anyway a little time goes on, I get really confused on what to do and I basically just stop talking/texting her all together - without ever really telling her what I want or resolving the situation. I basically ghosted her, which I totally understand is a fucked up thing to do to a friend.

So now its about 5 years later, I'm in a very stable relationship with someone, but I can't help thinking about what I did to one of my really good friends and never resolving the situation (like apologizing if I hurt her, telling her that I just wasn't ready for a relationship at that time, or that I really cherished her friendship). I haven't seen her or talked to her since what happened. I just feel really terrible about the whole situation and can't help but be concerned if I really hurt her or if she is okay. I know it's too selfish to want to have a friendship with this girl anymore but I can't help thinking about wanting some sort of closure in this situation. Just looking for any advice on what (if anything) I can do.",07Apr2019,2
148,"Me and my best friend are both in high school. I'll call her Emma in this post. Growing up, we were always very close because we were so mentally ill that we legitimately did not have to capacity to make other friendships. To put the severity of our problems in perspective, my psychologist who performed my psychological assessment told me that I had the ""worst case of juvenile agoraphobia and anxiety"" that she had ever seen. In a weird way, we bonded over the mental illnesses that we had in common, as it felt like we were the only people in the world who understood each other. Another major thing that we could bond over was our parents' attitudes towards mental illness. They would do anything to convince that it was in our heads or that we would grow out of it. So, we were left to wallow alone in our social inhibition and horrible mental state. We were hardly getting by.

By the time we reached the beginning of high school, I knew something had to change. After about three years of fights with my parents, I convinced them to get me some mental help. To cut it short, I'm now getting therapy and taking medication. The change has been monumental.

On the other hand, Emma just keeps getting worse and worse. She's incredibly intelligent, however she's getting hardly mediocre marks now. She lives in the shadow of her highly successful older brothers, always feeling like she's some error within her familial line. She has a habit of self-sabotage, often doing things that she knows will cause her turmoil or harm in the future. I've offered her help to the greatest extent of my ability, even offering to help her skip school school and go get a referral (From what I could tell it's actually easier than it sounds, just scary. Plus we live in a universal health care country so that shit is free and easy.), but that offer was virtually pointless because she won't even go to a teacher or school counselor. As many teenagers do, we often make suicide jokes, however her's are getting too real. She's essentially already admitted to me that she'll kill herself by the time she's 20 if things don't change, yet she does not do anything to promote change.

I know Emma incredibly well, and when I say that I think she's going to kill herself soon, I mean it. Her parents are still insufferable and refuse to see the chaos right in front of their eyes.

I know that it's a hell of a loaded question, but what can I possibly do? Even if she doesn't end it, I can't just stand there and watch her destroy her future. She needs help and she has acknowledged that, but her irrational attitude is making it so hard to make her find it. What should I do?

150,"I don’t want to preface, so I’m going to dive right in. 

A week ago, after a night of heavy drinking, I found myself walking around my town at 230 in the morning in freezing temperatures. I was confused, disoriented, scared, and cold. I waved down a couple of cars to no avail, but finally someone stopped to help me. I know it had to be scary picking someone up in my condition, but he did. He took me to the hospital and let me use his phone to call my mom to pick me up. 

This past week, I thought i lost my wallet with all of my ID cards, social security card, debit and credit cards, etc. But the guy who picked me up messaged me on Facebook to let me know that he had it. 

I’m supposed to meet him Monday to get my wallet, but I want to give him something as thanks. A thank you card for sure. But then I was thinking maybe a gift card somewhere and picking him some flowers or something? Nothing I could give him could possibly compare to what he did for me. I just want him to know how thankful i am for what he did for me. I could have been picked up by someone with mal intentions, so I’m so so SO lucky that he was there.

I have this manager, however, who suffers from chronic pain. I didn’t know when I first started working here but once I did know I was nice about and talked to them about it briefly. It’s progressively gotten to where the manager will text me when I am working saying they are in so much pain, it’s not getting better, they woke up crying, etc. I want to be supportive and I don’t mind lending an ear if they need to vent but it does make me somewhat uncomfortable.

152,"So picture this. It’s 12:30 at night and I wake up to the sound of voices. I got paranoid as hell, turned my light on and listened. Imagine my surprise realizing it was my sister crying to my parents in the room adjacent to mine.

After eavesdropping on the conversation, I found out that my sister is being tormented by a girl her age she’s friends with, and that her other friends aren’t doing anything to help her. This girl who’s bullying my sister is very odd. Her mother, although not diagnosed with anything, displays very odd sociopathic-esque tendencies. The whole families kind of fucked up. Very gossipy and manipulative.

I wasn’t able to understand everything being said, but essentially, my sister was being bullied by the girl, snapped, told her that although she respects her as a person, she could no longer be friends with her, as she was tired of being bullied. The girls older sister, a year older than me (I’m 15), sent multiple videos to my sister (only eleven), basically calling her a horrible disgusting human being, saying shit like “how can you live with yourself, you piece of shit” and other stupid bullshit. 

Honestly, I’m done dealing with this family. There has been many instances previous to this involving the girl bullying my sister, the mom slandering me and my father, and the older sister doing the same. Easily 10+ similar events.

I think I’m going to commit a crime in order to fuck with them. I know where they live, and I’ve been planning either keying their car, breaking their window, or egging their house. At this point, there’s nothing else I can do. 

What should I do? Should I try to involve the police? Get them charged with harassment ? I’m really at a loss at what to do. I’m fuming. All advice is appreciated.",07Apr2019,0

154,"I did pretty well in high school, GPA was only a little above average, but my SAT was one English question off perfect and that got me into a great engineering school.

I did that for 2 years but lost interest in my Electrical Engineering degree quickly, finding myself constantly bored in class and frustrated doing homework. My last semester at school, my grandfather I was very close to went into the hospital and I became completely socially isolated, driving 3 hours away every weekend to visit him in the hospital. With no social life or friends to speak of (I’ve never been great at making friends, or holding on to them) and the weight of my grandfather’s health, I spiraled hard, my sleep schedule got fucked, I missed classes, I constantly forgot homework, and I fell way behind. I failed a test for the first time ever, then another and another and another and so on. One of my professors (also my advisor) noticed and reached out to me, asked if everything was ok and if I was ok to finish the semester. I told her all was fine, just got a little distracted but I would recover. Just before finals, my grandfather passed away and I spiraled again, failing almost all of my finals.

I ended the semester failing 4 of my 5 classes (I passed public speaking, so yay me) and my 3.8 gpa plummeted far below average. I talked with my advisor and she said I could repeat all the courses if I wished, but I can’t stand the thought of going back to engineering school and I don’t want to work in engineering. I have taken some time off from school doing whatever I could find to make money, and have come to the realization that I want to go back and finish school, but I’m not entirely sure what major I want to pursue.

I have mostly thought about computer science, because I have always had an interest in computers and programming - though I fear my experience there could be similar to engineering school. My primary issue with engineering was the amount of actual homework - I enjoy classes, I actually don’t mind studying at all, I do well on tests - but assigned problems are pretty much my least favorite thing in the world. 

During the last semester when I was in and out of the hospital visiting my grandfather, I met a lot of awesome medical personnel from nurses to neurosurgeons and everything in between and discussed their work with them. I found myself truly engaged in what they were telling me about and took up an interest in medicine. 

Given my interest in the subject and (usually) good academic record, plus my ability to test very well, pre-med seems like the obvious choice for me from most of my family’s perspective. However, a few things give me pause: 

1) I did not like inorganic chemistry 101 at ALL (although my friend who got As in orgo 1 and 2 says she didn’t like inorganic and orgo was far more interesting). 

2) I have 4 Fs on my transcript now (physics 2 and 3 engineering courses) and I’m not sure what my options to transfer now would be or if I could realistically get into med school later

3) My primary issue with engineering school was the amount of homework in subjects that bored me - I have heard that pre-med and med school are much more studying than graded homework, which I am definitely much more in to, but I have not had any 1st hand sources confirm that. Pre-med may be just as bad for me.

So what do you think reddit? Do I have any chance of getting into med school or have I ruined it? And if I do, do you think I would enjoy pre-med/med school enough to get through it?",07Apr2019,2
155,I have a daughter who is turning 30. She had me going places with her to look for a place for her to have a big party for the 30 th birthday.

157,"Hi guys, F(23). I have a friend that is actually my maid of honor, I get married in August. She has been really great, super helpful and supportive of the wedding. But as far as our friendship itself... it has definitely deteriorated. I have known her for a little more than a year. The entire time, she has had many many, awful, heavy personal issues. I have tried my best to be there for everything, to support and help, and lend a shoulder to cry on and to never judge or anything. I have really taxed myself, if we're being honest. Toward the end of last year, I started to realize that many of her personal stories she would talk about were starting to not align with one another exactly... it was odd but I thought ""hey, maybe she feels uncomfortable sharing everything at once, and this is her growing trust"". well, the trend has continued and continued, until, I found out that not only were things not aligning but in January, she told me a huge thing that happened to her and in the midst of the story she basically admitted to purposely lying to me about her stories for the entire time I had known her. She basically had to tell me the truth in order to let me in on a new event that had occurred. We didn't really address the fact that I was now being told that she had been purposely lying and giving me a cover story the whole time, which caused her to have to start building lies upon lies in order to cover the cover story, and that might have been a mistake on my part. It was very very off-putting, both my fiance and I were very shaken to find out that a person we had come to know so well was hiding things from us on purpose, especially about things that weren't important to be hiding, nothing to do with our friendships, just things i guess she was embarrassed to share?

anyway, I have been able to work past that moment, but even still, she continues to lie. She hides things, isn't open, and I realized it has become incredibly taxing. most recently, i found out suddenly that she had been admitted to a crisis center/psych ward (i still don't understand which). As her supposed ""best friend"" she didn't let me know what happened, just that she was there. Today, I saw her, a day after getting out. I accidently mentioned that I had talked to my fiance about her being admitted and she imediately clammed up, and was very frustrated that I had told him. My fiance knows her very well and has always been a supportive person in her life as well, and I know this was a personal topic, but it just struck a weird chord with me that she was so upset about him knowing. she didn't seem to understand that it was weird that I didn't even know what was going on and didn't seem to understand that I had needed support. i have others in my life who have committed suicide, and knowing that she had almost done that and was now in a center/ward where she could be afraid or upset without any of her friends or family to talk to... it was very upsetting obviously and I was very weighed down and needed the support. I absolutely understand it is a personal topic, 100%. I know it might be embarrassing to have him know... but it went further than that. She saw it as me spreading it around about her, and made me promise and promise not to tell more people.. although, the issue is i was with a couple of friends when I found out and honestly my heart sunk so deep and I was in the midst of running a conference at my university, and so I had to tell a couple people that I had a friend in a crisis center and that I was very worried. I didn't tell them who, but now I feel horribly guilty. I'm afraid she will find out and read something into it. She has become understandably paranoid, but it causes me to have to walk on egg shells with her, all of the time. Its hard to be someones ""best friend"" who they ""tell everything to"" but to also not be trusted by them. 

anyway, I'm wondering if I should speak to her about the unecessary lying (she has a lot going on but I just really care and love her and there's no need to cover things constantly, i feel that I have proven time and again that I'm loyal to her and I won't turn my back on her... though I also realize why she is worried about me back-stabbing her, she's had it happen many times before and has a lot going on). I also would like to talk to her about her extreme worry about me spreading gossip about her. I have not nor would I do so. yes, my fiance knows some things, but he will also soon be my husband.... and I think its important to share with your significant other in that way, especially when given heavy news about a mutual friend. I'm pretty hurt by her reactions today, and just am not sure how to proceed. i just think this has gone on for too long, and for the longevity of our relationship, surely it needs to be addressed? I am regretting making her my maid of honor as it has been difficult to depend on her to help, again, I fully understand, but still makes things tricky (my original maid of honor is pregnant and her due date is the same date of my wedding), ",07Apr2019,1

162,"Alrighty, so, I'm a 19 year old guy who met a girl the same age as me and I'm convinced we began an incredible relationship over the past few months. The biggest issue in it was that she is living with her very controlling parents that dont like me. Many people in our area call  her parents crazy due to get generally strange behavior.  Besides that the relationship was strained because she doesn't have a job, car, or money (parents wouldn't let her) and would restrict her phone usage. She and I broke up but quickly got together. Her parents unfourtunately did not like that and took away her phone about a month ago. 

The last time I've even seen or even talked to her was two weeks ago at a church thing and since then I've just felt so lost and confused. I haven't really known if I should try to move on or not and since then I've started to develop feelings for a friend that I've known for quite some time. I have feelings for both of them and I would like to pursue a relationship with this friend but I'm scared that someday in the near future the original girl will somehow come into contact with me and I don't want to hurt her by moving onto someone else.

166,"Okay, don't call me evil just yet! Here is the background information...

This friend, let's call her Ashley, was like a sister to me. We were inseparable and spent a lot of time together. I trusted her completely and always had her back despite her many flaws. One of which was frequently cheating on her very sweet and caring husband, let's call him Joe. Joe adored Ashley and treated her incredibly well, but he was on the more reserved side and not much for PDA. Ashley has always needed the attention of everyone around her so Joe's brand of affection and love kept her satisfied for a very short amount of time. I think they were married about 6 months before she cheated on him the first time. 

I made my thoughts on her cheating well known, I didn't approve of it but she was a grown woman who was going to do what she wanted. Eventually, after she caught herpes from a random hookup she had met while on vacation in Florida she realized she couldn't continue to get away with it. She wrote Joe a letter telling him she was leaving him and left it on the kitchen table for him to find when he got home from work. She then packed her bags, quit her job, and moved hundreds of miles away to another state.  
We stayed in touch after she left and we visited each other when we could the first few months she was gone. I also stayed friends with Joe. We had been friends for 11 years and I never had a problem with him. He was a good guy and he didn't deserve the hell she put him through. He was seriously like a shell of a man after she left, especially when he found out she had moved in with another guy in her new state within 2 months of being there. The divorce papers hadn't even been filed yet. 

I saw Joe out at the bar and at parties of mutual friends often. We always greeted each other happily as friends and caught up like friends would. I apologized to him for never telling him about what Ashley had been doing and he told me he understood that she was my best friend and that I was in a tough situation. He said he didn't blame me for her actions. Meanwhile, my relationship with Ashley is getting more and more distant. She's not responding to texts as much. She's flakey, she's not reaching out or updating me or our mutual friends on her life. I thought maybe it was just her new relationship and the distance. 

 Eventually, the divorce proceedings started and, no surprise here, things got ugly. Ashley was going after Joe's pension and wanted spousal support. Joe wasn't going to let that happen and fought back. She had cheated. She had left. No way in hell was she getting his pension and spousal support. Because of this fighting, Joe had to provide evidence to her infidelity. During this, it was discovered that Ashley had slept with not one but TWO of my boyfriends. While I was dating them.  Suddenly her distance made sense. She knew eventually I would find out about her sleeping with men I was dating. She knew eventually her betrayal of my friendship would come out. It was heartbreaking for me. I trusted her and never thought she was capable of doing that to me. I now see how dumb that was of me. 

About two years has gone by since all of this. I barely speak to Ashley anymore. An occasional text here and there. But I still see Joe out pretty often. Probably every weekend when our group of friends gets together. Yesterday, we all met up at a bar to get drinks. When I got up to go home Joe offered to walk me to my car. I accepted and when I got to my car I noticed him hesitating. Eventually he came out and said this...

"" Can I ask...do you think there is ever the possibility of you and me being together? I've been thinking about this for almost a year and I think we could be really good together"". 

I responded, 

""I honestly never thought about it, you were always Ashley's boyfriend or husband. My mind never really went there. And the fallout would be...massive to say the least."" 

He responded, 
""Yeah well, I'm not her husband anymore and it's not like she thought about your feelings when she slept with your boyfriends. We could be perfect."" 

And that's when he kissed me. It was an amazing kiss and after a second or two in shock I kissed back. We kissed for a few minutes before he pulled away, pecked me once on the nose, and said ""Think about it, please."" Before turning to walk back into the bar. 

So, now we're back to the question at hand...do I give it a shot with Joe? Is there too much history? Should I abide by ""girl code"" even though Ashley didn't? Help!!!

168,"Apologies for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile so bear with me. 

I've just made the hardest decision I've ever made. I'm going to put my Baillie down in a month. She's my beautiful 13 year old lady who still loves treats and greeting me at the door. But I know she's tired, and most of all I know she hurts.

I'm giving her a month (setting the date for May 1st) so we can make it the best time she has left. I will carry her up and down the stairs as often as I can to give her joints a break. Every day, she'll get all the love she can handle. Every week, we're getting new take out and letting her try all of it. She and I are going to take one last trip in a couple weeks to let her grandparents and other close family say good bye. I want to make sure she experiences everything she can. 

But one of the biggest things for me is that she has never gotten to lick a real live cow. I know, this probably sounds weird, but her nick name is Miss Licks-A-Lot for a reason. Her tongue is too long to stay in her mouth, and she uses it constantly. I know she would LOVE to meet a cow, who would let her get up close so they could interact. I would absolutely be a mess, heck I'm a mess now. But I think Baillie would feel like a puppy one last time. 

My problem is I don't even know where to start. I live in Texas, DFW to be more specific, and I know there are plenty of ranches around. Who would allow some stranger onto their property with an unknown dog? How can I make this happen? Who should I reach out to?",07Apr2019,1
169,"This is my first post on Reddit and so I apologize if I get anything wrong. 

About a year ago me and my boyfriend where set to go on our senior trip. It was the most excited I'd been for anything in a long time. I have severe anxiety and am particularly anxious over letting myself be excited. My head floods with 'what if its not happy enough?' or 'what if it goes wrong?' and similar things that hinder my enjoyment of anything really. 

But this trip was planned out and payed for and had an itinerary and everything. My friends where going and my boyfriend was going and we'd only been together a year then and I was excited to just spend so much time with so many people I cared about. I kept fantasizing about loading things onto the bus, checking into the hotel, waking up with the sunrise on the bus, being seen in a bathing suit for the first time, going to a theme park ride together, playing on the beach. It all sent my heart pounding with anticipation. The beach, the theme parks, my friends, the fact that it was the last trip we'd take in high school, all of it. All of it was extremely emotional for me. 

But about a few months before the trip my boyfriend lets me know he won't be able to go because (having graduated a year early) he'd just gotten a job that required him to start well before he'd be allowed to take vacation time. 

And I know this was a good thing. I was happy for him and still am. It was a great opportunity. 

Still, it left me gutted. Its been nearly a year this upcoming summer and I can't let it go for whatever god damn reason. 

We've had lots of more time spent together since then and have stayed in other motels and have gone to other events. But whenever a bigger trip is brought up I turn into a blubbering mess because I feel almost numb at the prospect of similar big vacations. 

My head jumps to saying ""there won't be a chaperone"" or ""we'll be in the same room."" And this just confuses the hell out of my boyfriend because why would I want to be in separate rooms? 

Honestly, I don't want to be in separate rooms or to have a chaperone. I don't know. Whatever the case is I suppose I feel like I've lost some chance at some mystical opportunity that was only avaiable to me then. Even when he offers to replicate the trip by going to the beach with me it leaves me wanting to cry. 

Its harder to enjoy things nowadays and I usually will just want to stay in bed and cuddle if nothing has been planned out. This would be fine if not for the fact its out of melencoly and this heavy feeling of ""what's the point?"". 

Usually I can logically pull myself together and go because once I'm there its always better to have gone than to have stayed and slept it away. Its getting harder to do so.

After probably to much rambling I suppose I'm asking two things, 

How do you get excited about things?

170,"I’m in my mid 20s and ever since I left my hometown I’ve had trouble making new friends, I’m not completely lonely as I am married but that’s beside the point. Usually when I meet new people I have to tone myself down because I’m usually the one who stands out in a crowd because of my attitude, I’m the one who clearly doesn’t give a fuck about the opinions of others. Because of that, I usually have to tone myself down and act interested in things that simply do not interest me. I also live in the Deep South, so I get looked at crazy since I’m not your typical “southern boy.”  I’ve tried to make new friends but we hang out a few times and it’s like they’re like yeah that dude is insane probably won’t hit him up again. Thing is, I’m just different from what people are used to down here. I’m loud, love colorful language, and love to have a good time, so that throws people off. My hometown is just a few hours away but most of my old friends I don’t really have anything in common with anymore or when I’m there ask if they want to get together and they never want to really do anything. I don’t even necessarily want to go out or to the bar just hang out and have a few brews. I’m realizing friendships are starting to fade and I know as people get older they get busy with their own lives and have responsibilities. I look at life as I only get one shot at this and I want to make the best of it, my wife and I both refuse to waste away the best years of our lives. As I said, it’s not necessarily about going out or to the bar, just have fun. Anyways, since I usually have to tone myself down I don’t really know how to make friends anymore.

Everyone knows he is a good guy its just we don't have evidence for proving his innocence while his ex is using her parents to create a story about how during their relationship he was abusing her mentally but her ex's ex say that she is lying for attention and shes the one who's actually abusive and manipulative.

174,"Cartoons always used to light up a spark in me as a little kid, it's hard to explain, but I'll try my best. If a show could hold my attention, it'd give me kinda like a special, magical vibe or feeling of joy deep down within me where I felt like I was watching something truly special, and I'd hold an affection of sorts for it that will never really go away. As a result lot of the shows from when I was little are beloved classics (in my eyes). I was born in 2002, and remember watching cartoons since I turned 3 in 2005.  
   
 I do not hate or even dislike today's cartoons (unless it's a botched remake of something from when I was little), in fact many of them are favorites among my childhood classics. But they don't light that same spark or give anything close to that same feeling anymore.  
   
 In 2014, when I turned 12 and was going into 7th grade (also my first year of middle school), the cartoons that were coming out still had somewhat of a spark in them, but they didn't quite completely give me that same exact feeling. In 2015, when I turned 13 and was going into 8th grade, the spark just completely disappeared.  
 

The irony is I really like a lot of cartoons that came out after 2014 or 2015. Stuff like DuckTales, Star Vs., We Bare Bears, Loud House, Tangled, Justice League Action, Marvel's Spider-Man, Elena of Avalor (early on at least), Big City Greens, OK K.O.! the new Ninja Turtles are all awesome shows. But they just don't have that same magical, special vibe that the cartoons from when I was a little kid did.  
   
 The only time that spark does come back with new stuff is when it's a show that's still on from when I was a little kid, but those are a dying breed now, the only ones that are still currently running are Gumball, Teen Titans Go!, SpongeBob, and that's it (I'm not counting adult cartoons). Otherwise I only get it from rewatching the old stuff, none of the new stuff can do it for me, no matter how awesome they are.  
   
 Why did that magical, special feeling cartoons used to give me go away? Is it ever gonna come back to me with future cartoons? I heard smoking pakalolo can substantially make cartoons even more enjoyable. Maybe I'll try that to see if it'll bring the spark back.",07Apr2019,0
175,"I know that I used to be a compassionate, empathetic person, perhaps to excess.  I spent a lot of time trying to understand other people, and tried my best to find ways to help everyone around me.

However, I've noticed over the last year or two that I've been becoming more self-absorbed.  I feel like all I do now is think and talk about myself. More and more, I find myself less interested in how other people are feeling, even people I love or admire.  Recently, a friend of mine passed away suddenly, and at his funeral I saw my other friends crying.  And I comforted them, not because I was feeling their pain, because I felt like it was what I was supposed to do.

More generally, I feel like I'm less curious about how other people are feeling or how they think. It's gotten to the point where I am avoiding other people because I feel bored almost immediately once they start talking.   I don't know why this is happening, and it's really disturbing me.

176," 

Hi,  I am 29 yrs male. And for a couple of months this thought coming to my  mind that I am abt to touch 30 and then I will grow old and eventually  die. Its like I don't have any motivation and nor the energy to do  something. I am constantly thinking my life is over as I am ageing and  it happens right when I wake up everyday.

Some background: I have a toxic family. My mother is a toxic person.  My entire upbringing was done by my grandfather who is no more. So from  childhood up until 23, I was with my grandfather and grandmother coz my  mother and father were toxic and blamed me for their failures of not  working in life and earning money despite my grandparents telling my  mother to work and earn money. She married her love (my father) despite  knowing the guy earned nothing and didnt listened to my grandparents so  my grandfather took care of me from my childhood and I LOVE him soooo  much and he is still my whole world &lt;3.

Also I lent my mother $8100 around 4+ years ago and she didnt return  me and I have been asking for over 3+ years as she promised to give back  within 7 months but she is making excuses and its been 3+ years. Mind  that she is very qualified and roams here and there everyday but due to  laziness she don't work. My grandmother gives her money. So, whenever I  call her for the money, she will cry and shout and try to play the  victim role and ultimately costing my time on the phone for over 1- 2  hrs every freaking day and in the end I get hyper and I feel so tired  every day by talking to her on the phone that I feel sleepy right after  hanging up the phone. She is doing this for so many years. I am so tired  of this bit#h. Everyday she will play the victim that for me she is not  able to earn money and I am like go to hell...She always blames me...

She and nor her husband has given me anything since I was born, not  even food money, clothes money nothing. Everything was done by my  grandfather. Both of my parents are highly educated but mother didnt  work due to laziness and father didnt get a job worth his degree  (mechanical engineer) and it is my fault as per my mother. Weird huh!

My Work: I work as a freelancer like VAs etc and I am in between some  financial issue which is gonna get solved within the next couple of  months. I have been having financial issue since a couple of years but  this financial thing is going to get solved within some months.

My daily work and food routine:Wake up 7:30 amHave some biscuits  (cannot afford proper breakfast due to monetary issue),Then lunch at  around 1:30 pm - 2:00 pm,Tea around 6 pm,Dinner around 9 pm

I spend the entire day in front of a laptop from my room. I dont go  to gym nor go outside with any friends or whatsoever. I do freelancing  work hence I have to be infront of the laptop for over 14-15 hrs a day  and only go out to buy lunch, dinner and tea.

I basically fight with myself to reach the lunch time from morning  and reach the dinner time from evening. Yesterday and a couple of days  ago I was beating myself up like throwing strong fist on my chest and  wondering how my life turned like this?...Because I see other peoples of  my age smiling, enjoying and going out with friends. I didnt even smile  properly these couple of years. My chest pained so much after those  fists.

I just need to get this stupid thing that ""I am getting old and so my  life is almost over"" and I need some ENERGY and motivation and not be  in a negative depressed state everyday after I wake up.

What should I do? Please no therapy doctors s#it. I dont like doctors.

180,"I recently moved back to a small town that I haven't lived at in almost 10 years. There's a post office about a mile down the street from my house that I've been going to and I saw this woman there who I thought was cute. But my thing is that I've never been comfortable talking to women like that who are at work because I think that's not cool to do so I never said anything to her except the general greetings and everything.

Last week, I went in for a money order and to mail it off for a family member of mine. There's only myself, another customer, and this woman and her coworker. I'll call this woman Jane Jones and myself John Smith, obviously not our real names.

So I get Jane as my cashier and we begin the transaction of getting the money order. She stops and says, ""Hey, did you by chance go to [small private school nearby]?"" I'm a bit shocked by reply, ""Yeah, I did. My mom was Mrs. Smith."" She replies, ""Ah, I thought I recognized you. So that must mean you're John, right?"" I had a little brother who also went there but she never mentioned him. I reply, ""Yeah, that is me."" She asks about my mom and if she's still a teacher and all this and I come to find out that she graduated high school the same year I did so that means we're the same age, but I cannot remember her for the life of me.

I write out the money order then get back in line to mail it and have her again and we talk a little more. I ask her if she had so and so for a teacher and she corrects me on the name. I said a popular singer's last name and it sounded close but that wasn't it and when she said the right name it really began coming back to me.

About 20 years ago, I had attended this school for 5th, 6th, and part of 7th grade before leaving. At this school, they had multiple teachers teaching the same grade, so like 3 teachers teaching 5th grade, 3 teachers teaching 6th grade, and so on. 7th grade was the start of our junior high school year so we all had periods like it is in high school.

I went back home and found my yearbook with her in it. I came to realize that she and I never shared a class together. I vaguely remember her but I definitely did not hang out with her as a friend at all nor do I remember even talking to her except maybe a hi or goodbye at one point or another. I wasn't popular nor did I do anything that made me infamous. I only got in trouble once and was suspended for it in 7th grade, but it wasn't a big thing in the school as far as I know. So it's kind of strange she remembers my name to me.

My mom thinks she has/had a crush on me, and I kind of wonder if that might be true.

I found her on Facebook but it doesn't look like she's active on there anymore.

I kind of want to talk to her and get to know her, maybe even see if there is something between us, but I'm kind of fearful and don't want to mess things up by making her feel uncomfortable and possibly causing myself to feel like I shouldn't come to this post office anymore.

So I've come here to ask for advice on this and if I should proceed in any way. In your opinion, should I try to get to know her some way? Should I try to ask for her number or ask her out for coffee to catch up? Should I just leave it alone and forget it, just be friendly with her when I see her at the post office and leave it at that?

Do you think that she might have had a crush on me based on what I wrote above?",07Apr2019,1
181,"In one of my classes, I met this person through a common friend. We got closer and I started to develop a crush on them. I thought I saw signs that they liked me back, such as them staring at me a lot during class. Another example is how they asked to join some friends and I for lunch, which ended up lasting an hour and a half. This happened again, but it was just the two of us.

When it comes to relationships, I tend to categorize people into 3 groups, those I like, those I don’t like and wouldn’t date, and those I don’t like but would date. This person fell into the third group but I noticed on Tuesday I began to view them more romantically. 

I recently sent them a text telling them that “I thought I might like them”, because honestly I’m not completely sure, but I think I feel something, yet no response. It really irks me because I just want an answer. If they don’t like me back, I’d prefer to be given at least the dignity of an answer. I mean, one of the reasons I chose to confess now is because if I get rejected I’m in a good place mentally and will be able to handle it.

My friend is 2 years behind and re-doing her A-levels and has no idea what to do in life. She doesn't want to go to university because she insists it's a snobbish environment. She doesn't like any of her subjects. She hates English, she hates Psychology, she hates Philosophy, she abandoned the science subjects and her dream of becoming a doctor when it was clear she would never make it. And even if we stumble upon a topic in casual conversation that's just slightly related to those subjects she says she doesn't want anything to remind her of what she's studying.

&amp;#x200B;

The goals that she does have are unrealistic. She's in this drama group, where if they win this competition they each win a scholarship to a university in England for a drama course. Even if they win this scholarship, there's practically no future for someone with a drama degree in our country. As far as I can tell she's not that passionate about drama either, she only took part in a few plays when she was young and had casual fantasies of becoming a play or movie director. She also has dreams of travelling around the world, including America for at least a month. Oh and she wants to permanently move to Ireland some day. This is all despite the fact that without any degrees whatsoever she's going to keep earning a minimum wage, plus with her own family situation draining her of her finances too.

184,"Hi - I hope this topic isn't too expertise-specific. There aren't a lot of well-populated places to ask about this on Reddit, and I don't feel my story and questions are precise enough for r/legaladvice at this time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a small, non-metropolitan city. My high school aged sister recently disclosed she was attacked by a very well-known, respected, popular athlete in town - she went to his house to hang out for the first time, was raped, and ran away from his residence to be picked up by a friend. My sister told about the event, but her friend was the one who disclosed his identity. This happened a few months ago; we would have had no idea and she was dealing with some other big stuff that winter, so there were no particular signs anything had happened of this nature. My parents are devastated, but they're both dysfunctional and traumatized addicts who usually get upset about something and then find a million reasons to never do anything about it. I tell them we should call a hotline to find options, they say it's an invasion of our privacy and that they're useless. I tell them we should find counselors to consult, they say we have no insurance and transportation (it's true that therapy care isn't really accessible in my family's neighborhood; the only place that is around here, my family got kicked out of because they missed too many appointments long ago). And as you may have guessed, we certainly cannot afford any legal consultation. We're all concerned that reporting it would 1.) lead to nobody believing her (partially due to how long ago it was), and 2.) lead to huge backlash and physical danger for her. She unfortunately has a very poor reputation at school - she is slut-shamed constantly for rumored hookups, she has been jumped by ex-girlfriends of boys that were drawn to her, the whole nine yards. She also has an abortion on her record. The boy who attacked her likely figured he could get away with it because of her social status. She has to see him in school every fucking day.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying not to center myself, but I am also feeling deeply guilty following this news. I'm approaching my mid-20s and have been away at school for many years. I come from a drug and alcohol-addicted family, and my parents have historically incapacitated themselves (financially, physically, and otherwise) from solving any issues because of their own trauma (they were both sexual violence survivors as children and the children of addicts). I always tried to be the ""hero"" of the family by getting good grades in school, degrees, and awards, thinking as a kid that I'd be rich by now to whisk everyone out of this hellhole, cast a bunch of people to beautiful rehab programs and loving therapists, and give everyone everything they ever wanted. My whole life's purpose has been to protect my family and help us keep our heads up, but it's coming to a head in feeling I've failed. Now more than ever, I'm realizing that I can't save anyone (especially my siblings) from bad things happening, and in all my years of feeling like some savior-in-training, I haven't once encouraged anyone to change their unhealthy behaviors and get some help and get out of this place. I don't even know what I'm on Earth for anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that nothing could have stopped my sister's assault itself, because it's her attacker's fault alone. I would never blame anyone but that kid. But, the fucking circumstances we're in as a family--I feel like that could have been different. We could have been in a place where she felt safe disclosing, we could have instantly lined her up with our choice of brilliant therapists, and we had the resources to get her the fuck out of the school system with these kids who jump her on the street and violate her and wish death upon her. The damage is just gonna pile up now; justice AND healing is obstructed.

&amp;#x200B;

My advice questions: 

1. Because setting up therapy isn't an immediate option, what sorts of things can I do for my sister? I don't even live with my family regularly at the moment.
2. Is there anything I can do to hold her attacker (a minor) accountable, given our limited options? Police reporting would likely accomplish absolutely nothing. Obviously, I cannot do anything to endanger this young person. Is there a way to confront or expose him that would be legal and not result in me getting arrested/pummeled? 
3. Relatedly, how can I suppress my own reckless anger and temptation to lash out? I feel like I've never stood up for anyone or anything in my life, and am tempted to put my body on the line. 
4. How can I reconfigure and reimagine my role within my increasingly ill, underresourced family? I was considering moving back but I don't know lately.",07Apr2019,1

I over think my every move and my brain attacks me because in some fucking way whatever I did was feminine, I never dress girly now because it looks gross, and I wear my hair down because I get remarks that I look like a dude and it makes me happy when people say that (I even got mistaken for a guy by a doctor last month, my mom didn't like it much). A few months ago my mom told me that I would have to wear a dress to a dance and I broke down completely against my will: the very thought of wearing a dress made me recoil in disgust. I cried and my mom took me into her room to talk about it..  There was a lot of yelling and crying, she told me that ""I was her little girl and that was that"" and she asked me if I wanted to be a boy and i said no.. But it was the most unsure thing I've ever said...

Its been a few months and today I was trying on bras (we have pictures tomorrow and I have to wear a dress... Wish me luck) and I almost cried in the middle of penny's before I even got to the underwear department. I started trying them on in the dressing room and, in short, it ended in tears and my mom forcing her way in to talk to me. She said that she has no clue what's wrong with me and frankly neither do I... 

I need to somehow ask to see some sort of out-of-school help... Preferably an unbiased one that will help me out with what the hell is going on... Thank you in advance.",07Apr2019,1
188,"When I was a kid, I was given access to the internet at a very young age. I was given my very own computer IN MY BEDROOM at age 8. I had absolutely zero supervision, I had a password for my profile so that no one else could see what I was doing.

My favorite thing to do was to go to online chat rooms. At the time, I assumed everyone would be around the same age as me. I always told my real age. I really enjoyed talking to older people too, I thought it made me cool. 

I don’t really remember specifics from this age. I know that some people wanted to meet up, but luckily I wasn’t dumb enough to tell them my exact location and actually meet anybody.

However, as I got older (think 10-12) I started to more actively pursue talking to older men in these online chat rooms. At some point, I figured out what sex and role playing is. I met one man and ended up having a “relationship” for YEARS. We would have private chats almost every night. In those chats, we would very graphically roll play. We would set the scene, sometimes i would be his daughters friend over for a sleep over and I woke up in the middle of the night to get some water and would “find” him in the living room. You get the idea. I still remember his yahoo screen name.

I guess I’ve never considered myself a “survivor” of sexual abuse since nothing ever /physically/ happened to me. Is it possible it still counts? I was subjected to VERY graphic sexual details at a very young age. This man KNEW exactly how old I was. 

I feel like this opened me up to more real abuse I experienced later. I don’t remember exactly why/when I stopped role playing with this man. I moved on and ended up having several of these “boyfriends” I would role play with over different chatting platforms.

Eventually I met a guy named Scott. He was “17/18” years old when I was about 13. He and I had a relationship that lasted YEARS. This is definitely the “worst” of all of these relationships. We would role play constantly, almost nonstop. He taught me what BDSM is. He had me go out and buy a dog collar that he made me wear EVERY. DAY. He would force me to send him nudes. I would video chat him (I never saw him, he only saw me) of close up shots of me masturbating. He would make me shove objects inside myself, like a remote control. He made me write words like “slut” “whore” etc on myself with sharpie. There were SO many things he made me do that I was not comfortable with.

I can definitely recognize now that that was an abusive relationship at the very least. There’s just always been a disconnect in my mind on whether any of this is “real” abuse. None of this happened in real life. I’m ashamed at myself for allowing all of this to happen to myself. I’m ashamed for contributing to child pornography. At the same time, though, it doesn’t feel real and I don’t know if it truly counts. 

I’ve never opened up about this in real life and have never told anyone the full extent of what’s happened to me. I’m not sure if anyone can really understand. I’m not sure what my next steps should be, if any. Is there a way to move past this? My mind keeps coming back to this question. ",07Apr2019,1

198,"I’m in grade 12, and prom is fast approaching. I told one of my best friends I’d go with him as his date. I love him and we have lots of mutual friends, we had a table set, all was good. At my schools prom all tables fit 10 people, no more no less.
I have been “friends” the the people at our table for over 10 years. We hang out every month or so. The group expands to about 20 people but my date and I are only close with the 10. For prom we got 2 tables right next to each other. 
A couple days ago the group of 10 kicked my date and I from our original table, because they wanted to sit with other people. My date and I were really hurt by this. We felt like secondary friends, easily replaceable, and unwanted. We are now sitting with the other 8 kids in our group of 20, but if I’m honest with myself, it’s the group of “leftovers” that didn’t fit into the main table.
I have other friends that I sit at lunch with everyday. I was originally going to sit with them for prom before my date asked me to go with him. They have space for me (and my date if he wants) at their table.  I know he doesn’t feel close with them and would rather sit at the table we are currently at. I don’t want to ditch him but I also don’t want to ruin my night by sitting with people who I’m not close with/ don’t really want me there. I would feel resentful all night if I sat there. I would still dance, take pictures, and all the other prom activities with my date we would just eat at different tables. Would I be an asshole if I proposed this idea to him?

200,"I'm a 20y old f, first year of uni, and I have the biggest crush on my professor for a while now.


So, he first caught my eye in december on some uni event and at the time he wasn't teaching since his subject starts in the spring semester. First day of uni in march, there he is. I get the butterflies in my stomach and all..
Attendance is not obligatory at my uni, but every friday morning I went to his classes. Only his. Since a lot of student are preparing exams, there are only 10-20 of us at his classes. I figured, he will at least remember me. One time at the end of the lecture, I went up to him to ask a few questions about the subject, and he was so sweet and smiling, and that's when it hit me pretty hard.
So, 2 weeks later, at his lecture there are only 4 of us. At the end, a guy asks if he could give us some extra points for attending; he's like 'sure why not'. He signs them, and I'm left with him signing mine. He signs, I say thank you; he says 'Just so you know, next week is my last lecture this semester. Prof x is continuing instead of me.' I stand there all confused, and ask him if I could go to his 'practice' (we have classes in which we practice what we learned and earn points, everyone has to go to at least two, and you apply in feb/beggining of march);
he smiles and says 'sure';
i'm like-at what time are they?
-tuesday and friday evening
-when is less crowded?
-(smiles) friday evening
-ok, i will see you then, thank you. 

He's like you're welcome, i say bye, he says bye.
I go to the door, and he calls me. 'How many exams did you pass?' and sits down, looking at me all smiley. I start talking, and we end up talking for 15 minutes(at my uni that happens almost never with professors); at one point he asks me do I go to classes, and I say 'no, I don't like them' He says all flirty 'Well, what do you think about my lectures?' 'I only go to your ones.' He looks surprised but pleased, smiles and says 'Well thats an honour, I'm glad to hear that.' We joke, talk and I tell him about an exam I have in april; I got a bad professor and I wanted to change it(you pay and file a papir; sometimes uni accepts, sometimes not(if there's no room for more studenst etc)), there are very low chances that they will accept me and I told him that. He says that he could help with that. I stand there, shook, and he says 'Send me an e-mail and we will arrange to go and fix that'. I say how there is no need for that, blah blah, but he's like it's okay I'll help you...so we talk for a bit more, and split.
So, I managed to change the prof by myself and friday comes, I go to uni. The lecture ends, and we bump into eachother while leaving the classroom. I asked him at what time tonight the practice is, he tells me and asks me if I managed to change the prof. I tell him about it and 'Anyway thank you for you offer.' He smiles and I walk away.
That evening, I came to the practice all dressed up cute and all. He comes and tells us 'I know we were supposed to practice lesson xy, but my coleague is having a lecture right now and I would like to ask you all to come there with me.' We all go, I sit alone, all angry and bored, because I was really looking forward to going to his practice. It ends, he tells us to go to his classroom. He talks a few minutes about that lecture, apologises and says see you all next time, good luck with the exams. People rush out of the classroom, I pack my things and see him waiting for me to leave so that he could leave behind me. I rush and say Goodbye, not even looking at him.He says
'Did you like the lecture?'
I freeze.
'Yeah, it was interesting'
'Hm... I think you're lying a little.'
'Excuse me, what did you say?'(i did not hear him properly)
'I think you're lying a little bit.'
'Hah, no, no I'm not.. I like history so I liked the lecture.'
He said something(can't remember) and then asked me about my exam.
'Hows the studying going?'
'Oh, it's quite alright. I just need to read it a few more times.'
'Do you want me to *tell* the professor something?'
I froze. I couldn't say anything.
'When is the exam?' he asks
'8th april'
'Hm. 8th.. do you want me to tell him?'
'No, no, there is no need for that..'
'Are you sure?'
I nodded. 
'Ok, if you change your mind, find me at uni on monday, I have an exam in the morning.'
'Oh, ok, thank you.'
He smiles, I say bye, thank you again and leave.
I was really shocked and would never accept that, I did not know what to say. I was surprised that he proposed that because at my uni everyone knows everything about everyone. Never heard a bad word about him, especially something like that. Just by looking and listening to him, you can se that he is not the type to flirt with students and fix their exams up. He is always late, all bummed out and not really trying in classes. Can't quite explain in english, but we have an expression like 'too lazy to live'. 
He is also veeery nice and I am crazy about him.
So, need advice about what to do. I mean, I want to be with him, at least for a while. I need opinions on if he likes me or is just being kind and flirty for, well, no reason at all..Also, what should I do? How do I aproach him?
*he can't affect my grade so dating him wouldn't be a problem. Also, my uni is ok with that kind of relationships, although I would keep it a secret. Age is not a problem.

209,"Hi all,

I’ll try to make this as short as possible. My dad was retrenched quite a few months ago and I think he kind of fell into a bit of a mental slump which he didn’t feel comfortable sharing with us (his family) about (I think because of the pressure of being the sole provider). So soon after he was retrenched he went to see a “Feng Shui master” except he’s not rly a fengshui master but some kind of religious preacher?? I’m not entirely sure what he does but I can’t say who/what establishment. And this Feng Shui guy told him to become a disciple for learning some religious teachings, like meditation and everything which I’m okay with (because it sounds like standard religious practices).

Anyway, my dad says the meditation helped him relax during his tough time so that’s great, but the past \~3 months he’s been hiding in an empty room in our house doing god knows what (supposedly meditating but we don’t know), and he’s become kind of withdrawn (not emotionally, just physically withdrawn from my family, like he’s always not around). Recently he’s been spending almost every other day (if not every day) visiting this Feng Shui master and his other few disciples.

I found out that they’ve been telling him all sorts of very dubious things. For e.g. one of the fellow disciples can channel gods (he claims literally ANY god from any religion) by acting as a medium and once channeled Jesus Christ in front of my dad before. Idk why this doesn’t ring alarm bells for him because it may be common for deities in other religions to communicate through mediums, but really?? Jesus Christ?? Doesn’t that go against all standard Christian beliefs?? And they’ve also been telling him basically all the things he wants to hear - e.g. he was a very noble person in his past life so now he’s the reincarnation of some high-level person in the Chinese heaven hierarchy, and he’s been blessed by one of the deities with a special gift. They also tell him very ludicrous things about the afterlife that don’t align with orthodox teachings, like how one of the other disciples was a very pious Christian in her previous life and so ascended to the highest level of Heaven where she acted as a “public relations” liaison between all the different gods in the afterlife, before being reincarnated into this life. (?? Is reincarnation in Christianity even a thing??)

I’m worried that it’s all part of a scam, because my dad told me that basically he’s not just practicing a new religion, but training his special skills to start a business venture set up around this Feng Shui master’s brand. Essentially, this Feng Shui guy has told them that Guan Yin Pusa told him to spread his word globally so he wants to expand his brand overseas, and recruited a bunch of disciples to help him and who will become part of this business venture (my dad included). He also keeps telling my dad that he’s been earning too much money for what he’s pre-destined so it’s bad luck (I’m worried this is him prefacing asking my dad for money in the future). Since my dad is still unemployed, he’s been looking for jobs but I can see he’s not really trying anymore (e.g. he spends most of his time now practicing some “mind reading” skill by asking me to think of a number and guessing it - apparently the information is supposed to come to him because of a special connection with some deity). Every time a job opportunity comes up, he’ll ask the Feng Shui master for advice on whether it’s a good idea, and the answer is ALWAYS no.

My mum and I are both worried because we think he’s being absorbed into a scam. In fact I’m very very certain he’s being manipulated by this Feng Shui guy. His practices seem so unorthodox, and we’ve met him before and he never gave me a good impression (my mum didn’t like him either). For background, my parents are big believers in fengshui and my dad used to be quite a staunch Buddhist, but now claims he never believed in Buddhism and echoes the fengshui master’s views. He’s quite a gullible, impressionable person so I feel very protective and I’m quite at a loss. He told the Feng Shui master that the business venture cannot take off until a few years from now when I start working, so I worry that the Feng Shui guy is just putting him off work so they can get the business going faster.

Please help 😭 i can’t talk to my dad about this because you know typical Asian fathers don’t like being questioned and he’ll just get defensive and shut down if I bring anything up, so my best bet is to just keep a neutral expression on in front of him so at least I can be informed about what’s happening in his life and what they’re filling his head with!! I’m not really worried about finances because I will start work soon and can help to support my family, but I DETEST seeing my dad being taken advantage of.

Thanks for reading.",07Apr2019,1
210,"I am a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer. I have been working with a small local restaurant by my house by recreating their entire menu line up and created new Instagram and Twitter pages for them to increase exposure, now I’ve never really done any social media work for anyone other than myself so I was learning down the way, but I ended up getting them viral, contacted celebrities and large Internet personalities to come try the food and shout them out. I was doing very well for my first time and I have a special Internet personality with more than a couple million followers (20M+) and (15M+) subscribers coming in to do a video food challenge and it would have been a HUGE opportunity for the Resturant to gain a lot of business from it. All that for two weeks. Since I didn’t charge them for handling their social media (since I wasn’t very experienced in the beginning), I told them that if they want me to continue that work for them, they could hire me as their social media specialist or public relations specialist since it has been really beneficial to the business to the point where 3 days in a row they sold out and had to stop taking customers. But the owners ended up refused my offer and started insulting my work and wanted me to keep doing it for free, said that they never needed social media to be as successful as they are being now, including that I offered to do this for them and they didn’t ask me to handle their social media, and that I wasn’t really beneficial nor needed for the company, I was just convenience. After a long argument about that and even the owner verbally attacking me about how they don’t see the worth of being socially active and I felt as if I did get somewhat carried away. Anyway, I told them I was out and I will not longer manage their social media. So, when that Internet personality heard about my struggle, she secretly canceled her appointment that day and she isn’t going to appear at the restaurant as agreed and said she only joined in because of how I treated every customer as people and guests unlike the owners. Now since I haven’t actually given the page to the owners and I am the owner and admin of the accounts, would it be bad if I shut those pages I set up and managed? There were never any paperwork signed for them owning any photography I had done nor for them to own the social media pages. With how they treated me and devalued me in front of their customers, should I shut their pages down? They’ve already paid me for graphic design so all that is there but none of that graphic design is used in the pages. Is it ethical and professional?

It could be about life, about stupid things we find on the internet, all that good stuff! For 2 years, that server was all I did in my spare time; I was always talking to her on it while I did other stuff, like homework or playing games. It was like our escape from the world, and we did everything on there together.  


A few days ago, however, our server had to be taken down.  


I was asleep in class during a lazy day, and when I woke up, I headed to my next class. Before I got there, though, I realized I left my phone and went back for it. I got it, and there was 25+ messages of my girlfriend panicking because her brother found our Discord and everything we've put on it. She was urging me to get rid of the server all together (there was...explicit imagery, in addition to the whole secret relationship thing), so I did. And now, that beautiful server where so many memories were made...gone.   


Her brother doesn't like her for whatever reason, and now he's showing all his friends and family what we've been doing on this server. At first, she seemed to just let it pass, and things were sort of back to normal on a new server, but every now and again I get texts about what's he doing with the information he has. At first, we thought he just took photographs, but now, apparently he took videos of the server and is now screenshotting every single frame with incriminating items on it. I tried to console my love about this, but I feel like nothing works, and I'm worried about her safety...in addition to all the other secrets, she's trans and hasn't told anyone else about her plans to get surgery. She's talked about how she heard her father is disappointed in her, and that's before we knew about the videos...  


For the past few days, this has been looming over my head, like a giant axe, and I can't stand the worry anymore, but I can't do anything to help her outside of support her...is there anything else I can do? How could I console her properly, or should I even try? ",07Apr2019,1
215,"Soo this is going to sound dumb. We are both 18 and trying to go about this smart. We are both in the process of graduating.  I’m ahead and will be getting another job soon to save money. We’ve decided that we are going 50/50 on everything.

The reason we want to leave is because we are under the rule of very strict parents and we both have always dreamed of traveling. We want to live our own lives but we cannot with the way our parents are. They don’t want us to be together and tell us everyday why we shouldn’t be. We’ve been in an on and off relationship since we were 15 due to his parents moving him around and my parents not liking him and us growing as people. We always seem to find our way back and the spark has always been there. I’ve been with other guys and none have been like him. 

We are planning to both get jobs as soon as possible. When we do our first priority will be to buy the necessities. So that means backpacks filled with stuff to clean water, matches, other fire starters, protein snacks, literally the essentials. Then we plan to save $4,000 each collectively we will have $8,000. We plan to spend about $3,000 on a car. Then pay insurance several months in advance. So right there we are at about $4,000. That will be used for gas and food. We plan to not have a phone service. We will use WiFi. 

First we plan to go see his grandpa who will be passing soon. Then we plan to go see a mutual friend who lives a couple states away. Then we will find where we will be living until we move again.

I guess what I need is advice. Are we going about this well? I know this is probably a terrible decision but it’s one I need to make. I need to get out of my house. I love my family and don’t want to hurt them but I need out. 

Please don’t hate on me too much as my mind is made up. Just offer some advice?

217,"Hi guys,
when I were in the 7th grade a girl came into my class which who I immeditaly fell in love with, but she didn't. I never really had something in common with her or meet her outside the class room, but I had feelings for her all the time. I were and am a very shy person and never told her that I love her. 

Now nearly 6 years later I still do sometimes dream of her, even tho I didn't meet her the last two years. I don't even know what she's doing rn or where she lives.

I just wanna get over her, I know that I'll probably never ""get"" her or even meet her again. I know there are plenty of other fish in the ocean, but I think she was the one.

225,"I (23M) have a guy best friend the same age as me. We’ve known each other for nearly 10 years but two years ago he moved to the US (I live in France) and only comes from time to time to France to see everyone. So naturally we drifted a bit apart but we still talk very regularly.

4 months ago he came back for a week and had a crush on a girl (22F) I introduced him to, a girl I had known for very little time myself. Let’s call her Emma. I said “cool!” and even shipped them to be honest. She seems to enjoy his company and they kept talking over messenger/social media. I have no idea if she’s interested or just sees him as a friend (and I think he doesn’t know either) because she’s a very easy person to talk to and she’s the kind of person that loves everybody. She naturally seems interested in everyone.

Well after this week in France, my friend went back to the US and two things happened (in this order):

1. He told me he was dating this other girl in the US;
2. I became friends with Emma and slowly started to develop feelings for her.

I wouldn’t have thought #2 would ever happen as I wasn’t interested at all in the first place. But getting closer to her and knowing that my friend was dating another girl in the US... I thought he had moved on (they don’t even live in the same country after all). It just happened.

One night, I called my friend. I asked him if it was working with this new girl he’s been dating and asked him about Emma, if he was still interested in her or not, because I was starting to get feelings and thought it was the best thing to do. He told me that he just saw Emma as a friend and that his place was in the US. I was happy for both of us, and now it wouldn’t feel weird asking out this girl he’s had a crush on.

Now here’s the problem: fast forward and he broke up with the American girl and told me he was planning on asking Emma out when he comes back to France in a few weeks (and this time he’ll stay for a month).

I’m absolutely lost because, thinking my friend had moved on, I allowed myself to develop feelings for this girl, and now I just cannot imagine him dating her. Honestly I would die inside and I feel like I would loose two friends if he did that (him and Emma).

I told him about that, told him I have thought about this a lot and that the best thing to maintain our friendship would be to put Emma in no-mans-territory, but it seems he just doesn’t care. He tells me he’s going to do his thing anyway and totally disregard my feelings, telling me I’m being childish.

I don’t think I’m being childish. If you just stop and think for 5 minutes about what the outcome could be for our friendship, I’m clearly not being childish, I’m just trying to put everyone’s feelings into the equation.

What do you think I should do? Am I am asshole for developing feelings on my friend’s crush when he was dating ANOTHER girl AND considering the fact that he lives on another continent anyway? What should I do?

Thank you!",07Apr2019,2
226,"Hey, Reddit. I’m kind of distraught right now and I need some advice. I don’t know if this is important, but I’m a teenager. 

I went downstairs to print something and my dad’s desk drawer was open. Currently, it’s very early in the morning, so he probably didn’t expect anyone to see it open. I glanced over at it randomly and then saw some pill bottles. 

This confused me because I didn’t think my dad had any health issues, other than being overweight. I looked up the names of the medications that were in the desk, which were entecavir and tenofovir. Lo and behold, I find out that these are medications used to treat hepatitis B.

I’m shocked. I don’t know if my mom knows. I’m praying she does, because if she doesn’t, that brings up the possibility of my dad having cheated on her (although I feel like that’s unlikely.) I believe he has chronic Hepatitis B, since my research revealed that treatment is mostly for chronic, and that acute hepatitis b normally goes away on its own.

I’m just... so shocked, angry, and sad. This seems like the only possibility, since those pills were prescribed to him. This is my dad, who I love. He might have a major health issue, although people with hep b don’t really show too many symptoms, I believe. But it can result in liver failure and other scary things. What do I even do? 

TLDR; I think my dad might have Hepatitis B after researching some pills I found in his desk.",07Apr2019,1

228,"My mom is clinically mentally retarded (sorry for the harsh word, I don’t know how else to put it.) The doctor once said it wasn’t extreme but still enough to alter her lifestyle. I feel like all of my negative traits stem from the way I was brought up. I feel like I wouldn’t be such a pessimistic, lazy, insecure, apathetic asshole if she wasn’t the one who raised me. She was the one who subjected me to dirt-poor living conditions. She was the one who spent money on dumb things and made us move from house to house. She was the one who embarrassed me countless times in public and made me feel like I was less than others. She was the one who didn’t take me to my dentist appointments, who didn’t teach me how to brush my teeth, who gave me painful, rotting literally black cavities at the age of 5. She was the one who let my brother shut himself away from the world for 12 straight years and counting. I’m rambling. Point is, i’ve endure a great deal of things a child shouldn’t have to endure, and because of this, I am now a bad person. She does love me though, she always gives me money, asks me if i’ve eaten, worries about where I am, etc, but I feel guilty because I do not return that love. Whenever she tries to talk to me, I only have three responses, “yes,” “no,” and “okay”. I get annoyed, angry even whenever she’s anywhere near me, and I think it’s because I still can’t forgive her for all the suffering I’ve gone through because of her. People say that I shouldn’t blame her, that I can’t blame her because she’s ill, but I still suffered. I was still neglected. I was still hurt. I feel like I have every right to be mad at her. Is that wrong? I would try to talk to her about it but it’s useless. She will always be convinced that she was and is a good mother and that I wasn’t affected negatively by anything she did, and if i was, then it wasn’t her fault. So how do I make myself forgive her?

229,"Okay, I organised a night out in town with a few people, one of them being my friends ex. There were about 15 people, I live in a small town in the countryside so we took it to a place at least a mile away from any houses. We planned on all staying the night there with tents. There was lots of drinking and smoking weed.

I got really drunk and so did my friends ex, let’s call her Ruby. Ruby kept coming to me at the start of the night trying to kiss me. I said no because of my friend, who still likes her. Anyway the alcohol kicked in and we made out multiple times throughout what night.

I went back to hers with a few other people where we slept and I slept with her. These other people could hear us making out. The next morning I asked them not to say a word. They told all my mates and now they all hate me. They came to my house yelling at me to come outside and I did where they all shouted at me. I’ve fell out with all of them and they hate me.

I don’t understand why all of them are so angry. They haven’t been going out for months, and she says all the time she doesn’t like him. Also I was hammered I can hardly remember half of it.

232,"Basically my parents recently separated and are in the process of getting divorced(she told him she wanted a divorce in October and moved out in January). I'm proud of my mom for finally leaving my alcoholic father after 30+ years with him, but it's been a really tough process emotionally and financially as my mom is only working part time and my dad cut her off. She was able to get a few more hours a week and health insurance, but things are tight and she's been pulling money from my brother's college fund(her inheritance money) to help make ends meet and pay for her attorney. This has been extremely difficult process for her, she has never lived on her own before or supported herself and she told me she doesn't make enough money to support herself. She has been breaking out in stress-induced hives all over her body and every time I check in with her she is stressed beyond belief. I don't know the exacts of her finances but she has been making numerous decisions that confuse/worry me. We never had much money but my mom always spent a lot on trying to have the appearance of what I call a ""rich tennis mom."" For example she had been begging my dad for a new car and specifically wanted this 2 seater sports car. He finally got it for her a few years ago, and she totaled it with me in the car last summer. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life and she seemed to be more upset about the car than the fact both of us could have died (we both were miraculously fine even though we hydroplaned going 75+ mph and slammed into guard rails). The insurance money was enough to make it drivable but she has spent an additional $10+k on fixing the body and paint. I was prompted to post this after I visited her yesterday and made a comment about her boobs looking huge and she told me just got a boob job. This was completely shocking and out of the blue. I don't understand how she financially rationalized this decision and I never thought she would go under a major surgery and not tell me. A selfish part of me is upset that I've been so worried about her finances and mental health through all of this, and she goes and makes this very shocking decision that seems so drastically opposed to the conversations we've had crying trying to figure out how she is going to make everything work. Also I'm hurt by the fact that I feel left out and sad she didn't tell me about it. We haven't had a chance to talk about it because I was so speechless I had to change the subject. I don't have any details on any of it but for some reason I feel so emotional about it. I am a staunch believer in  bodily autonomy and having the freedom to change your appearance, but am having major conflicting feelings about all of this. I know I have to step back and realize that it's not my life and I don't know all the details. She is free to do whatever she wants and doesn't need her daughter's approval for things. I can't help but feel angry at her for this decision. I am worried for her financial future and don't want to her continue down a path of plastic surgery or trying to make herself happy through her appearance. What do you guys think about this situation? How can I support my mother through this tough time without overstepping boundaries?

233,"Hello
I am in my 4th year of college and I absolutely hate it, and myself for how I'm going about these last couple of semesters. I started out OK, few A's, mostly B's, couple C's. As time went on it went to no A's, few B's, mostly C's. Last two semesters it's been Some D's, couple C's. I am at a 2.0 GPA at this point. Despite being on my 4th year, I very likely have 2 semesters left after this one due to some classes I withdrew from/haven't completed. I have never not gone to class as much as this semester, laying in  bed sleeping instead quite often, and that disgusts me about myself. I am lazy. I always make up excuses about the work I need to do, put it off, and lie about what I've done/need to due. I have sabotaged this semester, and quite possibly my college degree. If I somehow make it through this semester still with at least my 2.0 I do not know how I will make it two more.

I hate where I live. With my parents. At 17 my parents and I moved from my long time girlfriend (we are still going strong, I love her more than anything still today at 21 years old) and every friend I have ever known. 45 mins- 1 hr distance between them and me now. I fantasize about getting a place back home with a few friends and my girlfriend, finishing school from there. It's just a fantasy, my parents would never allow it or support it, emotionally or financially. I make 1300~ a month so I'd like to think if me and 3 others rented a 1800$ a month house we could do it, but I could very well just be kidding myself. I am alone here, finishing myself going to work, sometimes school, and the rest of my time unable to find the strength to leave my bed or desk (where I use discord to talk to my loved ones back home). 

I ""hate"" my parents. I feel awful even typing that. They have taken care of me my entire life. They have also managed to make me terrified of them. My stomach drops whenever I hear my phone ring, or my name called. They answer any situations presented to them by screaming at me. I know they resent me. They are very successful people. Millionaires even. My father is even a professor at the very college I study at. They also expect me to pay for things myself, including car phone food gas etc. No big deal. I am an adult it is expected and I can afford it. I have not received any financial contribution from them in years aside from the free housing/internet they provide me, which I concede is exceptional. Before this latest semester they looked at my transcript without my knowledge, uncovering the 3~ classes I got D's in and the 5 or so classes I have withdrawn from. That day they found out was the worst day of my life. I have never seen them angrier or louder, and I have seem them plenty of both. They last few months my anxiety has been driven through the roof, with constant reminders that if I do not achieve good grades this semester, I am ""fucked"". Despite all this they are caring at times, and we can get along. Our relationship is very bi polar. I do not know if we get along or not. The bad has rubbed off against me much more than the good has. 

A part of me just wants to leave college and move back home, transfer to a Starbucks back there just to spite them and never have to talk to them again. I do not want to make them sad though. I still love them. I am so incredibly unhappy living with them. 

Most of all I hate myself for thinking all this. What mediocre problems these are, facilitated by myself. I am just paying the piper and lying in the bed my actions have created. I know I need to grow up and start acting like an adult. 

I do not know what I am doing, all I know is I am miserable. I want to stop being miserable. I do not know how. 

I am sorry for the ranting style of this post. Part of me just wanted to type this out to feel better. I don't know if I do.

I knew in my head he didn’t dance by himself or with guys, but I asked him with who? And he said a bunch of girls, I don’t know why but It really hurt my feelings to hear that. I asked him again if he really did dance with girls and his answer was “yeah I’m hardly going to dance with guys or by myself.”  I don’t want to be a girlfriend who controls her boyfriend and tells him what to do, but I really didn’t like that he danced with girls. 

In relationships I’m all about double standards, that if my boyfriend can do something I should be allowed too and vice versa. I asked my boyfriend if he would mind if I danced with a guy/guys at a party, and he said he would mind if I did and wouldn’t like it if I did. I pointed out to him that if he can dance with girls then I can dance with guys, his argument was girls can dance with girls, guys don’t have a choice they have to dance with girls. 

I didn’t let him dancing with girls interfere with our day together, i just let go of it. But i sometimes think about it and I’m just wondering if other people would also feel the same way about it as i do? Or if feeling hurt was stupid and over dramatic of me. ",07Apr2019,1

242,Just recently I pissed of my dad for a particular reason. That reason is that I don’t want to go home (I am an out of town student and I am staying in a house in the city) and he then told to don’t go to a computer shop telling me  that I am either becoming spoiled or just dont like them either way he was pissed at me. The reason why I want to stay in the out of town place is because I find it to be currently more comfortable here plus I am more productive here and I don’t see why he should be mad at me cause majority of the time we don’t even talk to each other most of the time I am at my phone or computer. Was I immature in this situation? or maybe this was my fault for not portraying my ideas better to him. Currently I don’t seem to give a damn and I can’t explaining my thoughts because it gave me the idea that expressing anything that challenges my dad’s ideals would piss him more. Whats your thoughts?

244,"Okay, so I was in the friendzone for like 6 years, and I finally got out because I stopped liking the person after I realized that I was more or less an emotional tampon for her.
Now I'm on the other end of the stick with another girl who's my best friend, and I have no idea how to get out because i'm not interested in her, but I wanna stay friends with her. Problem is, we're drinking buddies, and the last 2 times we went out drinking, she slept with me and we ended up making out, cuz well, I was horny. And I know for a fact that it's gonna keep happening because we're go out drinking together a lot and she ends up on my bed, unless well, she finds another guy.
Thing is I know how it feels to be on the other side of the friendzone and that shit really hurts.
Also I've had serious anxiety issues and depression for the last 6 years and it finally stopped after I stopped liking the other girl and now I can finally started sleeping well, but everytime my best friend sleeps with me, I just can't sleep or I end up crying because I get anxiety attacks around her.
What do I do, I still want to be friends with this person, but at the same time I want her to stop liking me?

246,"I broke up with him 7 years ago. He has consistently been in or trying to get back into my life. 

Last I saw him was spring 2016. He texted me late 2017. I threw my phone when I saw his name. I didn’t text him back. I should’ve blocked his number years ago.

Just because I still saw him after the breakup didn’t mean I wanted to. 

He hurt me, used me, and abused me. I wouldn’t let another guy touch me for nearly a year after we broke up ... I was disgusted with what I let him do to me. I was afraid he would follow me home, corner me or hurt me. He kept pushing himself back into my life over and over through school and friend groups. I was too nice to tell him to fuck off and leave me alone, and when I tried in “nicer” terms he didn’t get the hint...

Part of me thinks I’m overacting and part of me is thinking of how to stay safe. I never wanted to give him the chance to hurt me again. 

He texted me again minutes ago ... and I’m actually thinking of responding? I’m still afraid of him, but I don’t know if this is genuinely him wanting to make amends or a trick to crawl back into my life because he has nothing else and in his last resort... I don’t know his life, he might still be as bad if not worse than before, or he could’ve changed?

I’ve been turning over a new leaf this past year, trying to be a braver, a better person, but realistic. I don’t want to do something I’ll regret...

249,"My life is genuinely messed up. It has been for all my life. And I could rant about everything that has happened to me and why it all sucks, but one thing about me isn't even bad for myself - it's bad for everyone.

My whole life I liked to 'Stan' (be a big fan of) celebrities and youtubers. That's normal, of course. Some are incredibly inspiring and amazing. It's not until I became 13 when it all changed.

So 13, I didn't Stan a celebrity. I stanned someone I knew in real life - a teacher. He, of course, did not know. It sounds like an 'Uwu teacher crush thing' that everyone gets. I made sure I passed his classroom between lessons (changing my whole route), I'd get nervous when speaking to him. And thats fine, crushes on adult men are fine since it's probably a one off. But mine, it was different.

 I found out his social media, made alternate accounts to catfish him into letting me in his private accounts (luckily, this did not work), think about him non stop (I mean I dreaded weekends because I knew I didn't have his lesson) and I wanted attention from him so bad I'd ACT DEPRESSED around him and once self harmed and tried to get his attention. That's not normal, and I know that's heavily offensive to people who do suffer to depression (I feel sososos guilty for doing that). I was uncontrollable. 

It's not like I wasn't depressed. I wanted to kill myself if he didn't talk to me in a day. Not exaggerating. I was obsessed. My life depended on his attention and recognition.

He left, thankfully. I thought that this was a one off, that it was a sick teacher crush and 'everyone goes through it'. 

But it's starting to happen again, but to another teacher. Im refusing to act depressed around him this time or self harm and I'm trying not to become obsessed. But it physically hurts when I don't look at his Twitter. I can't stop thinking about him. I get nervous around him.

250,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Let me just dive right in. Just as the title mentions, I was raped at 13, and I loved it and believe it had a hand in shaping my sex life/preference in men.

Withdout going into the gory details of it (I know nobody wants to know that), let me explain what happened.

I was on my way home at about 9PM from a friend's birthday party, which was about a 10 minute walk from my place. Was walking by myself listening to music on my ipod, when I felt a man walking up behind me, so I just walked faster  because...stranger danger.

I didn't get a good look at him at the time, but I could tell, just by his silhouette, he was a big dude, at least thrice my size, and thought if this man wanted to harm me, I wouldn't be able do anything to defend myself.

Anyways, about a few seconds of walking faster, I realized he wasn't behind me anymore. So I was at ease. Just strolling down, at my own pace, was about to walk left on a sidewalk, on a dead street, when I felt a hand grab my neck and pull me backwards. Obviously I struggled, but at the same time didn't realize what was even happening, I guess my instincts for survival had kicked in.

Long story short, I was dragged by the neck into an alley, behind a store. Here is when I could actually partially see what he looked like. It was the same guy from earlier. Big, about 6'2,muscle bound and extremely violent towards he. He smacked me around while I resisted then punched me a couple of times, once in my face and once in my stomach to calm me down. And then went ahead and did the deed.

Here's what was weird, I struggled as much as I could, to no luck, while he was raping me. But for some reason, a relaization took over me. ""Hey, this is actually not that bad..."" and I don't know at it was, maybe a lack of any other option, or the fact that I actually loved being in that position, I just gave in and let him do what he wanted to.

The entire time he was hurling profanities and me, was being violent in more ways than one.

Now the sound of a couple of cars buzzing past they alley freaked him out, I guess, since he just got up and ran away.

There I was, a 13 year old girl, who had just been raped, sitting up against the wall of an alley.. not regretting it, not feeling ashamed of it, not feeling like a victim.. But like someone who has had a whole new side of life opened up to her. I literally got off on the fact, that had just happened.

I was so fascinated by it, that I went back to the same place the next night, just by myself, in hopes of coming across this man again. And I did (since that was a quiter part of the city, maybe he used it as his ""hunting grounds""?). I then talked to him, told him that I wanted him again. He was shocked more than anything. I would expect that. He then somehow managed to sneak me into a motel, had his way with me, just the way he did the night before. Then said he wanted to ""share"" me with his friends. Which again, I wasn't against. So he called 2 of his boys and all 3 of them took turns through the night.

Anways, fast forward 7 years. I'm 20 now. I would clearly say that I'm a sex addict/nympho. 300+ sexual partners later, I still look for more, I seek sexual approval in every man, that is twice or thrice as big as me, black, and muscle bound,because that is how exactly the man who raped me was.

I can't hold a steady relationship, because I just can't say no to a man that hits all those criterias, and then says he wants me. I can't help but sleep with them.. I just can't. I know I'm still young and don't want to settle down just yet, but what if this bleeds into the future as well? What if once I'm in my late 20s or in my 30s and still can't hold down a relationship because I want to be ""used"", yes used, by men? What direction would my life go in, if I continue this behavior?

Now, I'm not saying that, this affected my life in any other way than sexually. I'm a college student, that's well on her way to land a job, right after graduation. So all of that is taken care of. But I just can't stop myself from dressing provacotively, hanging out around seedy areas, coming on to guys who I want, in probably the least ladylike manner.

I'm known as a slut amongst my friends, as someone that has no morals when it comes to sex, since I've been having sex with older men, since I was a minor. Having sex with married men, being the reason for a few of their families to break up too. But.. I just can't help but love it, I don't want to, I try hard not to, but I just can't bring myself to think otherwise. 

I know, I'm an asshole and I'll probably get a lot of hate for posting this, but I just had to get this off of my chest.
I know, no normal girl would want to get raped, beat up, used my multiple men at the same time... But I do, is there something wrong with me? 

Will this kinda lifestyle be harmful for my future?

Is this something I should continue doing because I love it?

 Do I stop?

Am I missed up?

Well, anyways, thank you so much for reading all the way here, any suggestions or advice on this, or on why did I even love getting raped to begin with, would be highly appreciated 💖

TLDR; Was raped when I was 13,went back to him for more. Have become extenely submissive to physically powerful men, have had hundreds of sexual partners over the years and still need more. ",07Apr2019,0

So I was doing the dishes when I spotted a 6 inch Centipede.
So I immediately took out the bug spray and sprayed it slightly on it, while it did stop it from coming outside the sink it simply scurried back in the pipes.

I freaked out and poured half a tank of gasoline in the pipe thinking that the smell of gasoline will push it away or hopefully kill it.

I am worried that this fucker will return back to haunt me.
The reason I didn't unload the entire Bug Spray is because it's pretty toxic and I didn't want residues of this toxic waste in the kitchen utensils where we keep the food.

Is there anything other than bug spray that can be put into the sink to ensure it dies there or vanishes for good?

254,"A little background. My sister-in-law died about 5 months ago unexpectedly. She was in her mid-thirties and when my brother called me and told me, I was shocked and didn't really know how to respond.

The thing is, my relationship with my brother hasn't been great in several years, and that has a lot to do with my sister-in-law. She was manipulative and physically and verbally abusive towards my brother. She was an alcoholic and I suspect a drug addict that dragged my brother into drinking with her constantly. Some nights he would call me crying because she'd given him a black eye or had a temper tantrum and kicked him out of the house or one of her family members was threatening to kill him and he didn't know what to do. Everything was complicated by the fact that I have a nephew and my sister-in-law liked to threaten to leave and take my nephew with her. This happened consistently for 3 or 4 years and I tried whatever I could to help my brother at the time. I gave him a place to crash when she kicked him out, I made him go to the police and report the abuse a couple times eventhough he didn't want to, and I talked to a lawyer for him in the hope that he would try and gain sole custody of my nephew. But he always insisted that he loved my sister-in-law and he always went back to her and dropped the charges or didn't go to the appointment with the lawyer, or bought her family member whatever they asked for so they would stop threatening him. 

So I gave up because it was emotionally draining to try and pull him away when he refused to let her go. Eventually I moved to a different city for a new job and gradually heard less and less from my brother over time and that was mostly by choice. I told him I couldn't stand to listen to him cry about her threats, physical attacks or alcohol problems when he ultimately wasn't willing to leave her. He was bitter and resentful towards me as he felt that I was forcing him to choose between her and me. He made it clear that he would always choose her. I talked to my nephew rarely and became a stranger to them both. My sister-in-law started listening everyone of our rare calls so the conversation always remained superficial and eventually they both started to act as if the past had never happened and seemed to expect me to do the same. She acted as if we were best friends, even as the only messages I'd ever recieved solely from her were threats on my life. I started to ignore his calls because the thought of ""playing nice"" with the woman who'd destroyed my brother's self-worth and hurt him weekly was too much for me. 

Eventually the years of alcohol and drug abuse caught up with her. Giving birth to my nephew had almost killed her because her immune system was so messed up. She got sick and refused to go to the hospital when it became severe. My brother woke up with her dead beside him.

I have mixed feelings about her death but the first feeling is usually the most truthful and it was definitely relief. My immediate thought was that maybe our relationship would improve now and maybe I could get to know my nephew better. I couldn't even feel sad for her death and I realized that all of this wasn't what my brother wanted or needed, so it made me anxious to talk to him and awkward when I tried. 

He called me and cried. He asked me what to do, he poured out his entire grief for me to see...and I didn't know what to say. I said the typical things like ""I'm sorry this happened,"" ""she was too young,"" ""none of you deserved this."" I listened painfully to him saying the same things over and over, asking the same questions, and I wanted to be able to say the right words, but everything I said or didn't say didn't help and even made it worse. I realized that I didn't even know my brother anymore and he wasn't satisfied with my general platitudes. Our conversations always ended with awkward silence on my part and continued crying on his. 

I should have been there for him at the funeral but I couldn't be. The day she died was the first week of school. I'm in my late 20s and I found my ""right"" career rather late. I'd paid my tuition, but I was prepared to struggle for the few months of my program as I couldn't work full time. My mom agreed to help me pay my rent so I wouldn't be stressed financially while attending my course. Then my sister-in-law died and my mom quit her job on the spot and begged me to buy her a plane ticket so she could be with my brother. It was the only thing I could do for him so of course I did. Financially, none of my immediate family is doing well. My parents have worked minimum wage jobs all their lives and while my brother is better off, he was the sole source of income as my sister-in-law never had a job. I make the most out of all of us and I make entry-level money for my chosen profession. The entire few months of my program were stressful. I was working 3 to 4 days a week and because the program is so short, it was packed with information and tests. My brother would always call in the middle of the night because he was afraid of seeing her ghost or he couldn't sleep because of nightmares and I was guaranteed no sleep on the nights I worked so I  did poorly in my program because I kept falling asleep in class. I got a student loan since I could no longer rely on financial support from my family. I barely made rent for three months and I basically lived off of ramen noodles. 

My biggest regret is still that I couldn't afford to go to her funeral to at least be there for my brother. I feel he resents me for this, and for the silence when I don't have the words, or for the lack of positive stories to share about my sister-in-law. I will never talk badly about her, but I don't have any good memories of her either, so what is left after that? 

And FINALLY to the point of this post. Thank you for anyone that managed to make it this far. School just finished not too long ago and I'm finally back to working full time. So I took time off work to visit my brother, mom and nephew. It was my mom's birthday and I miss her a lot so I did focus quite a bit on her. Another plot twist: my brother took time off work to grieve but then broke his leg so he couldn't return back to work for even longer as he has a full leg cast and his job is very physical. So for the past 5 months since her death, my sister-in-law is all he's been focused on with no work and many ""friends"" distancing themselves in his grief.

I didn't want my week-long visit to be sad for him or my mom, especially since it was her birthday and I was there such a short time. It was the first time I'd seen my brother and nephew in over three years and I wanted to make the most of it. I avoided bringing up my sister-in-law, admittedly for my own comfort so my brother wouldn't break down in tears. I focused on getting to know my nephew, on my mom since I won't see her again for awhile, and I tried my best to keep my brother happy. I brought them all belated birthday gifts, and brought along card/board games we could play together, as well as walked my nephew to school and picked him up. We went to a movie, went shopping at the mall and my mom and nephew showed me around the town they live in. My brother is still in a cast so he can't walk for long before he is exhausted. He insisted we do things without him while he sat down quite a bit and observed us. 

When I got back home, I was under the impression that it was a good visit. Conversations between my brother and I are still awkward as it feels like we have to get to know each other all over again. Calls are still pretty superficial, until today. My brother called me and confessed how he really felt about our visit. He told me that he couldn't believe how I acted. That it was as if my sister-in-law had never existed to me, or how much it hurt him and angered him that I never mentioned my sister-in-law at all while I was there and seemed to focus only on having fun. While I did point out that the decorations my sister-in-law had put up were beautiful, and I stayed neutral whenever my brother mentioned her, he's right that I did my best to avoid bringing her up. And I know this was the wrong move now and I don't know how to fix it. 

What can I do to repair the damage I've done, and what could I possibly say to my brother, who is still grieving my sister-in-law as if she died yesterday? How can I make our relationship right, or can I even do so at all? ",07Apr2019,1
255,"Hi everyone, this is my first post on Reddit so here we go.

I’ve always been interested in discovering where my ancestors were from (I’m Italian btw) so a few months ago I bought a dna testing kit.

 I thought I already new the outcome but I just wanted to have a little fun. I predicted I was going to be 50% Italian and 50% English as my father is from the US but his family is English (my grandmother is from London and my grandfather’s family is English and Scottish) and my mom is Italian. 

Yesterday I got my results back and I was really confused. The results said I am only 18% Italian and 70 % from Northern continental Europe (for example Germany, France, Denmark etc), along with small percentages of other parts of Europe ( Iberia, the Balkans and Eastern Europe). The Italian part isn’t that hard to believe as I am from northern Italy which has been influenced by many continental European peoples. 

The part which really confused me was that according to my results I’m 0% English. Initially I thought it was considered part of Northern Europe, but as I further examined my results I realized that English was considered separately. 
I talked to my dad and he swears his family is English and that the results are probably wrong. I wanted to talk to my grandparents but they live in the US and I live in Italy so it’s kind of hard to contact them.  

I am aware that these tests are not accurate, but this is pretty weird and it left me with more questions than answers. 

What should I do? Should I take another test and confirm my results? Should I talk with my grandparents? 

I know this probably sounds stupid but I’m so confused. 😅

259,"As a person I don't like to be the reason for anyones inner turmoil. As the years have gone by I've learned to solve issues which can be solved and let go of the rest, keeping a constant flow in my life with focus on harmony. Or at least try. However, there are certain relationships which seem to demand more attention and energy than others. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have an ex 'boyfriend' who I only dated in 3 months. I was in love at the time. For some reason we fell very deep, regardless of the short time span that our relationship existed within. We were both coming out of long relationships. We were both willing to make it work yet anxious about the prospects of falling in love with each other for real. I never quite understood exactly where we stood as a couple but it made sense when it ended. We were too hesitant and too careful and too scarred at the time to begin to plan our future together. He left me behind as if I ment nothing which was hurtful at the time. I was also quite abrupt about the whole thing. However, I thought about him 24/7 or so it seemed. It was very intense and very unpleasant to have been left behind like that. He seemed very satisfied with the outcome on the other hand and he never looked back. Or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 years later he still is going in and out of this blocking me on Facebook and then unblocking me again, over and over. We're not contacts anymore and we never spoke again after he blocked me the first time. None of us have reached out. I have not thought about him for a long time and have been dating others. Then he pops up in the search bar when I'm online searching for something trivial which by chance has his first initial. I figure 'okay, wow, he took the time to unblock me. He must be moving on and doing alright'. It doesn't really demand anything from me other than thinking that. Then a few months later he does not pop up in the search bar and I notice again that he took some action to block me. The same goes on for months. Unblocking. Blocking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do as a person to give him peace? Have you ever been the one doing the blocking/unblocking or been in my situation, wondering if there's anything you can do to help? I do not want to reach out and talk etc. I don't think he wants that either. I'd just like for him to not be focusing on me that much, two years after we broke up our 3 months relationship. It makes me somewhat worried that he still has that focus directed towards me.

263,"I feel like I'm losing my mind. My mom divorced my stepdad almost twelve years ago. I haven't spoken to him since and I never want to. I still hear his voice and it scares the hell out of me. I can't think of any force in this world that brings such a rush of anger into me. I sometimes dream he's still there. I can't even control it.

My mom spent about ten years with him and took me with her when they got married. My stepsisters and I endured his reign together for a couple of years, but they were able to escape throughout the week. Eventually their mother let them stop coming altogether and then I was alone. 

I had no idea what to expect from day to day. Some days he was almost tolerable at best, most others he was an explosive tyrant. Early on it was just little things. If I was in the house he wanted me outside. If I was outside, he wanted me in the house. He never asked me to do things; every demand was immediately presented as though I had done something wrong. I vividly remember him screaming at me in my face because I was a few seconds behind my stepsisters for breakfast because I was washing my hands. I remember my mom trying to side with me and tell him she had asked me to wash my hands, only for him to insist that I had done something wrong. He stomped around the house at all times, usually pacing and loudly discussing ridiculous white supremacist bullshit on the phone with his cousin. I was terrified of him ever finding out I had listened to rap. I was constantly worried that some song he found repulsive would come on a TV ad or what have you because it would consistently set him off, fuming against the world for making the music and for me for exposing him to it. For a while this was about the worst of it more or less.

It really wasn't that bad until my grandpa died, and that's really when it all got much worse. He started treating my mom horribly then and constantly treated her more like a slave than anything. If I was in the living room when he was about to take a shower, he would purposely strip naked in the laundry room and stomp in front of me, loudly announcing that he ""had his belt off"". Occasionally he would taunt me and thrust himself in my direction and laugh his fucking laugh. I asked him once to please stop and he completely went off on me. I tried to just stay in my room as much as possible. He was always abusing animals and taunted me telling me about how he threw this stray cat my mom and I had been feeding off a bridge. I wasn't allowed to have friends over until I was about 12, and even then he usually found something offensive about them so they weren't allowed back. My best friend was able to come around for a good while until my stepdad claimed he knew without a doubt he had stolen money from his wallet, which he confronted me about by slamming my door open one morning and waking me up to scream in my face that I had better give him his money back. So after that, even though my friend absolutely had not taken anything from him, he wasn't allowed back. 

The constant arguments with my mom were the most harrowing parts. I never knew when he would start screaming at her over next to nothing. He always made a point to bring me into their arguments while I cowered in my room, calling me ""that sulky ass kid"". He once busted in my room abruptly during one of their arguments and screamed at me then took a floor fan and slammed it on the ground and then threw it out the front door and told me I wasn't allowed to have a fan anymore. He locked us out of the house several times. My mom took me with her to stay at my grandma's a couple of times after they fought, but we would inevitably go back and he would just buy her some clothes and she would act like it wasn't a big deal. He always told me I was going to make someone a good housewife someday (I'm male for the record) and said I was never going to be a man because I cried during a sad part of a movie. I cried a lot as a kid and it just got worse every time to the point where I was so scared of being around him at my grandpa's funeral because I knew I was going to end up crying there. 

It got to its worst when he and my mom started going to church and insisted I go with them because now everything I did was a sin and I was going to burn in hell. It only made him even more dominating and he was constantly reminding my mom that she was his property and that she was not to speak in church. He always accused her of cheating on him because she was friends with a lesbian woman from her work. She came home late from work one evening and he took all her clothes outside and burned them. I thought that might be what would make her leave for good, but she just went back a day later and he bought her more clothes. I was about as angry with her as I was with him and I was almost unresponsive at dinner, just trying to get through it so I could hide in my room. I didn't hear her ask me something and he snapped, telling me to answer her when she spoke. I just asked him why he hated us so much and before I knew it he was up and in my face, poking his fat stubby finger in my chest and reminding me how worthless and disrespectful I was. It was then when I realized by this point I was taller than him and he was looking up at me as he screamed. 

That was the only time I ever really stood up to him at all. I wasn't really that afraid of him after that, but I secretly wanted him to hurt me so I could prove it somehow, and it was like he knew and never did lay hands on me. I was doing horribly in school by this point and I started to believe everything he always told me about how I was never going to do anything worthwhile and was just going to work a minimum wage job from the time he kicked me out to the day I died. I came so close to killing myself and I often wish I had. I wanted to kill him so badly. I wanted to rid the world of him and myself. But I was too cowardly to do it and I feel like the world is all the worse for me letting him continue to live. He has another kid now and I'm so afraid he's putting her through the same thing. It's been ages since we spoke or anything. I shouldn't even still be worried, but I'm always afraid I'm going to see him and have no idea what I'll do. That has followed me through every job I've ever had and almost every time I've been in public my adult life in this town. 

I thought I was getting a bit better and not worrying about him so much until a year ago. I work in a hospital and he came into the ER with his mother. She somewhat recognized me when I was helping her get to the restroom and when I recognized who she was, my heart nearly stopped. I looked up and saw him, that awful grin still on his face, walking through the ER. We met eyes for a moment, but I don't know if he knew who I was--I look pretty different than I did before. But he did a double take and I just turned away and walked as fast as I could and just found a bathroom and completely broke down.

I managed to stay hidden from him the rest of the night, but I feel like my mind is absolutely ruined. I'm associated more things with him than I ever have. Worse yet, they're incredibly common things. Black Ford Rangers. Denim. Confederate imagery. Conservative ideology in general. I live in a heavily conservative small town where there are a ton of men who are so similar to him I feel almost crippled because I just hear and see him all the time. My middle name is the same as his first name and I'm seriously considering changing it. Everything reminds me of him. I nearly had a panic attack when I had jury duty a few months back because I knew there was a chance he could be there and so many of the men who were there were so much like him. When I was dismissed from it, I just went home and locked myself in my apartment and cried.

I don't go anywhere anymore. I'm just trying to get through college and right now it's just unfeasible for me to move away. I thought I was getting better, but it will just flare up unexpectedly more and more frequently and I can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm going to be tortured until I know he's dead. I'm afraid of ever doing anything that might make me well known at all. I'm doing my best to be as strong as I can, but I struggle to sleep because all I can see is myself torturing him slowly and basically throwing my own life away to get revenge. I've been in therapy for a few years, but it's like I can't stop thinking of how much he and all the countless pieces of shit like him are making the world as bad as it is. I'm such a weak person and I'm too afraid to fix anything. I'm incredibly frustrated because I feel like I have a serious loss of connection with reality. I know it's fully possible for me to encounter him somewhere, but I can't justify constantly being reminded of him all the time when I know all these people I'm surrounded by aren't necessarily him even if they remind me of him. I thought I had convinced myself that the best way I can disrespect him and dehumanize him is to consider him unworthy of any attention or recognition for ruining much of my life, but it's hardly so easy in practice.

Apologies for being a long-winded bore. I just have practically no one to talk to about this who won't tell me to just pray about it or some horseshit. I don't really even know what kind of advice I'm looking for, I just know sometimes others can perceive a possible solution or perspective I'm unable to see.",07Apr2019,1

266,"I'm currently a Uni student with a good friend of mine studying the same degree. He's always been a great pal of mine, people in the cohort think were inseparable and we constantly get banter is thrown our way for always being chummy essentially were known for being best friends. But recently over the last 4 weeks, I've just developed an absolute loathing for him. As if I just can't stand him at all, from his mannerisms, to how he acts so socially irresponsible, pulling his phone out at the most inappropriate times. But unfortunately, in our degree, I'm stuck with him for a bit. But I can't even stand talking to him or even being around him. I'm so confused as to how I'm meant to deal with him 6-7 hours a day, Monday to Friday if I'm just so sick of him already. To make this worse I've realized he always makes everything a subtle competition. For example, he currently has gf whereas I do not. Then he repeatedly keeps asking questions like, bro how do you like even function without having sex? (Like really demeaning questions). Even answering questions in class, I'll know the answer, whisper it to him (because who wants to actually answer questions in front of the cohort) and he'll instantly answer the question as if I hadn't told him seconds prior. Even doing study/assessments prior to me only to ask if I done this or that etc etc. If anyone has advice for people who know what this feels like or has dealt with something similar ( I know this is super specific) I would greatly appreciate it.

267,"So years ago I was falsely accused of rape. I had evidence it wasn't true, but the police took so long to get in touch with me by the time they asked for my statement the damage was done. I was never charged but my reputation has been destroyed. Recently I got a copy of the police report and finally have everything I need to make a serious case for defamation. The thing is there is no information about the incident on the internet. The only reason it would come up in my future is because of people who know about it. So I have to decide, do i sue for defamation and risk making the situation worse, or do I just move to a quiet corner of the world, never pursue anything of merit and start over. If I sue, i risk people tweeting about how evil I am, protests around campus, articles about me and any chance of having a life. If I win the lawsuit however, I can live my life to the fullest, and not be worried about constantly looking over my shoulder fearing that my life will collapse at any moment. I am beyond done with this world and the only thing that has kept me going since this happened is the chance that i could sue and finally get my life back, but i risk making my life even worse and being an outcast for the rest of my life.

268,"I've just turned 32 and I feel like I never became what I wanted - a music producer. I never followed through on becoming a writer...I just ended up distracted in a corporate job trying to make ends meet, losing sight of my hopes and dreams and wasting away my pain with alcohol to numb the dread and postpone the reality of thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm over the hill now. How could I ever become a music producer at 32? What has happened to my life? It's all slipping away and I wake up every day with a rock in my stomach. Dread. Nothing but dread. Since I was 12 I've daydreamed and fantasied about dying and I don't know why I enjoy the thought so much. I'm not emo. I just don't know what to do anymore. Life has gone so fast and continues to go so fast and memories soon fade. Something also about Avicii's death accelerated my dread, and it's especially bad now as it's been a year since he died and I reflect on the things I was doing last year (travel) and how I've been so busy trying to change jobs I haven't stopped to appreciate the past.

I have no one to talk to who will listen, they just brush me off. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. Nothing to hope and dream about. Just death. I'm tired of feeling like my life could've been something great and it's the polar opposite-i'm a lazy fkn failure and an example of someone to never be like. I hate everything.",07Apr2019,4

He reached out because what he's doing is taking a significant mental toll on him and his personal relationships, and he wants to get out as soon as possible.

I love my friends. They’re my family. I shook and cried for days at the thought of a razor touching their skin. They’ve always been such positive influences on my life. I never saw this coming. I couldn’t eat or sleep, I couldn’t focus in classes. I couldn’t talk to anyone without shaking and crying. I took every break school gave me having anxiety attacks in a bathroom stall.

I had known about one of them having self harm issues weeks before, I was keeping my stresses to myself, and we were trying to work it out together, but I got my schools guidance counselor involved a day after I found out they were BOTH self harming because I couldn’t handle it.

The guidance office has a policy to call the parents of the student who self harms, but my  friends both have terrible relationships with their parents. Now neither of my friends will talk to me because I “flipped their lives around and they hate it”. I don’t know if my friends will ever talk to me again. I’m so scared of losing them. I don’t know what to do. I just want this to stop. I don’t know how to handle all of this and it’s driving me insane. 

I’ve tried to talk to people using fake names for my friends and not revealing the situation. No one my age knows how to handle this. I can’t tell my mom because she can’t handle it. I know she can’t, she can hardly handle talks about depression. I can barely talk to my sister because the same thing happened to her when she was my age and she was permanently traumatized. I can’t talk to my dad because my relationship with him is terrible.

I’m forced to handle this alone, I hate it and they’re MAD at me. What else was I supposed to do? Let them suffer while I sit with this alone?? 

I used to have the same self harming issue. I KNOW how this feels, and it was one of the friends I reported that reported ME when I was struggling. I have no idea how to move forward from this. I need help but I’m too alone. If anyone knows if there’s anything I can do, please let me know. I love these people and I just want them to be safe.",07Apr2019,2

276,"Hey guys, just posting on a throwaway account.

So I'm \[21M\] in an asian family of four and my brother, who has recently finished high school last year, has been quite concerning lately. My family is fairly fortunate so we've had a quite a nice upbringing with a lot of freedom and leniency. Me and my older sister, 23, have left home for University so haven't been able to keep an eye on my brother while my parents are busy working throughout the day and just want to come home to relax so it just means my brother has the freedom to do whatever he wants and he chooses to play video games in his room all day. Sometimes he skips classes in school and takes off days when he feels like it. He hasn't really had anyone to look after him or anyone to look up-to since he's the oldest sibling at home. He is very anti-social everyone including his own family and I don't think he has many friends. My parents don't speak english that well as that's the only language he can speak so it can be tough for them to communicate with him as well. It is very difficult to get proper answers out of him other than him answering ""yes"", ""no,"" or ""I don't know"". 

Me and my sister has been discussing what to do to help him out but it's hard to when he doesn't want to put in any effort in anything else other than playing computer games all day so we figured the best way was to let him grow on his own when he starts at the same University as me 2 hours from home and lived by himself in a University dorm with other first year students. Our family were convinced he would study Engineering this year when University began 6 weeks ago. He made very little effort to know the area he was studying at and didn't visit the dorm at all. Move in day for the dorm was a week before University started however, he told me he would move in on the Sunday, one day before University started. This was alarming for me as it meant that he wouldn't start off University on the right foot and begin making new friends. However, on the Sunday, I got a phone call from my youngest brother, 13, and told me that he isn't going to University at all but he would come up anyway with my Dad and brother. He has had three months in between high school finishing and the start of University and he chose the final day to tell us this. They visited me and I asked him a lot of questions about why he made this decision and why he did it on the last day. All of his answer's were 'I don't know' so I just started throwing out suggestions like maybe he felt pressured to go to University because everyone in his family and relatives did and that he was scared to live on his own as well as make new friends which he agreed. He also mentioned that he hates studying. I was kinda okay with this and asked what he planned to do instead and he said just ""work"" but he was unsure where. I strongly suggested working at the family restaurant as a waiter/cashier so he got familiar with talking to customers and building communication skills which he lacks as well as going to the gym and hanging with friends.

Fast forward to today, he has made zero progress and still plays video games all day and night. Me and my sister are very concerned and my parents has put a lot of pressure on us to help him out but we don't know what to do. My parents are quite old and we don't want them to feel more stressed than needed when they are both working over 12 hour days to run the business. We want to take away his computer but don't think that's the best idea since I feel like he will feel oppressed. I want him to see some kind of therapist but I don't know if that's the best idea. He is just in his little bubble isolated from the rest of the world and I want him to do well in life but I'm running out of ideas to help him out. ",07Apr2019,5
277,"Last week I had just finished a shift at work and was about to drive home when someone reversed out on me from a parking bay while I was on the road, I was only driving very slowly and he came out of the bay at quite some speed (enough to have written my car off). We both got out of our cars and I was that shocked over everything that happened that I didn’t know what to say. He said we would contact each other and sort it out later and got back in his car, I was so stunned I just kind of agreed. My neck hurt so I went to the hospital where the doctor said I have whiplash. 

I called my manager and explained everything and she said there is a rumour that the person driving the car doesn’t even have a license, let alone insurance and that I should contact the police ASAP and the car he is driving is his girlfriend’s, who also works at my place. Called the police and they said to ask for her insurance details and if she gives any hassle to go straight back to them. Messaged her and asked for details and she refused point blank as she wasn’t driving the vehicle so she thinks it’s not her problem. Also she has told the police that her boyfriend stole her car as she didn’t give him permission to drive it, which is a lie because he drives that car all of the time. Picks her kids up from school, gives people lifts home from work, picks her up from work if they’re not on the same shift etc. Got back in touch with the police who told her to give me her details which she sort of did (gave me her policy number and reg plate, no address or anything else though) but ultimately as I was hit by an uninsured driver I will have to claim off my own insurance, this has obviously made me angry so at work the next day I was talking about the accident with my colleagues who tell me I should tell the police that she is lying about him stealing her car.
 Someone then went up to her unit and told her I was going to do this and she is now making up stories about how I’m actually at fault. Apparently I drove into him on purpose because my car was already damaged and I want a new one (lol). She is laying it on really thick and making me out to be this evil person just wanting to stir the pot and wanting tonnes of money and people at work now think I’m awful and am in the wrong. 
I’m just not sure what I can do now? Should I tell the police she is lying? How can I stop her being awful at work? Is there anything I can do to claim against her or her boyfriend for damages done to my car as I think it is so unfair that I should cop for something that wasn’t my fault?",07Apr2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

By that logic, I've always seen most things as ""unnecessary."" I go to school, eat, and sleep because I understand that you need it to get through life. But sports, volunteering, part-time jobs, etc. are something that I've always thought you didn't need in order to have a normal life. As a result I don't really have any strengths nor experience outside of what I'm being taught in school. I'm no over-achiever either. I half-ass most of my education and only really focus on the couple subjects I think will be necessary for my future. Even while doing this I get mid - high 80's on average, and I'm sure if I had wanted to, that I could be an extremely successful person.

284,"Hello. This is probably just another really generic post about high school relationships that this subreddit has seen plenty of, but it's all that's been on my mind lately so I would greatly appreciate any bits of advice.

I used to date this girl who we will call ""Kacy."" We're both in our senior year as of now.

Kacy and I started off as friends and we bonded through classes and a lot of common hobbies and interests. Eventually, we got to a point where we were fairly certain the other reciprocated feelings and confessed. I got chocolates and asked her to be my girlfriend.

The honeymoon phase was really great. We hung out a lot and had quality time together when we did things together. However, things started getting messy because we both started becoming jealous of each other's relationship with close friends of the opposite gender and struggling to be more open about our feelings and whatnot.

After a few months, we broke up and I did my own thing while she got into another relationship. I couldn't bear to see her with someone else or the thought of it so I ended up blocking her on basically everywhere for my own sake.

Fast forward to the more recent past, we moved past the awkwardness and are getting close again due to her being the sub to the sub of my badminton partner. We go on team dinners and she usually ends up driving me so that has contributed as well.

Now, here's comes the real kicker. 

Over the course of the badminton season, she has been giving my rides home, and in one of them, she told me that someone was asking her and she was unsure about it because she was planning on asking someone herself.

Recently, my good guy friend ""Kyle"" has been gaslighting me about the relationship that I pushed to the back of my mind. He asked me about my feelings, if I would try again, or if I would go to prom with her. All of which I responded uncertainly except for the last to which I said I wouldn't mind (in reality, I've been wanting to ask her but I didn't want backlash from asking an ex). His gaslighting made me realize that despite everything I really do miss her.

Later in the day, I realized all of Kyle's questions have been hypothetical except for the last. Realizing that Kyle and Kacy have gotten close recently as well, I kind of figured out what was going on and that she planned to ask me. This along with Kyle's gaslighting made me question if I was starting to like her again.

Kyle, Kacy, and I were planning to play some video games together before the badminton match, but Kacy couldn't make so it was Kacy and I. I had a blast, and midway through, I knew I liked her again and  was on my way to being head-over-heels again.

Yesterday night, Kacy, Kyle, my sister and I hung out in my room and just talked about anime, college and stuff. Kacy and I were more physically close than usual (similar to how we were before dating) with her legs over mine. That night has just left me feeling even more confused.

I'm really scared to do anything right now because our breakup changed me quite a bit and I don't want to go through something similar. I was thinking about cutting ties after the season ends, but some friends have been telling me that that's unhealthy and will leave me feeling worse. Some have been saying to confess and find closure, but that's scary.

It got me thinking, I used to camwhore when I was younger. Like 8-15 in the yahoo chats or msn or 4chan. I had dozens of contacts and I had deep conversations with many of the men. It was highly sexual, often either them or me or both sharing video streams. Sometimes it was just conversation though, asking me to come live with them or whatever. I was a loner at school so this was like my only way of getting attention and comfort and friendship.

\[You don't have to read the whole thing, but I'd say it will give you better look at my situation\] Also sorry for typos and grammar, english is not my first language.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey! I came here again to reach out for help, since you are great people and everytime I asked here, I got the advice that I needed. I'm thirteen, turning fourteen on fifth May. In the past I went through depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts and actually attempted suicide two years ago. Last year, 2018 in September, my mental state got worse. 

Right now I'm in a sutuation where I just don't see the point in anything. I visit psychiatrist, psychologist and my own doctor for therapies. I take two kinds of pills for my panic and anxiety attacks, also for my sleeping problems. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore. But I know it's wrong. And I want it to change. My psychologist told me to give myself a compliment everytime I look into the mirror, to go out more and to dance at least for one song all the way till the end. I've been skipping school a lot lately, since it's such a toxic enviroment. I have no friends, only two girls that talk to me, who used to be my best friends but were very mean to me while we were friends, so I cut them off. Now it's just awkward and every interaction with them makes me uncomfortable. My other classmates hate me a lot. I used to get bullied at school really badly, which was one of the reasons I was very suicidal. People at my school don't seem like good people to me, to be quite honest. Of course there are some individuals that seem really nice, but I think it would be weird to start being friends now, when middle school soon ends for us. Also, I don't think they like me much because of what my classmates have been saying about me.   


I'm down to accomplish all those things my therapist told me to do, since I'm very hardworking person. Even though the selflove-compliment thing is very hard, I'm trying. I've been going out more lately. I used to never leave my house. Never, literally only to school and back home. And so I see it as an improvement, and I'm quite proud of myself. I haven't danced yet, because I can't find energy to do that. But I will try. Maybe even after I finish writing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is: I feel like my parents are disappointed in me more and more, day by day. My mom pressures me constantly and wants me out of the house ALL THE TIME, and she always reasons it with ""your therapist said so"".  My dad is very angry and upset with me, because I skip school. He also blames me for playing video games so much, he says that's the cause of my depression. Okay...??? 

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be super weird, but I'm pretty sure at least some of you who are around my age can relate that you all have one fictional character you just wish was real. For me it's Peter Parker, Spider-Man. The only reason I'm excited to go to high school is because I hope I'll meet ""mine Peter Parker"" there. I just don't know how to approach people! I'm so awkward. Very socially awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm here to ask you: How to be happier, motivated to live and go to school, find friends or if I should wait it out until high school? And how to approach people in high school? And how to make my parents pressure me less? Thanks, hope you have a great day &lt;3

290,"So, this is my first post here but I can’t find shit for answers on google so thought I’d try reddit as it usually answers a lot of my weirder questions, so please help me if you have any advice on this. 

Short version: If I’m getting paid under the table and I file taxes next year, will my employer get in trouble?

Longer explanation:
So I ’m a tattoo apprentice, and I’ve been tattooing close to 7 or 8 months roughly now (so about 3 months for 2019), and like many other artists in my town, I get paid under the table. Which is great and all and I keep more money but I’m a bit of a goody tooshu and I’m honestly a little nervous about running into problems with the IRS or getting into some kind of legal trouble. Now I know I can file taxes while being paid under the table with some 1099 form and other technical shit butttt, I don’t want to get my employer in trouble. He’s been doing this for a longg ass time himself and I know he would get in a bunch of serious legal shit if the irs and whomever else took notice. So I was wondering anybody had any idea if I file for my taxes in 2020, will he get in trouble???

So last night my coworker offered to drive me home, which I was pretty happy about since my mom tends to drink a lot at night and thus was unable to actually come get me. (It should be worth noting that I usually get off around 10:30-11:00 p.m. btw) 
Anyway- so I get in the guys car, and I hit his dab pen and he hits mine. We’re getting pretty toasted and we start talking about theories and whether or not god is real. Typical weed conversion, right? 
Anyway- so after a few moments we start the ride to my house, I told him where I lived and he had assured me he knew exactly where that was PRIOR to us getting toasted. So I got pretty terrified halfway through the ride when he started asking me which roads we should be turning on. I knew a lot of them, but I was so toasted I was terrified I was telling him the wrong thing. 
He kinda started to bug because we were both realizing how high we actually were. And that this ride home would be pretty difficult. Plus it was now like 11:25 and my mom was wondering where tf I was. Not to mention cops were everywhere patrolling. 
So I started to tremble and shake while I tried to pull up google map instructions. And he kept slamming on the gas pedal at random intervals and I suddenly didn’t feel safe anymore. I was shaking and it was hard to breath, and I kept messing with my phone only to realize I didn’t have internet to look up the directions. Luckily he just gave me his and I was able to find it easily- but the ride was pretty terrifying. I’m embarrassed and scared to ever see him again, because I feel like I did something so so dumb.

TLDR: refund was garnished for student loan in default. I wasn’t notified about the loan being in collections, and cannot get in contact with the company to try to start paying. What can I do?

Novel: I am a teacher (juvenile detention, not public. So year round). I had calculated my return, and Federal was to be about $7k. I filed late January, and it came out to around my estimation. State accepted (around $800), and I received it about a week later. 

I had earmarked both of them - the $800 went toward a specific medical bill to pay it off. The $7k I had planned to fix two broken teeth that need root canals and crowns (yes I have dental insurance, but it is still exorbitant), pay some more on medical bills, and pay toward some other debts. The ""where's my refund"" on the IRS said it was to be sent to my bank on February 27th. That date came and went, and my refund did not appear in my bank. I saw that it could take until March fourth, but when I called my bank, they said they had no record of it being sent. That weekend, I saw online a number you could call to see if it had been garnished for any reason, and I got fearful and called. It said it had been garnished by the US Department of Education. Upon some digging, I learned that I had a student loan that had come out of deferment last May, but the notification had gone to an old defunct student email address, and they had not sent any written notice.  The company they sent it to for collections did not send any notification, just garnished the refund. I am just heartbroken, and honestly in shock. I feel like I should have been given some notice. I attempted to contact the USDE, but they said they have nothing to do with it, it was handed over to a collection agency in May. So why did they garnish my entire refund, if they don't even hold my loan anymore?! 

I called the company that garnished it and now owns the loan daily, for over a month now to try and set up a payment. Every single day, it rings for about 5 minutes and then I get a voicemail saying they are sorry no agent is around to take the call but to leave a message with a phone number or email address and someone will get back to me. I have left a message almost every time. What else can I do?!? I cannot afford for them to garnish my wages...

310,"To preface, I’m a straight female, and I’ve always been friends with guys, mostly. This is for no other reason except that I’m naturally more comfortable around men. I’m currently a university student.

I only have one (genuinely 1) close female friend, we’ll call her Lauren. Lauren does not attend my university, she is a friend from when I was in high school that lives near my university. 

At school, I have a really awesome group of friends. My best friends are 4 amazing guys who I get along incredibly well with, and my relationship with each of them is completely platonic. I have an extended group of friends that is about 10 guys, with whom I fit in with as well, but I am less close with them. Lauren does not know the guys from wither group, other than from me talking about them, or meeting them in passing when she visits me at school.

Recently, Lauren got out of a long term (2 yr) relationship. The day after she and her ex broke up, she was on Tinder. When I asked her why, she said it would boost her self-esteem and give her a rebound opportunity. I knew that that was a bad sign, and I tried to encourage her not to do that but she’s SO sensitive. So by telling her that attention from random guys probably wasn’t the best way to heal, she was hurt.

Anyways, fast forward a couple weeks. Lauren calls me and says ‘You’re not going to be happy with me’ and informs me that she hung out with and made out with one of my closest friends (We’ll call him Jimmy). It was definitely uncomfortable for me, partly because she had communicated with my friend behind my back to coordinate plans with him, but especially because I knew her intentions were to just hook up with someone, and my friend Jimmy has the BIGGEST heart and does not just hook up with people for fun. So, basically, I knew it would fuck with him. I told her this, that it made me uncomfortable, and she responded defensively. In a ‘you’re my friend, you should want me to be happy’ kind of way. So, I let it go. Whatever.

The next day, she tells me that she matched with one of my extended friend group friends (We’ll call him Sam) on Tinder. And I joke around about how I’d be pissed if she tries to hook up with another one of my friends (I wasn’t joking though, just trying to approach this serious problem in a less direct way). Long story short, she calls me 2 days later, and tells me that she hooked up with Sam. And she tells me about it like it’s no biggie, like as though it’s just some random dude. At this point, I’m extremely frustrated, and she can tell. So she asks me why, and I tell her again that I’m not comfortable with her hooking up with my friends. And she gets defensive in the same way again.

So fast forward to last night, about 2 weeks later. I have avoided her because of what she did. But today, she calls me and asks what I’m up to, and I tell her that I’m hanging out with the crew (my closest guy friends), so I’m busy. And she says ‘No biggie, I’ll come over and hang with you guys.’ And I’m frustrated, because she kinda invited herself, and also I’m trying to keep her at a distance from my friends if I can.

At this point, I had informed a few of my closest guy friends about what Lauren had been doing and how frustrated I was, but I had not yet told my closest friend, whom I’ll call Greg. Greg is not close friends with Jimmy or Sam, either, so he would not have heard about it from them.

So, Lauren comes over and starts flirting with all my friends. Most of them aren’t having it, because they know what she’s been up to. But Greg doesn’t know, so he lets it happen. She’d touch him when talking to him, sit between his legs while we all watched a movie, convinced him to give her a massage, etc. She is clearly on a mission. And at this point I genuinely cannot take it anymore.

If these were mutual friends of ours, maybe I’d be less bothered, but out of everyone in the world, she’s trying to hook up with all my best friends who she barely knows? I just don’t understand. And since she’s so sensitive, I don’t know how to approach it. I don’t even know if this is a toxic enough friendship to dump it. Or am I in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable about it? Please help.

313,"Graduated with a Masters degree some years back. Have only had temporary jobs/internships since and it really drains me. I have gone through some very dark periods, doubting myself and scared about the future.

Now I'm in an internship again. What I would like advice with, is how to stay motivated and showing my best side while at work. If an opening shows up, maybe I will be in a good position to get it, who knows. But it's hard to put your best face on and stay motivated when you're working full time (some days overtime), same as everyone else, while getting just what I got when I didn't have any job (like government benefits). The sense of unfairness creeps up pretty often and the feeling that I'm just being taken advantage of me.

314,"I met this girl 8 months ago. We hit it off and we kept in the friend level because we both want to be single. We would talk everyday, watch movies, hang out etc. I got to know her siblings, parents, friends and even her secrets and insecurity. We would send each other little vlogs and generally check up on each other. She was definitely genuinely good and caring and a positive influences.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a history of lying to her, things I forgot about. However, this last lie is apparently the last straw for her.

&amp;#x200B;

Last Friday, she came over my place (she has keys) and I was high. I had promised her I would quit my coke habit 30 days ago, and I had been truly clean except that Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing, she asked me what's wrong. I merely said I was tired but she wasn't buying it. I keep saying Im just tired but eventually I cave in and tell her the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

She gets mad, and says you lied to me again. She leaves my house and the keys. She had blocked me from all social. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 days later, she sends me a long paragraph saying she wants a break. Here's a few snippets of that letter:

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;I want to tell you that I’m not forgiving you for lying to me again. I'm just so tired of it when you lie about the things you do instead of telling me the truth straight away.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I can't believe I'm the first one to write to you about this, like seriously?. Anyway I just want to say we should just take a break from whatever this so called friendship is. I don't feel good after being lied to by someone who i talk to everyday, completely honest to, and give your positive energy to. It's just heartbreaking.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I need to focus on my real friends and school.

 

&gt;I just don’t think that our so called friendship would work out in the end anyways so why build some sort friendship when you know.. will probably just disappear anytime and I just think it’s time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Thank you steve for being a funny and supportive friend. And for real, don't call me after this. I'm sorry it had to go this way.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt super bad. I wrote her an apology, which I asked her brother to give to her. A day after the brother removes me from snapchat.

&amp;#x200B;

I call her the day after and no response.

&amp;#x200B;

And beyond that I made a few TikToks but not for her, but it was songs about forgiveness, but secretly it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm just taking the lessons I've learned, I've completely kicked my habit, it has turned me off from coke completely. I'm striving to be more truthful.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess what I'm asking is, is this really the end? 

&amp;#x200B;

Will she come around like before and forgive. It's been exactly a week since this happened. And tomorrow will be the longest we've gone without contact.

316,"Hi guys,

I’m currently a French student and I’m experiencing difficulties about my future. I don’t know what to, what I want to do.

I was a good student with no difficulties. I managed to learn reading before entering in school, I skipped 7th grade and I graduated high school with good marks easily. Then I entered in a good an engineering preparatory class (a particularity of the French system) and it was... horrible. I finally get a bad computer science school and I left it because of the methods. I’m now at university in physics-maths and I don’t like what I’m doing. I have bad marks and I don’t know if I’ll get my bachelor. Thus I’m thinking about other options for next year but I’m kinda lost. I don’t want to talk to it to my parents or friends because most of them don’t care or give bad advice. Therefore I would like advice of others.

Firstly I think about changing of course. I applied for political schools and business schools. However I’m not that confident about getting one of them. Maybe some business schools but I’m not that sure. Moreover I applied for college course in economics, rights, etc... but it would require to restart from the beginning and I don’t know if I will have the motivation.

Secondly I think about stopping my studies. I’m loosing motivation everyday and I’m dreaming about being a self-made-man. Furthermore I’m exhausted to live once again with my family. Maybe I should consider a work/study program or studying in a foreign country. Nevertheless I would probably enjoy creating my own business. There are also some people who want me to become councillor of my city.

To conclude, I don’t know what to do. I’m not really confident about my future, despite everyone saying that they’re not worry about me. I think I’m a looser and I’ve never accomplish anything great. My studies are really taking an important place in my life these last years and it’s kinda stressful. I think I too much think about it and other stuffs, thus I neglect to enjoy life. Finally what are your recommendations ? Did you experience something similar ?",07Apr2019,1

318,"This post is the result of more than a decade of pent-up resentment, as well as an inability to give voice to my thoughts until recently. I apologize if it’s on the lengthy side. I’m not even sure if what I’m doing is the right thing, but it’s what I want. I’ll summarize as best I can with a TL;DR at the end, but I think the details are important in understanding why I want to disassociate myself with certain members of my family.


Growing up, I was always told that “family is the only thing that will always be there for you.” I believed that as a child, until my mother left when I was 10, and I realized things weren’t so black and white. My mother is not the subject I need advice on today, though. Because I always heard “family is all that matters,” I can’t help but feel guilty in my decision to drop contact with certain members of my family. The three I’m speaking of are my paternal grandparents, and my dad. 


When I was 17, my dad and step-mother decided they wanted to move to another state. I wasn’t willing to do this, I had too many people I cared about where I live. I was only a few months away from turning 18, so I decided to stay. When my dad, step-mother, younger sister, and younger brother moved, I stayed with my grandparents. 


The condition of my stay were that I had to have a job, and I had to go to college. No time frame was given for the duration of my stay. For a little over a year, I maintained both a job and college, paying for school directly out of pocket. I didn’t qualify for any grants, and I was unwilling to take any loans out of fear of student debt. I got fired from my job for reasons beyond my control, and I could no longer afford college, so I had to quit that too. I applied for a job everywhere that I could, but no one was hiring. 


Eventually, I was told that I had a month to pack my shit and leave. They were going to kick me out into the streets with no job, and I’ve resented them for it very much ever since. Fortunately, a friend let me move in with him, I got a job within a month, and we’ve been roommates ever since. The kicker, though, is what my grandfather said to me. I remember it verbatim:


“I know you don’t remember it, but when you moved in with us, we said you could stay for a year. It’s been a year and a half, and it’s time for you to move out.”


I didn’t know the word for it at the time, but I now realize he was gaslighting me. Even so, I knew that he was not being truthful, and that only fueled my resentment. There were also a lot of little things during my stay that were meant to control me. I was only allowed on my Xbox and the computer for an hour a day between the two devices. I was threatened with eviction if I didn’t smile more. I was called “fucking useless” because I accidentally dropped a TV we were moving to a different room. There’s more, I’m sure, but you get the idea. 


Then there’s my dad. Unlike my with grandparents, I actually kind of *want* a relationship with him. Unfortunately, we have very differing ideologies, and he tends to get very aggressive or passive-aggressive about it. I’m an atheist, and he’s become a very devout Christian since I moved out (He claimed he was agnostic when I lived with him). I don’t really care what he believes in, but he takes very great issue with my lack of beliefs. He’s said things like “It’s [his] fault [I] turned out the way [I] did,” and “[He] should’ve made [me] go to church.” Even when he was agnostic, when my step-mother found out about my atheism and threatened to leave, he made me pretend to be Christian so she would stay. 


It’s clear that I’m not the son he wanted me to be. We have extremely differing political views as well, but I don’t wish to go into detail here. No need to spark political debate in the comments. He’s very racist, xenophobic, and I suspect even homophobic. I yearn for a healthy relationship with the parent that actually stayed in my life, but I’m not sure that’s possible with such stark differences between us. I try to focus on the things we have in common, but he inevitably brings up our differences and starts another fight. I haven’t spoken to him since November because of these tendencies, after a particularly nasty political argument. 


It’s tempting to double down on my “no contact” policy regarding my dad and grandparents. The “family before anything” mentality runs deep in my family, and I would certainly be alienating myself from my two sisters and brother, the only ones I particularly care about continued relationships with. Ever since I moved out from living with my grandparents, I’ve felt a dramatic upturn in my self-confidence, and I’ve been able to grow as a person in ways I never thought possible.


I find myself in an “all or nothing” situation, and I don’t know what to do. Everyone thinks very highly of my grandparents, and I’m the only one who sees them for what they really are. My dad’s hyper-aggression is well-known, but everyone else just kind of deals with it because “family first.”


TL;DR - Manipulative, gaslighting grandparents and disappointed, disappointing father. I feel it’s in my best interests to sever ties with them completely and distance myself from their overwhelming toxicity. Doing so will almost certainly cause a rift between myself and my siblings, whom I actually care about keeping in my life. I don’t know what to do. ",07Apr2019,1
321,"Throwaway, apologies for vagueness.

I run a small business. The majority of the people I hire are independent contractors for one-off projects. They are free to work wherever/whenever they want.

In this industry, I also work as an independent contractor for a similar business in a neighboring state, often working alongside of the individuals I hire for my own projects (it's a close community). No one, including myself, is under any sort of exclusive contract with this other business (or mine). We are all technically free to work for whatever businesses we want.

I recently finished a huge project, which employed the use of a few contractors that also work for the other company in the neighboring state. However, I just learned that the contractors who work for both companies are being penalized (i.e. being pulled off of their upcoming projects/work) by the other company's owner for working with my business, and others are being threatened with similar consequences if they work with me. The owner (again, who I regularly do work for) has said nothing to me about this. I'm hearing it straight from the people being penalized.

I am not going to change how I run my business or who I hire (especially because we have little to no competition with each other, due to the distance between companies), but I also don't want people getting punished because of their association with me. My current plan is to continue running business as usual, and if a specific contractor wants to cease working for me because of the restrictions placed on them by the other company, that's between them and me, and no one else. I'm treating the situation as a non-issue until a conversation like this happens, or the owner speaks to me directly about whatever issue he has with my company.

Is there anything else I can/should do in this situation? Or do I just keep moving forward?

322,"This is extremely hard for me. During a casual conversation about a year ago with my friend she was asking about my goals in life... it's been my dream in life to join the Air Force. It means the world to me and I want to put my heart and soul into it. 
She said it's been something that she's considered just to get some structure in her life. Long story short we started working out together and were going to enlist together. 
I'm in my mid 20's and she just turned 19 so this next part is understandable. We were both supposed to go together to talk to a recruiter and without telling me (though I was waiting so we could both find a time to go) she went with her family and told me about it afterwards. 
I contacted a recruiter and because of how I answered his questions I believe he is now ignoring me completely. I believe that I am ineligible because years ago when my dad died I tried to commit suicide. Though I didn't tell my recruiter this information (yet) he is still ignoring every single attempt I make to contact him. 
As time has gone on my friend has stopped working out with me and now works out with family members and I just heard that she made a new friend to work out with. Things between us in the last week or two have been a but different. I do my best to be fake and pretend that everything is the same.
I'm not a bad friend and I dont want to be a bad friend and I know that it's not her fault that my life is this way. I dont want to feel this way and I dont want it to hurt this bad. It just sucks someone nonchalantly fulfilling the dream that I had. 

TLDR: Not her dream in life but it is mine, she's eligible and I'm likely not. She's been slowly abandoning me and cutting me out of the process of enlisting. She doesn't know that I'm probably not able to join and I know that me being mad about this all isn't her fault and it makes me a shitty friend right now. ",07Apr2019,1

327,"I know many of you are expecting a story to hear about abusive parents, well this isn't one, well maybe it is abuse I don't know I just know I can't fucking live with my parents anymore. Especially my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

Problems started when I entered highschool. Now my mom is a pretty nice woman, but very very strict and over protective. My mom always tries to help me with everything, every little damn thing. I know, you are thinking that my mom is a great parent, she is setting me up for a perfect future. Wrong. She cannot help me when I move out, she is setting me up to fail. I've tried telling her that I'm old enough and don't need her help anymore except all she does is get defensive. Usually she says something along the lines of this ""I have to help you otherwise you will fail! You will be a nobody! Is that what you want?!?"" Or ""You are so lucky I can help you, I am the most helpful parent in this neighbourhood, you should be grateful!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

So clearly trying to tell her I don't want your help doesn't work. It just pisses me off so much, how I want to be an independent man, I don't want her fucking help. And she never, ever lets me do something without her help. I don't even ask her anymore. She plans out how I study, what to review, like thanks mom I'm not fucking 7 years old let me do this myself. Because in uni, you won't be there to do shit like that for me so I am going to fail when it's important.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, its gotten to the point that whenever she tries to help me I become ungrateful, being a bit disrespect, don't say thanks, and brush her off. I was hoping she would get the message but she just gets really mad. We have bad arguments at least once a week, where she screams at me, compares me to other kids and just sometimes walks out. Just had an argument now, and she told me that I make her feel like shit, that she would rather switch places with her dying friend right now. She told me I am so rude to her that she wants to die. She walked out after saying that.

330,"For context: I'm a 22 year old male.

So i've been sort of mulling this over in my mind for the past few years. I've dabbled in it a little before, but never really committed to it.

Basically it just sort of happened. I've had 2 imaginary girlfriends before. Let me start of by saying, I'm not exactly in the best state mentally. Crippling depression, anxiety, maladaptive daydreaming, lots of isolation, social issues/anxiety, body/self confidence problems, have had issues with starving myself. Stay away from self harm for the most part, one near suicide attempt.

So first time it happened was my sophomore year of college. I was going through extreme anxiety issues. Like couldn't go to class, was always sick, starved myself because it, lot's of panic attacks in class, and basically anywhere and everywhere to the point where i'd be freaking out crying wondering what was wrong with me at 2 in the morning. There was an anime I had been watching. So there was a girl in it that I found cute. So i just sort of imagined her being real and with me. Well, i'd say she was more an imaginary friend the majority of the time rather than a girlfriend. I don't have friends, and my family are assholes, so she was all I had. She would listen to me, encourage me, and not judge me. She was what got me through that awful semester.

The 2nd time it happened was about 1 year ago. I was suicidal during this time. Similar to the first imaginary girlfriend I had, she was there for me, she made me happy, she motivated me to keep going and try to get better. I honestly believe that without her I wouldn't be alive today. It lasted about a month. I haven't had any since then.

So is it that bad that I have one, like full time? I'm so far behind socially that I can't even make friends, much less get a real girlfriend. I don't have the confidence to do most shit normal people do so I just honestly don't see how I could ever come close to having a meaningful relationship with someone.

332,"Right employed and post employed members of Reddit. I really really need advice. 

Workplace bullying. What classifies as bullying in the workplace? And what can I do about it. 

So a little backstory. I (20F) work in a supermarket. I started September 1st, last year. So I'm not working there very long. The store has been here and open for 11 years. The other woman I'm talking about in this post, we'll call her Megan, has worked in the store since it opened, 11 years ago. So she knows all the staff well, is 'pally' with management too; and also is familiar with many customers, all of whom like her. 

I work on the checkouts and the customer service desk. Megan works checkout cover, which means she gets the change for us, does voids for is, tidies the baskets and replenishes the bags etc. Basically, she is supervising checkouts and helps with any issues that arise throughout the day. However, she is not my boss. She is not any higher up than me. 

So. Megan is in her late 50's and is generally very cranky. She has her favourites but the rest of us are treated by her like we are a nuisance. The young girls in particular. I know now when I list out some examples that I'll sound petty, but please bear with me here. 

⏺️Making me look incompetent infront of customers by taking over and not letting me do my job. 

The tills are old. Sometimes they freeze and need to be rebooted. To do this, you reach down and press and hold a button until your scanner beeps. That's it.  You press a button, then wait for 4 minutes for it to restart. When this happens to me when Megan is covering, she refuses to let me do it. She'll make me move out while she goes in to do it. 

If a customer wants a price checked or I need the SEL (shelf label) and Anne sees me going to do it she'll do it and won't let me. If somebody asks me where something is and I go to find it for them, she won't let me, she'll do it. 

I have literally about 30 examples of her doing this and making me look completely incompetent infront of customers, when the task she takes from me is my job to do- not hers. 

⏺️I am literally afraid to ring my call bell for her to come and give her money to get me change. EVERY time I do, she comes sighing and rolling her eyes. She snatches the money from me and stalks off. Yes, snatches. Like a child. It is her job to do this so I know that I shouldn't feel nervous to call for it but I do next of how she treats me when she comes. 

⏺️Snarky comments like one time I had a kidney infection and my slacks wouldn't zip up. So I wore different pants that were the same colour as my slacks, and I just explained to my manager when I went in. He had no problem. I'm walking down an isle bringing something for a customer and Megan is walking behind me, I hear her say, blatantly out loud, to another colleague ""I think I'll wear my jeans tomorrow"". Like, sorry, why do you feel the need to comment like that? She definitely knew I could hear her too. 

There's actually just too much to put in here but please feel free to ask me in comments and I will answer. 

Basically, I started at 11am this morning. On Tue customer service desk. I was literally crying at the desk praying for no customers to come by 11.04. my face is the first thing people see when they walk into the store. 

I have gone to HR about Megan's behaviour before. I was basically told ""that's just how she is, don't take it personal"" and it was brushed away. That was that. I feel like I'm really stuck here and don't know what to do. I really like my job and definitely need it, but I can't keep checking the roster and dreading coming to work when she is in. I can't keep letting her be so horrible to me all the fucking time. This has been going on over 7 months now! 

I don't know should I muster up all my courage and some and pull her aside and ask her has she a problem with me, or if I should type and hand in a letter about it to HR.

The one thing which i absorbed in last few years is that corporate world sucks and I hate 9-5 jobs.(Have done few small internships).

I have seen a lot of people in other subs talking about their finances and debts and how they hate the job and work only for money, and i don't want to end up like that. But money is also an important parameter to live and  I am so confused right now. I should also take responsibility of my parents, family etc.

343,"My life is genuinely messed up. It has been for all my life. And I could rant about everything that has happened to me and why it all sucks, but one thing about me isn't even bad for myself - it's bad for everyone.

My whole life I liked to 'Stan' (be a big fan of) celebrities and youtubers. That's normal, of course. Some are incredibly inspiring and amazing. It's not until I became 13 when it all changed.

So 13, I didn't Stan a celebrity. I stanned someone I knew in real life - a teacher. He, of course, did not know. It sounds like an 'Uwu teacher crush thing' that everyone gets. I made sure I passed his classroom between lessons (changing my whole route), I'd get nervous when speaking to him. And thats fine, crushes on adult men are fine since it's probably a one off. But mine, it was different.

 I found out his social media, made alternate accounts to catfish him into letting me in his private accounts (luckily, this did not work), think about him non stop (I mean I dreaded weekends because I knew I didn't have his lesson) and I wanted attention from him so bad I'd ACT DEPRESSED around him and once self harmed and tried to get his attention. That's not normal, and I know that's heavily offensive to people who do suffer to depression (I feel sososos guilty for doing that). I was uncontrollable. 

It's not like I wasn't depressed. I wanted to kill myself if he didn't talk to me in a day. Not exaggerating. I was obsessed. My life depended on his attention and recognition.

He left, thankfully. I thought that this was a one off, that it was a sick teacher crush and 'everyone goes through it'. 

But it's starting to happen again, but to another teacher. Im refusing to act depressed around him this time or self harm and I'm trying not to become obsessed. But it physically hurts when I don't look at his Twitter. I can't stop thinking about him. I get nervous around him.

To be honest it's not really a crushy thing. Truthfully what I want is to know everything about them, to be close to them and to tell them everything about how my life is messed up. But nothing flirty or whatever, of course. Like a substitute for the shit parents I have.

345,"Hi. I live in a densely populated community and have a very consistent schedule. I also live in this weird building where the bathroom windows syncs up with my neighbour and I have an opaque shower curtain which covers the window but sometimes I open the curtain to vent steam etc. I just assume nobody looks out there because the view is literally just the window to people’s shitters and brick wall (there’s no view of sky or the sidewalk or anything). I’m starting to think somebody is watching me but I’m not sure. Mostly on the weekends like when I go do groceries and such I see this same guy outside smoking. He lives in the building that has the contiguous shitter windows and he ALWAYS either sees me coming or going and sort of looks at me funny &amp; turns to go inside. My intuition is telling something about him. Something about his body language makes me feel like he’s waiting there for me. He wears a hood and tries to turn his face away when I look at him. I see him every weekend multiple times. He could be watching me because I always have a massive joint so he might want to break in &amp; steal my stash. I’m also a buxom redhead &amp; masturbate in the bathroom (sometimes quite elaborately) and it’s possible he can see because sometimes the curtain is open. Maybe my imagination is running wild? I was stalked for like 2-3 days by some Muslim guy (I’m convinced he was a groomer) when I was a kid so I’m sensitive about this stuff. Is there anything I can do to figure out if he’s watching me and his intentions? Since I noticed him I don’t leave the curtains open anymore but I still see him. I don’t want to make any fuss because there’s a good chance I’m wrong but I also don’t want to do nothing.

Me and my brother are both 17. I personally have had a lot of partners in my life but never had sex. I don't know about my brother since we dont really talk about stuff like that. We might say to each other shit like ""damn that girl has a nice ass"" but not personal stuff. Everything started one day when me and my dad were on our way to a doc's appointment. I commented on a sign that said ""Studio 36"" outside a house (that basically means that it is a brothel). My father was very successful with women when he was young and he always asks me how things are going for me with girls. When I pointed out the sign he asked if I ever had sex. Me being a bit shy and uncomfortable I said yeah just to avoid further discussion. But then he asked if I wanted to go to one of these studios and insisted that he would pay. I said that we had to go to the doctor and then he jokingly said that I was a pussy. Today we were having a bbq and when we were grilling the sausages he again asked me about girls. I told him that I didn't have anything going for me at the moment and then he proposed an idea. To hire 2 escorts for me and my brother. I didn't know what to say and politely declined. Then he again jokingly started picking on me but it was all in good fun. Then he said that he would do it regardless of what I wanted and that if I wanted to have sex I would.

361,"I’ve always been a little bit of a control freak, but last night I realized that my problem may really be hurting my social life and me. 

Last night was my first Prom at my school.  My friends and I had made a plan to get ready at one girl’s house (we can call her Katie), go to prom, then go to an after party and sleep over at Katie’s house. Katie was supposed to drive everyone for the whole time. I like structure. I like plans.  I was happy with this idea. However, my parents are a little... controlling.  I knew I couldn’t tell them about this afterparty because they would be suspicious and keep asking me questions. I know they’re just doing it because they care but it’s so much easier to not tell them I’m going at all. I turned off my locations services on my phone and told them my gps was being weird so they wouldn’t be able to track me. 

After I had an AMAZING time at prom, we left to go back to Katie’s house so we could change out of our dresses into party clothes. When we were pulling into Katie’s driveway, she hit her brick wall on accident and shattered her front headlight. Obviously we all felt bad but we decided to go to the party anyways in one of the other girls’ car. Then, we had people texting asking if we could drop them off at their houses after the party because no one wants to be DD.  It quickly turned into a whole plan for after we left the party, it would be another ~40 minutes until we got back to Katie’s house. 

This is when my brain sort of went into hyperdrive. We were still at Katie’s, about to leave for the party and I started getting really anxious and decided that I just wanted to drive home (my car was parked at Katie’s). I had told everyone I was going to this party. I was ready to go. But there was something in me that really didn’t want to go. I don’t know where this sudden anxiety came from since I had been so excited for the party before. Thinking about it, I feel like it may have been a control thing, where I had lost my control on the situation and our plan had gone awry, therefore causing my anxiety to peak. As I was driving home, I started thinking about how if I had the choice of just driving to the party myself and being able to choose when I wanted to leave, I would have absolutely gone. However since I didn’t have a choice of what time I could leave the party and had my control and predictability of the situation taken from me, I guess my subconscious fight or flight response took over and I picked safety and comfort over a fun and exciting night. 

I’m frustrated at myself and still confused why I became so anxious at the idea of having plans change last minute. This isn’t the first time that I’ve left something because of a sudden change of plans, and I really want to become adaptable but don’t know where to start. I could really use an outside perspective on the situation. 

TL;DR After prom, my friend group’s plans changed abruptly and I got so anxious that I drove home instead of having a fun night with my friends. ",07Apr2019,4
362,"Hey, thanks for dropping by this post. 

I was debating whether to make one at all, but I figured I didn't have much to lose. The gist of it is, I seem to be going through some kind of quarterly-life crisis and can't find my feet. I always thought I had a superiority complex when I looked down on other people's happiness / contentment with life, but I realised it wasn't superiority at all - but confusion. I couldn't understand how people in my life (friends, family, fellow students etc) seemed so fulfilled with themselves and why I wasn't feeling this way. 

The last thing I want to do is sound ungrateful, because I'm blessed in so many ways - health, family, friends, financially I'm in a better position than some others (not the richest by any means) and academically I'm in a very good position (at one of the best universities for what I study) etc etc 

But I've never 'got' life, or understood my place in it. There seems to be a hole in me that I struggle to fill with the happiness other people find in things, and I constantly feel restless - itching to go and find meaning in the world. Don't get me wrong, I'm very ambitious in what I want to do in my field but it all seems like a lifetime away where I'll have a job, kids and the rest of it. I want to have these big adventures with my friends around the world, see places and do things that'll make me feel something other than a lack of fulfilment (despite being a poor student) - at the moment, I just feel like I'm not making the most of life and I'm looking for ways to change that.

Her father was a very abusive man, physically beating her and her mother until Hannah moved away, and while her mother never physically hurt her, she stood by while it was happening, and would at times say she blamed Hannah for ""being an anchor"" keeping her with her husband.  It took a toll on Hannah emotionally and mentally, and is still an issue to this day.  All that aside though, she loves her parents anyways.  She especially loves her mother, and wants to try to have a better relationship with them in the future, now that she has the distance to be able to do so safely.  On top of that, her culture is very important to her, shes Filipino, and very traditional in some ways.  Tradition in the Philippines would dictate that I ask her parents blessing.  I know her father hates me, he blames me for stealing his daughter, and has tried to assault me on multiple occasions, and her mother tolerates me, she seems to just be happy Hannah is out of the house now.  I've just received news that I've got the job I've been gunning for, and will be starting in fall.  Once I start I'll finally have the money to give her the wedding shes always wanted, and I'd like to start prepping for that now that its a real possibility; but I just don't know how to go about both respecting Hannah's desire for a relationship with her parents, and her cultural needs; while keeping her parents at a distance where they wont try to hurt her in some way.

My dog does nothing but eat, lie down, and go to the bathroom all day. He gets pets and lovies, as well as somebody in the room about 75% of the time. Our house design is weird and my dog is afraid of the floors so he can't travel into the kitchen anymore, a dogs favorite spot, nor can he go up the steps, well, he can, he did it and it surprised us, but getting him downstairs, I had to carry him awkwardly because his feet don't work right anymore.

I’ve been on my high school cross country team for the past three years. Last year, my calf started to feel like it was ripping in half, so I was out for the rest of the season. Since spring has come around, my parents encouraged me to run more to get back in shape. I decided to because I thought that it was a smart decision. I started running, and the terrible calf pains came back. It occurs during the night, and my calf burns with pain for an hour or so, waking me up and leaving me crying. It then hurts to even just walk the next day.


I looked up what I could do, and I decided that I would start running shorter distances to build my muscle strength back up first, and stretch longer before and after runs. I also would intake some form of potassium every night. I started doing this, and three days in, the pain kept coming. I decided to maybe just take a week off and try to start again next week.


My dad hasn’t liked that. He has constantly been telling me to run the past few days, and when I tell him what has been happening, he says it is just a little pain and to get over it. I don’t trust him that much though, as he has done no sports throughout his life and is quite overweight. My mom hasn’t cared that much, but my dad refuses to take me to a sports doctor for “a little ache.”


What should I do? I am a minor so I don’t think I can go on my own. Is it really just muscle pain, and I’m just making excuses? I’m getting really upset with my dad.


I don’t know what to think anymore, if anyone has advice I’d love to hear it.",07Apr2019,1

382,"I know a lot of people have very conflicting opinions on the military, but I’m genuinely considering it and am just hoping someone will have had a similar experience and can give me some guidance.. 
so I am 22 years old and I have had a fairly easy life up to this point, I have been going to university for 3 years and I am about to be a senior in college. I’m engaged to be married next year as well. I always had a very high respect for the men and women that serve our country but never really thought it was something I wanted to do until here recently. But after months of consideration I just can’t get it off my mind. At first it was for the benefits, maybe helping me out with the rest of school, healthcare, stupid discounts on stuff that doesn’t matter.  But then it turned into something I felt like I NEEDED to do. I feel like I have to serve my country. And besides getting my degree soon I really will have done nothing in my life that I’m really genuinely proud of. I think serving my country would give me that sense of pride and fulfillment I am looking for, and I feel like I would be doing it for the right reason. My only dilemma is my fiancée is also graduating the same time that I will be, but she wants to go to graduate school to become a doctor, I am extremely proud of her and her dedication to her schooling and research while working full time with people with mental health issues. So how could I possibly join the military and be shipped to who knows where in the world(which sounds extremely exciting to me, because I’m beginning to hate my small town in Kansas) and either be away from each other for 4 years or have the possibility of moving somewhere stateside and her not being able to find a school she will like/be accepted to/be able to afford, or if I get stationed over seas then that’s a whole other beast. I understand joining the military is a huge sacrifice to those who do it, yes I’m a little scared to leave my home, my family, all my friends I don’t have, but I don’t know how I can make the decision to sacrifice for someone else. She’s said she would go with me anywhere in the world, and take time off if she needs to, she’s also said we could make it work long distance... but we all know how that would work out. I don’t know Im just kind of stuck weighing my options, I feel like it’s either now or never and I really don’t want to be 60 years old and saying to myself “damn I wish I would have done that”. None of my family has ever served so that’s not a motivating factor, I don’t feel like I need to because someone told me to, I just feel like it’s what I have to do.

383,"I'm studying Criminology (in 3rd year now), and have some options for after university, but can't decide what to do. Unfortunetely, I'm terrible with decisions like this, and so I would greatly appreciate some help.

1. Get an office job working at a bank; this is where I'm doing my internship, so I can certainly get a job there. Upside is good pay and stability, downside is it might get repetitive and I don't know if I want to work for a private corporation.

2. Get a job working for the police; I've always wanted to be a police officer. Upside is that I can see myself definitely enjoying it, but the downside is that I don't know if I could psychologically handle it.

3. Go to law school to become a lawyer, most likely going into corporate law. Same upsides and downsides as the first option, except the pay would be better, but debt in the short run.

4. Join the military; majority of my ancestors were in the military, so it's definitely a family thing. Again, I'm not sure psychologically, but this is certainly something I could do to honor my family.

5. Go to law school and join the military as a lawyer. Best of both worlds, as I get a higher paying law job, but also get the positives of the military.

385,"For context: *i've always suffered from ADHD and have been really interested in the logical stuff like numbers and programming etc.*

*Sadly that's a really bad combination, i was unmedicated until i was 18, ages 16-18 i went through intermittent episodes of being an alcoholic and abusing weed (never simultaniously however) and my High school at the time sent me to a Psychotherapist to take a look at me because i was failing horribly academically.*

*He told me that i should go get checked for ADHD because he figured it would make a lot of sense if those bad habits were just me trying to live with ADHD without any help or knowledge.*

*Fast-forward i got diagnosed and he was right, i'm currently nearing my 21st birthday and am set on a dedicated Ritalin dosage, this is always where my new decline starts.*

After starting my Ritalin and finding the right dosage my mind cleared up, it was honestly like putting on glasses for the first time, i was never quite aware of how little i could see (or think in my case), i stopped all bad habits, partly due to it being a requirement for Ritalin and partly because i had no need for it anymore and instead i started learning.

I started absorbing information about everything that remotely interested me but always made me say ""There's no way i'd understand any of that"", things like self-learning AI, the brain both physiologically aswell as psychologically, i started to realize and understand SO MUCH and life was great.

The issue a few years later now is where my Ritalin is starting to feel like NZT-48 in the limitless movie, the pill that makes me able to use my brain but with the side-effect that if i'm without i'm dumb as a brick.

Whenever i'm not on Ritalin my mind feels clouded, i can't read, my focus jumps involuntarily (things it has always done but i never knew my demons) and i just can't stand it, i feel more like a flawed human being now that i have medication and i think it'd only get worse if i stopped taking Ritalin.

I feel like Ritalin over the past years has allowed me to closely observe my cognitive abilites and while i like to think i'm a pretty smart bean, if i'm honest with myself i know i'm not.

Lately i've been putting myself down more and more, i am able to distinguish exactly where my brain fails but i just can't get myself to fix it and as a result of this constant wear on my mind i've started to lose my sense of joy in life, nothing is fun anymore.

The main reason i hate myself for my short-comings is because of where i identified them to be;  
I've always wanted to be a programmer (and i am, full-time) so i pride myself in being logical and good with numbers.  
I should be decent with assigning and manipulating variables in my mind but i'm not, my cognitive abilities are lacking.

I feel like my mind is waging war on itself, people always say that the only thing the brain can't diagnose is itself, but i feel like mine did.

I know exactly what to do, where to do it, what to expect and why i'm doing it, yet i can not.

It's making me feel like i'm fighting an uphill battle constantly and frankly i've been reasoning myself into suicide lately.

On ritalin:

* Too little working memory / short term memory
* Too slow retaining memories, facts, concepts

without ritalin, it's the same as above but adding these on top:

* Inability to read 2 consecutive sentences
* Cloudy judgement
* Impulsive and irrational behaviour
* Uncontrollable thoughts

403,"  

I recently broke up with the ''huge love'' of the last school years and the first years at university. We were together for 3 years, with a pause of 6 months in-between (she broke up then, now it was me). There were times when I really thought that she is the love of my life (I feel like this even now sometimes). The reason I broke up was because I was very unsure about my relationship for the last 2 months and I couldn't handle it anymore. Also, in the last 2-3 months we were arguing a lot and we didn't really discuss, we just confronted each other. Basically, in the last 6 months or so we created small problems that weren't solved, because someone would apologize and the other one, because of endless love, would accept it and hug him, without the issue really having been solved. I love her from the bottom of my heart and of course I would really like to keep in touch with her but you know how these things work. Now I feel like I can't handle it because sometimes she sends me messages and I want her to respect my decision but on the other side I can understand her. When we talk, what I do is not telling her things like that I miss her or that I love her because I don't want to give her hope so that she can move, as I don't know how long it will take me to clear things in my head up, instead of always telling her the truth.

408,"TL;DR this is going to be long so sorry in advance but basically my mom lashed out at me all the time and I’m always the bad guy

So since I can remember my mom has been an alcoholic she didn’t drink before 4 but she’d drink like every night until she was wasted. When I turned 12 I had a hard time in middle school and was easily irritable so I’d talk back and sometimes yell. Anyways this has been happening for a long time we just don’t seem to get along. My dad was abusive to he and didn’t want anything to do with us kids and when he did he was pretty mean. But fast forward to Thursday, I told my mom that I didn’t want  to got to prom with the kid who asked me so she started texting saying that I am mean and horrible and that I am bully and that I shouldn’t go up to her for advice anymore because I turned down a kid that I had never spoken to before for prom. I say ok and tell her that I’m not going to go with just anyone and I don’t want to lead this guy on. And yeah after I came back I walked in the door she was drunk and was glaring at me I asked what’s wrong and she said you are just a bully I don’t want you around anymore you’re just mean and abusive so I go into my and try to ignore but then she starts playing her music loud and I need to study for my test the next day and so I go out there and turn it down because if I would have asked her to turn it down she would have laughed. After that she gives me like a death glare and turns it back up so I go out there again and turn it down. She goes crazy and starts pulling my hair and throws me into the chair and starts slapping hand hitting me. I don’t cry or scream or anything so I just laugh because I don’t want to give her the satisfaction. Anyways I’m about to go into my room but then she starts saying how nobody likes me that I’m just like my father who was abusive and that I’m evil and stuff so I yell a stupid insult back at her and run into my room. I know I shouldn’t be insulting her but but she just kind of pushed me that far. So the next day she acts like she is mad at me the next morning so I go to school and she picks me up so I can go and see my therapist (which Idk if I need one but it’s kind nice having someone listen to me for once) she starts talking about my grads and how she’s going to pay for this really expensive photographer and I let her go on and on about even though I expressed disinterest last summer and she told me she would never do anything for me again if I didn’t get them taken. So she’s going on and on and finally we get there and I go to the therapist who I just kind of start talking to her about how my moms drinking is bothering me so that goes on for an hour. And I get out and she doesn’t say anything I’m kind of frustrated so maybe I have an odd look on my face but finally we get into the car and I ask her what is wrong and she says talking bad about me to your therapist again? Then she says you have a guilty look on your face. So I said I didn’t say anything mean about just about some stuff that is frustrating me and she says I’ve had enough of you, you need to live with your dad and I’m kind of like dumbfounded because I don’t even know what I did. And so she starts saying all you do is make this house chaotic and all you do is cause problems. And so she goes on and on about how stressful her life is and how horrible it is.

Meanwhile my mom is crying and screaming and all this other stuff because I called her a horrible mother (everything is always about her all the time and she complains every-time she does something for us and has no problem starting fights with her daughter but I do regret insulting because it does make stuff worse) anyways she tells me to pack up and to get ready to be picked up because I am staying with my dad. She calls my dads mom and tells her that she needs me to live somewhere else and that that I’m horrible my dads mom says that she thinks I’m wonderful. But before I get picked up I tell her how much the drinking bothers me and my grandma starts laughing and saying that I have no place in saying that since I’m so young.

Backstory/important details:

We’ve been best friends for 3 years. When I met her she did very poorly in school, so I helped her with math and English primarily. And she got way better which was awesome, I’m so happy for her. Now we’re about at the same level in different subjects though. I’ll still beat her in English but she’ll beat me in history for example. We’re both very stubborn.

We’ve paired up with this other girl at school who we both really like and are currently getting to know better. Bff and I haven’t always gotten along super well in groups. And I guess, we aren’t getting along super well in this one either. Now I need advice on what to do.

Her face can annoy the actual living crap out of me. I’ll give 2 examples.

1. We were in math class. Third group member asked for help with a problem, which I thought I had somewhat understood. Turns out they had misunderstood the problem so I started explaining (just to her) what I thought was right. Bff interrupted me several times just straight up saying I was wrong and why. Taking her comments into consideration and constantly being cut off eventually got me so confused that I snapped: “FINE, I just won’t HELP then!” In the end I was right and was the only one to solve the problem. But she just looks and talks to me as if I’m stupid and frankly I don’t think she even knows it.

2. We had a meeting with her our principal. She has a brain bleed at some point and her face ended up slightly disfigured. After the meeting I told my bff “dang she’s kinda intimidating looking huh?” And she immediately looks at me like: wow you’re just saying that cuz of her brain bleed you fucking (stupid) bully.

When in reality I meant her position of power, the look in her eyes, how her hair was done in this messy kind of crazy way and the way she talked. Literally didn’t even notice her damn face. It just pissed me off so much cuz she does this a lot. I make one comment about someone and I’m a bully, a racist etc. I don’t even think like that. I don’t think that far.

What do I do? She’s my best friend and I love her. She’s my person, and I’m hers. Sometimes she doesn’t answer her phone for days and it’s annoying but I get over it. But the face she makes and the way she talks? I just can’t. ",07Apr2019,1

My dad has been there for me all my life . He always took care of us and was successful in his career . He liked to binge drink every once in a while but it didn’t interfere with anything and he was highly functioning.

Things were great for a while , until recently , when he found out he had a scary health problem that will problem end up killing him in the next decade (I hope that’s not the case but that’s what will probably happen due to the diagnosis) 

He was prescribed meds for another unrelated condition, and he has been abusing them . He sends me odd messages and says things that are innapropiate at times . It’s kind of how he acted when he would drink .

On top of that a lot of other personal shit has been going on with him including a few deaths in the family . I want to help him but he is the type to get very angry if I were to bring something like this up .

411,"looking for specifically australian advice to do with car insurance. 
so last monday i was parking my car on the way to the doctors and accidentally scratched this girl’s car. i took full responsibility and she was there and we exchanged details and took photos. we discussed over text that we would proceed through a cash in hand job because the damage was only cosmetic and it wasn’t a deep scratch. she got a quote and said it was $500-$600 but she didn’t get it written down. (i found this off because she new everything to do in the case of an accident but she didn’t think to get me a written quote). and then she said the amount was $600 including a rental car, which i had no qualms about paying for the rental car. but what tripped me out was my uncle is a mechanic and he saw the damage and said it was no more than $200-300. but i did not dispute her and then i got legal advice saying because i don’t have any income and assets i could organise a payment plan with her. i suggested this to her and it made her very unhappy and she said she would instead go through insurance. 

and i have been doing my research and i am trying to figure out what outcomes this would have for me.
the first being that i get hit with $600 for being under 21 (i’m 18, she’s 24), $500 bc i haven’t had my full lisence for two years and maybe $400 for repair costs and maybe $500 for her excess which could be up to $2000. 

or because her excess is likely to be $500 and if she said the repair and the rental car is $600 (so it’s likely that the repair cost is $500 or less) will she still be able to put the claim through?  ",07Apr2019,1

So first of some background, i used to be a super bubbly, and flamboyant guy. Straight, but just a very expressive and social guy. I tried to be nice and generous to everyone, had a sea of patience for anything or anyone, a bit of an ego problem but other than that I was a pretty well rounded person.  Then in high school it started to hit me, then after I tripped on acid a few times after high school, did some other dumb shit, and fast forward to now.

I have zero patience for anyone, all my old and new friends besides one of them, and my girlfriend annoy the shit out of me. Same with my family. I can barely last 10m when I'm hanging out with people and I catch myself having really really dark thoughts about doing things that I feel i would've been horrified by in the past that im pretty okay and unsurprised by in a weird way now, although I do realize that they're new. I've gotten super antisocial because everyone around is after me or something I have and my friends have just turned into a bunch of liars. My egos almost all gone, cause I've just kinda realized and accepted the fact that I'm above most people. My mindset is just better, I'm smart, and I'm far from lazy.

I guess to wrap up I've lost almost all my feelings besides annoyance, hate, and lust. As for love I'm crazy about my gf and I'd never hurt her, I'm sure I love her but she annoys me too. I just wish I could control everything and every variable so I could make people better and more fun to be around. Has anyone else experience this? What do?

- Made my bank account with her name on it (she had to because I was 17 at the time) so the insurance company had a place to send my settlement. I turned 18 and received the settlement, but have no access to the money. She had taken out over 90% of the money and put it into her own account. 

- She has spent at least $200 on ""essential oils"" alone. 

- She has only spent my money for the past 2 weeks because she hasn't gotten her check 

- She will argue and scream if I every try to leave the house without her permission 

- She has taken my phone multiple times (she can't take the one I just bought though, I paid for it)

- She somehow thinks she's ""saving me"" by holding my money hostage and not allowing me to look for a job, pay for my healthcare, etc

422,"I've been with my boyfriend for about 3 years now and one of the issues we've had has been lying. I guess the big three lies so far have been usage of marijuana, success at university, and now what I think is using a Juul. For a bit of background, I can be pretty uptight about all of these things. Towards the beginning of our relationship I was very opposed to the use of marijuana, but over the course of time I've become more open minded about it and it no longer bothers me. However, the fact that he lied about it for the longest time is still a sore spot for me. I just don't like to be lied to. Who does? Well, cutting forward to a week or so ago I found what I now realize was one of those Juul things laying around our apartment. He was with me when I found it and immediately told me that it belonged to his friend. Hes admitted to using this friend's nicotine vape on occasion, which I've already expressed my displeasure about. Back at the beginning of our relationship he was very anti-smoking (cigarettes obviously, not weed) and it was a point we really agreed on. It's pretty nice being with someone with the same values as you, especially since we both want to get married and have children someday. Anyways, he claimed he needed to return the vape to said friend still. Since this incident I can say with reasonable certainty that he hasn't seen this friend again. I definitely think he would mention if he saw him. They're best friends and he has a pretty busy schedule, so when they hang out he tells me in advance so I know I shouldn't expect him to be home. Well, on a whim today I looked where I found the Juul the first time. Gone. Now I have a feeling he's been lying about using this nicotine vape a lot more than ""occasionally with the boys"". I'm pretty upset about this right now. I've told him so many times not to lie to me and I thought he understood but it doesn't seem that way. When I found out about him smoking pot we went through a pretty rough patch and I'd rather not have that happen again. At the same time, I'd love to launch him to Pluto with a million juul pods where I dont have to deal with these lies. 

I guess the advice I'm looking for here is whether I'm blowing this way way out of proportion. On top of that, how should I confront him about this? Like I said, I'd rather this didnt blow a crater in our relationship but I'm worried that this is only incident 3 of many many more.",07Apr2019,1

They were also very controlling and would punish for arguing. So I learned to hold my tongue and be silent.  I was also forced to apologize even when they were in the wrong because I was a kid and obviously always wrong.

437,"Hi guys,

I’m currently a student but I don’t enjoy what I’m doing and I’m seriously thinking about ending my studies.

Before I was a brilliant student : I managed to learn reading by myself, I skipped 7th grade, I graduated from high school easily. Thus I integrated one of the toughest formation in my country. It’s called a preparatory class and it was fucking hard and horrible. I got a school at the end but for some reasons I finally went to the university in physics-maths. I clearly don’t like what I’m doing so I decided to look at other options but I’m not really confident about them. Maybe I’ll get one or I should restart my studies, however I now seriously consider another option. I was already open-minded before but all these experiences gave me less prejudice and I would probably consider stopping my studies.

What are the reasons that push me to think about this option ?

Firstly I’m clearly disgusted by studies. I don’t know if it’s what I do in particular or studies in general, but I’ve always found stupid my country’s scholar system like many friends. Most of them even went to foreign countries because of it.

I also don’t enjoy the student life. I didn’t have a real student life these last 2 years because I worked a lot. Nevertheless, from what I see and what people tell me, I feel so disconnected to people of my age. I can fake but I don’t feel comfortable. I feel like most of them are focused on learning stupidly from bad teachers, going in parties and have no projects.

Secondly, I don’t know what I want to do. Everybody is saying to me « you should already know » but I think this speech is so weird. Unless you’re really bad in all the other domains, I can’t see how you can know what you want to do (and most adults admit it to me too). I like to many things, I’m passionated by too many stuff and, even in a company focused on a particular topics, there are so much different jobs.

Because of all of this, you can thus deduce that it’s difficult for me to find the motivation. It’s really exhausting and my difficult formation just increased that feeling of being unable to be successful in studies. My motivation is like a roller coaster and it depressed me so much sometimes.

I also like freedom, being independent. Living once again with my family is really horrible and it’s just another pain in the ass.

Furthermore if I start working now, maybe it could help me to find my true calling and it will motivate me to finish my studies.

To conclude, I think about a lot of stuff and I’ve always dreamed of being a self-made-man. I also have the opportunity to become a city councillor next year if I play well. I can do a lot of things but I don’t know what to do. Therefore I want advice from others but I don’t really trust my parents or my friends. My friends don’t have the experience and only care about their own life. Concerning my parents, I followed them a lot of time despite warning them and I regret it. They’re not here for me when I need them and I don’t trust them.

Thus what are your opinions ? Do you have some experience to share ? Would like to read that and thanks in advance for your answers",07Apr2019,1

441,"Hi everyone. 

24 girl here who has never had sex. I actually haven’t had my first kiss either, but we’ll get to that in a second. 

Basically, despite people telling me all my life that I’m attractive, no one ever seemed attracted to me. I’m 24 and haven’t been kissed. It takes a toll on you emotionally knowing that no one wanted to kiss you enough to do it. 

That brings us to present day. A coworker of mine (roughly 30 years older than me and unmarried) has displayed interest in me. And by displaying interest, I mean that he has clearly said that he wants to be as close as possible to me intimately and wants nothing more than to have sex with me.

We have been friends (hang out after work, share secrets, talk for 8 hours at a time after work) for about a year. So hearing his desires weren’t shocking or disgusting to me because he’s one of my best friends. We say “I love you” and act like a married couple but we haven’t kissed. Our coworkers don’t know that we’re as close as we are, but they know that there is something going on. It’s also worth mentioning that we both work at one of the largest Christian companies in the West, so there are a few reasons why we’re trying to keep things on the down-low. 

It’s been a few months of us discussing sex in (serious) depth. He is a Christian, as am I, however he sees absolutely no problem with us having sex. He finds it to be an honor if we were to do it because he would be taking my virginity. His argument is that “we all lie so often so we’re already sinning constantly.” He also said that sinning doesn’t make us go to hell. As long as you’re saved and trust Christ as your Savior, you’re set. 

Lastly, he loves me. He sees a future with me even though I’m 30 years younger. I don’t love him romantically. I love him as a person and best friend. He knows this. 

This is what I’m wrestling with. Because of this, I think about sex ALL THE TIME. I desperately, desperately want it with everything in me. Does he have valid points? Is this somewhat true what he’s saying?

PLEASE. Anyone with any insight or opinion or past experiences, I BEG OF YOU to please share. I’m so desperate for guidance. Thank you SO much. ",07Apr2019,0

443,"So me and my sister have a few years between us and my brother is a few years older than her. In my family I’m the baby and have sometimes been favoured (I can honestly admit unfairly favoured) by my parents because I was the baby and was quite smart like my brother. My sister isn’t extremely academically talented (not to say she’s dumb she just doesn’t excel like my brother did). Black parents have no chill so my mom would comment on the fact she’s not extremely intelligent and say she at least tries. My dad and my sister would get on okay. Me and my brother get on very very well. My sister has always been a very stubborn bossy person. When we used to share a room she’d throw my clothes on the floor and she’d say I couldn’t listen to certain music or wasn’t allowed to sing (I’m not amazing at singing but I really enjoy it and because I’m a dancer I like to sing and dance) just because she could sing better than me so she could be the only singer. But when I had a talent (like dancing or painting) she had to do it too. Obviously here this wasn’t a major issue because this is just how kids are. 

But as we got older we still didn’t get on. She remained the same selfish person. It got a lot worse when she was a pre teen and she became quite large and my parents and my brother put a lot of pressure on her to lose weight because we were all quite chubby kids but she’d all our weight apart from her. This is when her nasty personality came out a lot and her and my mom really grew apart. 

My mom became mentally not all together and it has caused a lot of tension in our family. My mom used to do everything in the household she was a SUPER mom (still is , love you mom) but she doesn’t really do anything anymore. This was when I was 13. My brother was in his final year of university, my sister was doing her alevels and my dad had to go to work a lot because my mom stopped working because of her illness so I had to take over the housework and had to cook for everyone and such. This honestly started to depress me because nobody helped at all and I understand alevels are stressful but as an older sister and brother you shouldn’t feel comfortable with making your younger sibling of 13 cook and clean for everyone.

So my sister went off to uni and everything became so shit because that same year my brother moved out 150 miles away so I had to literally do everything by myself and deal with my moms illness on my own. And my sister didn’t really feel anyway about it. Even now she will say it’s nit that bad. I don’t blame my brother because before me and my sister were born my parents had a lot of issues and would fight like they do now and it probably triggers a lot of memories for him but my sister never dealt with that so I don’t understand how she can be so purposely be so dismissive to my feelings. I became so depressed and self harmed but whatever (I’m cool now lol)

In the middle of university she took a gap year. In university she had now became much meaner and she started doing this thing where aside from not helping out with housework or anything she won’t share any cutlery or plates or cups with anyone. She keeps a private stash of hers. She’s honestly so disrespectful to my dad. She says things like “can I eat this or has dad contaminated it” “I don’t want to touch the remote dad touched it” and I can’t even imagine what she says about me if that’s her parents and she says all that lol. And she argues with my mom all the time , knowing that she’s ill and that My mom can’t physically help the way she acts. We once had a huge argument because I tried to address how horrible she was to me when we were growing up , for a while I was able to ignore it but it got triggered because my brother invited me to visit him and go the theatre as a present for doing well in my exams and she started bullying me because I didn’t invite her. She got an expensive laptop for doing well in her exams so she already got her present so why did she need to share mine. So I told her straight everything and how I felt and it only made things worse. But eventually I just got tired of the bullying so I just apologised even though I 10000% still stand by everything I said.

She went back to her final year of uni and we started to speak a lot more and get on. We bonded over me teaching her how to do makeup and we finally had something in common that she didn’t try to police or take from me. 

Now real time. She came back this year and she’s still doing the same shit. For atleast 4 months she wasn’t working but I started working part time. She did absolutely nothing yet I still made sure I cooked before I left the house cleaned everything I would come back at almost midnight and I would still be sorting out the house when I came back. She still doesn’t touch anything anyone else uses only used her own cutlery and stuff but she doesn’t have an issue with eating the food I’ve cooked because she’s lazy and has no other issue although she’ll make sure to cut her food so it hasn’t touched anybody elses as if she’s disgusted in us. It’s just so arrogant. I’ve ignored this for a while but then I realised how can I joke around and be lovey with someone that doesn’t respect me as a family member and views me as disgusting and talks about her family members like that and treats us like that. I’m on a gap year and I’m studying from home and I still go to work and sometimes I work full time hours and yet I still have to do everything in the house. She still is selfish and inconsiderate. And so I suddenly stopped talking to her like a family member and just paid her the same respect as I would pay anybody else in this world. And then she came to me calling me a bitch saying why did god give me such a sister and all this and all that calling me selfish. So I just explained everything to her and she still refuses to understand so she started bullying me again. Naturally she really scares me because whenever she does this it triggers memories of when we younger and she’d do the same thing and I’d feel so powerless so I don’t bother go into a room when she’s in it. I just stick to my room unless I have to go downstairs.  She still has no problem benefiting from my labour but still acts so above everyone else. I am honestly not going to speak to her when I move out. She was saying to my brother that she is going to move out and my brother asked her why and she said because I hate these people. When literally we don’t do anything to her. She doesn’t do anything in the house. She’s 20 something living rent free without doing any chores.

So if you got through all of that, am I wrong for firstly being offended in the way she acts and thinking she is disgusted in us. Because she still expects me to check her bum when she thinks she has something wrong with her yet she gags at the thought of drinking from a glass someone has touched.

Do i have to keep trying? 

Should I just not speak to her at all?

What should I do. Because I don’t like confronting her at all I would honestly feel fine not talking to her for as long as I live.",07Apr2019,1
444,"I'm 20 and she is 22. We dated for 2 years and prior to that we were best friends for 3 years. I thought a lot about the relationship and it's ok. I don't really feel hurt anymore thinking about the kissing and time we spent together while being a couple. But the friendship before kills me.

We got to know each other when I was 15. We were both in a clinic for people with mental health problems. I remember when she slept over at my place the first time. I was so shy and unexperienced, when she fell asleep on my bed I didn't know what to do. I tried to sleep on the floor first, but it was too uncomfortable so I laid down on the bed with her. But I felt like I would be harassing her if I would have just lied down besides her so I chose to sleep the other way around. Her feet in my face, and my feet in her face. I still have to laugh when I think about how stupid that was and how she looked when she woke up, and then I remember that we will never have this again. Never. Or one time when I was at the central station. I didn't really expect to see anybody I know, but especially not her, since she lived in another city. And then she suddenly gets out of the bus before me. I ran to her and hugged her and she was so happy to see me. And then I remember the day on which she broke up with me and how there was only coldness in her eyes. Whenever we didn't have contact for a while fate led us to meet each other again, but not this time.

I know how to deal with the memories of the relationship, but I don't know how to deal with the memories of our friendship.

So I showed the evidence to my mom and then my brother and both didn't believed, even if it was his voice saying how he wasn't dating my brother anymore and how he wanted to be with her.
After that I felt that I lost my family, that I was alone and that he won this fight, I felt back into depression, I only have my bf so I don't wanna annoy him all the time about this issue.
Two days ago it was my bday, I had to invite them all and I had to act all nice when I didn't wanted to. 
My brother always treated me like a piece of shit*t, that I wanted to destroy his happiness, my mom called me by all names and said that wasn't true and that my brother in law was a nice guy that he would never do that. I cried a whole week about it. I'm trying to decide if I should just cut them out of my life or keep talking and just get over it and accept that my family loves more him than me.
This morning my brother text me that his mother in law wanted to buy me some clothes (if I needed them) because she is going to a country where stuffs are more cheep. I felt so bad because that woman is nice to me even if we don't have direct contact. I feel so bad, because my mom treated me really bad, even in my bday, and this woman is so sweet but she is his mother, and I don't wanna have to do anything with that family, I don't accept my brother in law, I hate him but they all are trying so hard to be nice to me and I'm alone and depressed and I don't know what to do.
I tried to talk with my family and nothing happened. So, I can't do it again.

•Mom: Obviously, I was failing school. When she confronted me I told her about my depression and she said ""how dare you try to make this into that? Do you even know what it is to be depressed?"" Then went on. Called be a rebel (I am). I lost all respect for her. 

•Mom/Brother: Had me live in the ""refurbished"" garage where only the electricity worked, sometimes, during one of our worst winters with a record of -40 windchill. I got frostbite in bed and I still have the scars. 

•Dad: I know he used to but I'm not sure if he still does, but would traffic little girls in the hood. Would drive while drinking with me in the car and take me to the house they used to ""spend time"" while him and my uncle would talk nasty shit. I was like eight.

448,"TL;DR at the bottom. Myself: 23, male. Her: 23, female.

I've been seeing a girl on and off throughout the semester. When we first did anything, she and I had a project together. It was an all-day affair, so when she and I were waiting for the second half of classes to begin (about 5 hours), we just hung out in a few different coffee bars and restaurants. It functioned like a date, but I wouldn't call it one.

We met almost every other week to work on the project, but slowly began doing other thing s together too. We saw a Chinese orchestral concert together, and after we finished the project, she 'bit' when I said ""It's too bad we won't be hanging out and working on this project anymore."" And suggested we make plans to meet next (this past) weekend.

Just this Thursday evening, she and I went to a film showing for environmentalist movements. That's twice our 'dates' were essentially just looking frontwards at a staged performance. We talked, but not much about ourselves. I suggested we do something more ""talky"" next time, and she agreed. That's this week.

That's where the difficulty comes in. She's aloof, but not in an impersonal way. I'm worried that she's confused by the fact that I haven't made a move outside of making plans with her. Neither of us are super-into technology, so outside of class and our 'hang-outs,' we don't talk/text.

In short, this girl is somewhat aloof, but not impersonal. She may even be responding to my own slight quietness (caused by the confusion of 'where she and I stand)-- it's possible we're both confused about where we stand. Maybe she's waiting on me to make a move. I'm having trouble differentiating her 'cool as a cucumber' attitude vs. the possibility of her only wanting to be friends with me. We've 'hung-out' about three times (never called them dates), but we see each other twice a week. Once during class on Monday, and always once over the weekend. How might I go about finding out her feelings without putting her on the spot? The last thing I want is to make her feel uncomfortable by asking a question like that without putting myself out there too. ",07Apr2019,1

Last year my mother died of cancer. She had mostly raised me and my little sister (16) by her self. We have a father, but he has just recently started to take part in our lives. Our mother left us a house with mortgage and a car. We are currently in the process of selling the house. The money from that will cover the mortagage on both the house and the car, and leave my sister and I with a good size of money. The plan is that I (19) will be moving from my home country to Scotland.  Were I got accepted in to my dream university. My sister will move in with our Aunt and her husband (I will keep a lot of my stuff there, and stay there during holidays). 


The problem is that we have three cats. We really love them, especially my little sister. Before my mother died I got the impression that my Aunt would allow them to live with her(for sometime) but yesterday she said she wouldn’t. Because she is not a big cat person, and absolutely hate hairs. I really understand this, and feel so much guilt already about having to get so much help from her. I feel so grateful that she takes care of us like this, even tho she doesn’t need to. 

I don’t know what to do with the cats. 
I can’t take them with me, my aunt doesn’t want them, and my sister has no other place to say. Having to give them away would devastate my sister, and she is already having such a hard time after our mother died. 
My mother had a friend, witch we adpted two of the cats from, and my mother mentioned that she could take them for a while. But my mother was heavily drugged at the end, and I don’t know how true this is. I could send her a message and ask, but i am not sure if it’s the right thing to do. I am kinda lost on other options. 
I am considering just applying to a school near were i live, renting an apartment and raising my sister myself. But that sounds crazy, and i am pretty sure my aunt would not allow it. But I feel so responsible for my sister, this last year I have been the person mostly raising her, and it would kill me if she became more sad, or had a harder time than she is now.

Today stands as a good example as to what I've been putting up with. We received a 911 call and I went through the steps verifying that we had no officers available to go. Per policy, I should advise the supervising office that a call is holding. As I called his number over the radio, the supervisor assigned himself to the call (they all have the ability to do so as they have the operating system linked to ours in their car units), so when he replied for me to go ahead with my dispatch, I gave him all the information regarding the call he just pulled - as anyone would do per policy. My trainer for the day, instead of asking if a. I assigned the supervisor on the call or b. Why I assigned him the call, immediately began yelling that we don't assign supervisors and I should have only advised him instead. My reply, ""He assigned himself, so I gave him the call notes."" A few minutes later, my supervisor pulls me aside and coaches me for ""defending yourself instead of stopping to think about it and take constructive criticism."" My thoughts? Constructively criticize your trainers to not automatically assume trainees are in the wrong every time something unusual happens. I don't take well to being told I did something wrong when I didn't, and I will stand up for myself. I'm never rude, just give the correct information. I'm not going to sit there and be yelled at for not doing anything wrong.

I haven’t said anything to her about how I feel in fear of ruining our relationship at work. I love my job and plan on staying there for at least a couple years while I finish school. I know this girl plans on going away for college which is also why I haven’t said anything because I don’t know what I’d do if she left while we were together. It wouldn’t be too far away but still, that would suck ass.

It’s also hard for me to tell if she has any kinds of feelings towards me, but I think she does, unless she’s just being friendly because we work together.

I really want to talk to her outside of work but don’t know how to tell her this. I can’t stop thinking about her. She honestly makes me love my job even more and when I see we aren’t working together one day, my heart drops.

I have her phone number, but she didn’t give it to me. I never asked for it. It’s a whole other story, but to keep it short, when she was being hired my boss needed me to text him her number since he left her resume at our work. Now I have her number in a text that I sent. I almost called her or texted her and was going to explain how I got her number and was going to see if she was free today but decided to wait because I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or be seen as a creep who randomly has her number.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I really want to express my feelings towards her and talk to her more, but I also don’t want to ruin things at work and with our friendship. Has anyone had to deal with something like this before? Anyone have any suggestions for me? I’ve been told to not date coworkers but damn, I can’t seem to get over this.

Sorry, this is going to be a wall of text, so if you don’t want to read a long story, you might want to skip this one.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 17, and he is 18, both seniors in high school. We’ve been dating for a little over two and a half years and I’ve known him for a little over three years. Although this is my first relationship, I think it’s a very good one. We’re each other’s best friends and I can honestly say that I’ve never been anywhere near this close to anyone else in my life, with him feeling the same way. We’ve had some disagreements, but I’ve never actually argued with him, and we generally get along very well. I also think he’s a good influence on me, he’s encouraged me to try new things and go outside a lot more, and he persuaded me to seek treatment for depression. I realize that people change during college and that there’s no guarantee that this will last, but I also know that many couples actually get married after dating for 2-3 years, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to consider him in my future plans.

&amp;#x200B;

For my actual college decision, I have a variety of options, and they all feel like compromises to me. For some background, I currently plan to major in science, do a lot of research, and enter a PhD program. Here are my options: 

&amp;#x200B;

I got into a highly competitive university that is basically everything I want in a school. Great program and I liked the environment there. However, we don’t qualify for financial aid, so I’ll end up paying near full price. My parents can afford it are willing to help me pay if I really want to go, but won’t help me with grad school expenses and don’t think this school is worth the high cost of attending since it’s just my undergrad. If I could get fully funded in a PhD program after, it would be a great option, but I’m not sure how easy that is to accomplish.

&amp;#x200B;

I also got into a state school. This school is less than half the cost of the prestigious one and also has a great program for my interests, but I don’t like the atmosphere there. It’s widely known as a party school and is extremely large. I’ve also heard it’s difficult to get into classes you want, so I’m worried I might not be able to take everything I want or have good research opportunities in my undergrad. Both of my parents want me to go here.

&amp;#x200B;

I also got into the school my boyfriend is attending. It seems like somewhere I’d fit in, and cost-wise, it’s more expensive than the state school, but nothing extravagant. Although I would still have a lot of great research opportunities here and I’d be able to do everything I’d wanted to, they are not as widely known or ranked as highly as the other universities I’m looking at. If I go here I might not be as prepared for grad school and might miss out on more prestigious opportunities in the future. The thing is, I’m not sure if I do genuinely care about prestige or if it’s just everyone around me who’s conditioned me to want that and expect me to go for it. Also, I might like the school environment partially because I know my boyfriend is going there. Even though I tried to evaluate it for what it offers, it’s definitely possible my assessment is biased.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I feel like I’d be the happiest if I went to school with my boyfriend, since I’d still get the opportunities I wanted and would be able to stay with him, but I’m not sure if that’s the best option for me, thinking ahead. My parents said they’ll support me in whatever I decide, but all of my options feel like compromises and I’m not sure how to move forward.

463,"I know this is a super opinionated and subjective topic but I’m just really confused and could use some advice from various perspectives. Long story short, I grew up extremely Christian, lost my faith after questioning my beliefs and having horrible experiences (parental abuse, feeling abandoned when I was at my worse by God), became an Atheist as a teenager, and now, as a 17 year old, I’m questioning that. I’m having so many weird feelings and doubts. I’m like the least religious person so know, and I literally prayed out loud yesterday for the first time in like 5 years and I cried. I asked God for help and to show me if he was there. I don’t really know how to do this kind of thing anymore, so I could be praying wrong or seeking the wrong answers. I’m a pretty rational person, so I don’t know if all these feelings and doubts are just psychology and I’m being dumb, or if there really is something there. I read the bible for 3 hours yesterday and something just felt right. Or maybe strange. I’m not sure.  Maybe it was bad. 

My boyfriend is Catholic and he’s super supportive and not pushy whatsoever, and he is setting up a meeting to talk with a priest (my idea). I thought it may help and I could get some closure for me, or maybe have some kind of spiritual awakening. 

Again, I know this is super strange, but please be kind and don’t judge me. I’d like to know what your advice would be, and maybe what perspective/religious background you’re coming from.  If maybe you’ve experienced something similar, I’d like to hear your story or how you dealt with it. Thank you all so much. (: ",07Apr2019,1

465,Hello everyone! I need some advice so near my house a F45 opened up and they were doing a promotion where you can do the 6 week challenge for 600$ and if you lose 25 pounds or 5% body's fat. They told me they were giving me a meal plan and were going to give me protein shakes. So I decided to do it because I wanted to lose weight I'm 20 year olds and weigh 170 5'8 thought I would be able to lose it and do this I am a college student and I didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to afford this meal plan and they never gave me protein shakes or anything. I kind of got weird vibes from the place too tbh from the woman owner. I am struggling with losing any of the weight if anyone has any advice? Or if there's anyway I could somehow just get my money back I'm a college student and I know I'm stupid for putting it in I thought it would be easier.

467,"He’s 23, I’ve noticed that he’s been drinking a lot more lately and has been more secretive when I visit him at his apartment, he tells me to stay out of certain cabinets in the kitchen and steers me away from his room if I walk to close to it. I went over to his apartment the other day and he was drunk, he started yelling at me and threw things, so I left him alone to calm down. I tried to talk to him later to express my concerns and he snapped at me to mind my own business. He’s always been a very kind, open person, so this sudden personality shift is concerning and I feel like it’s the drinking that’s doing it. I don’t know how often he’s drinking exactly, I just know he’s been at the bar a lot more and he seems to always smell like alcohol or is tipsy. It’s a small town, so a lot of people we know go to the bar to hang out, one of my friends told me that she saw him sitting alone last week, he wasn’t getting anything to eat or socializing, he was just ordering drinks for a couple hours. She said he left and drove himself home after that (she did try to stop him, he was apparently drunk and stumbling by the time he stood up to leave) and that I should talk to him before he hurts himself or someone else. That was actually what I’d meant to talk to him about when he snapped at me.

 I should mention that he has suffered from depression in the past and he’d tried to self-medicate then too, but I was able to intervene because he was in high school at the time. I’m just worried he may be depressed again and is too proud to get real help.

 I’ve already talked to his mother and she said to leave him alone and let him figure it out because he’s an adult now, but she’s always been less sympathetic and tends not to be concerned, she was like this when he was suffering from depression too.

471,"So, I dont know where to start.

I finished my degrees got a job etc., 25 atm, crazy family, never had a gf, never kissed, starting to be an alcoholic. Family is living abroad (Norway and Germany), Im living in Croatia and Im all alone in this country (this is our home country, Im the only one left). 

So I was friends with this girl for a couple of years. We were in touch on a daily basis, mostly via wapp and similar apps. Last year I started developing feelings for her and she rejected me. I went to Norway to my family for a couple of weeks and we didnt speak to eachother for that time period. After I got back I tried to fix things and try to at least stay friends. Also I was in a shitty situation regarding my living conditions, place that I was staying at the time was an absolute shithole.

She had an apartment that was for rent. I asked her politely if she was willing ti rent it out to me. She said yes but she asked the price that she knew I couldnt pay (and was waaay above market price). A couple of weeks go by and she sends me a text if I was willing to rent the place for a third of the initial asking price... Due to my situation I said yes and moved into that said apartment.

When I moved in I was kinda hoping that at least we'll be friends again and at least see eachother a couple of times per month like we used to. Long story short, a month ago she admitted to me that she was just pretending that we were good all this time. She said this after she came back from a holiday with her bf (a month holiday to be exact). 

I feel used and fooled cause I've been paying the rent all these months and now it seems like I will be moving soon. Should I make the first move and leave the apartment or wait for her or someone from her family to ask me to leave? It would be way easier if I wasnt renting from someone I know. Also, the last conversation we had wasnt pleasant and both me and her said some rude stuff to eachother.

Also, her family broke the deal - they were entering the apartment without my knowledge on a couple of occasions but I let it slip..",07Apr2019,1

I was kinda sad and decided hang out with friends because i assumed she didn’t like me or something, and they got me high to cheer me up, i should also note this was my first time getting high and it was really strong stuff. The next day i wake up and the high is still going on, in fact it lasted all day. Well i was talking with i friend that day  and i think he said that she flaked on me because she thought i already had a girlfriend. Now at first this confused me and i was wondering if i heard this correctly. I didn’t get a chance to ask him about it because we were interrupted and i had forgot about it for the rest of the evening. Now that i had some time to think about it, i think i know were this rumor came from. There is another acquaintance that we sometimes hang around that is also in a gym class with me. A week or two ago he kept pestering me about which girls in the class i would rather fuck, and it was getting rather annoying so to shut him up i said i was already dating someone and i wasn’t comfortable talking about it (big mistake i know).

473,"Hi I'm 19yo guy (gonna turn 20 this july) , I belong to a poor family and i'm the last kid . Last year when Intermediate College ended I applied for University but I ended up getting less marks in the entrance exam So as a last resort I had to get admission in A literature University nearby my house which is basically an Education (teaching/literature) University but they had an I.T department. I wanted to do CS but I.T was the closest option to it so I got admitted there. However soon after getting admitted I realized that the study here wasn't that great , some teachers were not professionals and didn't know their subjects at all. I thought this might change in the next semester but the condition is pretty much same or you could say worse now. Almost daily lectures are missed because of absent professors and even when they're present they don't help that much. In short I don't feel like i'm being taught anything worthy here . But the advantages here are that it's pretty cheap so my family can easily support it. I have a job as a home tutor , it doesn't pay much but I can earn my pocket money easily for the month. My life is pretty Chill here. The environment here is pretty Ok , I have a few friends here but have a hard time adjusting because kids here are mostly from poor villages etc and our interests don't match. 

Sometimes I really don't want to study here , The only reason I go here is because it's easily affordable , close to home and I've fallen in love with a girl here (This may seem irrelevent but I thought I should mention it) but when I look at my financial Condition I feel as if there isn't a better choice for me . The Univeristy I actually wanted to get into is at a good distance from my home , almost costs double fee per semester but Is a well known University and teaching is pretty good there and it's graduates are pretty set from what I've heard. I could reapply this year and i'm positive to some extent that I could do good on the test this year and get into that University. But the main problem for me seems to be the financial Issues . My family has some money saved which means I could pay my dues for 4 , 5 semesters only If I get another home tutor Job I might be able to pay the dues for that University without much problem. I want to get into that University because It offers me a better future and I really feel no use studying here as there isn't anything useful being taught here.

Ever since my Childhood i've seen poverty in life and I really want to get a better life. For that The University I want to get into seems a good way to change my life as it has a better reputation and it's graduates seem to find jobs easily. But it is expensive and will cause financial problems for me . If I find another home tution job financial issues can be lessened. Getting into this University Could prove to be really helpful for my future.

The only mental challenge for me is that i'm having difficulty making that decision of changing universities . Here i'm comfortable , the commute is only like 5-10 minutes , easily affordable , Environment is ok and I actually love someone here ( again irrelevent but might as well say it). Most people say that programming is something that you can learn on your own and don't need a degree for that and college doesn't really help in programming. From what I've heard it's not difficult finding jobs even with a not so famous degree if you have a good grip on programming. But I really have no actual experience of how companies hire out there and if having a famous Degree matters or not in programming. Either way I don't want to hang my future on chance.

The other University is expensive , far from home and getting admitted there will cause financial issue for me. But . It will help me get a better future and can help me get out of my miserable poor state of life . So what should I do? Should I change University next year? should I stay here despite the bad study but comfortable financial condition here ? Should I even worry about what university teaches if programming is something you can learn online better than any university but what will be my job security if my degree isn't that worthy? What should I do , i'm pretty double minded as both the thoughts of staying here and changing University seem to haunt me on daily basis but both seem reasonable choice for me to make as one offers financial and daily comfort while other promises a better future? What would you suggest I do? I really seem to find both the situations equally important but don't know what to do. Any kind of help will be Highly Appreciated!",07Apr2019,1
475,"One of my social media accounts was accessed last week and everybody on my friends list was asked to transfer the fraud a large sum of money because I was ""in an emergency"". It took me an hour to get into it and change my credentials &amp; then delete the account (I almost lost the account outright, the biometric pass on my phone saved me in the end as it was the last unchanged credential).

This was extremely humiliating and reputation damaging but I already had a borderline panic attack about that. I found out later that my friend was defrauded massively and sent a large amount of money to the impersonator -- so that's even worse. Lots of other people believed it was me but did not make a transfer.

I've had a couple of days to reflect on this and I'm wanting advice. On one front: is there anything I can or should do to help them? Secondly, I found this mentally taxing, especially reading the chat where my relationship with my friend was exploited to defraud her, and I've had a constant level of anxiety since. Is there a good way to deal with the pain of identity theft of this sort? As well as the guilt I feel. 

I'll say, as a postscript, that if your FB account is breached, somebody can do immense damage and there's very little support to disable an account quickly to mitigate against this. And if anyone's on the fence re deleting their account: not deleting mine is an immense regret I now bear.

477,"Hello everyone! I’m terribly sorry if this is not the appropriate place or way to ask something like this, and it it’s not, I would appreciate some pointers to where to ask.

I’ve been contacted by an art magazine that works mainly on Instagram. It seems legit enough and it is offering a spot in a coming physical issue. My main concern is that part of the means to appear in the issue is paying a rather large sum of money, at least for me, and I’m having trouble deciding if that is a fair deal or not.
I suspect that if everyone featured on the magazine pays for that sum, it would effectively pay the manufacturing costs of producing the book and then they would profit of many people’s art without giving much in return, basically “for exposure”.

Anyway, I’d hope you guys could give me some advice if I should take this deal or not. Thanks in advance!

The issue is that summer is approaching, I'm going back home, he'll be moving quite a distance away for a new job, and then I'll be traveling abroad in the fall.

I don’t know if I can mask the smell or if there is a way to stop the smell.

Also, the same group of friends I talk to are too honest sometimes. I’m grateful for them telling me some things so I can change them, but sometimes when they’re honest they exaggerate a ton. Then they all start laughing. It makes me really nervous because it might be true but because I can’t smell and have low self esteem, I never know. Also, there are two sounds that drive me insane. Loud whistling with no tune, and GOD DAMN SNIFFLING! One of them does both and as soon as I tell her to stop she does it louder and everyone starts to join in.

**Hello, Reddit.**

**This is a throwaway account.**

So, my issue is that in the past (When i was between 6-14 years old), I did things I am now incredibly ashamed of.

For instance, at my birthday me and some of my friends had a sleepover, and I and another guy jerked off (Not each other!) and the rest of the guys who where there know it (obviously) now. Well to make it short - I did some slightly gay things in the past - but more to ""explore"".

My problem is - some people know about these things - and right now, my life is really good. I have a lot of friends, school is good, everything is perfect. But it is driving me crazy (especially at night), that someone will tell everybody what I have done and my friends etc will leave me because of it (I am not gay at all. This is why it bothers me a lot - because it is PAST).

Not only that, but the stranger lives 3 hours away from me based on their snap map.
      It's possible that one of my friends was trying to set me up with someone but they seem maybe 5+ years older than me(I'm 16) so that is unlikely. Plus none of my friends have fessed up to this.
     Should I just unadd them and move on, or be patient and see what happens?",07Apr2019,1

490,"This is just a long, difficult situation to explain, at least in full context, but I don't know who else to talk to about this. Here we go:

I'm a senior in high school and I've never (or at least not in years) had a good existence as a social creature. Now I don't want to mislead, I'm no outcast or anyone that has been widely bullied or disliked or whatnot. Generally, I get along well with my classmates and peers, most people generally like me and I've got some good friends.

I have had (undiagnosed but it's fairly obvious) a pretty bad experience with social anxiety. Maybe not so severe as others but it's hindered my teenage years and I'm only recently forcing myself out of it. 

Starting in middle school I got this weird idea of separation between my school peers and close friends (neighborhood crew). I considered my neighborhood crew my real, close friends and my school friends just that, school friends. I always had this ridiculous notion that my school friends would be easy to move on from past high school and that my ""real"" friends would stick with me throughout life. And so, I never really ""hung out"" with my school friends. Not for most of our early years of friendship.

Part of it was probably this weird anxiety that I still have about interacting with the families of friends. I don't understand why, but I always feel like the parents of friends think I'm some freak or weird bad influence or something and essentially just don't want me being friends with their kids. Similar for siblings but more on a peer level. 

Fast forward to sophomore year and I'd hung out with the school friends on a few isolated occasions (each with their own anxious waves and my stupid brain trying to get me out of there in any way possible) and the neighborhood crew wasn't really together anymore. We were still ""friends"" but not like we used to be. We weren't attached at the hip the same way anymore and eventually we only really talked when we came across each other or in random isolated events.

At this point, the slow realization of my mistakes had dawned on me. I had never felt as alone as I did that year; I really had no friends. And so I tried, incredibly hard, to get past the anxiety and really bond with my friends; try to actually be a friend.

I should make it clear I always liked and cared about these people. I just had this stupid notion that I should try to stay detached because I'd go off to college and leave all of them behind. This was at the point where I just hated school and my peers and couldn't wait to grow up and leave the world I knew behind.

It was still difficult to do. I decided to try and enjoy my school experience for the first time and I really did change a lot. I got along much better with my peers; I actually really enjoyed their company now and could consider them as school friends, too. And for my actual friends, as we slowly encompassed more of us into the group (and post-receiving my driver's license) we began to spend a lot more time together and I really love them all. 

Then came senior year. So far I've participated more in school culture and events than ever before. I've got real friends that I cherish. I still make blunders with the anxiety (sub-consciously put-off an invitation to an event and it may be too late to say I'll go, have to double-check) and I'm overall more confident now.

But that's just it. College is around the corner. 5 months away. Graduation is only 2 months off. I was still excited and happy about college earlier in the year, but now, with the actual thing coming up so close, it's getting worse. At a bonfire a few weeks ago with my friends, we were talking about how it'd be weird, so many people we wouldn't see every day or maybe even ever again.  And it just hit me: I'm not ready to go.

I've never been happier in school than I am now. I've never wanted to just spend as much time with my friends as possible as I do now and I just...I can't see myself being happy anywhere else anymore. My friends expressed similar feelings, except they're still excited- they're ready to branch out, meet new people and find a new group.

I'm just not. I know I will make new friends. I'll probably love them too. I just don't want to leave. Some of my friends are currently touring a school they're likely to go to, and the thought of them loving it, being off there together, so far away, just hurts. 

I'll probably be around them on breaks, but just the thought of us not being together, not being the most important people in each other's lives anymore...I just don't know what to do.

Tl;dr- I'm just not ready to leave my friends and start a new life in college, and I really don't know what to do.",07Apr2019,1

Fairly common, I often run into people who 1) feel really uncomfortable if I disagree with them even over small things and try to change my mind 2) always have to have the last word 3) don't handle criticism well 4) will twist my or their own words so they're never ""wrong"".

493,"I have been “talking” to a guy since November now. We’ve been friends for three years and we also felt a connection but for those three years I was dating someone else. Last October, my, now ex, boyfriend and I had issues so we called it off. That’s how I ended up talking to this guy. Well call him Able. Able and I decided not to “hold each other back”. Meaning if the other person wanted to talk to others it was ok. My thought was what we would inform each other if such thing happened. For the past 5 months I haven’t talked to any other guy or done anything with any other guy because I didn’t feel the need to and I really like able. Last night I became suspicious of able being with other people. So I asked him: “You would tell me if you were seeing someone else right?” And he responded “yes, but I am not seeing anyone else”. 

I started venting about how I felt insecure and so and at some point that I get quiet he tells me that he did during winter break which was in December/January because he didn’t know where we were going. 

I am hurt and disappointed but I feel like I can’t be. I don’t know what to do with this relationship. I don’t want us to date yet because I don’t want to rush anything and I feel like we both aren’t ready for it. I also don’t want to end things completely because he is my best friend and has been for the past couple years and throwing it all away would truly damage me.

494,"So I have this friend, we're really close, like sister close, but recently she's just been a bitch. Lying to me, ignoring me and just being awful. It's gotten to the point where my anxiety is acting up real bad and I'm in constant worry she hates me and is only using me at this point. She's been flat out ignoring me even when I'm in her house or at school. Last week she stayed home from school, the whole week. She must be sick right? Nope. She was sick monday/Tuesday, but the rest of the week she was fine, stayed home to watch Merlin. I found this very unfair because she always expects me to be at school even when I'm sick, there's plenty of times she's been in a huff or just a bitch to me because I was sick and legit couldn't go to school. And now to yesterday, I had to go to town so I asked her if she wanted to come with and to bring her brother so we could all hang out. We went. She was fine mostly until the end when she started to obviously get bored of me and just started ignoring me. Then when we got home again she started making excuses to not hang out with me the rest of the day and they changed. First it was ""we gotta clean the house"" then it was ""movie night"" then it was ""game night"". I know these were lies because they never vlean the house on a Saturday unless it's just small chores, game night is always Friday night and they don't have movie nights anymore unless it's a special occasion or a film they all want to see in the cinema. Also regarding game night, I was meant to go to game night but she's been lying to me and said it's ""only a family thing"" yet our other friend has been going and she's been lying to me about it (I know when she lies). Now the the thing that's pissed me off today. I asked her to come over and she said no, why? Because she's watching Merlin. After I paid for half her shit yesterday and everything she doesn't even bother to come up to mines today after spending the whole week watching merlin. I'm willing to end our friendship over this and be petty because it's really annoying. ",07Apr2019,1

When I was 10 years old, I went on the elevator with a stranger. I am a boy and he was a man. At first he asked normal questions, but then it got weird. Not the questions. He held me as if hugging, and started doing squats while hugging me. He did that until his floor reached. He tried to invite me in, begging for my approval, yet I softly said no. And kept saying no. He stared at me in fright until the elevator door closed. He was shaking right now. I could see it in him, but so was I. I was terrified. As I reached my floor. I quickly ran to our apartment and rung the bell. The man stood frozen looking at me from behind, he did nothing but stand. I quickly entered. And as soon as my mom found me, she saw me frightened. I quickly confessed. I never thought twice about how stupid the situation may be. But my mom told me that he was sexually harassing me without my knowledge of it. I was a kid at the time, I didn’t know much. But mu mom said he was rubbing his dick at my back for his own sexual pleasure.

I am currently 22 and I had a difficult time growing up the only true friend I have had who has always been there for me is my Mother. Without her I'd be a broken man. 

I was bullied alot during school and was shy and I struggled to make friends I was always picked last in P.E and people who are thought were my friends would snigger about mebehind my back.

I also had and still do issues with my Father my mom remarried years ago thank god and she threw him out when I was 5 after he had an affair. He used to smack me for no apparent reason I was a good kid and whenever I went to see him as a child when he would come to pick me up I was always frightened or nervous. 

I can remember one day he said to me when he pulled up outside a house he was staying at that if I didn't get out the car quick enough he would smack me. 

Even now he thinks I'm some kind of pushover and an idiot due to the learning difficulties I had during school.

I have not contacted him now since last November as he gave me a mouthful of abuse and assumed to know everything about me which pissed me off.

Aswell at times I get lonely haven't had a girlfriend yet every girl I have met has in some way treated me like shit or I've been ghosted and it has affected my self confidence dramaticly to the point where I have met nice girls that I have pushed away before they have a chance to leave me as I'm afraid of getting hurt again. I have tried using Reddit to meet people and it hasn't work out as intended.

My flatmate ordered me the Shane plush from Stardew Valley last year over http://www.sanshee.com and we've waited now for several months for it to get shipped to germany. Unfortunately, my flatmate was away when the mailmen tried to deliver it (again, we waited months to get it) and since I didn't have any papers or his ID card here we couldn't get the plush in time so that it was transported back to Sanshee into the US.

We've wrote to their customer service and the first and only response was on the 5th of February. No info from them how we could get it again or anything at all. 

Following the tracking number they send us, we see that the package arrived again at their location and that was on the 25th of March. Still no answer from them.

515,"I'm going to start this post off by saying I know I'm wrong here and I wish I had better control of myself.

So I have this ex boyfriend, we dated on and off for 4 or 5 years. He was mentally abusive a little bit and I was always jealous and insecure. He lied to me a lot, about both big and little things, so that didn't help. For some reason I could never get over him though. I always loved him, even though our relationship was so unstable and borderline abusive. He also drank a lot, so I drank a lot too. I ended up in the mental hospital after a few horrible fights and I tried to hang myself in a hotel room. About 2 days after I got out, he kicked me out of the apartment we were living in together. I only had a backpack. I stayed in airbnb's for a little while, until I moved in with my parents. That wasn't ideal for me though. 

Unfortunately even after all this, we would still talk and see each other. We wouldn't speak for a few months, then one of us would cave and text the other and start it all up again. The last I spoke to him was in November, but I hadn't seen for a long time before that. So I haven't talked to him in about 4 or 5 months, and honestly I was so proud of that. I didn't think about him. But 2 nights ago I got drunk alone and depressed so I texted him. He was so sweet and happy and supportive of me. Telling me he loves me, how amazing I am, how beautiful I am, etc. So we facetimed and sent a few pics to each other.

He texted me all day yesterday. I finally unblocked him on Facebook. I actually was looking at an old pic of a pet and saw his comment, so I clicked on his profile last night. Again, I was drunk. I'm off weekends so I usually go a little nuts. It said he was in a relationship. I texted him ""you're in a relationship?"" And I went to look at his page again but I was blocked. So I went batshit crazy trying to text and call him. My jealousy is absolutely insane, and I turn into a different person. I had nightmares about it all night.

I woke up thinking about nothing else. I didn't get a chance to even see what she looked like. So I made a throwaway Facebook to find her. She's actually really pretty, which hurts like hell. I screenshotted our conversation and pictures and messaged them to her, without even thinking. I just wanted to ruin him. I know it's my fault for expecting anything else from him. He was always a shady piece of shit. She didn't reply and blocked me.

He hasn't replied to anything so I blocked his number. I feel absolutely insane and so low right now. I know I should have just left it alone. I know I shouldn't have talked to him in the first place. Now I can't think of anything else and I am sick to my stomach. 

I have never met anyone who is as jealous as I am, and even after medication and therapy, I have never found a way to control myself when I go off the deep end like that.

I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow, but if anyone has anything to say that could help just a little, please. I'm feeling like I want to die.

524,"I've been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend for a little over 1 year. Recently, however, I've not been feeling so sure about things. I'll create a list to make things easier to read:

\-I've noticed that he has been getting really clingy. Whenever I'm at home, he is always wanting to video call, even if I'm doing something. For example, if I'm in the middle of cooking something, he will insist on calling me in the middle of it. If I'm home and don't let him know, he will get upset with me.

\-He gets upset with me if he doesn't know my entire schedule. If I'm going to work on a project for school with a friend while he's at work, he'll get mad if I don't tell him. If he's going to hang out with people, however, he rarely tells me. He constantly has to know my schedule, but I rarely know his. I have to specifically ask him to send me even just his work schedule so that I know what times he's not going to be able to talk, and even then, I have to ask multiple times. He expects me to send him my schedule without prompting, but I have to ask multiple times to even get his work schedule. When I was working on the project with my friend, he actually texted my mom and told her that 

\-He almost always deletes the messages from when we fight. It's gotten to the point to where I will start stressing out if a friend of mine deletes any messages that they send. It makes me feel as though I'm going crazy.

\-When we fight, he constantly changes his reasoning for being angry. A few nights ago I missed a ton of calls from him (at 10:30pm) because I was helping my mom. She got knee surgery last week and fell going up the stairs. I stayed in her room and talked to her for a while and only saw all the missed calls when I got back, but he was already asleep. When I woke up the next morning to him accusing me of ignoring his texts, even though I was asleep, and said I was taking forever to respond. When I woke up, I was responding within seconds, then said that I was taking forever and it was annoying him. He then said he was annoyed because he was freaking out the previous night and I wasn't there, then accused me of trying to turn it into a fight. Then he got pissed when I didn't say ""I love you"" back. After a bit more back and forth, he said that he tried to be civil and that I was being a b\*tch. When I called him out on what he did, he said he was angry that morning when I woke up because I didn't tell him the full story. I'd told him after I woke up that I didn't answer his calls because I wasn't near my phone because I was helping my mom, who fell. The part I didn't tell him was that her knee started swelling up to look like there was an extra soft ball on it and that she couldn't breathe because of the pain. He was pretty much saying that he was mad at me because I didn't include the details of my mom's fall.

\-He get's upset with me if I take more than a few minutes to respond to his texts, especially if I'm doing other things.

\-Yesterday he got mad at me for not paying attention to him. He and I were texting and I was eating and playing a game with friends. He suddenly got upset and said he was going to go. When I asked why, he said ""Because I need attention rn and your not being attentive which tells me basically you don't care that much."" I apologized, to which he said ""I've literally kept (messaging app) open this entire time while talking to you."" I apologized again and he said, ""Just be more damn attentive, don't brush me off to the side.""

\-I can't really talk or call with other friends while he's still awake. I have a group of friends and one of the people in the group lives overseas, so the time zone makes it hard to voice chat. Whenever I'm home, he's always wanting to call and gets upset if I try to do something else, such as call with other people instead of him or leave the call to watch Netflix. I typically have to wait until he's asleep to do other things.

\-If my schedule gets busy, I'm suddenly ""never around"" and just leaving him to be bored on his own. He will also start saying that I'm never there for him. Even if he's the one with the busy schedule, I'm apparently never around to talk.

\-My friends, who get to hear my relationship drama, say that a lot of the things he says and does aren't good. They say I shouldn't stay with him because the way he treats me is wrong.

\-He always expects me to bounce back from arguments in a heartbeat. I'm a person who values my solitude and takes time to cool off from arguments. When I get in a fight, I always prefer to be alone after and think through my emotions, but he expects me to recover and be all lovey-dovey right after an apology. I've told him that I can't do this, but he still expects it and gets upset when I tell him that I need some time to think thing through.

I realize that there's a lot of things that I could be doing better and that a lot of it is probably my fault, but I don't really know what I'm doing in this anymore. I know that these posts can't give the entire backstory, but I tried to include the most recent stuff. I don't feel like I can talk to him about any of this because he will probably get upset and start holding things against me, for example the amount of money he's spent of gifts that I've specifically asked him not to get me. I literally practically beg him not to get me anything because I'm not super materialistic and I don't want to be spoiled, yet he does it anyways.

Anyways, is my relationship toxic? Am I just being too blind? It has me feeling kinda like sh\*t and I find myself not really wanting to talk to him as much anymore...",07Apr2019,1

I’ve heard it more times than there are days in this week.

I’ve attempted discussion on this before but the “I am so sorry” apology occurs then we return to the routine. I don’t hate my father due to this, otherwise, he’s actually pretty good.

538,"So has the title states, I technically started going to this church's youth group actually in 2013 when I was around 17/18. I went there with a boyfriend at the time I'll call Timothy. It had a really odd vibe to it. I have been a Christian all my life but I was used to laidback churches. Timothy's church was very, very conservative and actually got onto us when we were holding hands in church. They called it massive PDA somehow and I got turned off. Decided to make excuses not to join Timothy anymore at youth group. Anyway, Timothy and I break up in 2016, but we start being friendly again around mid-2018. We're still on good terms, but never getting back together.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, one of Timothy's male friends from church actually invites me back to join their young adult ministry and for a while I was actually enjoying it. I got the feeling the church was tight knit and they weren't acting so squeamish around coupes for sure. I made some other new female friends in the young adult class and all seemed to be going smoothly - until a few weeks ago...

&amp;#x200B;

For the last few weeks I've been super busy with work and feeling generally tired and groggy, so I skipped out on Sundays and Wednesdays. Each time I've missed, the women I knew from YA ministry that were texting me, asking where I was and what I was doing. I found the questioning odd, but I told them I was busy/sick. Then between 3-4 of the women start insisting that I Facetime them if I'm going to miss church so I don't miss any lessons. I ignored this because I thought it was super weird.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for at least 2 weeks, they keep texting me all throughout the day, when I'm at work or at school, they're constantly asking what I'm doing. I must get asked twenty times a day things like, ""So where are you? Are you at \[name of university\]? Are you at the library? Are you at home? Let me know where you are."" What really creeped me out was yesterday, I did not reply to 3 of the girls' messages asking if I was coming to church and if I'd sit with them. I got on Facebook and minutes later I got another text - this time from the YA ministry leader. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey \[my name\] just wanted to see what was up. The group and I are noticing you are being distant and when we are reaching out to you, we can see you are on social media a lot lately. Please know we are here for you and you don't need to shut yourself out. Come out to \[woman's\] house tonight and sit with us, let us know what's going on.""

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like things are getting super, super invasive and on top of that, all of the women in the YA ministry are questioning me over and over about Timothy. They want to know what Timothy is doing, how his job is going, blah, blah, blah. The thing is I've noticed at this church is that it is very sex-segregated. Women and mens bible studies never overlap and I don't know if this is intentional, but even unmarried people don't typically mix and sit together on Sundays. And there have been times when YA ministry people have called me to actually ask where Timothy is. I explain to them that he and I aren't even that close anymore and no i don't keep tabs on him 24/7....

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to ask my mom for some advice because I trust her the most, but she thinks that I'm just not used to being apart of a church but that's wrong because I have been raised in a Baptist church most of my life, and people in my parent's church never acted like this as far as I can tell. I'm somewhat of a timid person and while I really liked the friends I was making in YA ministry, I feel like things are getting weird and I don't know the right way to bring up their behavior. 

I'm bringing this up now because they have even gone as far as to say things like ""We will start picking you up on Sunday mornings to ensure you can come worship with us, no excuses."" So, are they just being socially inept or should I try and put a stop to it?

I (25F) guess this is kind of broad, but I was wondering how people get out of a slump. I'm 25 years old and just feel really isolated and depressed.

I fucking hate my condition and would give anything to be a ""normal"" person. I have difficulties socializing (especially with the opposite sex, not that I have many avenues for that IRL), I can't hold down a job, I can't drive, and have a hard time doing things that a neurotypical person can do effortlessly.

I haven't seen her since I was about 8 (18 now) and I'm sure her and the rest of my family down there, (Aunt, Uncle, and two older cousins of mine) wanna see me and show me around. I've never had anything against them but I don't like to talk about myself very much and obviously they'll ask me loads of questions.

550,"I'm 19(M) and have lost a lot of motivation to work out. I think it stems from the fact that I'm slightly addicted to my phone, and that I have prioritized work, and video games over the gym. I was really into working out, I started 5 years ago, worked my way to benching 395 lbs all the while not looking like a gross monster, and this is kind of what the only thing I was known for at my school. I got called meathead a lot, and people would always bring up my bench. It didn't really bother me and I'm not gonna act like I didn't like the attention, but being known as guy who benches big and guy who has funny twitter gets really old. I really want to get back into the gym, my life was a lot more fun back then, I love to look big and feel strong, and I want it back. I go through my day thinking this, and then I actually go to the gym. 

At the gym, I'm constantly on my phone, walking around, and am too lazy to do exercises that aren't the normal, easier workouts. I still work out, I look fine, but I'm just not pushing myself. 

Some factors I think may be in the way:

* I am addicted to being on my phone
* I tell myself that I don't mind being small
* I have a problem of wanting to change but not doing anything about it in the long run
* I have some bad stints of anxiety, and my head is clouded at the gym sometimes
* I have a bad FIFA addiction. I constantly want to add to my team, it's quite disgusting
* I tore a few tendons in my knee in early January, and am still in rehab (can't play soccer/run)
* I took some supplements that may have messed my mental state up. I'm currently off them, but it was a natural testosterone booster, and it really made a difference at the age of 17/18. Not a smart move I know.
* My gym is kind of sus. Not too many people I like, and not too many hot girls (big factor)

557,"Hey,

Sorry if this post is long but you need to know the full story before everything else:

So, everything began 5 years ago when I was in love with this girl, let's call her Julia. 
Julia was a girl in my class which was very nice, was very beautiful, so a lot of boys (including me) were into her.
So I did some cringey shit like writing notes to her which said some stupid shit like ""Guess who I am"" and ""I am your secret admirer"", (I was pretty young)
And she found out, and I was like nope, it was wayy to cringey for me to even talk to her. 
But then came 8th grade, note that I am in a country where this is the last grade of ""elementary"" school, after which you go to high school, so this was my last grade with my classmates, and I was like fuck it she is still cool I'm going to be friends with her, also note there is another character, my best friend, let's call him Paco, Paco was like the alpha, but I wasnt antisocial, I was just the funny guy in class, so he is best friends with her and has been into her since forever, but she said she didn't want a boyfriend till highschool, but he tried, and failed 2 times. Okay so me and Julia are pretty okay, and now a teacher is making a new sitting arrangement (or however you ca it) and wow, she made me sit with her, and she wasn't upset, so, from then on we became better friends every day, and near the end of the grade, we were best friends, so we talk about everything and everything, I even knew her family. 
But then the grade ended, and me and Paco are still friends and go the same highschool together, but me and Julia aren't talking that much, but we still do sometimes, but one day, I see Paco in the toilet whilst on break and he told me that he was going to ask her out, and I was super happy, and later I found that she said yes and that they are dating.
Now, for some fucking reason I stopped talking to Julia, I'm really unsure why, but whenever I would see her with Paco, she would ALWAYS try to talk with me but I low-key ignored her, but not on purpose, but we are still good, a few months pass and Paco tells me they have broken up, I was shocked, and we went to coffee, and I jokingly put up a story on IG saying ""support for our fallen trooper"" and SENT IT TO HER, she then (rightfully) attacked me, but I just said you guys just patch it up. Now, jump to a few months back from today, and we haven't spoken a word, I haven't seen her anywhere, I don't talk to any of her friends, radio silence. But then, I remember her while I was laying in bed and I just fucking feel this sadness because I messed up our relationship, but then I sent her a message on IG like hey Julia long time no talk, and she was like yeah, and I asked why aren't we talking anymore, and she sent me a reply like ""I don't know, I'm not responsible for that"", and I asked who was, but she said ""Hmm, I don't know"", after which she seened my message, a few weeks ago she saw my dad with my dog and my dad asked aren't we still good, to which she said the same thing that she told me, and now, I really wanna patch things up, I still love her (as a friend) and want her back in my life.

560,"Hello. So, I (20)have known this girl(21) from Uni for around a year and we have become friends. We have a lot of things in common and have bonded really well. However, in recent months she has been flirting with me and making some advances that make me really uncomfortable. I am a gay guy and I have been in a relationship with a man for five years, but, because I live in an homophobic country, I am closeted to most people and only some close friends know about my sexuality. Obviously, her advances have made me really uneasy because I am just not attracted to her and I won’t ever be.

This morning she texted me an extremely long message confessing her feelings for me, with parts of the message being extremely emotionally forward and intense. She told me how I am “what she has been looking for not only in a man but also in a person”, how “she doesn’t only like me but she loves me” , how “she can’t see herself loving anyone else in the same way that she loves me right moe” and how  “she would give everything and anything for me to feel the same for her”

The entire thing was a big “Yikes” for me and left me lost for words. She then started calling me repeatedly, forcing me to turn off my phone. I can’t avoid it though, I’ll have to see her tomorrow for class and the remaining days until the semester is over, and then probably around the school. 

I don’t want to tell her that I am gay because, again, I live in a homophobic country. Something similar also happened before and, when I told that girl about my sexuality, she reacted in a very defensive manner and kept telling me how I had to “try it with a girl” to see if I was actually gay, forcing me to block her.

I know for a fact that I won’t accept her emotions but I also want her to stop from flirting with me. Keep in mind that at times she has overstepped her boundaries and I have told her to stop because she is making me uncomfortable. She had stopped and apologised but then takes little to no time to do it again. I have a feeling that if I reject her by simply telling her that I am not interested, she will keep insisting. 

On the other hand I don’t want to hurt her. If her emotions are as intense as she describes, then I will end up hurting her anyway, but I don’t want to cause her too much pain. 

What do I do? Should I be direct? Should I give it time? Should I wait for her to realise on her own that I am not interested?

564,"This is mostly to vent, but also to ask for advice on how to handle this.

We've been living under this guy, I'll call him Dick, for about a year and a half, and for about the past eight months, he's been throwing actual feces (I can't identify if it's his or an animal's) and used needles on our steps.  We live in a garden unit, so all he has to do is step outside and toss gross shit over the side and it lands right on our steps.

He hates us because he has a victim complex and thinks we're racist because we called the cops on him once for breaking our other neighbor's windows.

My question here is what can I do to handle this?  I've already told our landlady multiple times, who, if she doesn't ignore me, makes weird excuses like ""Maybe it's someone throwing it over the fence.""

We live in a gated plot, so no one else could be doing this.

It happened again today.  There's some kind of large jewelry box filled with crap that was tossed right outside our door.  Supposedly he's being kicked out, so he just comes back for mail and God knows what else, but every time he's here, there's a new surprise on our porch.  The cops don't care, and apparently neither does our landlady.  I don't know when he'll be gone, but I also pay to park my car here, and I'm worried he's going to do some finishing touch by smashing my windshield or something before he's gone for good.

568,"Tl;dr Don’t want to live at home during law school, but I don’t know if it’s worth the financial  investment. Any advice is appreciated. :) 

Throwaway account so I can share all my business.

I am almost certain I am going to law school in my state next year, just have to submit my deposit.

Where I live now is almost an hour commute, but my parents are currently looking to buy property in that part of the state.

I know that commuting would allow me to save more money, but i’d like to be more social in law school, cut out any potential stressors from commuting, and I would like to have more independence and control over my personal life.

I have minimal undergrad debt- i’m talking maybe $10,000 and then whatever the interest will add on. 

I’m looking at outside scholarship sources, but with my current offer I will owe roughly 42,000 in loans from law school alone. It will probably be a little more if I take some money out for living expenses.

Graduate or off campus housing will cost me about $15,000 a year. So I would go from owing about 42,000 to about 87,000. 

I dormed my freshman year and commuted the other three of undergrad.

I’m very responsible and i’ve always been a very focused student, so I don’t think commuting or living off campus will affect my studies. I clean my own space and do my own laundry, etc.. Typically I meal prep for the week and eat out when I don’t and sometimes I get free food if someone buys dinner for the house or cooks.

I’m pretty busy now and am out from morning to late at night, but there’s still a lot I don’t do out of respect for my parents. I know I will probably be even busier (somehow) during 1L, but I still have that urge to move out on my own.

My personal life has definitely taken a hit with commuting and i’ve missed out on a lot of experiences. It’s difficult to maintain friendships and I usually don’t bother dating. In my mind I was going to wait to actively date and put more effort in once I move out and had my own place.

 My parents are more old fashioned and I’d like to have the flexibility of maybe using dating apps (as much as I hate them) to find someone. For example, my dad acted crazy the last time I dated someone.. he’s super overprotective and wanted to meet the guy and we were still getting to know each other (Mind you we only dated for about 2 months)! It caused a few arguments between us. And they always ask a million and one questions. When i’m not dating he really doesn’t bother me much. I’m not dumb or naive, i’m quite cautious actually, but dating at home the last actually added to my anxiety. 

Even though they’ve lightened up, it’s really difficult to do anything without someone asking where i’m going and I just want to have my independence and privacy to do what I want, when I want, with no questions asked. Or when I get into a relationship I’d like to be able to have that person over and do normal couple things like idk watching a movie cuddled up and not have to worry about my parents because usually someone is always home.  

Would I be crazy for taking on extra debt for housing or is it worth it in your opinion? Is that much debt manageable to pay back if I get a decent paying job or would that limit my ability to clerk sine they don’t pay much?

569,"I love music and once in a while, I like to listen to it loud. Yesterday** was one of those days as I attempted to do some spring cleaning and keep my LO entertained. A couple songs later and I notice that I received a text and then another one and then another one. I thought it was my SO since we had already been talking to each other and he had recently left the house but instead it was my neighbor (who lives upstairs) complaining about the noise level and how she could hear it “throughout the apartment” and to “LOWER THE MUSIC” 

It was 3:30 in the afternoon...Now younger and super petty me would’ve gone and highered the volume but instead I continued on cleaning and waited for some time to respond because I already knew what I was going to say wasn’t going to be nice at all. She then proceeds to text and calls me 4 times in a row...

This isn’t the first time she’s complained and I’ve been pretty considerate with my music playing but I’m sorry the way I see it, an hour of music isn’t killing anyone. She doesn’t work and is fairly young if that really even matters. She’s always complaining about something and I’ve just about had it with her. Idk if this also plays a role, but my mother owns the house and she’s a horrible tenant when it comes to paying rent going for about 15 years. 

I really wanted to respond and still kind of do but my SO said to leave it alone. I had brought it up to my mom the first time it happened and she didn’t really take anyone’s side especially because neighbor had also mentioned that she’s been living uncomfortable for the past few years. I recently moved in so I’m assuming she’s hinting at when my aunt and 2 sons lived here to which my mom said she can move. 

What should I do? Should I just take SOs advice and leave it as is or bring it up to my mom? Or just spazz on her like I would love to but feel like it’s too late for...

I eventually lowered it and was playing cartoons for my LO but don’t believe this will be the last of her complaining and definitely isn’t the last of me playing my music (which isn’t often) I’m just so fed up with the bullshit.

My mother is so far down the putrid conspiracy hole that is Qanon. It's entirely distressing and I'm lost.

I've  always looked up to her. She taught herself how to code, after having a family and no previous work skills, and has had great jobs ever since.  She has always been the strongest one in the family.

Over  the last year, my sister's life has spiraled out of control because of heroin addiction. She has been in and out of jail, and has not been able to hold a steady job for obvious reasons.

In a totally understandable desire to help her daughter, my mother has  given my sister thousands of dollars for living and court expenses. All  the while, my mother has been absorbing herself in this ridiculous conspiracy, claiming it was her escape. No conversation goes untouched  without some reference to it. Me, my father, and other siblings have  begged her to leave this stuff out of family gatherings etc, and that she should focus her mind on something more constructive.

That  has not panned out. She sincerely believes that there is a secret cabal that runs everything, and they all survive on the blood of  children...yeah....""Didn't you hear? Hillary is locked up in GTMO and  they're interrogating her as we speak!, bet you won't hear that on CNN!""

I'm not entirely sure how to say this, but my family keeps insinuating that I might be autistic or have some sort of mental disorder, when I really don't think I do. Full transparency: I used to think that maybe I had some sort of disorder, but I've kinda realized that after being told for years that I'm ""weird"" that I'm probably just more introverted and stoic than the average person and that maybe it's a bit off-putting socially. But I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, sometimes my family flat-out says ""You have autism"". Most recently it was ""Everyone has quirks, but you have A LOT of quirks..."" Sometimes they tell me that I have OCD because I'm constantly having to clean up after them (they leave random electronics on all-day and all-night without being used, they leave their shoes in bizarre places making them tripping hazards, cups filled with water are just chilling out around the house randomly, etc.) While I normally ignore stuff like this, it's really been effecting me and making me self-conscious to how I behave in front of people (especially whenever they're around).

&amp;#x200B;

I have two big issues with it: 1) sometimes they joke about it, and even though I don't have autism, it's not cool that they treat a legitimate medical problem as a joke 2) I like to believe that I'm doing alright socially, and them feeding into this self-consciousness is starting to impact my self-esteem over all. I've spent my whole life being told that I'm ""weird"" by everyone, and I'd prefer to just own my weirdness instead of trying to make it out like some disorder or like it's wrong (I'm really not all that weird anyways. I just have unconventional interests).

&amp;#x200B;

She claims she is bipolar and tends to lose her temper quickly. I'm semi scared of her since she has been in fist fights and various tussles. I dont want her to give me a hard time but I also dont want to be apart of her drama, If that makes sense?

590,"I am 18 and my brother is 20. We both live in my family house rent free and we don't really do chores. I am going to university full time, while my brother works full time. My parents are pretty generous people giving us both expensive gifts for Christmas and our birthdays (such as pads, MacBooks, beats headphones, iPhones, new gaming systems, tuition, etc). I admit we're both spoiled and get more than we deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are religious and want to enforce basic house rules such as no alcohol, and no fornication in the house. They allow us to drink and see women as long as it is not inside our house. The reason for this is because of my dad serves in a high position at a church, and his contract forbids the above sins in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

I respect my parents and try to follow their house rules, but my brother is a different story. He always gets into tantrums because he wants his girlfriend to sleep over, and bring over beer. This always results in a huge family fight and ruins days. He even offered to start paying rent just so that he can do the above things in the house.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother just recently spent most of his savings on a new car (he paid himself), and now has almost no money left to move out and rent. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think my parents' rules are fair, or that my brother has a good point? What things can I do to help the situation?

600,"
My best friend invited me to come to Colorado to her friends wedding that she was officiating. When we got there, that is when I met Ken (Ken is a F2M trans person). Imagine a park ranger persona type of person, tattoos, big smile on his face while having his hands on his hips and looking up at the sky. That's Ken. We hung out together a lot. It was very obvious that we had interest. One night, we laid on the mountain top staring at the sky, talking, laughing.  He then told me passively about his gf, I was kinda bummed out, but enjoyed the friendship. The next night, he asked me what I thought about polygamy. That was unexpected, and I never thought about it. I told him just that, nodded his head and started talking about an old crush of his who broke his heart, who he didn't trust anymore (Sara). I listened to it all in stride, having a fun time. Also to note, Ken has an extremely mild case of Aspbergers.

After all that, the next few months were a lot of texting/calling. Casual conversation. At that time I wasnt sure what kind of relationship he had with Angela (gf). Was it open? I admitted to him one night that I had a crush on him, he reciprocated and that changed things. I asked about Angela and he told me he was looking to end things with her, but didnt want to hurt her feelings. I told him not to string her along, and he agreed. He said that she agreed to his need for 'free love'. The next month I came to visit him and have fun. Angela was there 90% of the time, she came over and he would 100% ignore me and get all cuddly and schmoozy with her. I felt like I was entertaining myself, or in a uncomfortable situation. I mentioned it to him cause he seemed oblivious, and he told me she wanted to be there so he had to prove all was well to keep her happy. The one day she didnt come over we slept in bed and had sex. He had said they had an open thing, so I thought it was ok. I mentioned the fact I liked the idea of a relationship with him &amp; he acted like he didnt want to make commitments. Remember, 'free-love' guy. The next night we (Angela too) went to a gay club and he was allll over this guy there. He was talking to me about him like ""mmm I bet he is fun ;) I got his number"". That night Angela spent the night with him and I slept on the air mattress.  The next night, I got a call from my mom saying that my dad unexpectedly took a turn for the worst and was intubated. I went back home the next day to find he was dying. He died later that night of severe sepsis with all us around him. The hardest moment of my life.

The next few months, me and Ken continued to talk. Him and Angela's relationship was still there, and he just kept saying he was intending on ending it. Then he said he would wait till he got back from Cali (a trip to visit family/Ken to meet family). He procrastinated cause he didnt want to hurt her feelings/deal with it. After the trip, he messaged telling me he did it. I was glad and glad she wasn't being strung along.

After a few more visits, we talked vaguely about me moving down. At this point Ken was in a ""can't we just be"" instead of committing zone. I wanted more but tried to open up to his thoughts. I didn't want to push it. Our interest in each other grew. I was willing to see what happens. About 2 days before I moved down Ken told me casually and with happy inflection that he got the random guy that he hit on/wanted to sleep with at the bar to move in (Matt). I hung up lol. He called back like ""did I say something wrong?""  I told him I wasnt going to be in that uncomfortable situation again and he reassured me it is just for extra $ and he needed a place to stay. He had no interest. I accepted that. I moved down. Matt and Ken didn't do anything, they clashed and Ken couldnt stand him after a few months. Ken and I became emotionally attached. He told me he was in love with me. He often told me at random, or if I asked...that I am enough for him and he doesnt want anyone else. For the entire relationship, he instilled that. A year later he asked me to marry him...and for someone who was so afraid of commitment, that stunned me. Around this time, my health anxiety came about. I am a severe hypochondriac with PTSD like issues from excessive, past trauma. I am currently being evaluated, but multiple terms have been discussed. I have had this issue since I was 5 and it fluctuates or disappears. My folks instilled that going to a therapist would land me in a padded room. They felt it was my duty to manage my own mind. So I always severely avoided therapists. I told ken openly that I was a hypochondriac with severe anxiety and he was understanding. At this point, I hadn't had that side of me appear yet. 

A month later, I was on Kens laptop. I ended up getting on the internet and went to my FB. He was still logged in and I kinda pondered for a min. I saw he messaged Sara and it was suggestive. Like, talking bout how good she was ""with your fingers ;)"" (they had a minor sexual encounter previously) and other flirty things. The problem was this was RECENT. She was discussing wanting to take him to Hawaii. That night, I showed him that I saw his msgs, and I was pissed. He wanted to sit with me and run through the convo to clarify it meant nothing. And that they always talked like that jokingly. That he thought about Hawaii, but wouldn't do anything. That he just wanted a free vacation cause he felt he deserved it after hotwiring her 3000$ 3 years before to get her teeth fixed. The whole thing smelled of BS. I then did the worst thing out of BLINDING ANGER. The worst thing I have ever done. I made a faux Sara acct spiting me in order to get Ken to stop talking to her. I was a total shit for it. The whole thing did go through and he deleted her. I didn't feel good about it, why would I? I knew I had to admit to Ken what I did, no matter the cost. I knew the consequences; leaving me, him talking to her again, kicked out, I don't know..but I was prepared for whatever, so I told him. His reaction was, like it wasnt a big deal. He wasn't upset. He told me he didnt have any interest in talking to her anyways so he was going to just keep it that way. 

Through the arguments over the years, seldomly I would fly off about her if we were talking about her or something relevant. Like the term ""your precious fucking Sara"" came out of my mouth a handful of times. He'd just get into IDC mode or be hurt that I would doubt his feelings/what he says. 
   
A few months later my health anxiety got bad. It coincided with the wedding stress. My hobbies all stopped. All that existed was my fears. For the next few years the anxiety would came &amp; went. I would be so out of it, that my surroundings were cloudy. Not paying attention. I would ask irrational health fears to ken which, initially he was fine with, but then it was a regular thing and he couldn't deal with it.  His personal issues surrounding it werent getting addressed from me cause of my mindset.  If he were to talk about how he feels and I was focused and there, it was often he would say something painful about me or us that I didnt know how to respond other than shock or sadness when he was looking for acceptance, so he thought I wasnt prioritizing his feelings. He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I would always put it off, try and get better on my own, fail, and repeat. This is something that fluctuated. I kept meaning to go, but I just got clammy and scared over it. I tried so hard to keep it in myself and not burden him cause...I didn't want to burden him with it anymore. Hes my husband, not a crutch. Throughout the on/off bouts..our lives were, good. We both worked at ACE together, a house, a great routine..and we genuinely enjoyed our time together. 5 out of 7 days Ken would wake up, wake me up with a kiss on the cheek and a snuggle in bed, get in the car, go get breakfast sandwiches, drive to work, go to a restaurant after work, try and beat eachothers score in Cribbage, go home and watch Netflix in bed, sex, and cuddle to sleep. 5 nights a week for like...2 yrs. 
Then, his folks went on a road trip to Boise and said they were looking to retire there. They wanted to fly Ken out to look at homes with them cause they wanted us to move up there too. I was unsure about this, I was comfortable, but it was an opportunity to go somewhere better and with more options. They got the house and we all drove to Idaho. I had severe suppressed/released anxiety from around February till now. A huge one. And Ken was at the end of his rope with it. We still did all the amazing cuddly, fun things together..enjoying each other but if my health anxiety seeped through, it ruined it. My sleeping habits also got severely effected, and just my general well being.  Through this all, he always maintained that  he just can't deal with my anxiety, he wants me to get help, lost hope, loves me, wants to be together, would never let me go, never forever. This was literally 2 weeks ago that he told me all that. In the arguments he would accuse me of being a liar, untrustworthy, selfish, childish, etc. 

This last Tuesday was The big Kahuna.  Ken seemed odd. I asked him on Monday in bed what was up, if he was distancing himself from me and he took a second and told me everything was good.  On Tuesday we went to eat dinner at some fancy restaurant, cracked some jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go do the $5 Tuesdays and he was all for that. Like totally excited, holding my hand, you know all the gooey lovely stuff. Which is normal and constant for us. I came home and gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend April and the text looked like otd be something bad about me, but when I politely asked, he bold face lied to me saying it was about something else, I could tell he was lying and asked if it were really about me and he said ""well, yes"", ""well then why did you lie to me?"", ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"" and then I got angry, not cause he was talking to April about me (which isn't a state fucking secret, I really don't care) it was him lying to me. I blew up over it. He went to the movie alone, and at the end of it texted me with this

""You've never believed how I felt about you. And you're right, I didn't know how to answer your question last night..thats why it took some time to think about. I am going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with you anymore, I don't want to do things with you anymore, you're not the person I want to be with. I gave you many chances to get help, I am done and I would like you to go""

You can probably imagine how I reacted, bawled like a baby. I called him making a complete ass out of myself saying he couldn't have meant that, he loves me, Im sorry, I will go to a therapist, etc...and he just looked at me like ..get a hold of yourself. He has never said that or ever indicated EVER that he wanted that. Everytime, even weeks before he said he would never leave me, loves me too much, etc. At home i said 
""Please, i am sorry...""
""it's too late""
""do you really want me to leave?""
""YES""
""for good?""
""for now""
 ""I will get help for real I will!""
 ""What, you think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings for you again?"" 
""you don't love m---??""
""I am going to bed""
""but.."" 
""BED. I have to be up at 6"" (shuts door). not a tear, not a care, not even anger...just a fed up-ness.

 Once I got a hold of myself I wrote him an extensive text stating how I need help, and I can't pretend any longer that I can deal with it on my own, and how I can't use him as a crutch and that I don't blame him for being fed up with it, that it sucks I needed a massive push but I am going to do it and hope it betters myself as a standalone human cause I can't affect people like this. I wrote him basically that (summarized). He didn't respond Wednesday, I contacted every single therapist in town to get an appt in asap...and got one for Friday. My sister was resoundingly proud, (crying actually) that I was really going to do this. She'd only been pushing me for 20 years lol. I did everything I could to improve at the quality of my day to help clear my head. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, got a decent sleep schedule, made dinner. Ken came home, and seemed...jubilant...about his day (which is normal. His #1 priority is the quality of his day/job/hobby. He wont let ANYTHING disturb that...hence why he wants to get rid of me and went to bed mid breaking my heart. That's very normal for him. One of his biggest complaints about me in our relationship is me keeping him up past his bedtime. Like he said I dont care about his well being cause I was in a talking mood at the wrong time. Or I would be on my phone in bed and it would keep him up so I'd put the covers over me so it didn't bother/he wouldnt see. He considered that sneaky lying.) So yeah, jubilant just with his day. The bizarre thing was him being sporadically extremely nice/normal to me but also very distant. I got 1 text from him ""I am glad you go an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home"". I respected that, and didn't bother him. And went on faith.

Thursday I cooked, made cupcakes, got groceries, still giving him his space. At this point in my head I was done with the 'pining' 'mindset and just...tried to find the positive in that, everything happens for a reason, and maybe my stubborn ass needed a slap to put me in the place I really need to be. So in a small way, I looked forward to my appt. I talked to my sister and she understood his need to distance himself, to say ""you know what? I am fed up, I can't do this any more unless you get help. I'm done"" but made it clear that if I follow through and really give it my 1200% and he still wants out then that is really shitty and says very little about the vows he made. I talked to April that night who basically was like ""I think he is done. I was really excited you were finally getting that help, I just don't think that hope was shared"". 

The next day was my appt and fuuuck. Sitting across from a woman staring at you, talking about your entire life story in order to be assessed was hard. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous. She was worried about PTSD, and it manifesting in some tangible way. She could tell I was extremely nervous and tried to calm me down. Afterward though, it felt...okay. like, I did it, and I will continue to. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me and I took that as it was safe to talk too. He was happy I went, proud maybe..but wary. He was still in that 'place' but he was really seeing I am ding my part, and will continue to. He told me spontaneously then that he started talking to Sara again. My brain went blank. like the blankest stare into nothingness. Normally, I would be upset, but I was composed (but dying on the inside). He literally handed me his phone and said I am more than welcome to look at the texts. I was not ready for it. I just got Ken to talk and then this sunk me back to an even worse place. I read the texts and I literally could not believe my eyes.

""Why did you add me again?""

""I wanted to apologize for unfriending you years ago""

(proceeded to tell the literal entire story of when I made that fake account years ago, and how fucked up it was...the one I admitted to and he didn't even seem bothered by/said he didn't have any desire to talk to her anyway. Also told her I 'snooped' on their messages that time and it was totally ""fucked up""....the messages he literally encouraged i read through with and was understanding about and told me I was more than welcome to look at any of his stuff to prove he has nothing to hide )

""Omg! Why would you marry someone like that?""

""I contemplated calling it off when I found out, but I had too much money on the venue. I wanted to add you back all these years but I didnt want to make her mad, and I didnt know if it would really be you I was talking to you this time. I don't care what she sees anymore (see what?).""

""Don't worry, she's out of my life for good, how are you?""

(and literally the following is just a plethora of giddy 6-7am conversations with him talking about how beautiful the sunrise is there, etc and many phone calls.)

I was FUMED. I walked out to have a cigarette to try and compose myself. I asked him to come out and talk with me.
Me:""that was some painful things you said""
Him: ""yeah, I knew it would be tough for you to hear""
Me: ""Do you like her?""
Him: ""no, I messaged her to apologize and to have a friend back"" 
Me: ""you told her you contemplated marrying me then?"" 
Him: ""Yeah, I did..that was such a big lie""
Me: ""it was, and I told you flat out I did it and you let it go"" 
Him: ""well thats cause I already knew and had time to process. I actually found it on your computer."" 
Me: "" What? You didn't tell me that""
Him: *shrugs*
Me: Was it true about why you continued with the wedding?""
Him: ""I did it cause I love you""
Me: ""No, you said to her you stuck with it cause of the down payment on the venue"" Him: ""Stop. Why do you do that? Why do you always jump to conclusions and not take what I say? I love you and thats why I did it. The $ was secondary."" 
Me: ""Do you really want a divorce?""
Him: ""I thought about it the other day yeah.""
Me: ""But, doesnt that even bother you?"" 
Him: ""you arent allowed to ask me about my emotions yet till you earn it"" 
Me: ""okay..I just don't understand why that extreme. We love each other.""
Him: ""You can be divorced and still in love. Lots of divorced people are in love...""
Him: ""I want to be with you. I love you. I never wanted it to get to this point, to contemplate leaving you, but I don't want to live like this (cries) with you refusing help."" 
Me: ""I am going to someone, I am really on this. This is it""
Him: ""I want to see you get help and I want you back""

 Later I said, verbatim ""I am going to try and be okay with the Sara thing. It hurts, i hate it, I don't understand it, but I am trying here"" and he said ""you arent going to dictate who I want to talk to or who I want to be friends with. Its none of your business"". He has made it very clear that I have to earn him back and that if I am not cool with something, tough shit. 

 How could he say all those things? I have him back, kinda. Now he is in a...'it is going to take some time to earn my trust back but I want the anxietyless you cause I love you and I am proud you will get help' mode. I am going to continue to do my part, to do me, to fix myself...but like...I feel just...I don't even know. The Sara thing is extremely uncomfortable...and I don't know if that is something that I am overreacting over or he really is not doing right. If it is wrong what can I even say about it?

Also, now Ken is trying to do stuff with me. Yesterday we went to a BBQ pit, he was laughing at my jokes, if he saw i had goosebumps he's stroke his finger on my arm and giggle or offer his coat. But at night he still went to sleep in the other room, I asked him if he was sleeping in there again and he did the whole...breathe in and 'what did I say before' look. ""I told you yesterday until you get back to your sleep schedule right I sleep alone"" then hugged me and kissed me on the forehead. He won't kiss me on the lips yet. He woke me up this morning stroking my back and kissing my head like ""you gonna get up and we can do stuff? Do you want to go shopping?"" I of course got up despite crummy sleep, pretending I am totally awake and ready. And now I have these urges to look at his phone to see if he is still talking to Sara and what about now.

So there is this girl who I’m friends with. Close friends. And she has serious mental issues. It’s been building up and it actually scares me. To start with, she’s depressed. Self harm, suicidal thoughts, stuff like that. She’s also emotionally and mentally abusive. Thing is, she practically needs other people to function. 

What I mean is that her feelings and emotions are based off of other people, never herself. She is practically an empty shell of a person that needs other to fill her up with emotion. 

She refuses to go to anyone for help. Her family, teachers, the school, therapists, anyone.

She is seriously unstable. I truly believe that she is dependent on me and another friend of ours to the point where she would actually kill herself without hesitation if we left her, (Which we want to.) 

She’s emotionally and mentally abusive. She holds stuff against people to an insane amount, and shared literally every private detail about me to everyone at our school. 

She’s obsessed with me. I mean truly, truly obsessed. I don’t want to go into detail as i don’t even like thinking about it.

607,"I apologize for the length of this, but I feel like the more information I give the better understanding it will be when it comes to what I want to do.

For some background, I am 17F, and the school I go to is primarily black. I am rather very involved in the program that is run by my two teachers, one being L (the sweetest down-to-earth teacher I've ever had) and B (the one I will be talking about today). B is a new teacher at my school, as this is her first year ever teaching there. So, of course, the new freshman that have arrived are having both of these teachers at the same time, unlike my friend O (she is a sophomore, I am a junior), A (same as me), C (same as O), and I.

One of these freshmen, S, has taken a huge liking to B. And vice versa. But we'll be touching that later. Keep in mind that S is white, just as B and L are, and that C and O are black. A and I are both Hispanic (although I also have a hint of white and Asian in me).

Now, onto the main portion of the story. I'll add a TLDR at the bottom as well as what I'm asking advice on.

The program I'm involved in is very agriculture-based, and we do competitions involving speaking our creed, judging livestock animals, so on and so forth. At one of our very first competitions, B promised we wouldn't have to walk back through and look at the animals again because we already had results, and that we would be able to go straight to getting food. When B suddenly changed her mind, the entire group of students (there were maybe 6 or 7 of us) was complaining about it. However, instead of addressing us all, she decided to take it out all on O. She got into O's face, her finger not even an inch from her face, yelling at her for complaining. Everyone was absolutely shocked. O, of course, told her mother about this incident, but hoping it was a one-time thing, not much action was taken about it. One time in class, O had accidentally dropped her ring on the floor, and C picked it up and gave it back to her. O had simply said ""Thank you"" when B gets up from her desk and starts screaming at O. Obviously O tries to defend herself since she did nothing wrong, but that was followed up with B yelling at her louder and threatening to call her mother.

The problem is, she only does this to O and a select few other students. B will berate them for very simple things such as talking in a whisper, eating in class, and just having a basic conversation while she's not teaching, all of which students do on a daily basis in there. I personally don't know if I should call this discrimination, but since my vocab is failing me, that's the closest word to what I feel this is. And, just a hint, all of the students she does this to are black.

And then there is S.

As addressed earlier, S is white. If you want to know how rare white people are in my school, you can keep track of them with all 10 of your fingers. Because there are legitimately a total of 10 of them in my school with myself included.

Yesterday, I found out B visits S's house for ""practice"" for poultry and creed speaking competitions despite the fact that we have two practices weekly for those events. That in itself set off an even bigger red flag than I already had. On multiple occasions, B has also bought S food with her own money, something she has and never will do for any of us. She allows S to curse in front of her (something she claims she absolutely does not tolerate) and multiple more unacceptable behaviors. S made it to state in her creed competition, and B had even given her a good luck gift and announced through our school's PA system that she had done so (although when I showed my lamb, no gift ensued, not even when I placed really well and sold for a lot of money). B will also transport S to personal locations, such as her home, her boarding stable, and even other activities, but will not do so for other students.

The main reason I decided to make this post is because of this specific incident that occurred during the past week. One of our benefits in the program is your typical high school letterman jacket. To earn this jacket, you must get 100 points before you're eligible to purchase one. To give you an idea of how difficult this is, A and I worked our asses off to get these points. Raising a living, breathing animal that will be under your care for about 5 months as a project only earns you 7 points. Being an officer only earns you 5. That is how much effort it takes to get this jacket.

With all of this in mind, B decided she wants to give S her jacket simply because she made it to state. She didn't win, didn't even place top 5, but for some reason, in this woman's mind, she wants to give S her jacket because she truly deserves it. I completely get it. S made it to state, it took a lot of effort, congratulations. However, I'll give you 20 points (which will make this the highest earning activity), not the goddamn letterman that you're supposed to put so much more effort into getting. The competition is literally just saying the same creed ALL MEMBERS LEARN super good. Not making your own speech. Something anyone can do rather easily with a good speaking voice and memorization. Oh, and an FYI, it is painfully obvious that she would never suggest such a thing for any other student, including A and I, as she's made it blatantly obvious that we're ""all the same in her eyes.""

On a side note, B's general attitude when it comes to teaching is awful. She sits at her desk all day, talks about personal problems, barely teaches us anything, and can be really moody towards students and L. There have been times where she will argue with L in front of all the students about some information the students have no reason knowing. Our class assignments will literally be a simple worksheet per day and that's it for the entire class period (about 70 minutes considering the period I have her is an extended one). The notes we get involve her saying everything on the slide and no added on information. She can't even stand up and read them, she simply remains at her desk. B also walks out of class and interrupt's L's class multiple times each class period, not bothering if her class is testing or taking notes. B can be very snarky and snappy, telling us to get out of her room if we walked in because she wasn't standing at the door to let us inside even if the door is open. One time she yelled at a student for opening a bag of chips inside the class and told her to get out of her room ASAP or she would call an AP (stated earlier that students are allowed to eat in her room). B has temperamental issues with O, C and the other students stated earlier, and absolutely none with S, A, or I.

To what I want advice on. I really, REALLY want to report B to someone about this behavior towards her students. However, she has gotten really close to our principal (they bred their freaking dogs together) and I know if I go to him I would not remain anonymous and nothing would happen. I don't know if I should go to him anyway, or if I should seek someone higher up the chain. I don't know if I should even report this in general. If anything, I would report the favoritism (which does seem like it might be racial) and leave out what I call discrimination. I simply don't know how to approach reporting it if I even should. I'm a good student with a clean academic and disciplinary record, I take all Pre-AP/AP/Dual Credit classes, and generally the quiet kid in the back of the class, so I see no reason they wouldn't believe me excluding the principal considering he is, as stated, uncomfortably close to B.

TLDR; My teacher has expressed clear and unreasonable dislike to a handful of students while simultaneously holding one student on a pedestal, probably because of race. She also has this insanely bad attitude towards all students that is comparable and might even be worse than your typical thought of a teenage girl and doesn't even take teaching the curriculum efficiently seriously. She is really close to our principal, and I don't know whether or not I should report to him still, seek someone higher up the chain, or not report it at all.

I also realize bias may be a better way of describing her actions against O and the other students, but I'm not too sure.",07Apr2019,3

This is one of the few Asian people in the gym I go to, and I always thought of Asian dudes as meek, weak, and nerdy and this person not fitting into that box made me very uncomfortable.

622,"My placement is a pretty serious commitment: 12 months, working in a shelter for young girls victims of violence and abandonement, run by a religious community and located in the outskirt of a pretty dangerous metropoli. I work 48 hours a week and I have one free day.

I am not new to this type of work: I have been part of anti trafficking network for years, both as a volunteer and a social worker, in my home country and abroad.

Yet, this is the first time working in a religious community. I am agnostic and respectful of other's spirituality so I did not believe it was going to be a problem. I was wrong.

It's been two months and I feel lonely and isolated. I am the only (and youngest) non religious worker and I am having a very hard time finding common ground with my fellow project mate (we are two from the same association). I did try, but while we can get along, we just happen to be extremely different. It does not help that she does not speak English, nor my country's language, nor the local language. So yeah. Hard times.

I tried to meet new people outside of the projects, but the sisters (we live with nuns) are uneasy with me going out, even if I am very careful and take all the possible precautions not to get in trouble.

The work time are also extremely heavy: while we have pauses trough the day, we start at 6:30 and finish at 20:30.

I am not hyper happy with the work either, as I am working as an educator, while I would have liked to do research. I believed I could do both at the same time, but the general state of demotivation I am in does not really help to find energy to do extra work.

I don't know what to do. I am not a quitter, and I am doing my best to find a way to enjoy the project. Yet I don't want to be miserable for a year.

What should I do? Any tips?


Extra info: I did sign a contract but I can withdraw in any moment. Yet, I do not want to let down the association. Also, it is a pretty competitive programme : you can literally do it only once in your lifetime, everything is paid for and you also get a small wage (15 euros per day more or less).

Thing is, part of me thinks that technically I should not be miserable. The shelter is very good (the nuns did build a heaven for girls, really), the country is interesting, I do think I could make a fantastic research project if I could just find the energy and, while education is not my primary goal, I do love the kids.

People
Jon: the ass hole
Alex : my prom date 
Angela: Alex's cousin and my friend 
Sarah : friend and prom organizer
Mark: Person I didn't really know that much or respect 
Sanchez : close friend of mine




So two days ago a friend of ours accidentally added Jon to our prom group and us friends always swear at each other like it's nothing at all. So when Jon joins my friend and I say we wish our dicks were in him (sounds disgusting but we honestly greet each other with shit that's wayy worse) He then starts going off and talking shit about how he can fuck me up and bury me 6 feet under so I sent some laughing emojis and told him to come meet me at a nearby beach at around 6pm the next day. He replies to that message and says ""you come meet me in your mother's room bitch watch me stuff it down her throat"" Now at this point I was confused since my mum works at the high school we're in as a teacher and everyone knows that she's one of the sweetest people on earth. So then Alex who's my date to prom shows up in the group chat and asks how we're doing (Ps she has a boyfriend and she's Angela's cousins she's also coming for a visit so I offer to take her to prom) so Jon asks who this Alex is and someone says that she's my prom date. Jon sees an opportunity and proceeded to call her a bitch so when I realized this guy was being serious I told him to stop ahead and apologize before he looses his friends (he has a total of four friends) at this point everyone in the group including his friends are enraged by how he could call Alex (a total stranger to us who seems sweet) a bitch and how he can say that shit to my mother. So Jon just goes completely silent and says ""I'm totally shocked"" then proceedes to insult everyone there including his friends I tell him that I'm being serious right now about meeting up with and beating the shit out of him and this guy just stays quiet while his friends tell him to apologize and that he wants no part in this fight. He doesn't, So everyone including his friends  roast the shit out of him (oh Ps all his friends are mutual friends of mine and they were too nice to say anything to him till he said this shit) the group chat dies off with everyone laughing at this guy (sounds horrendous but he honestly deserves this shit with the stuff he's done) 
The next day I wake up go to the gym and do my regular routine on a spring break day. I open the group chat and find out that Jon couldn't stop swearing about my mum and talking about her sexually so the whole roasting thing comes back but this time I honestly had enough of his shit. I tell Jon to meet me up at our school (he lives right next to our school) so we can fight he says he's down and that he can beat the shit out of me. I go there call him and he tells me he's shitting and he'll be right there to fuck me up. 
I open up the group chat and ask where the fuck he is he continues to call me a pussy for not being able to wait. 5 minutes later I call him and find out that he blocked my phone number. I go on to the group chat to ask where he is and he says he's coming. I sent a video saying that I'm all alone (just in case he says something like we ganged up on him) he says that he's coming. Then I say that I'm leaving in 20 minutes and this guy goes dark for literally 20 minutes and while I was waiting all my friends called me telling me that he's just a child and that he's not worth my time but I'm just too stubborn to realize this shit. I call him again nothing and when the 20 minutes were done he switches his phone back on and says that his phone was off so he couldn't come (long story short Jon just kept going on about excuses and shit) I get enraged and tell him that I'll fight him even if it was in the middle of prom itself or anywhere else.
 Now Jon just stopped and people started leaving the group which we had so much fun in for such a long time. We make a new group without Jon and I went on a jog to try to calm myself down now Sarah comes says that she's worked too hard for this shit and asked if I could at least not do this shit at prom since it'll ruin the mood and that I shouldn't prove my masculinity to anyone while being a dick head she then proceeded to leave the group since she was upset that all her hard work might go to waste. I come back saying that I don't give shit about how people view me and that I would've done the same thing even if they existed or not. Sanchez ( who was taught by my mother) gets on and starts telling me that I shouldn't care about where I fight and that he'll be there to beat him up too since the shit he said about my mother was too personal. This morning I wake up and find out the mark sent me a voice note ( mark isn't in school anymore and is playing for a professional soccer team) he proceedes to tell me how I shouldn't fight him at prom night or anywhere and that I should apologize to Sarah since she's been working on this for months. Now this honestly shocked me because I didn't really know Mark that much and I never thought he even had the capability to say such things. So it really moved me

I add Sarah back and Jon and type this into the group
 ""Look I wanna start with apologizing to Sarah you've been working on this for months and my dumb ass was about to ruin the mood even if I did fight him outside I honestly do apologize and Jon you're honestly just a pathetic guy who stays at home all night so you wanna come to prom and not worry that anything is gonna happen come you're just a child after all and I've already stooped to low for you to begin with. Since this is about my mum I know for a fact that if I told her about this she'll tell me about a hadith (it's what we as Muslims believe our prophet said) of the prophet saying that a person's strength isn't by his muscles or how many people he can beat but the the psychological strength that he can handle while people swear at him so imma just let God deal with you. Honestly so many people told me to stop ahead and not stoop too low for you but I ignored them and continued with your child like mind just fuck off man. I would've called you but I know you blocked my number from yesterday . So just stay on league and all that bullshit of yours and may God forgive you"" 

now after I sent this I removed Jon from this group and everyone was telling me how proud they were of me but I honestly just felt defeated by a person who insulted my mum my date and all of my friends. Sanchez and a couple of my friends who my mum taught text me in private and start telling me that they'll still beat this guy up with or without me because of the way he talked about my mum. I honestly do want to fight this guy so fucking bad but I just know that my mum who is dear to me wouldn't approve of this and the fact that we could hurt this guy so bad that we might run into some legal issues

Now at around 6pm I go out with a couple of friends to meet Alex since she was new to all of us and she seemed like such a nice person. So we say hi and all that good stuff then Angela tells me that Jon apologized to Alex but also called me a scumbag and that apparently she doesn't even want to look at me and he keeps going on and on anyways. He then goes ahead and tells her that if her ego is too high for her to forgive him then she can go fuck herself and that he doesn't really care anyways. Sooo he fucked up again and the only person who might still be his friend ( a person I had a huge fight with but is mad at him because of the stuff he said about my mum)
Right now the only thing I honestly want to know is if I should go on and fight this guy so I could sleep without me thinking about Jon or the stuff he said about my mum or just ignore him and try to convince my friends not to do anything to him since he's just a loser anyways.

626,"Okay so I was leaving lunch with my boyfriend today and he had distracted me (but let’s be real it’s my fault for getting distracted) while I was backing up slowly to exit a parking spot. Next thing I knew I felt a small bump for maybe 2 seconds and stopped. I immediately knew I had hit a car. I wasn’t going more than 5 miles per hour or less while backing up but I was so mad at myself for not paying attention.

Turns out the car I scrapped was our WAITRESS from the lunch we just had. I felt like an even bigger dick. The paint on my car is slightly scratched maybe 3-4 inches long but nothing super noticeable. I guess it was lucky?? for me because the spot I scrapped on their car was already missing paint and rusting. But you could still notice some slight damage, no denying just a scrape. 

I went in to the restaurant and told the manager what happened and she was being so friendly about the situation. She was kind of laughing telling me not to worry saying as long as there’s no dent I’m okay. But I still felt awful. We all went out and looked at the back of her car (the car I hit was already old and beat up with scratches and paint missing so it didn’t stand out much at all but still I felt awful). 

The waitress came out and was looking annoyed? Maybe she was on break. But she looked at it and the manager/boss was talking to her and saying “Wasn’t that huge spot of wear and paint chipping already there” and the girl goes “I don’t even know” and walked away saying she didn’t have time for this. The spot was already there but within it you could tell a small amount of scratching was there from me of course. I felt bad because the girl seemed pissed off. The manager turned to me and said “Don’t worry about it, this is no big deal. She drives an old beat up car anyhow and I’ll take care of it” and she told me to not worry and go ahead and leave. I asked her again if she was certain and told her i could leave my information and she insisted not to and that I was entirely okay and it wasn’t a big deal. But like it wasn’t her car to say that for so I’m not sure? 

My fear is I ended leaving after asking a few times if she needed my info or how I could make up for it and she insisted it was no big deal and I was okay to leave. But now my paranoia is getting the best of me thinking “what if they change their mind and try to claim I hit and ran or something awful?” I might just be paranoid but I had an experience years ago where a guy rear ended me and said it was his fault and he’d immediately pay for any of the damage. But then found out the price of my cars fix and tried to act like I was the one at fault. We won that case but I just don’t trust anyone.

629,"I am an 18 year old who is about to graduate high school in June, and after that I have no one to go to, and no where to go. Long story short, I have an abusive dad and my mom just lets it happen. For my own safety and mental health, I can't stay here. I was really hoping to go to university (and I got in everywhere I applied), but my parents won't let me take a paying job, and my dad refused to let me do the FAFSA (for non-Americans, it's basically an application for financial aid from the US government for college education). Because I can't afford to get into debt, I have had to turn down every acceptance I've gotten so far, and I have no idea of what's next. I can't stay with any extended family, because my dad would kill me if they found out what he's done to me my whole life. I can't stay with any friends, since they'll all either be starting college, or in my hometown--my only other friends I have are in Canada, or in a tiny town with no job openings (I looked).

Barring the family business (I feel like it's meaningless if I can't give them my past employers contact info, because I don't want my dad to do something to me), I have no real work experience. I don't have a driver's license and my parents want to control me and won't let me get a license, so I have no car to use or way to even get to a DMV office since my town doesn't have one, and there is no public transportation to get there. Once I am out, I don't think I can stay in my area, but I have no where to go.

So basically, I have: no place to go, no job, no job experience, no job lined up, no place to live past June, very little money, no driver's license, and no car.

I looked at joining the military, but because I got a formal C-PTSD diagnosis when my mom let me see a therapist (whom I went to for a whole 2 weeks, before my dad found out), I can't join (plus I've had some experiences in the psych ward over the last 3 years which makes me ineligible).

I'm thinking of applying to one more college in Canada that, if I went there, would put me in manageable levels of debt (throughout high school, I've taken every AP and class with the local University I can, so if I go to the university I'm going to apply to, I would be there for for 2 1/2 years for a Bachelor's Degree at 15k a year for all expenses if I don't get a scholarship). But is this a stupid idea? I feel like it is, but everyone I've asked so far said it isn't (except my older brother and sister).

So Reddit, I'm just asking what would you do? My mom keeps telling me that my mental health will get worse if I go out of town, and that I should stay, and I want to respect her, but I don't think I can stay.",07Apr2019,2

632,"Hello!

So like the title says I can sometimes feel amazing and then suddenly feel really shit and like everything I'm working for is useless. I've also suffered from panic attacks and I sometimes feel super light headed and dizzy or just generally out of it. I don't know if that makes sense but I feel like I'm in third person watching my life pass by sometimes -  sorta disassociated? I've started to be alone more but I actually like it more as my friends can be really high energy and it just drains me.

&amp;#x200B;

As well as that, I've been handling these feelings in a bad way. I make myself sick and it can be triggered by feeling really stressed and needing something to control or feeling like I don't deserve to eat. I've started eating less and some of my friends have noticed but it's not really bad because I'm kinda overweight. I don't mean it's a good way to lose weight; since I'm not super skinny or anything it doesn't seem to be as bad? I don't really know. Saying that, I have lost some weight and my dad has brought it up as a topic of concern but I've just brushed it off. I know making myself throw up is bad for my teeth, esophagus and probably more stuff but I do it anyway which makes me hate myself more.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately when I feel down I've started to feel even worse and the panic attacks have gotten worse. And on the other hand when I feel great I feel really great, like bubbly and happy. I have spoken to the counsellor at my school and one of my friends recommended a book on anxiety (she's going through something kinda similar herself). One of the things I was advised was to make a list of everything I need to do but I've done it before and it makes me even more stressed. I've booked an appointment with my gp but the appointment is next month because that's the earliest I could get. I'm also on the Easter holiday at the moment and I'm scared because my thoughts are always worse when I'm by myself and I don't have the routine of school to distract me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: As title says, I also feel dissociated from reality sometimes, make myself throw up. I've asked for help from my school but I'm on holiday and gp is next month. I'm sacred to be alone with my thoughts and would appreciate some advice.",07Apr2019,1
633,"Hi everyone this is one of my first posts so please bear with me I'm doing the best I can. :)

I am 18 years old and live in CT with my mom and my dog. I graduated high school in 2018 and have been working and figuring out what I want to do for the past year. I landed on being a vet tech and theres a fantastic program in my area not 15 minutes away from my current home. Now my mom has been talking about moving and is serious about it. She also encourages me to apply for the program (I have) and to attend starting this summer. 

Small problem is that the area in CT where I'm located is very expensive and completely out of the question for someone my age to live alone with a part time job (30hr) and school on top of that. I have an internship lined up and connections in the field in the area lined up for internships and possible jobs later on.

My mom seems to understand but also doesn't seem to want to help me? Im confused about everything she says, she will say things like, ""apply and go and you will figure it out, you don't need me!"" I personally don't feel confident doing that, I know I'm going to need a car and a place to live in 6 months. She has told me I can not come with her and hasn't decided where she's going to move but demands there won't be enough space. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked at rent, the cost of a car, insurance, and my school fees and I am a wreck trying to pretend I can do it. I will have to move so far away from where we are I would have to quit my job (a beautifully managed kennel/daycare) and drive at least 45 minutes to school everyday. 

A bit more information, I have an older brother (26) and older sister (20), both of whom are still somewhat supported by my mom. My brother, the oldest moved out a year ago after getting his first job and drives the car all of us kids previously shared. My sister is amazing and does do the best she can, she is still in school and needs her mothers financial support as anyone would. My brother just rubs me the wrong way, he lived with us and was financially supported 100% by my mother well into his 20's and she's asking me to move out at 18 fresh out of high school. 

I've worked since the day I turned 16, didn't manage my money well but I do well now. I fully support my dog, I rescued her myself and all of that cost I handle, she is extremely important to me. I am at a point in life where I'm very happy and my mom is not. 

She is older and I think she's done with children, I still need my mom. A lot. I know no life skills and I tell her this to which I'm told I'll figure it out. I don't know what to do. 

We have never been close and I feel very little connection to her because of lots of different incidences and honestly the way she treats me. I've never felt as happy as I do on average but when she talks to me I just feel more alone, more lost.

I don't really know what I need, but I need help. Im genuinely so scared my life is going to fall apart when she moves away from here without me. Please Im open to any suggestion you could think of I just need to know where to go now.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My mother (whom I've had serious problems with since a young age) is kicking me out at 18, to retire and move away. Where we live is where I'm attending school (no dorm), working at a great job I'm very happy at. Final note, my brother lived at home until 25 and my sister lives at school and doesn't come home if she can help it. What should I do? How can I make my mom care about whats going to happen to me? Should I just give up and move away myself and start over?

634,"It’s been 6 months since it ended, but I feel like I have been left even more damaged. There were many times where I felt uncomfortable, and didn’t want to do things, but felt pressured to do them anyways. Sometimes I would resist, but then I’d give up, because I’d convince myself that I found someone who actually loved me. 
 
I have never told anyone about this, no family, friend or therapist. I’ve always been an extremely introverted person, even though I do want to share my thoughts and feelings with others, I always let people talk over me. 

The last time I was with him, for the first time I convinced myself that I felt so mentally and physically violated. That very night I left his house hurt both physically and mentally. I remember walking alone in the dark, with snow up to my knees, and crying my eyes out. I had no one to talk to about what just happened... Before I came home I wiped away my tears and cleaned myself up, because I was afraid my parents would notice how much distraught I was in (They don’t know about him). He broke up with me after that night. 

6 months have passed and everyday I feel like like I want to kill myself, but I put on act around the people who see me. I pretend that I’m ok, but I’m not. I feel so relieved every time I convince myself that I will kill myself just the next day, but when I don’t I’m left feeling that same feeling that night I had left his house. A state of depression, anxiety and hurt. 

All I ever wanted was someone to give my love to just so they can reciprocate that same love. But now, i can’t just keep pretending nothing happens, I just want to die peacefully, so I won’t have to think about what happened. ",07Apr2019,0
635,"I met a girl in class that's a couple grades ahead of me. I made a lame ass joke that nobody else was laughing at and she started laughing loudly and at great length and then started talking to me. She asked me to repeat the joke yet she obviously heard it. As I told her it she smiled the whole time then waited after class to pop out say boo and scare me and looked me in the eyes. She doesn't talk to other guys in class. After that incident she didn’t do anything as explosive. She started laughing at half funny stuff I say in conversation to other people or responding to stuff I say or asking me to repeat jokes. After I have a conversation with her she scares me. I was joking around with her and gave her a picture she was laughing loudly and saying my name a lot and I had a gut feeling from her eye contact because she held good eye contact and when I moved close to her didn’t flinch. Her friend asked me to tell the girl jokes and chase her down the hall as a joke. Early when we were joking around she held good eye contact longer than most people and I got a vibe from it and she was saying my name a lot.

The girl gets red while talking to me, hides her face, smiles, makes no eye contact. blushes and smiles when I say hi first. She can’t look me in the eyes and say hi first. She continued butting in my conversations to talk to me. Well her friend asked me to sit across from them. The girl had an attitude but found any excuse to talk to me and when they took turns with selfies next to me she had to be between us and asked me to get closer. She giggles and says my name for no reason. I told her friend I don’t take selfies she said “Me and Tina are going to take care of that”. The next day she comes and gets me when the girl is wearing something that shows cleavage for a selfie next to her. From that she blushed and asked me to get closer. When I talk to her she asks for a selfie with me or scares me. She hovers around me with her friend and approaches me with her friend trying to talk to me. Another friend looks at her and says her name when I enter a room. her friend’s comment nice things on our pictures. When she gets my attention and I talk to her she scares me or asks to take a selfie and to sit with her. She has me get closer every time and sends me the picture for me to post and tag her. She likes it then tells me the next day she likes it. When she sees my in the halls she can't say hi first or look me in the eyes. She can only approach me talk to me and flirt with me with her friend next to her. When I am not looking every opportunity she stares at me. She says my name a lot. When I say something bad she giggles and says my name. She compliments me a lot like new shirts haircut and so on. She has listened to my phone call with my mom and asked why I didn't say I love u at the end. Her friend goes around and finds information to tell her then she tells me what she heard about me. She has talked about me to her parents because she told me something that only they would know. She also has asked me where I live. When I looked at her and she caught me she smiled at me.

640,"I learned from my parents that to love someone meant sacrifice. They taught me the Golden Rule: to treat others how I would like to be treated. And in my experience, the world desperately needs more people like me; empathic, attentive, charitable, accommodating, generous, etc. This has come back to haunt my life in the worst way. Because now I am selfless, but unhappy.

I put myself last, always. I make sure other people have my time, attention, and resources until I’ve got none left for myself. I thought for a long time that somewhere, a karmic bank was just bursting with my deeds and dedication to others. I thought “paying it forward” was the  key to happiness. 

How do I practice this everlasting kindness towards myself? How do I justify saying no to someone who needs or wants something from me? How do I walk away and use that same energy to treat myself to something, without feeling heartless or selfish?

641,"I have been in a relationship with my partner for over two years and his family are very close,it took a long time for me to feel like his extended family liked me and I still feel somewhat of an outsider.

My boyfriend's cousin Sam* had been with this girl Emma* for about 3 months prior to her falling pregnant. The family seemed to accept her straight away and she started attending family events immediately. She is often on our property and yet we have never been introduced and she blatantly ignores us when she sees us. Since her falling pregnant they have moved in to a house together opposite ours. 

We have tried talking to her and being friendly as they are having a baby and she is now apart of the family, but we are shut down every time, she does not make it easy to like her. Emma is from a wealthy family and has never had to work for anything she has. Often giving off the impression of a girl that gets her own way. She is very immature because of this and doesn't seem to grasp the amount of work raising a child is going to take. Since moving into their house they have yet to cook for themselves as she doesnt know how to cook. 

Since Sam has been with Emma he seems a completely different person, no longer the friendly face we were used to seeing at family events. He now is barely seen and when he is, he's always rushing off somewhere. 

This is not my thoughts or feelings but Sam's parents would be the type to be highly critical of a couple having a baby prior to marriage, especially a couple who had only known eachother a matter of months. I know for a fact if it had been my partner and I in the same situation we would have been heavily criticised, instead of celebrated and being the talk of all events on how great the pregnancy is.  

Im really at a loss on how to improve the situation and am aware I'm viewing this all in the negative I'm tired of feeling like there's a tension anytime the family is together. Any advice on how to fix the situation? Do I have a right to be annoyed here or am I making something out of nothing?

642,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some encouragement and kind words :) 

So I work in this company for 5 years, and I was only on sick leave for one week in those 5 years until two weeks ago when I got a ""hard"" flu. I had fever for week or so.. Also my blood test wasn't the best so I had to take antibiotics and I had another blood test this friday. Well the results aren't so good.

 So I will have to be another week at home with more antibiotics and pills since my potassium levels are really low.

I asked my doctor if I should go to work but she said I can't and that I should stay this week at home so I could run some tests to make sure everything is going better.

So now the part where I feel stupid. I feel guilty for not going to work this week. I know it may be stupid but I don't know why I feel stupid... This is the first time I had something like this and while I'm feeling guilty about work I'm concerned about my health since it can be serious and I think I should listen to what my doctor says.

He responds jokingly ""I'll try"" 😂. 

I don't think he meant anything by it but it made me uncomfortable. He then brings up that he's available to hang out during nights if I'm up, which I'm not comfortable with. So I tried to subtly hint at that by saying that I put off most of my chores at night, and even added that daytime works best. He offers to help me with chores in the nighttime which I politely decline and thank him for his offer. I then ended the conversation by saying I had to go make dinner.

Me and this best freind (bf) have been hanging out, since i started at the school when i was around 9, we both are 15 now. He has always been ahead in the girls department, because he is a very comfident, and also nice looking dude.
Now, this girl started on our school about 2 years ago, and we instantly both thought she was really cute. I knew that i didn’t have a chance, but somehow, my freind thought he had. Long story short they were together for over a year (for a two 14-15 y/o’s thats a long time) and they just recently, about 7 days ago broke up.

Now i changed school after they had been together for a few months, so i don’t see them that often. Im good freinds with his now ex, and it just so happend we had arranged to meetup, and get drunk. Me and her had planned this before the 2 of them broke up, so no biggie.
Now to the main event. We chilled with some freinds for a bit and drank some alcohol, and then headed off to her place to chrash. I went in and bought a bottle of shots on the way home.
We snuck in, and went into her room. She found some premade popcorn, and we began watching netflix. After having finished the bottle, we were cuddling a little and 1 thing leads to another, and we make out, and have probs the best conversation of my life 10/10 we snuggled up in her single bed (spooning) at 4am and slept for a full 3 hours, before i snuck out.

Now to my question:
What the f*** do i do? We have talk, and we both feel the same way, we really loved the evening and, we had a really good time. But don’t know what to do, as my bf still is in love with her, and i we don’t want to hurt him. She also feels like she needs to mive ln properly, but that she really likes me.

648,"**Rant ahead tldr at the bottom**

I had been seeing this girl for a while and I was really into her but she was in a rough place emotionally. To respect her privacy I won't get into what she was going through but the point is at the end of the day she needed time alone to sort through what she was going through.

I knew all that from the start and thought it was going to be alright if I just waited but then in a shock to both of us she ended up staying the night at my place and it really mixed me up emotionally. Waking up to her knowing that I had to go to work but she'd be here when I got back was a feeling I didn't know how to process. I was so incredibly content, like nothing could have ruined that moment. But it was also when I realized I had no real place in her life yet. I wasnt her boyfriend and I wasn't going to be until she had sorted herself out but I had no idea how long that would take. I felt so strongly for her but at the moment we were nothing more than friends with benifits and I couldn't drag her into a relationship anymore than we had already kinda wound up in one. I couldn't be her boyfriend and expect her to work on herself at the same time and I knew unless I said something she was going to let me try and I just couldn't take that risk.

On top of that, I have anxiety. It's not the worst but it doesn't make things easy when someone isn't giving me their all. When something is off I catch it really easily and I stew in it until I eventually need to just clear my head out by telling my partner everything on my mind which can freak them out. Without her being able to give me her all I knew I'd be a mess of anxiety and she'd have to burden reassuring me that I'm not the problem again and again. That's not fair to either of us.

I ended things the next day and while I think it was the mature choice it's also incredibly painful knowing that by the time she's ready she may no longer want to be with me. I need help distracting myself from this feeling while everyone of my friends is busy with their own lives. What are some things I can do to stop thinking about her?

I'll get ahead of the criticism as well and say I know all of this seems juvenile and silly from a more mature perspective. I know there will be other girls. I'm 21, I know I'm young and there will be other people, but I'm living this now and those facts aren't helping me and I'm depressed. So if you have any advice on how to distract myself please share.

Well 4 years ago I joined the military and left home which he didn’t want me to do but he seemed to stick by my side nonetheless and we stayed connected and even tho I’m not much of a gamer, we would play hours of video games so we could talk and bullshit on chat like old times. Every time I came home on leave it was like I never left and we would immediately pick up where I left off, once it got within 6 months of my military separation date he seemed to get excited, he started making countless plans of what we should do when I got back and he actually started preparing for our plans by buying and setting up stuff. Him and his wife would constantly say how
They wish I was home all ready etc. well about a month ago I got home. The whole 2 day drive back we talked constantly but the night I arrived home nothing. I snapped him to which he opened it and didn’t respond. So next day my family plans a welcome back party and I text him to invite him and he sends back “not sure if I can go kinda busy”, to which I say “No problem we don’t have a set time, what does your schedule look like? Or I could bring you some left overs afterwards?”. No answer, for two days no answer which shocked me honestly considering I had been gone for a year and half since my last visit then he sends me a Snapchat about something random so I ask him why did he not respond and he just says “What? I never got anything that I didn’t reply too” and denies it. So I’m like umm ok must of missed it and he says sorry and seems genuine and invited me over for a Bon fire (which was one of the ideas we had planned for a while and he had saved up a lot of wooden pallets just for this) and he told me he had taken the week off and we had some beers hung out all day and it was awesome, again like I had never left. He even talked about how glad he was that I’m back. Then I head out at the end of the day and a few days later I ask what he’s up too this weekend. He says “I think I have something going on” I say “oh ok” and move on. Another few days go by and I invite him to hang out again to which he ignores and sends a meme back, when I asked again yes or no he just didn’t respond. Then next day he asked me to help him move his grandparents washer and dryer to which I said sure and went over to help for couple hours. Then a few days later he asks for help with some tires which I go help and then right after they drop hints as if they gotta go do something else so I go back home. At this point it’s the last day of his vacation time and been a couple days since I went over last and just asked how his day was going and what he was up too and he says he thinks he has something to do around the house. Couple hours later I see on his wife’s Snapchat story him in the background laying on the couch watching YouTube. Real busy huh. So at this point I’m getting frustrated because someone who’s supposed to be my best friend that I haven’t seen in almost two years couldn’t get off the couch to come to my welcome home party, has blown me off everyday except for one night unless he’s using me for help. So I stopped trying to hang with him and called up some friends that we used to mutually hang with and then he heard about it and messaged me with a bunch of questions like where did You go what did you do when and how etc as if he was jealous or mad I did something without him. So I tell him just HMU when your free cause you always tell me your busy. Well about a week later, I get invited to a party and message my best friends to ask what he’s doing that night as I wasn’t gonna be at the party long and he again almost gets salty and asks why I’m there. I just tell him so and so invited and what was he doing later cause I wanted to hang to which he opens and ignored. Couple hours later I send “so I guess that’s a no then huh?” To which again he opens and ignores and I haven’t talked to
Him all day. I’m so confused, honestly alittle
Hurt and worried. Like why out of nowhere is he doing this? We’ve always been so close. Am
I wrong to be upset? What can/should I do? Why would he act as if everything is so great when I was there if he felt different? My only theories are that possibly he’s gotten used to sitting around alone all day while I was gone and is having a hard time stopping the laziness or I know while back his wife told me he was saying how he said he was really depressed, could he be fighting that again? I don’t know who else to ask, thank you so much. If you need any other details I’ll answer.",07Apr2019,1
657,"Im 26 yr old and my whole life i felt like a C student but always feel like im ready for something great or to achieve it. Ive read every finance and self help book. Making ok money but feel to incline to my comfort zone. I feel like im a zombie and feel numb. Feel like a loser after seeing people achieve greatness. Comparison sucks i know but im human too. I hate myself for not being better but i do try daily. Im very impatient and have anxiety. Never had a girl and no friends. Hang with many of my cousins but they all dealing with their shit plus their kids etc. 

I commute 3hrs daily for a job with no growth and i apply to new jobs daily. Trying not to give up but i feel numb so bad. I save every penny and feel the urge in my body to jump up run and scream many times. I cant relax and want to have fulfillment as well has feel alive. 

Why do i feel this way and how do i improve. Have no social life, commute alot of hours and not doing /taking any risk which makes u feel alive ",07Apr2019,2
658,"(F 19) Been feeling depressed and uninterested in things I used to love. I really want to befriend people but I can't seem to connect with anyone. That's how it's always been, actually.

I always think people perceive me negatively. Like I am weird, ugly, cowardly, a child...

My crippling social anxiety doesn't help at all. Been having issues with my self-esteem as well. If only I could be that happy and optimistic person I used to be.

All I seem to waste my time on these days is browsing social media, crying, and regretting my life choices.

How can I feel happy and motivated again? How do I stop caring what others think of me? It's so easy to say "" just stop caring what others think of you"" but I always forget in the moment.",07Apr2019,2
660,"I'm a 13-year-old transgender male. I live with my mom, stepdad, two older sisters who are twins and a year older than me (14, about to be 15), my little sister (5), my dog, and two cats. 

I feel like they all hate me.

I used to be in a good mood all the time but now I'm constantly in a bad mood and my little sister is always rude to me now.

My older sisters constantly pick on me. 

My mom and stepdad don't give a shit about me. 

Example One: last school year, I was called down to the nurse for a mandatory eye check (mandatory for all students) and I found out my left eye was near-sighted. There was a letter mailed to my house saying that I should see an eye doctor. She ignored it even though she hung it up on the fridge and every time I mentioned it, my mom would yell at me. I brought it up a few weeks ago and she said: ""why doesn't your father take you?!"" And I already asked him when I went to his house for a weekend and he doesn't have my insurance or else he would have brought me. I told her he doesn't have insurance but she said ""well, he could have brought you to America's Best. You can pay out of pocket there."" Which neither my dad nor I knew. She bought my sisters a $900 king-sized bed and bought them each $700 iPhones on Christmas (my older sisters). But she won't take me to the eye doctor. 

Example Two: I was at my best friend's this weekend and she moved out of her grandma's house with her mom and moved into a nicer house a few blocks away. She doesn't have hot water yet so I couldn't shower and we didn't do anything anyway so we were just lounging around but the thing is: my hair gets greasy easily. VERY EASILY. So earlier this evening (about an hour before I'm writing this), I was sitting at the table eating the cold pre-made sub my mom bought with my little sister sitting across from me eating her small kiddie microwave burritos and I was resting my head on my hand while eating the sub with my other and with my always ""in a bad mood face"" that I've developed my Mom asked me what's wrong and the word ""nothing"" was half-way out of my mouth before she said ""you look disgusting!"" All because my hair was greasy. 

Example Three: My phone has the right half of the screen glitchy and impossible to use, it's able to function but you can't see anything on that side. So, I showed my mom and she said ""well. (Stepdad) and I am getting new phones soon so you can have this one. Excuse me, what? My past two phones have both been hand-me-downs. They both have come to be in bad condition and one of my older sisters (my favorite one) said I could have her old phone and my stepfather won't even do anything for me.

I swear they all hate me. I can't sit with them in the living room without them not saying anything to me or insulting me. And if you say ""well, they probably can't afford a new phone"" first off: see example one, and my stepdad makes six figures and my mom makes a little less than that. Also, should it be normal for a kid to be afraid to stand up for themselves to their parents or are even afraid to tell them stuff????

I have:

\-no grade below a 90

\-Great hygiene

\-A stable relationship

\-A talent for creative writing

\-I'm quite

\-I never have friends over

\-I do my chores without putting up a fight

\-Don't argue

Help me, please. What do I do?",07Apr2019,1
661,"Hey, thanks for clicking on my thread, would really appreciate your opinion. 

It just feels like each day bleeds into the next. It feels like the last few years have just flown by without me noticing, I mean we’re a third through 2019 and I could of sworn it was Christmas yesterday. At the moment I’m in my last (4th) year of military service, so I’ll be out by Christmas. Work wise this year is a write off, I’m literally just waiting for discharge, I’m trying to educate myself in the meantime. I’m really looking forward to getting out, but despite the options I have I’m worried I’ll make the wrong choice in what path I take, or what should motivate me. Should I chase wealth? I’m very money driven, but will I find myself feeling empty in the pursuit of materialism? How do I find my passion? If I can’t find it, do I just grind through a job I dislike? It’s all so vague. 

I guess I just feel like I’m missing out on what a young person should be doing, I’ve never had a relationship, and I feel I’d be pretty difficult to be with as I’m not a very sociable person. I think drinking, clubbing, festivals etc are rather boring, all I really do on weekends and evenings consists of working out (big fan of fitness) and gaming or watching tv. I want to travel but I do t want to do it on my own any more. I’m pretty unconfident aesthetically too, I’m in good shape but I lost all my hair (bar eyebrows and beard) at 17 which sort of killed my self esteem. I’m only going to be young once, I’m scared I’ll hit my 40s having never had a relationship. I’ve always made friends wherever I’ve gone as I’ve moved around a lot since I was a kid, and I’ve had some good friends, but I’ve never had a truly close friend.

I’ve been very aware of our own mortality as living beings this last year, if that makes sense. A friend I was pretty close with at high school passed away suddenly. It hit me hard. I’m very close with my parents, so to see them wear down of age as they’ve hit their mid 50s scares me. My dad especially, in the last few years his physical deterioration has been very prominent. The thought of something happening to them fills me with horror. It’s like, any one of us could go in a split second, just like that. Whether we’re diagnosed with a terminal illness or involved in an accident, everything could change in an instant. That in itself has just been on my mind constantly. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is whilst I’m young and healthy, I want to make the most of every day, but I don’t know how. I want a purpose, not just wake up, go to work, workout, eat, go to bed. I want to feel like I’m living, not like I’m existing, while I’m still here. I hope that wasn’t too long or boring a read, thanks a lot for your time.",07Apr2019,1
662,Is there a way to tactfully tell my coworker that not everyone wants to listen to his loud-ass WatchMojo video or anime top ten list videos in the break room? I try to be very polite to everyone but it's driving me insane. I have absolutely no idea why people think it's okay to do that. Any advice?,07Apr2019,8
663,I was in a game and I got mad so I quit it. I then got up trying to break whatever’s I front of me but if was so odd feely that I could barely pick something up because it felt heavy. Don’t know if it had to do with my mental state or not but I still feel the same way (it’s been 12mins) and idk what this is. ,07Apr2019,1
664,"I'm 15 years old and I've just never been very motivated. In general. I find it hard to do my homework because I just find it more tedious than anything. I still don't really have any hobbies except for video games and watching shows. I've joined multiple after-school activities, but I seem to always end up quitting on them. I quit robotics because every time i went we did nothing, I quit archery for no reason, and I quit going to the gaming club because I disliked the people there.

If there's one thing I was ever motivated to do it was to code. I used to code in Game Maker Studio for a while but decided I wanted to move on to C#. Like a year later and I still have no clue how to because I haven't really taken the time to learn.

If this was something that just started recently (aka puberty) I would be able to reason that it's not as problematic as it is. But in truth, I feel like I've always been unmotivated to do anything. I think I get it from my mother? Is there some kind of genetic influence on this stuff?

It's really hard to do anything other than schoolwork and leisure. There was a point where I was totally content and happy with the way my life was, but recently I've felt less enjoyment doing this stuff. I really want to gain an interest, but I always end up giving up on in.

I've never asked reddit though. Anyone else go through the same stuff? Anyone successfully gain motivation as late into life as me?",07Apr2019,1
665,"I've been dating this girl for seven months, and it's been the best relationship either of us have ever had. We're both in college, and I have an extremely busy schedule for all four years (Music major). A few nights ago, she told me that I just don't have enough time for her anymore. She knows that I would give her the time if I had it, but I just physically can't. So she broke up with me. It was incredibly emotional and really difficult for both of us, and from what I've heard through mutual friends, it still is for her. 

I want to talk to her and try to mend things, but her argument is correct. I have very little time, and while this semester is harder than most, It will be hard for me to give her the time she needs. 

What should I do?",07Apr2019,1

I know this a weird question but I have usually just dated guys from the same friend circle or through a dating app. But with this guy I don’t know I’ve just randomly seen him around and how the heck are you suppose to get to know someone you don’t know without knowing them through class, an app, friends. And I would only have one shot and I feel like such a weirdo already about this . I don’t know why I’m drawn to him but unless I give it at least one shot I would regret it. ",07Apr2019,1
