2,"I work in factory and I don't want to work there the rest of my life.

I worked as a dental assistant for a couple of months and I didn't like it so I went back to my old factory job.

I'm interested in working with babies and healthcare related jobs, but I'm really bad at small talk with people and I get really nervous when talking through procedures and what not with patients. When I get nervous, my hands start to get shaky. So I'm open to other suggestions.

I just want something that's a good fit for me. I don't want to have to go to an actual campus since it would be a drive (I live in a town that has next to nothing), and it would be hard for me to have to do any clinical/on site/on the job type of study with my current job and family to take care of.

Any help would be appreciated, TIA.",04Jul2019,2
3,"I've just recently (6 months or so) started working for my fiance's family business. I want to have my own business someday, and the business they run does really well for itself. Her family and I discussed my goal of eventually owning my own business (possibly this one), and that the business would still be in the family since I'm marrying their daughter. 

Now that I've gotten into the business, I see all the problems and bullshit that goes on. It's a bar and there's a lot of issues that just get swept under the rug. Employees are consistently not doing what they're supposed to do, the building itself is falling apart, employees are drinking on the job, and there's a lot of sanitary issues that have been going on for years. 

I'm sort of stuck in the middle of all of this, and I don't really have a say as to what goes on. I've brought these issues up multiple times to them but they are never here to lay down the hammer. They don't seem to care as long as they are getting their paycheck at the end of the day. It's left me very frustrated with them that they aren't willing to step in and do anything about it. There are zero consequences for people not doing their jobs. 

I can't really talk to my fiance about it because she gets defensive with the whole situation and we just end up fighting. So I end up bottling things up and it's really taking its toll on my mental health and our relationship.

So the reason I need advice is because I don't know how to go about this. Should I line up another job? Should I just stick it out? Should I quit even without another job lined up? I don't want to have hurt feelings between her family and me just because I wasn't happy at their business.

I also don't have any clue as to what I would do for work beyond this. I have a degree but I really don't want to go into the corporate bullshit world. Starting a business from the ground up is expensive (and hard obviously), not to mention I have no idea what kind of business I would actually enjoy. 

I just feel lost and I'm getting more frustrated and unhappy everyday.",04Jul2019,2
4,"I am not trying to sound spoiled with this post.

I really want to have a Sweet 16, but my parents do not want me to have one. I have not had a birthday party since 3rd grade and all of my friends are throwing these huge parties that are so much fun. I really want to be able to enjoy my sixteenth birthday with my friends and family, get a nice dress, nice cake, and just have a fun time at my party.

I would be open to the option of having a cheaper party ‚Äî even having my friends come over for a movie night, pizza, and a sleepover. But my parents claim that our house is not suitable for friends to come over and have a party.

I understand this sounds ridiculous, but I have been dreaming of having a Sweet since I was little. I have even offered to pay for half of the party (and I did so much research to find a very good price range with everything I want, rather than blowing $10,000 on the party). 

Is there any way I can convince my parents?",04Jul2019,1
6,"Yes, I‚Äôm a bisexual male but people tell me that at first glance they think i‚Äôm gay because of how I walk, talk ect.  So here‚Äôs a list with things I want to change

-Hand gestures while talking]
When talking I use my hands a lot to help me deliver a message more clearly when talking to someone but my dad sometimes yells at me for doing that and tells me ‚ÄúTo act more masculine‚Äù.

-Speech]
People tell me my voice is feminine also that I talk too fast.

-Walking]
I don‚Äôt know how but people tell me I don‚Äôt walk like a man, which makes me not wanting to walk anymore because of that insecurity

-Reactions] 
I sometimes react by covering my hand(s) over my mouth if I‚Äôm shocked or surprised, and when I gasp, my gasp is like, not deep (as in the sound isn‚Äôt deep).  And when I‚Äôm happy, I raise my voice to a lighter voice

I come from a family of noncollege, and rather poor. I want to go into college, but im afraid of my major (Political Science) (--&gt; law School) as when I read into Lawyers, they don't earn as much as I beleived. I know you should never do something for the money, but that really is a deciding factor in my ideal job. But I'm still afraid that ""What if I really don't like law"" then, what can my major get me? I'm just overwealmed, and afraid tbh. Any ""job test"" I take is always unclear, and I just don't have a clear path in my mind for what I should for my future. I'm a type 1 diabetic, so many paths I wanted to pursue, like an airline pilot, are crushed. I feel like I have a responisbility to take care of my family (Mom and sister) as they are both retail workers, and quiet frankly, will probobly never own a home in their lives.

13,"I was a member of a kik group and everything was running smoothly until this morning. I woke up to find a bunch of loose razors and a small blood smear in our shower. I have several roommates and last night one of them was in the bathroom making some noise like he was sick with diarrhea, which I know happens from time to time so I wasn't particularly worried about it, so I went back to sleep. This morning when I saw the blades and stuff I started to get worried and contacted the landlord because I panicked and didnt know what else to do. I didn't want to call the cops because I really had no evidence that anything happened and I've been accused of overreacting my entire life. I started telling this group about it and one of the members was telling me I should try to help this guy, which is all well and good but there is a bad history there.

The roommate, I'll call him A, is an asshole. He has woken me up in the middle of the night most days since he moved in a few weeks ago, usually arguing with different women he's brought home. He's been stealing food from all of us that live there and doesn't care about it. We've talked with the landlord about it but he wants to give A a chance. I have no good feelings towards him. I've been working full time and attending night school, I need my sleep.

This person in the group was telling me I should counsel him and make sure he's okay and be the guy to help him through whatever it is he's going through. I told her that I would do what I could but I don't have the time or the mental strength to stretch myself out that thin. I asked the group not to hate me but I needed to go to work.



So I began this earlier this morning and since then I was able to rejoin the group and post an update on the situation, after which I was promptly removed and probably blocked. I am unbelievably sad about this. I have undiagnosed Aspbergers (my therapist and I both believe I have it but haven't been formally diagnosed) and because of it I have severe social anxiety. Coupled with depression I'm just...Im feeling absolutely horrible like I just want to curl myself up in a ball and fade away.

Anyone that can give me some advice on how to cope right now would be a giant help. Thanks for reading and sorry it's so long.",04Jul2019,1

18,"So I should start by saying I took a year out of things due to mental health issues.

Last year I finished a btech in creative media games design with a very good grade and which I really enjoyed, and I‚Äôm located by one of the biggest hubs for games companies in the world, I‚Äôd love to work as a designer but that isn‚Äôt exactly an entry level job or a concept artist but my artwork just isn‚Äôt good enough.

I love the games industry but I‚Äôm also kinda scared to go down that route with all the stories about how poorly employees get treated and how much uncertainty and turnover there is, which is something I feel I would not cope with well.

Theres also the other route of training to be a therapist/counsellor. I really want to try and help people with mental health issues. Id like to think I‚Äôve always been a very empathetic and caring person and feel like this would be a good route for me too but would require years more of study to get anywhere and feels like I will be committing to it if i start that training

I‚Äôve also thought of the idea of potentially doing both as an indie developer in the background of counselling work but I have no idea how feasible that would even be

I don‚Äôt even know how to begin to make this decision and im feeling a lot of pressure to get plans moving, I know where i would go to study for counselling and if i was to start i need to apply and make a decision soon

21,"We live down a quite quiet dead-end street (in London). Opposite our house is a small car park (could fit maybe 3 cars). We‚Äôve lived here for 3 years and no-one ever uses this car park. Basically, none of the neighbours know if anyone‚Äôs allowed to park in it so no one does in case they get a fine.

Anyway, about 4/5 nights ago a little red card started pulling into the car park late at night. They rev the engine a lot outside the house and then seem to retire to the corner of the car park. Both mornings (late around 11am) the car is still there. Gone around 9pm and seems to return in the early hours each day. 

As far as I have been able to see it‚Äôs just one guy. Alone in his car, facing my house. I don‚Äôt know why this is weirding me and my partner out so much, maybe because the street has always been quiet and that car park reasonably empty.

25,"I‚Äôm 19. I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist for psychotic depression for almost six months now, but I haven‚Äôt come clean about a major problem: I hear voices. One male, one female arguing with each other about whether I‚Äôm a bad person, whether I have DID (I don‚Äôt), whether I should sleep or not, whether I should hurt myself. The male voice is almost always in the zorastra sucks and deserves bad things camp, and the female chimes in to defend me. I had a bad night on Monday, slept for like two hours because the guy was yelling at me not to sleep because he thinks I become a little boy and do bad things in my sleep (he‚Äôs way crazier than I am). I want to figure out how to cope with this better. I have a therapy appointment on Friday, and I think it‚Äôs time to broach the topic with my therapist.

Problems:
1. I‚Äôm scared my therapist will be angry and not trust me anymore. I‚Äôve kept this a secret from her for a long time, and I‚Äôm really ashamed of that fact and of the fact that I hear things. 
2. I‚Äôm scared my therapist will try to put me back in a psych ward. Those places are the worst; I‚Äôve been in four times and could not bear to be committed again. The first time I was committed was because I told someone I trusted about this and they called EMS and I was strapped down and force fed medication that made me unable to function. 
3. I‚Äôm scared my therapist will think I‚Äôm completely insane and not want to help me anymore or will think I‚Äôm unable to be helped. 
4. I‚Äôm scared my therapist will not believe me.
5. I‚Äôm just really, really scared.

38,"I've 'high functioning depression' and generally well presented but a lot of the time I wonder why the hell I bother. I've no one in my life to look good for and I never meet anyone to date. 

I'm a woman nearing 40 and still single, I never wanted to be married but I do want a long-term monogamous partner and I wanted a kid...I'm not ugly but I can't help but think if no one really wanted me in my twenties then why the hell would they want me now? I look on Instagram to see all these women much younger and more attractive than me, I can't help but get down.

There's also another part of me that thinks looks aren't everything, there are plenty of people in the world who don't meet beauty standards but have happy healthy loving relationships. So I feel sort of in limbo between wanting to cut myself some slack for things like getting older and gaining weight, but then also feel guilty too. 

I'm not bad looking for my age, with a little weight loss and gym I'd be better, but my depression leads to emotional eating and I just can't seem to bring myself to face the gym again. 

I just feel too worthless to even try.",04Jul2019,1
39,"So I‚Äôm wanting to quit juuling for two reasons.

To save money
And I don‚Äôt want to worry abt feining or crave it anymore.

The reason I don‚Äôt want to stop is because it gives me something to do and everyday I get exited for the ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù the first hit of the day gives me. I love this feeling and personally there‚Äôs nothing better and I look forward to this everyday. Like after my morning buzz I don‚Äôt get one for the rest of the day so I look forward to the next morning so I can get another one.i also think abt it all the time and I feel like I need it every hour or two.

How do I get motivation to quit so I can stop thinking abt juuling constantly. It‚Äôs controlling my life. Help please!",04Jul2019,1

41,"My mother and I were very close up until recently, we rarely fought and we were very upfront about our problems. After a few life challenges and changes, I found my mood was going downhill, and I became low spirited in my daily life. This had an impact on my life, whereas I am very much more introverted now, my room is almost always in a state of mess, and I get stressed easily. Today she came into my room and began to berate me on the state of it again, and something in me kind of snapped and I realized I can‚Äôt take it anymore. She always seems to grab into the places that hurt the most, whether it be small things like getting angry when I don‚Äôt leave the house because of anxiety, or making direct insults at my person and saying how lazy or dramatic I am. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my mother, but I don‚Äôt like her at all. I‚Äôm trying to get better but she keeps dragging me back down again, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

44,"A little backstory here. My ex and I met sometime in our second year of high school. We clicked nearly instantly but neither knew how to ask the other out. I eventually asked her out and it was a little awkward since neither of us really know what to do. Time passes and she said she would love to.

We start dating. And here is where everything goes down hill.

I have anxiety and depression. This is relevant to the story. Everything goes well. We are open with eachother and don't really keep secrets. She told me how she was polyamorus. She said she wanted to start a polyamorus relationship. I was not on board but, I was afraid of being alone again.

Thoughts started rushing through my head. ""She doesn't love you"" 
""She wants to leave you"" 
""If you say no, she will definitely leave you""

Out of fear, I let it happen. The worst part is, none of those thoughts were true. They would have never happened. She would have stayed and been happy with me.

The relationship made me feel unwanted. Made me feel alone again. And I took a turn for the worst. I started to manipulate her. Mentally abusing her. Threatening my life because she knew I had thoughts of suicide. Eventually, she broke up with me but.. She kept talking to me.

She cared about me. She didn't want me to die. She still loved me after she broke up with me. But I didn't see it. Months pass and I was still manipulating her but in small doses. It was still the wrong thing to do. I changed how I got her attention to nsfw sort of stuff. We never saw each other after the break up so, all was done by phone.

She eventually realized she was doing something wrong. I kept at it but again, slowed down on it. Then, she told me she isn't sure if she wants to keep talking to me anymore. I was heartbroken by this but, I started to see I was doing things the wrong way. I told her it's fine. I won't do anything. 

The time that I was not talking to her, it made me re-think everything. I started to make changes to my way of thinking. I saw all the things I did wrong and what I could have done right. But I still feel like I haven't changed. It might be the anxiety asking if I'm being abusive and my depression answering with ""yes."" I just want to change.

But the reason why I'm hear is to get advice on how not to reach out to her. I want to give her space. I want to change. I just want her, and everyone around me, to be happy. I don't want to make the same mistake again.",04Jul2019,1

46,"Hi all, with the 4th of July, all of my roommates have gone home and literally all of my friends have gone somewhere with family, so I'm alone in my apartment and on campus until Sunday. I've been in a particularly rough mental health rut (re: my post history), so I'm feeling very anxious about the next few days completely alone. I want to try to go into this with a positive attitude out the gates because I'm the kind of person to just drop dead when my anxiety flares up. 

I guess what I'm asking is, what are your guys' favorite things to do while alone? TV recommendations? Movie recommendations? Literally anything! I just need something to preoccupy my mind and thoughts until everyone gets back.",04Jul2019,1
47,"I‚Äôve tried making a list and asking nicely for some help but it seems like they just forget or are ‚Äútoo tired‚Äù. It kinda seems unfair to me since I work as well and have mainly been the one to cook and clean on a regular basis. I use to be the first one home so I would clean right away and ask what to prepare for dinner but now they‚Äôre the first ones home. And I‚Äôm the one coming home to dirty dishes, clothes left in the washer, dirty clothes and shoes on the floor, nasty toilet, etc. I don‚Äôt clean or cook for fun but why am I the one taking the responsibility while they get to relax? I‚Äôm tired too you know?",04Jul2019,1
48,"So, at work I'm a residential cleaner and anyone whos done this job knows that some houses just have this creepy vibe to them. From the first time in this place we things weren't right...everything seemed off.

Fast foreward to we have been cleaning this place for a couple months at least now and just last friday while we were there I swear to god I saw the daughter (shes in ger 20s we think) come downstairs to where her dad (and I were but I dont know if she saw me). I heard him say ""oh its you"" in a very sultry way then then in the relfection of the tv screen while I was dusting I saw her embracing him, he was sitting down at a desk, and her face extremely close to his. Like it looked like she was kissing him. Then he was telling her to go away and she said ""what? Is that wrong? Is it not right?"" 

Then I looked down as I was starting to shake and panic then he said go away one more time but more with more anger then she just quickly walked away and went up stairs to her room again.


Some weird things we have also noticed:

-he went into her room one time and locked the door, stayed in there for the whole time

-when he asked why her door was shut one time (as we dont clean rooms with shut doors) he said ""are we going to have a problem?"" She replied with ""i dont know are we?"" In a weord way

Mind you these last two examples my coworkers witnessed not me. 


So honestly, yeah thats pretty much it. I told my boss and he said he will talk it over with uis wife as we all have no fucking kdea what to do and this is a very touchy subject. I DO NOT want to be accusing someone of somthing like this and for all we know thats how they show affection. But with how cold they all come off and how weird the vibe is plus the other stuff im really torn and have no idea what to do. Its been weighing on me tons. 

Any advice would be welcomed please, and please remember I said *I think* and never said that this is for sure happening",04Jul2019,22

52,"I know this sounds super ghetto, but I rejected a few calls from an unknown number multiple times today, and they eventually left a voicemail indicating that they found out who I am, know where I live, as well as where family members and ex girlfriends live (with proof)... and will be sending people out to those locations to repossess my mother‚Äôs truck.

My mom was sent to jail a few months ago following a DUI incident. I am not living with her or currently in contact with her due to unrelated factors, but I would still like to help her as much as I can. I know where her truck is, at her most recent address. I‚Äôm guessing the repo company doesn‚Äôt know about this because it‚Äôs been sitting there ever since she was arrested, about 4 months ago. The tags are removed, as well.

My plan is to play stupid with the repo guys. Something along the lines of ‚ÄúOh man, I‚Äôm sorry. But I really have no idea where her car would be. A truck, you said? You‚Äôre welcome to come by at my address and check. I‚Äôll get you a beer if you‚Äôd like. But you‚Äôre not going to find it at any of those places. I really don‚Äôt know, man. Sorry I can‚Äôt be of help.‚Äù

Would some bullshit like that work, assuming they don‚Äôt uncover her new address? What else, in my power, can I do to blow them off?

Note: Moving the vehicle is out of the question. She has an interlock attached, that‚Äôs currently irremovable, and calibrated to her breathing.

I called my mom two days after we did it but I couldn't manage to tell her so I didn't. I called her again the next day (yesterday) and she took me to the hospital. After waiting for a long time the doctor told me I needed to take plan b so I did. However, she told me that there's only a 58% chance it will work and if I miss my period in a month I have to take a pregnancy test. Obviously I'm super nervous, scared and ashamed of what happened and I can't think of what I'll do if I miss my period. This had also caused a strain on my home life as my parents aren't talking to eachother and my dad won't even look at me.

56,"So; me (also female 17) and my gf we‚Äôre going out for 2 months; that said we both liked each other for 9 months prior. This was her first relationship. 


I have severe depression and anxiety along with potential DID or schizophrenia although it was only discussed with my therapist and never officially diagnosed. Anyways this week my depression was hELL. I wrote a suicide note and everything was horrible. Eventually I managed to get through it with help from my parents. 


In the note I referenced her; basically telling her not to kill herself. Once I felt I was better (although I definitely wasn‚Äôt in my right mind) I showed her it, purely bcs I wanted her to know my depression wasn‚Äôt her fault and that I would want her to be okay ‚Äî-&gt; I should not have done this at ALL I know so please don‚Äôt comment telling me how manipulative it seems it was the biggest lapse in judgement I‚Äôve had. 


She now is having a stressful time (will not reveal it for privacy reasons) and I hate seeing her like this. 

So she‚Äôs going through some depressive episodes and anxiety 

That said; she‚Äôs shutting me out a little; snapping at me when trying to help, in knowing her for a while she‚Äôs never behaved like this before. 
The only real change, is me. 
A lot of the negative things happening to her have been a direct impact of our relationship (homophobia) 

And she‚Äôs moving away for a short while (1 month maybe longer) as am I for the same amount of time. 

I‚Äôm also split on two universities; one near her and one a couple hundred miles away. Both equally good for their fields. 

For me my anxiety is through the roof because of not being able to help her. 

I‚Äôve had insomnia for a while sleeping at 8am and waking up at 12pm on average. 

I know that there‚Äôs no more I can do that tell her I‚Äôm there for her and give her space. 

But then again, should we break up it would help her home situation a little bit. It would also appease a lot of her stress and mine. 

Since we wouldn‚Äôt see each other for a while anyways there‚Äôs plenty of time to cope with the situation, and if we were to break up I would change universities to be further away so we would be far away from each other; meaning sh can get on with her life, and should we remain friends it wouldn‚Äôt impact on her getting a new relationship. 

Obviously I do believe that I love her and I want what‚Äôs best for her and as much as I hate to admit it; I am coming to the conclusion that I‚Äôm not the best for her, due to my anxiety disorder and depression and the fact I‚Äôm not a man. 

Then again I could be wrong and end up ruining things for her, if she‚Äôs already struggling it might tip her over the edge. 

I suggested breaking up once I learnt about us not seeing each other and she did not take it well at all; so obviously I went back on my words and we stayed together, 
I really want what‚Äôs best for her and I would truly hate for her mentality to be compromised because of me. 
Maybe I could suggest a break while she gets her head together? 
Any advice would be appreciated!",04Jul2019,1

70,"After a bit of a doozy of a fight between my mom and I regarding me moving states, I'm making this post.   


My boyfriend(29) and I(f21) have been in a year and a half long distance relationship, and we're thinking about me moving states (only about five hours away, really) in order for us to start a life together. He already has a place, rent is MUCH cheaper in his state (close to over a thousand a month cheaper), and I have the opportunity to transfer with both my current salary AND my college credits. He currently has finished a seasonal position with one job and is looking for another, but doesn't have plans to move back to where I am, where we met. He'd lived in my hometown for around five years or so and decided to move back near his family since he hadn't been near them in so long.   


Personally, I would rather him move back up here and we just get an apartment together, but I understand him not wanting to move back. His father has the beginnings of some kidney disease and I think it's making him feel as if he would be missing out on this time with his dad while he's still relatively healthy if he moved back. I'm not going to be too terribly bitter about it; though it does make me feel like I'm held at less of a standard than his family sometimes.   


I also wouldn't have too much of a problem moving down there because of my current living situation: I've been living with my family still while I both do work/school full time, but my family is stressing me out to the point where I want to move right this instant. Every time my mom drinks a beer, like clockwork, she gets on a high horse and she can do no wrong and she tells me what's wrong with my life. The fight consisted of her comparing my boyfriend and me to her first marriage, and basically told me all the wrong things with our relationship. The age difference, my boyfriend not willing to move back any time soon, me not taking school seriously enough and throwing my life away for a man, blah blah blah.   


There are five people crammed into my one tiny one house. Any food I buy for myself gets eaten if I leave it in the fridge, even with my name on it, so some nights I end up going to bed only having cheese and crackers for dinner. Every time my extended family comes over for a get together, it ends with everyone wasted and fighting, sometimes with an injury that requires stitches. All of this in front of my preteen and teenage siblings. I sometimes go days without showering because we have one bathroom that my family all hogs and doesn't consider that anyone else may need to use it. They regularly use slurs like f\*ggot and n\*gg\*r (and encourage my siblings to do so) and it makes me crazily uncomfortable, and they get angry with me when I don't say it along with them. I do not like my living situation, and I want to move out. I have no friends looking for housing in my hometown and I don't want to room with someone I'm unfamiliar with. So that leaves my boyfriend.   


The plan for months has been for me to move down there, but am I making a stupid choice? I've already contacted the colleges/told my employer about a possible transfer and everything would go smoothly; is it too crazy to move states (or, about five hours away, it's barely a state away) this early in my life, or should I take the leap and do it? Moving and experiencing new things is part of life, right? His parents are nothing but supportive so I would even have their help during the transition, along with my boyfriend.",04Jul2019,0

I guess I'll start with an intro. I'm 19 years old, male, with severe kidney failure. Doctors predict that dialysis will start in about a year. I'm off course scared but that can wait for now. Start at the beginning.

So I was born to two drug addicts. My real mom did meth when I was cooped up in there and I think that's why the kidney problems are here. According to my uncle, I was left to lay in my own diapers for almost an entire day, with no interaction. I just stared at the ceiling I guess idk lol. Anyway zoom ahead 9 months. 

My real dad drops me off at my uncle's house for me to babysit, never to be seen again. My real parents knew about my kidney problems of course but were either too high or just not too be bothered with me to not give me medicine, etc. So I'm at my uncle's house, 9 months old weighing all of 15 pounds and can't move at all on my own. My uncle and Aunt, who I call mom and dad now, saved me from near death when I was a toddler. They adopted me and took care of me. 

I had my kidney transplant when I was seven years old. I still remember it. Anyway, every single doctor appointment, every single hospital stay, everything doctor related, my dad was there. I feel closer to him and I love him. My dad being my uncle, if I say dad or mom from now on I mean my aunt and uncle. My mom rarely if ever showed up at the hospital and soccer games when I was younger, it was all my dad. I think that's why present day I feel that's why I love him and not my mom.

Present day or the last decade: I have to deal with constant bantering, nitpicking, looks of hatred, among other things that my mom only does to me. She only treats me this way, and what she does my dad does. He does nothing to help. When he gets mad, it's just worse. My siblings and I are called all sorts of names like assholes, dumbasses, worthless, stupid, bitch, etc. It doesn't sound like alot but hearing it from your own parents for nearly 12-15 years, it starts to knock you down. They only say those kind of things to my brother and sister when they are in major trouble, but I have to hear it everyday over me doing the smallest stuff. I won't pretend I'm perfect either, I've stolen from them, lied to them, worse of all I broke several old dishes that were my grandma's that she gave to my mom before she passed from liver cancer in 2009. My parents think I did it on purpose and I still have myself for doing it. 

My dad moved to Virginia to take on a higher role as an air traffic controller back in 2015 I believe. I just know it's been a long time. My parents are still together so everything is stretched thin when he's gone. My mom can go full on rampage mode, screaming at everyone if we do the smallest things. She's mad constantly and my brother and sister can say that I did something and she accepts it without question. 

I've had to live my entire life with barely any contact with friends except through school and rare occurrences where I can have out with them on the weekend or something. I don't have a phone or computer unless I have one in secret, like for now, I don't have any video games to talk or hangout with friends through that, no TV in my room while there's one in every bedroom, and video game consoles in my brother and sisters room. My brother and sister need only ask and they can do whatever they want, whenever. I have to complete a chore list before I can do anything, rarely do I get to go before I have to complete something. It sounds petty to complain about this stuff, I know, but when I have nothing to do while my siblings have everything before them, it's hard.

Now I'll get into why I can't just run away. I have to take a morning and evening meds everyday. It probably rounds up to 30 pills in one day. I have to cath through a mitrofanoff witch is basically a tube from my bellybutton to my bladder. I have to drink a certain amount of water everyday. Blah blah blah. All this medical stuff that is required for me to know, but I already know. My parents think I'm some monkey that doesn't know how to do anything but I've been able to do all the things on my own for ages now. My dad took it a step further and commanded guardianship over me. He tried to be a conservator as well but the judge thinks there's no need when I work part time at a local grocery store. I don't work there anymore, that was last year. Any money I make is put away through automatic checking or whatever it is where jobs just send the check to your bank. But the account is under my mom's name so I can't get my money on my own. I haven't worked in a year because my dad denies me it because I have to pass school first, I understand that, but he cant call me a free loader when I have offered countless times to pay rent, right? 

Anyway all those medical things need insurance, an address to send to, along other things. I can't just leave when they can track wherever I have the meds sent. My dad, as guardian, has the right to send police to get me and I'm just because I'm this shit hole. I have been diagnosed with severe depression and I know it's only because of living here. I've had the depression since maybe 2013. IDC I'm not keeping track. I just know it sucks here but I'm trapped. I failed every class in 11th grade because I had no drive to do anything. I tried to kill myself  4 times then. I just want to leave. Anything will help thank you. 

TL:DR- I believe I live in a mentally abusive household and want to leave but medical responsibilities are holding me back thanks.",04Jul2019,1

80,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub to post this in. If not, please point me in the right direction. I didn‚Äôt know where else to go to ask about this. Please bare with me here, I know this is going to be hard to follow because I don‚Äôt know exactly how to word this so that somebody on here will understand what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm only 24 and I don‚Äôt really have any experience dealing with banks and certainly don‚Äôt have experience dealing with something like this. 

To begin, my grandmother, who is literally the sweetest most kind hearted woman in the world, appears to be in a serious situation right now. She has been talking to this person online for the last 6 months apparently. It started out on Facebook, a man who is going by the name ‚ÄúJames Henninger‚Äù added her as a friend and  struck up a conversation with her. Before long it moves from Facebook to texting her phone and then to google hangouts (which I‚Äôve heard is notorious for being used by scammers). 

She has apparently been sending him money here and there, started out as just sending amazon gift cards to him at some address in New York. The guy told her that he is stationed in Syria and gave her a whole sob story about how his platoon was bombed and he lost all of his personal belongings and had no way to access his money. He asked her to open up a bank account with SunTrust and send him money through that. He also had a box of checks sent to her home. I don‚Äôt know every detail because she is obviously not being 100% transparent with us about it because she is embarrassed that she has fallen for this. I‚Äôm not sure if he has access to the account or what, but I‚Äôm assuming he does since he is getting the money somehow. Like I said she isn‚Äôt being completely honest with us about the whole thing so I can‚Äôt give as many details as I would like. 

Anyway, my mother got a call yesterday from a man who was trying to get in touch with my grandmother. He said he was with the corporate security department of Regions Bank (which is apparently the parent bank of SunTrust I think? I‚Äôm not completely sure) saying that he needed to speak to her about checks that had been deposited that were not hers. She called him back and he told her that one of their clients has had $57000 taken out of his account (which was the account that checks had been deposited into, as well as her main bank and he named both SunTrust and her main bank). So apparently this scammer has gotten ahold of this other mans account and is using it to funnel money through to himself. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting from what he said, like I said I‚Äôm not 100% sure because I didn‚Äôt talk to the guy myself. 

Long story short my grandmother may be in some serious trouble. I don‚Äôt know if this guy has her social security number or not but I do know that she has given out a TON of personal information to him. He knows every member of our immediate family by name and what we do for a living. He knows her address and what her daily routine is. He obviously has access to her SunTrust account and is using her as a scapegoat to filter money from another mans account to his, if that makes any sense. 

Once we found out about this, we told her not to let the guy know that we know it is a scam. But for some reason that I cannot understand, she immediately texted him and told him that we all knew about him and we knew he was trying to con her. She asked him if it was a scam (smh) and that he has still been talking to her, I‚Äôm sure just to try and find out what we know. 

I know this is probably hard to understand, I am very scatterbrained right now this whole thing has my head spinning and my heart racing because I am just so mad and so worried for her. She doesn‚Äôt have a lot of money and to think that some guy is trying to take advantage of her has me raging mad right now. 

Please if there is anybody who sees this and knows what kind of action we can take, let me know. Obviously we are going to take her to close all of her bank accounts on July 5 when banks open back up. Is there anybody who knows how to find this guy or get his IP based off of his google account that he is using? 

Again i apologize for this post being all over the place. My mind is a mess right now and I have major ADD so just typing all of this out in a way that is halfway coherent has been tough. If anybody out there can help or knows what we should do, please respond or feel free to DM me. Thanks in advance.",04Jul2019,7

(+ j‚Äôs idea of a joke is running away from me, knowing i wont try to catch up. i often just end up behind them and separate from the conversation.) 

the above situation happened twice today, which is one of the reasons im making this post. 

another thing, im a lesbian and both of them know. j has made some insensitive comments. 

he asked me, and i quote, ‚Äúif i was a real lesbo or just bi‚Äù. he also uses queer as an insult, but only when it comes to me. the reason im including this is because k laughed, which feels like a violaton of trust. she was one of the first people i came out to, and also the person who made me realize i was gay in the first place. 

this isnt all theyve done, its just the most recent and the freshest in my mind.

To start with, thanks for your time reading my post and make helpful suggestions or comments. 

Here is the whole story. 

My wife booked through United Airline (UA) for a round trip from China-USA. It happened on the return flight to the USA from HK. The flight would stop at Japan first then back to the USA with ANA airline. The flight was on July 1, 00:50 a.m. She was carrying around 80 kg of luggage. At the check-in of ANA --- everything was fine until a supervisor appeared. She stepped in and accused my wife of not having a child seat for one of the babies. It seems ANA has a policy that just a single line on their page (took me a while to find it) ---‚ÄúWhen one adult is accompanied by two infants, child seats are required‚Äù. Note at the time of the flight (July 1st), my older daughter (Grace) is eight days from being two years old (Born on July 9th). Grace is over 37 inches tall and over 38 lb at the time (she is always among &gt;95% of her age). Younger daughter is on lap seat. Since we booked through UA, which only requires a child seat for baby not able to sit straight, we did not know there is a policy like this, and there‚Äôs no such information on any email/confirmation we receive. Grace is more than capable of taking the flight fine without any issue. 

After a long and heated argument, ANA (or that specific woman who is in charge) still refused to give the airline tickets to my wife and babies. Because it was almost 10:30  p.m (only able to check in after 10:20 p.m.), my wife was not able to get a child seat near the airport 

Think about it, you saw a woman, who was carrying a baby in front of her chest, four big pieces of luggage next to her, and holding her older daughter (who is almost two) so she did not run around in the airport. Are you that cruel to refuse the ticket which she paid already? 

UA representatives at HK airport were gone as well. The only way to resolve this is contact UA through the phone. 

I called UA from USA (wait time was around 50 min for each call) 3 times to resolve this issue --- the first two calls were hanged up as I am a bit anxious to explain my situation and want UA to do something with this before the plane take off. The first customer support directly hung up on me after I explained my situation. The second one helped a lot: tried to contact ANA before there was still time but got a negative answer from ANA (I guess from the same woman in charge). And then offer to change the flight to the nearest one in around 7 hr and waived change fee. Somehow the line was disconnected when I was about to pay. The third call finally went through and spent 500 dollars, so my wife could catch the earliest flight in the morning from UA (only charged the difference fee). I mean it is not my wife‚Äôs fault --- and there‚Äôs no way I could argue with them over the phone for this so I paid first so my wife could come back to the USA first. 

Before the ANA supervisor stepped in, the girl at the counter almost issued my wife the tickets with no issue. That woman stepped in from behind and checked everything my wife has and decided it is against their policy to let my wife board on that plane --- and more importantly showed no sympathy. This is some serious discrimination or whatever you call it. I believe she is a Hongkonger, and they tend to discriminate people from the Chinese mainland.

I mean, you see a single mom at the airport, with two babies, four 20kg-luggage (older baby is 8 DAYS away from 2 years old- -- can walk, dance and behave extremely well . Both my babies DID NOT cry during the 15 hr flight both ways). AND YOU DECIDE--- NO, NO AIRLINE TICKET FOR YOUR BABIES BECAUSE YOU DID NOT HAVE A CHILD SEAT. More importantly, younger daughter is on breastfeeding and starved longer than she needs to be. ARE YOU THAT CRUEL???

Thank god, she is back. At US custom, everything went super smooth. Officers processed her files extremely fast. People nearby are nice to help her with lifting her luggage, encourage her to stay strong, etc. I thank those people. 

Now I want to know what are the options I have to file against this specific person who works for ANA. Is it possible to pursue legal action, and what the chances of winning are?

My questions are the followings: 

1. How to file a formal complaint against ANA/or this person for this incident? I do not believe calling customer support would be of any help. Any suggestions? 

2. Would this be of any interest to any media? Newspaper? How should I spread the story to pressure ANA ‚Äì this is beyond just an apology from this woman who refused to give my wife the tickets. She needs to pay for what she put my wife through (stuck at the airport for 12 hr + 15 hr flight; my wife was not able to sleep the whole time because she needs to keep an eye on the babies. Plus, she cuddled the younger daughter the whole time on her chest during flight, so the baby did not cry at all).

3. Any other suggestions on how to get at least the $500 we paid. We believe it is not our fault --- if you think it is my wife‚Äôs fault, please let me know.",04Jul2019,0

92,"So; me (also female 17) and my gf we‚Äôre going out for 2 months; that said we both liked each other for 9 months prior. This was her first relationship. 


I have severe depression and anxiety along with potential DID or schizophrenia although it was only discussed with my therapist and never officially diagnosed. Anyways this week my depression was hELL. I wrote a suicide note and everything was horrible. Eventually I managed to get through it with help from my parents. 


In the note I referenced her; basically telling her not to kill herself. Once I felt I was better (although I definitely wasn‚Äôt in my right mind) I showed her it, purely bcs I wanted her to know my depression wasn‚Äôt her fault and that I would want her to be okay ‚Äî-&gt; I should not have done this at ALL I know so please don‚Äôt comment telling me how manipulative it seems it was the biggest lapse in judgement I‚Äôve had. 


She now is having a stressful time (will not reveal it for privacy reasons) and I hate seeing her like this. 

So she‚Äôs going through some depressive episodes and anxiety 

That said; she‚Äôs shutting me out a little; snapping at me when trying to help, in knowing her for a while she‚Äôs never behaved like this before. 
The only real change, is me. 
A lot of the negative things happening to her have been a direct impact of our relationship (homophobia) 

And she‚Äôs moving away for a short while (1 month maybe longer) as am I for the same amount of time. 

I‚Äôm also split on two universities; one near her and one a couple hundred miles away. Both equally good for their fields. 

For me my anxiety is through the roof because of not being able to help her. 

I‚Äôve had insomnia for a while sleeping at 8am and waking up at 12pm on average. 

I know that there‚Äôs no more I can do that tell her I‚Äôm there for her and give her space. 

But then again, should we break up it would help her home situation a little bit. It would also appease a lot of her stress and mine. 

Since we wouldn‚Äôt see each other for a while anyways there‚Äôs plenty of time to cope with the situation, and if we were to break up I would change universities to be further away so we would be far away from each other; meaning sh can get on with her life, and should we remain friends it wouldn‚Äôt impact on her getting a new relationship. 

Obviously I do believe that I love her and I want what‚Äôs best for her and as much as I hate to admit it; I am coming to the conclusion that I‚Äôm not the best for her, due to my anxiety disorder and depression and the fact I‚Äôm not a man. 

Then again I could be wrong and end up ruining things for her, if she‚Äôs already struggling it might tip her over the edge. 

I suggested breaking up once I learnt about us not seeing each other and she did not take it well at all; so obviously I went back on my words and we stayed together, 
I really want what‚Äôs best for her and I would truly hate for her mentality to be compromised because of me. 
Maybe I could suggest a break while she gets her head together? 
Any advice would be appreciated!",04Jul2019,1

107,"When my boyfriend at the time but husband now, came home from Iraq he wanted to ‚Äúdelete‚Äù his other snap and create a new one randomly. Instantly knew something was up but I was so happy to have him home I didn‚Äôt want to think about it So I WATCHED him ‚Äúdeactivate‚Äù the old one. I can‚Äôt remember why but a month or so after creating his new Snapchat he said he was gonna delete the app and not use it for a while. For a bit it was good but then I would randomly find that he searched it in the App Store and he would lie and say ‚Äúoh I was looking for a chat app that we had in Iraq to get some numbers I needed‚Äù I believed him. Then I caught it downloaded on his phone but it was logged out and he said ‚Äúoh I just downloaded to get my old pals from home number‚Äù I believed him. Then he said he was just gonna keep snap on his phone again. Well why he was sleeping one night I was curious and just opened the Snapchat app to see if he had been using it and surprise, he was logged onto his ‚Äúdeactivated‚Äù Snapchat and snapping girls and having conversations with them... I had found conversations with him begging girls for nudes and FaceTime sex while he was in Iraq when we first started dating and made it official and his excuse was ‚Äú I didn‚Äôt think you were really gonna wait for me‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt see it as cheating or anything wrong. And when I say I found conversations I mean I found like 20 different conversations begging for sex videos and FaceTime sex. The entire 7 months his old Snapchat was ‚Äúdeactivated‚Äù he was logging on to it at work and talking to girls and his ex girlfriend of 4 years and the main girl he swapped nudes and videos with while he was in Iraq. Those conversations weren‚Äôt saved so I can‚Äôt prove what he was sending and he swears it wasn‚Äôt anything bad and he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt remember‚Äù what the conversations were with some of them. Of course... my dumbass believed him and stayed. I deleted his old Snapchat for good and now he‚Äôs using his newer one but he barely ever uses it. Right before he went home to visit, I just checked his Snapchat and noticed he‚Äôs back to adding random girls and clearing conversations with them but of course when I bring it up it just starts a fight and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one ruining our relationship‚Äù well he‚Äôs been home now on leave for about a week and his Snapchat points have gone up like CRAZY which of course he isn‚Äôt snapping that many guys a day cause he doesn‚Äôt even do that when he‚Äôs at home with me. He‚Äôs also posting all his friends and family on his story and we will be married for a year in September and I have never ONCE been posted on his Snapchat story because ‚Äúhe just doesn‚Äôt use it like that‚Äù hell we just became friends on Snapchat cause I asked him a million times to add me before he left. Enough about Snapchat. Let‚Äôs talk about social media In general. Like I said, in September we will be married for a year. His profile picture is of him and I since December but that was the only thing he ever posted involving me until THIS MONTH. Nothing for my birthday(not even a gift or flowers or card), nothing for our ‚Äúdating anniversary‚Äù nothing. He NEVER likes my photos on Facebook not even the ones I post of my pregnant belly carrying his child but will like other girls photos and posts. He didn‚Äôt even want to post we got married on Facebook so we didn‚Äôt for a few months until I finally MADE him do it. I had to pick out and buy my own cheap ring cause I didn‚Äôt want to wear a rubber one anymore and he took his friend with us to go pick it up from the store.... romantic. I‚Äôll be cleaning the house cause he said hes sleeping and I‚Äôll walk into him watching porn instead of having sex with me. He just got Instagram back (he deleted it cause I caught him messaging girls) before he left to head home too... convenient, right? When I first found out I was pregnant in December, he didn‚Äôt want me to keep it and still to this day at 8 months pregnant when we go clothes shopping for the baby he will make comments like ‚Äúoh yeah I forgot my life is gonna be over‚Äù and he‚Äôs just not excited at all. I have his apple computer to watch tv in bed with and all his text keep popping up and he‚Äôll respond to all of them but will leave my message sitting there for a few hours and ignore my snaps I send him of his son moving in my belly. After our son is born he has 2 weeks with us before he leaves for a 3 months training school and I just don‚Äôt think I can worry about being cheated on while I‚Äôm trying to take care of our son.

108,"Hi Reddit, 
I typically lurk and read posts all the time and it seems like a good community. Now that I have an issue that I can't go to anyone about, I thought this would be the next best option.

Before I was even 1, my mom and by dad (who we will call B) broke up. We found out B cheated on my mom later on and he was just overall shitty. My mom did find a great guy that raised me by the time I was 2 and that's who I consider my dad, because he was the one who taught me how to ride a bike, drive stickshift, the whole thing. 

B did come around here and there when it was convenient for him when I was little. My mom wanted to make sure I knew him and had him in my life so when I grew up I would never think she kept B from me. She always allowed me to make the choices and decisions. B was pretty much an alcoholic (every single ""birthday party"" that he threw for me involved his friends and fuck tons of beer) and his awful girlfriend at the time was manipulative to me.

When I was 11, I realized what was going on and called him and told him to go away. He did. His mom tries to show up at my house a lot too, but soon stops.

For the past year I've been thinking about contacting him for reasons I'm unsure. I feel like maybe he's changed or something. It's just all mixed emotions I want to sort.

Last month I built the courage up to tell my mom. She's such a huge supporter in my life and her opinon means a lot to me.

She told me I craved attention.

Obviously, I want the attention of my dad because I would be contacting him but I didn't think I was craving attention and I feel guilty and awful about wanting to talk to him. 

I talked to a teacher I'm close to and she said it's most likely because my mom doesn't want to see me hurt by him again... I don't know what to think of this.

Has anyone gone through anything similar? I don't know anyone who has.",04Jul2019,0
109,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years, and he‚Äôs generally pretty awesome. However, he‚Äôs been doing this weird thing the past 3-4 years where he doesn‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúyou‚Äù when speaking to me. Instead, he will refer to me in the 3rd person and sometimes plural as well. For example, if he wants to know what I want for dinner, he might  say, ‚ÄúWhat does a Julia want for dinner?‚Äù

To give an example of the plural thing, if he was trying to say that I shouldn‚Äôt stay up too late tonight he would say something like, ‚ÄúAll the Julias need to go to bed early so they can get their rest.‚Äù It makes me feel very strange when he does this, which is pretty much all the time now. He doesn‚Äôt speak to anyone else like that, and when I asked him why he won‚Äôt stop, he said that I prefer it when he talks to/about me like that. I really don‚Äôt prefer it at all and it feels kind of dehumanizing in a way. I‚Äôve told him this several times, but he keeps doing it.

110,"I‚Äôm a cook at a restaurant (M 19) and I‚Äôve been working at this restaurant for 3 year, 2 as a dishwasher and 1 as a cook. During my time I‚Äôve worked every station and work hard and (in my opinion harder in some cases) as most of the other cooks. I work six days a week and average about a 35-40 work week and the problem is I make $8 an hour. 
My pay hasn‚Äôt shifted since I started working there and never in my time as a dishwasher. I‚Äôve talked to my night time supervisor about pay (he‚Äôs very chill and I love working with him) and he say that pay is based on what you know and can contribute as a cook.

However next month I‚Äôm going to a college out of state and I will no longer working as a cook there (maybe on holidays that I‚Äôm back).

Before everything i usually go 5-7 days a week consistantly, and she usually goes couple times a week. Well, back in May she started to go even more, then i noticed she started to go when i usually go to the gym. Which is from 5:30PM to 6:30PM, then i switched it up from 7-9, and then she started showing up same exact time . She stares at me, she brought her wing girl in once to work out with her and they both stared at me. She then consistantly works out next to me, she does her booty routines, she stares and looks, i mean i look back in a concealed way. But recently she stopped showing up consistantly, she stares at me with the death stare. Did I do something wrong? Maybe i should have approached her? Also I'm the type of dude that goes to the gym to workout  and usually doesnt stare at girls. Maybe i'm coming off as too intimidating? I'm pretty muscular dude, I weight 220 FYI and lean.

114,"First, on me: creative, sensitive, an overthinker, biracial, with a highly traumatic past I've mostly but not completely come to terms with. Late 20s. 

I became friends with a woman at the bookstore where we work a couple years ago. She is a few years younger than me. It's safe to say we are more than just work friends by now, as we became quite close. She is kind and quiet on the surface of things.

It has not been a perfect friendship, both on its own terms and also when others from work got involved. I believe though am not 100% certain I am her closest friend and she does not have any friends outside of work.

From the start, I noticed she would ask me a ton of questions. Advice. About my life. About life in general. And sometimes she would not be entirely honest or upfront. I've begun to suspect she asks me all these questions not because she cares about me but because she wants to have her needs met alone.

For example, she would say ""you can't get FAFSA loans for grad school"" and I would insist she could. She insisted no. So I looked it up for her and read it out to her, and she mumbled, ""Yeah but you have to pay them back."" That pissed me off. I felt foolish about that. I decided to say nothing. I should have.

We work in a toxic environment, and I would openly share about who sexually harasses women, and other gossip. She would deny knowing anything when I ask her, but after I share something, she divulges that she is aware of what I'm talking about. Other times she'd just deny knowing anything, when other people told me she was aware of the matter. 

All of this secretiveness and deceptiveness would not be such a problem if she weren't constantly pestering me with questions that are weird, perplexing, and sometimes unbelievable. These have included:

-Do you want kids? (three times on three different occasions)
-How do you kill yourself? (She said she was asking because someone in the news had killed themselves.)
-How do you invest? (I am not rich enough to have ever invested, and she knows that.) 
-What's my hourly wage? (After spending the entire evening asking me on advice about her job. I couldn't believe this one. She is a college grad. There's no way she couldn't figure this out herself based on her salary.)
-Were you the one who complained about [creepy manager]? (I was not, could never have given the impression I was, but more on this later.)

Things got more complicated last year when our friendship began intersecting with other colleagues.

There are certain people at work I distanced myself from after they became verbally abusive. She likes them though and said to me, ""I'm inviting them and if that makes you uncomfortable, you can leave!"" (She said it cheerfully with a shrug, not angrily. I told her I'd just sit on the other side of the table from them.) To her credit, she ended up not inviting either of those people, but the week of her party she reminded me with an intense look her party was that week. It was the look that said, ""You better fucking come because I didn't invite the people you don't like."" (I had never asked her to not invite them.)

There was one weekend when she refused to say hi to me, and at a meeting, she sharply poked me in the arm (it hurt!), was taken aback when I gave her sideeye for it, and she proceeded to ask me to ask the manager a question for her. I refused: she's a grown ass woman! She can ask questions her damn self.

I had asked her that weekend for one small favor: to check a room for something precious I'd lost. She didn't do it. When I told her I'd found it, she blankly stared at me. No ""sorry I forgot"". No ""I'm glad you found it"". It was around this time she'd said to me, ""Is there anything good ever happening with anyone? And by that I mean YOU!"" 

She never apologized and didn't change her demeanor, though she'd stare at me a bit. I avoided her for a couple weeks before she said, ""What's wrong with you?""  in an accusatory manner. And I told her, ""You've been coming across as angry and rude. I don't like how you treated me at the meeting, and how you've accused me of not having anything good going on ever when you know I have a rough life and I suffer from serious depression."" She claimed the comment was a joke and said she was angry about stuff, but not at me. We made up. By this time I had already advised her that she could benefit from therapy, but I doubt she took my advice.

Just prior, we had begun attending the parties of a man who I later learned has taken a male friend of ours into his bathroom and exposed himself to him. He's done this at least twice. It has made our friend uncomfortable, even though I don't think he sees it as sexual assault. He has a gf he loves very much, and she'd been in the next room whenever this happens.

The sexual assaults, plus the fact this same man has outright accused me smugly of lying about my racial heritage and the horrors of my childhood, also spoke to me smugly about his friends who act lecherous towards me, and spoken to me extremely condescendingly about not wanting to be friends with a troublemaker at work, led me to refuse to have anything to do with him.

And yet when I told my close friend I am no longer attending his parties, she was taken aback. ""What, why???"" was her answer before I explained he's creepy, manipulative, dishonest. Every time we've hung out in the past six months, she finds a way to bring him up in conversation, whether it's asking me if ""we've worked over our disagreement"" (lol) or just namedropping him knowing I loathe him.

A few months ago, she claimed she had no idea he'd exposed himself to our friend, even though I know she had to remember the first time I told her. Then she mumbled, ""I think he likes him."" Yeah no shit. Another time she mumbled, ""He takes on his social worker persona into his friendships."" Like that's a fucking excuse? And if this is any indication of his social work, Lord help us all: he claims, ""I believe DEEP IN MY HEART that I can make a difference in these people's lives and I've seen when meeting my friends on the street, even if it was years after our friendship had ended, that I'd help them change for the better"". Aw Lord. He would never let me finish a sentence, after I gave an opinion on something, he'd just repeat himself a few times, and when I would tell him of his friend's sexually inappropriate behavior, he was ready to dismiss it before I'd even told him half of what his friend did. Seriously, fuck this sociopathic motherfucker.

But this is a woman who remembers everything from the fact I slept on a boat last year, that I once told her Canadian doctors are going overseas for work, that I think people from a certain country are arrogant. I forget I've told her most of the things she remembers! And she can't remember I told her about a sexual assault? 

I also gotta love how she is still friends with him despite the fact after a drink or two, he spits a TON. NONSTOP. You stand next to him, he will shower you. You need to bring your own windshield wipers for that shit. People duck when near him when he's drinking. This led to my friend getting pinkeye. When she told him about it though, he said he had no idea he does that.

I know the assaulter has been talking shit since he realized I want nothing to do with him, as this woman is the only one I've discussed him with, and several people have been making comments about how I don't like him, and some other weird bits of information I only told him or he only told me when I trusted him seem to be slowly spreading. 

I am pretty sure I know the answers to my confusion, hurt, and frustration, but I would love extra takes from people who can view this less emotionally than I can and who can give pointers that I'm just too knotted up to think of. 

This woman and I have had some good times. We really have. But we have such different values, and it seems like she just wants me around to help herself, but she also demands I suppress my self-respect and dignity for her on top of that. I can't do this anymore.

The catch is I am still traumatized by extricating myself from that troublemaker at work, and then the sexual assaulter. Doing a slow fade on her led to a year of shit-talking, malicious gossip, turning colleagues against me (I strongly suspect she is the origin of questions about my heritage). 

All this craziness has got me kinda fucked up. I thought saying hi and keeping conversations brief, and turning down social engagements with ""sorry I'm busy"" was the way to do it. But it seems like when I do it with people at this job, it leads to months and months, in one case over a year, of hatred and malice and vengeance.

I know this is too broad a question for this thread, but man I wish I could figure out how to stop trusting the wrong people and so easily, without my heart deadening. Also: being a good friend without overextending my generosity. There is something I'm not getting and I'm not sure what it is.

Thanks if you've made it this far. Respectful answers, please.",04Jul2019,0

It's true. After a couple months without it, I have taken 800 micrograms of LSD and...not tripped. This was not a singular experience. I took 400 micrograms on some other days and went to work, stone cold sober. None of my coworkers noticed a thing, because there was nothing to notice.

Weed isn't getting me high anymore either. I have bought 33% THC weed, high quality kief, edibles... Yep. Not high. Every time. After 250 mg+ guaranteed THC in one sitting.

The only thing that affects me now is large doses (100+ mg) of DMT. And that's only for a few minutes, then it's gone.

122,"This has just been bothering me for a couple of months, and I really need some serious advice. 

My mom is from Trinidad. Since I was 9, she‚Äôs wanted to take I and my dad to Trinidad. I‚Äôm 23, she‚Äôs 55, my dad is 67. 55 hit her pretty hard, but my dad‚Äôs not getting any younger. I still live with my parents while going to college.

In the Winter semester I committed to a summer chemistry research group. My mom knew about this. I committed to it, I worked hard for it, I *really* want this for my career. It took a lot of work to get this.

At the beginning of the summer my mom started planning a trip to Trinidad to see our family. I said that‚Äôs fine, you two should go, but I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know if she didn‚Äôt understand or if she just doesn‚Äôt respect my career, but she bought three tickets anyways. I don‚Äôt know how much they were but they had to be at least $800 each. 

I said no, I can‚Äôt go; I already committed. Well she‚Äôs been having a total freak-out. This isn‚Äôt the first time. My mom is just like that. She even tried to convince my best friend‚Äôs mom to convince me to go. She‚Äôs been trying to guilt-trip me for a while. 

My family in Trinidad doesn‚Äôt speak the same kind of English that Americans do. I have problems understanding them over the phone. My mom hasn‚Äôt been explaining my point of view well so now they think I‚Äôm racist against Indian people. They‚Äôve had problems with my dad being white in the past, but that‚Äôs a different story. We‚Äôve been trying to reconcile for a while and this would be the best opportunity.

They‚Äôre exactly a week from leaving. My dad decided to just eat the price of the plane ticket. They‚Äôre flying with United Airlines. My mom has not let up for one minute.

The thing is, I *really* want to go to Trinidad. We‚Äôve never had a family vacation. It‚Äôs been 17 years since the last time I left the country. But I also really need this research. Research has been slow this year. I‚Äôm sure I would still have a job if I took the time off, but still, it‚Äôs just a really scummy move to take time off without a months‚Äô notice. Also, I *really* don‚Äôt want to rub this professor the wrong way. He has connections to industry, and I really need to pay for school.

Another component is that I also need my mom to respect my decisions. If I say no, I mean it. I‚Äôve been saying no since the beginning. This could have been avoided. 

I also don‚Äôt want my not-white family to hate me. 

I‚Äôve had money saved up for a while. I wanted to use it to move-out. I could probably go to Trinidad next year. I could probably pay for me and her.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. She‚Äôs been really pushing hard, and it‚Äôs working. So far, I‚Äôve said nothing but ‚Äúno‚Äù. My dad is just trying to stay out of it.",04Jul2019,2

I just broke up.

A few days back I walked out on him. Did some fucked up shit during that period. I hurt him, I really did and I completely got what I deserved when he made the decision to break up with me.

We've been quarreling a lot in our near 3 years being together. And I mentioned break up various times. Each time I would walk back and he would take me back but I guess, this time, he had enough. That's what I get for taking him for granted I guess. 

We both have had our faults, it's tough being with someone as emotionally damaged as me. But he did, he stayed. He made me better as a person, made me grow a lot. My bestfriend has seen me gone through a few relationships and her and those that saw me in it say that I have truly grown a lot. And I did like to believe that he did too. He was always a turtle in a shell but over the 3 years, he has started becoming more expressive, more caring, more alive. 

Every time we quarreled and talked about our differences he always asked me, do I think our differences can be solved? I said yes, always did without thinking. My actions and words are always based on emotions while he is the more logical of the two. It's been 4 days since we broke up, 4 days since he last replied me. I've had a lot of time to think because I'm on a break from work (thank god) and you know what? I still think that yes, our differences can be solved from a logical stand point now. 

I loved him so much that I forgot about myself when I was with him. One of the reasons we always quarreled (or rather me breaking down) was that I was insecure. He's starting a new path now which brings about some new friends and new activities and I was absolutely terrified about being replaced and he blames himself for my fear. But over these few days, I realized that it doesn't matter as much as I thought it would. Because if it does happen and he does replace me, fine. Because my value is worth way more than that. 

But at the same time I must admit, I knew that would never happen. 

Because this guy treasured me, he really did. He went out of his comfort zone repeatedly for me, grew for me, loved me. He introduced me to his family, talked about housing with me, brought me along to his family gatherings. 

He says that we are very different. And you know what? He's right. He's calm like water and I'm impulsive as fire. And that's fine. Sometimes, I need his calm to relook at things. Other times, he needs my fire to do things. 

It's not that I can't live without him, I'm not any lesser of a person without him, I am still whole. But, he did add on to me, made me better than who I am. With thoughts of him in my mind, I'm handling this break up way better than I thought I would. I'm trying to carry on with my life. Even when apart he's making me grow as a person. 

I miss him, I truly do. The me months back would be at his house, banging at his door begging him to see me or blowing up his phone. But, I guess I'm better at making rational decisions now. My heart is aching and it even extends to my fingertips. It's so hard to not message him, call him, see him. 

I really do genuinely believe we can work things out after much thought, I just don't know how to tell him that. I'm at a lost of what to do.",04Jul2019,0
131,"My downstairs neighbor told me that he cannot sleep because I am too noisy, especially when I walk. He was very nervous to tell me because he didn't want to be ""that guy"" but since then I've not been feeling at home.

We live in an old building with cardboard walls and I wouldn't be surprised if I learned there is only an inch between my floor and his ceiling. I can hear my neighbors talking on the phone, walking, singing karaoke, cleaning, moving furniture, etc but to me it's always just been part of living in an appartment building... 

I work 6 days a week, I leave home around 10am and come back around 8pm. I get up around 9am and go to bed around 1pm... Sometimes 2pm if I have trouble falling asleep. I don't have friends over and stay at my boyfriend's twice a week. I don't listen to music in weeknights, I sweep instead of vacuuming and I go to the laundromat because I fear that my washing machine is too noisy.

My neighbor works Monday to Friday, goes to bed at 10pm and wakes up at 5am. I don't know when he leaves but he's back around 4pm.

I used to do everything I had to do between 8h30pm and midnight (cleaning, cooking, showering, etc) but now I feel guilty whenever I move. I am someone who walks in their appartment a lot because I live in a small space so I do a lot of back and forth. He suggested I walk on my toes and I've been doing that but the amount of effort it requires drains my energy to do anything else. My apartment is now a complete mess and I don't feel at home. I know he goes to bed at 10pm so I try to do everything between 8h30 and 9h30... Needless to say it doesn't work.

My neighbor next door said she also got a very similar complaint from the guy below her but she just told him to go to hell... Needless to say, that's not the kind of stuff I do.

I feel like I live with a roommate again and I'm so exausted. What can I do?",04Jul2019,1
132,"Hello. 

I work for a chain fastfood restaurante, and basically to summarize they treat the workers like complete and utter shit.

They take away our employee meals, the bosses can be assholes, I pick up 95% of the shifts that are dropped, I come in whenever I'm asked to, but i get no praise whatsoever, and they wont even look my direction for a promotion or a raise.

Given it's fast food work you cant really expect much, but I certainly wasnt expecting this.

I want to leave in order to garner more work expirience, but the one thing holding me back is the fact I have made amazing friends there. I never really had many friends as a kid, and working there has made me feel like a normal person.

I just really dont want to let go of the people I have met, except for the bosses. What would you guys do?",04Jul2019,1
133,"Now before I get into the details of everything, this post isn't as serious/important as some of the other posts on her, but I still would appreciate some advice.

So recently my family just got internet for the first time. We live in the city so pretty much everyone has internet, we just didnt get it because some issues with my great grandmother. The thing is from what my dad told me, the plan has only 40 gb per month (averaging out to 10 per person). Now that is a VERY small amount. At 1st I didn't realize how small it was but then I did my research into just how little that is. I then checked if our provider has the same data cap regardless of plan. From what I gathered, the data cap regardless of plan was 1 tb per month, or an unlimited option (we have Xfinity). I also talked with a service representative/agent and they affirmed my thoughts. I showed my dad everything I found yet he still insists that the data cap is 40 gb. I am absolutely sure that he is lying about this. How should I talk with him about this?",04Jul2019,1
134,"Tldr; 24 year old single guy, out of college in the real world, hung out with friends the other day and over heard them say I should not have been there. After that realized I have no one around that I can hang out with or talk to anymore, all my friends are just acquaintances now. I have been doing things on my own my whole life, going to the movies, concerts, bars, etc alone. I am working on my career and work full time but other than that I am lost and dont know what to do. 

I sit in bed all day on my days off. Pretty much done with trying to date, its impossible to meet someone and have never been in a relationship or had sex. I am no one to everyone I used to be close to and have no romantic connections, is it best to just accept this and just live for my career?

~~~~

So in the past few months I caused things to end between me and a girl I was seeing because I was not sure I wanted to be in a relationship with her. My lack of experience, not feeling a romantic connection, not much of an attraction towards her and the fact that she has been the first girl to really care about me and give me a chance caused me to be unsure about it all. We were almost moving forward and then I told her I wasnt sure about it all and that lead to her ending things.

I ended up feeling ok for the first two months afterwards, I was on my own. I went to do things on my own, visited doctors for some conditions I had, unrelated to her and sex since I am still a virgin, and I work full time so I was pretty busy. Over time I kept thinking about her more and kind of regret causing it all to end. I also realized in this time I dont have a strong support network. I didnt really neglect my friends at all while dating her, but losing our continuous communication and my friends enveloped in their own lives blinded me to my lack of support.

I have always been stupid and pretty much talked my feelings out with my friends, and I can see now it was bad because I would talk to anyone who would listen to my previous dating failures and I can tell some of my friends found it odd a guy was this emotional and this much of an over thinker. After this last girl I tried my best to shut up and suppress my feelings about it all and I have done a really good job of it in person but I do come to reddit to vent basically.

Other than that I dont really have anyone to go to now. Like I said most friends are busy with their own lives and relationships that its hard to get a response to a text let alone hang out to catch up or even ask for advice. My closest friend agrees to plans but then ignores my texts or makes up an excuse about his girlfriend not wanting to go and she chimes in and says its him. But when its something he wants to do he will miss work and do whatever it takes to go. 

The other day really hit home though, I reached out to one of my friends (not the same one as above) to see if he would want to hang out and it seems he was already hanging out with his group of friends that I kinda know and thought I was part of the group. He invited me to hang out with them so I went. When I was with them I left to make a call and over heard one person in the group say I was not supposed to be there. It didnt sound like they were annoyed but clearly the rest of the group were not expecting me to be there.

I do know they hang out here and there and there have been times I have scrolled through social media posts and see them hanging out. I get it, I havent been around their main group much over the years but the friend who did invite me I have known for years. I dont think they have to include me or anything but it doesnt feel great knowing they dont really think I should be around. I have decided to not hang out with them anymore and just hang out with the one friend if he invites me out or something. 

I have a bunch of different friends and friend groups I used to be close with when we were in college and outside of it but at this point I have nothing. College just ended over a year ago too so it will get worse. I dont have any plans for the fourth of July tomorrow and have been thinking about staying in at this point. I am really not sure where to go from here though. I keep myself occupied with work and studying for a license but on weekends I am so not motivated and just lay in bed all day thinking about that girl and how I have nothing left now, no real friends to make plans with or really talk to.

I know how to be on my own, I go to movies, get food, usually fast food and eat in my car, I go to the grocery stores or malls to get out of my room here and there. Occasionally I go to the city and walk around for an hour or two or I find a random place to go to and stay there for an hour to at least be out. I have gone to bars alone but never really sure what to do there. I have even gone to a concert alone before and it was fun but I am not sure about doing that again. I usually keep to myself in almost every situation unless I know people or they talk to me so talking to random people at the concert is out of the question.

It seems like this is how life will be from here on out. I just dont really know how to navigate this all. I dont want to keep showing my feelings or telling people how something they said negatively affected me, I dont want to be around people who dont want to be around me. Dating is not something I can really fathom anymore, meeting someone is impossible but going through it all again at 24 with no experience is just stupid to me. I missed out on so much that I can never make up because I was not good enough. I just dont know what my next steps should be, I work full time, working on furthering my career, but other than that I am lost and going nowhere.",04Jul2019,2
135,"My boyfriend says I dress to impress other guys whenever I go out. We haven‚Äôt seen each other for a bit because we have both been swamped with work, and he works out of town, so I instantly thought ‚ÄúHow does he know how I dress when he‚Äôs never around?‚Äù But I discarded the thought because I don‚Äôt want to belittle his feelings.

 So, I asked him ‚ÄúLike how..?‚Äù because I genuinely believe I do not do that. He got really offended and tried to just get rid of the entire topic and said ‚ÄúNope. Your right! You don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù At this point I was confused and frustrated.. I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was lazy and didn‚Äôt want to waste his energy explaining it to me, or he was frustrated that I didn‚Äôt see from his perspective. I believe I was just trying to understand the problem and see if I could fix it because I really do love him.

I tried to get him to understand where I was coming from because I believe seeing both sides to the problem is a huge thing in a relationship. He didn‚Äôt understand, but it wasn‚Äôt that it was hard for him to grasp.. He just wasn‚Äôt trying to understand it. He believed I was attacking him and made his feelings shrivel down to nothing. In the end he ended up saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it. I have to go to bed now, goodnight.‚Äù Even though I tried typing up a situation where he was on my side, he just gave up. I spent a good 5 minutes deciding wether to go with an angry response or no emotion. I went with a simple ‚ÄúI love you, goodnight.‚Äù because I am the type that stresses out when we end on bad notes.

So: 

1. Am I being unreasonable? Should I just blindly accept his feelings without questioning it?

2. Is there any better way to get someone to understand what your feeling other than stupid fake situations?

3. Is the thing I left off with bad? (As of right now, he hasn‚Äôt read it or replied so it‚Äôs possible that he is either going straight to sleep or ignoring my text.. But the second option is probably just my paranoia.)

Yes, I was a teenage girl when I made it. 

I created the blog awhile ago. Basically, I thought true crime was interesting, and upon seeing other people make art, I wanted to do the same. 

Not in an intentionally glorifying way, but I‚Äôd draw killers in a mocking/roasting way, or in ridiculous situations, or, at worst, in ways that look like they‚Äôre amused/having fun (doing regular things like cooking or something). Almost all of these were by anonymous requests (I always avoid the obvious romanticizing ones, but still), and I also had some joke ideas of my own. In the end, it was 100% on my choice to draw all of these prompts. 

I also drew murder victims out of respect because I felt at the time that I should definitely draw them if I draw killers. Honestly, looking at that sentence I just wrote makes it apparent to me that it wasn‚Äôt really respect, because I *still drew killers the next day*

Overall, I see that even though I wasn‚Äôt romanticizing in the sense of ‚Äúuwu columbine‚Äù, I still treated killers as characters when I drew them, even if I was trying to mock/poke fun at them. 

Now, I still am interested in true crime, but I choose not to do that anymore, and recognize that this isn‚Äôt how I should express my interest. These were real people that affected actual, innocent people. 

I want to start fresh with a new art blog away from creating that kind of content, but I don‚Äôt know how good deleting my old blog will do, considering google search/images and reblogs. I‚Äôm also worried it can still be traced back to me. What do I do from here?",04Jul2019,1

150,"So I went on a date last night with this woman whom I had had nothing but good impressions of.  She's physically beautiful, kind, like-minded, and we'd met in person before and spoken on the phone.  Unfortunately, however, she showed her true colours in a manner that was so disturbing that I ended the date early with a false emergency, claiming that I'd just got off the phone with a relative who had fallen gravely ill.

First, she was late and came up with some bogus excuse about how the trains weren't on time.  Well, I consider a date to be like a job interview, so I was already holding her CV over the shredder excuses notwithstanding.  

Then we started talking about my recent trip to Europe and she asked me what ""provinces"" of France I visited.  I guess she never went to school or took a single civics or geography class -- or is pathologically forgetful -- to the point that she even confuses *d√©partements* for ""provinces.""  (Because every country that isn't America is Canada, of course.)

The last straw was our conversation about Denmark.  Having been there herself and remarked how expensive it was, she asked if I'd made a visit and whether the non-existent ""adoption of the euro"" had had any effect on prices.  It was at this point that I -- with as straight a face as possible -- excused myself to answer my relative's call.

I don't know what to do.  She has called several times in the past few days and sent numerous text messages, and I know I'm going to have to give up the charade eventually and tell her the truth.

153,"I am a 22(F) who is in my last year of college. I have close friend who has a mental illness, in which I recently got into an argument with.

I have a lot of skeletons in my closet such as molestation during my childhood, homophobic parents, suicidal thoughts, and forced religion growing up. I am an asexual female due to the feeling of disgust that comes over me at the thought of sexual acts. I‚Äôm overall just looking for advice to somehow fix our relationship or be able to come to an understanding. I honestly don‚Äôt think my past issues that are mentioned will be solved seeing as I am a coward, but I just don‚Äôt want to lose this friendship.

I have a friend that I have known since middle school, who I consider dear to me. She was diagnosed with maniac depression, and has dealt with it since she was a preteen. She often comes to us with her issues looking for advice and support, considering that she is bisexual and her parents are religious and don‚Äôt approve. This is perfectly fine seeing as I love being there for my friends.  We are a tight and small friend group and like to keep it that way. The only reason she comes to us so often is because she can‚Äôt rely on her family due to the fact that they believe she fakes her episodes. The problem isn‚Äôt that she comes for advice, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs always about her and her issues.

My friend likes to relate everything we say or do to her and her problems. We could be talking about something as tiny as cute dogs, and she‚Äôll somehow find a way to lead it back to how she wishes her family wouldn‚Äôt treat her like a dog. I understand that she is going through things but I am not in the position to constantly have to be helping someone with their life when mine is falling at the seams. I‚Äôm not a confrontational person and it wasn‚Äôt that big of a deal until she began to make it seem like her problems triumph everyone else and their problems. I am currently in college and my parents still do not know that I was molested, due to me not being confrontational. I told my friends about the situation because I‚Äôve always been closer to them. It‚Äôs simply hard to tell my family when the offender is a family friend. I still see him regularly around my family, and sometimes I come to friends about it. Almost always, she responds with stuff like ‚Äúatleast you don‚Äôt have episodes about it‚Äù or ‚Äúatleast you‚Äôre still happy‚Äù.  Sure, I‚Äôm not diagnosed with maniac depression but I still have my issues and it hurts that she just dismisses them. I don‚Äôt judge on her and her issues and I never accuse her of lying but apparently I can‚Äôt be suicidal if I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with a mental illness?

Anyways, the final straw was when she told me I shouldn‚Äôt be complaining about my homophobic parents, who also berate the entire LGBTQ+ community, because I wasn‚Äôt out yet. Only my friends know I am asexual because my family members are hardcore Christians. They believe LGBTQ+ are going to hell and woman should marry men to produce children. My parents are also into politics and often bring up how it‚Äôs disgusting that they want more rights and often berate the mere topic of LGBTQ+ people being treated equally. My mom recently discovered what asexuality was and found it abnormal. She made it seem like people who identify as asexual are ‚Äúignoring their responsibilities as humans‚Äù and are ‚Äúforcing themselves to be different‚Äù. Not being sexually attracted to people doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt have children. I could simply adopt kids in need. With that being said, I already know what my parents think about me because they insult me indirectly when they unknowingly call me abnormal and disgusting. Was it bad of me to think she would understand my pain? 

The point is, I snapped. I went off on her about how I always listen to her problems and how I never criticize her for being her. I was tired of giving advice to her over and over and never being allowed to do the same. I went off on her about how I always answer her late night calls when she‚Äôs having an episode without complaint, but the moment I look to her for comfort she gets annoyed. I told her if she wanted someone to rant to her about her problems then she could ‚Äúfind a fucking therapist‚Äù and that I couldn‚Äôt deal with her and her issues anymore. I was tired of being treated as a therapist instead of a friend. My doors were always open but it seemed like everyone else‚Äôs was always locked. Most of the friend group is saying that I was being too harsh because she has a mental illness and I don‚Äôt. She‚Äôs kind of ghosted me on everything and I feel like I took it to far. I hated that she looked down on me for having issues and being suicidal without a mental illness, but still expected me to be there for her. I just don‚Äôt think I can handle helping her with her issues while dealing with my own by myself. In a way, I‚Äôm kind of happy that she ghosted because I‚Äôve had time to think this over. But I keep getting this feeling that I went too far.
My friend told me she thinks that I‚Äôm over-exaggerating or fibbing to one up her? I truly don‚Äôt understand because I would never do that, but I‚Äôm waiting for her to respond to hear her side.

154,"I work at an HVAC company in New England as a receptionist and summer is brutal for everyone. People (especially the ones with money) get nasty when their A/C's do not work and you're out to the last week of July for appointments...

But for someone who just books the appointments and tells the guys where to go, I get angry customers a lot. My company is a triple threat to my mental health; small (constantly back-up), family-related (my cousins), and VERY disorganized management (boss never follows through on his end). I've decided to quit at the end of this year just get me through one more semester to avoid taking out loans before I graduate college next spring and it will show on my resume that I will have been at my job for two years. 

I would have quit awhile ago but there are a few factors at play. I want to avoid looking flighty (most people say staying at a job two years min is good I believe?) and it being my first office job, I'll probably put them as my references for my next job after school. We're also moving next year due to my boyfriends job. 

Anyhow, the attitude and entitlement from customers is making me angry. I can't enjoy my nights home with my boyfriend, my weekends off (and more so when I'm on call to send the guys out on an ""emergency""), and can't enjoy my online summer classes right now. I find it hard to relax and knowing the end is so close, it makes me want to just say fuck it and leave. 

Any tips to cope till December? Thanks. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. This was all triggered by a new install calling to say her upstairs A/C wasn't working in her house (which is a fuckin mansion btw) and how it's ruining her Fourth of July. So I had to wake up the tech on call to send him down to fix it because she couldn't wait until morning because she had plans to go to the beach. (The techs had a rough day as it was, so I felt awful sending him out to something that I don't really consider an emergency so late.)",04Jul2019,3

157,"I am a 26 year old male. I'm an unemployed, uneducated loser. I worked at a clothing store for a few years but they let me go. I began living off of unemployment checks. When they stopped coming, I began working at an Amazon warehouse. Around this time, I started developing what I thought were symptoms of a hernia. I felt a tightness around my abdomen and a pressure against my diaphragm. I also noticed that my entire stomach was protruding much more than usual. I'm very skinny. I'm 5'6 and about 120 pounds, so I'm used to having a completely flat stomach. Maybe a small tummy roll when I sit down. I drink once in a while, maybe I'll go through a bottle of hard liqour every other month or so. but I felt like my stomach growth happened suddenly, and I never noticed any type of beer belly coming in. I used to be fairly active. I attended a boxing gym about 3 days a week and ran a mile or so once a week, so I was in okay shape. but I only did some light weightlifting, and the work at Amazon kind of messed me up. It was 10 grueling hours of almost nonstop heavy or heavy-ish lifting. I don't think this caused my hernia but I think it possibly aggravated it? Anyways, Amazon let me go before I could get health insurance from them because the work was seasonal, so I had to apply for medi-cal insurance. I got it in April and scheduled the earliest appointment I could get, which was early July. Here is where my mother comes in. I've built up a lot of resentment towards her. Shes failed at preparing me for life. I know that its eventually up to me to make my own away as a grown man, which is why I'm making this post. But my mother is manipulative, lies to me constantly, gives me the silent treatment when I confront her for something, babies me humiliatingly in front of people, has never taught me how to pay a bill or pump gas or ride a bike or buy a car, among other things. I'd grown complacent living life as a loser, but now I want to change. So my appointment comes around. Never met this doc before, Russian gentleman I think. He looks at my stomach, presses it all over, and tells me I'm fine. He says my tightness is probably just from straining a muscle or something. I try to press him to do more, I tell him that I feel pressure on my diaphragm, I've felt the tightness on my abs for a long time, that my stomach shouldn't be as ""fat"" as it is, but he insists its nothing. He said that since my stomach protrudes symetrically that it probably isn't a hernia, and that mens hernias usually have bulges in specific areas and are usually in the testicles... something to that effect.. well hes a doctor so I guess hes right. but what else could cause my stomach to protrude the way it is? maybe the pressures really are just from strained muscles or in my head.. maybe my stomach is bigger just because I'm getting older. the doctor was almost laughing at me over it, seriously.. So I get out of the office and tell my mom. Shes shocked and so am I. the doctor has sceduled me another appointment for 2 months from now for blood work. I dont care to go to it. My mom an I have a HUGE fight. She says that I need to go, and that she wants to sit with me in the office to demand a ultrasound or whatever it is for my stomach. I tell her that I'd be humiliated as a grown man to have my mom in there with me. Here is what REALLY turned it into a shouting match... I tell her that I just wanna start focusing on finding a job, getting a car, and attending HVAC school.. She wont have it. She starts telling me that if I start working, then I'm going to lose my health insurance and they're gonna start charging me. Shes insistant that something is wrong with my stomach and we need to know what. I'm so confused, idk how any of that works. I'm so paranoid. Should I really wait for 2 (or who knows how long) months to have my stomach looked at again? I am about 90% sure that something is wrong with my stomach. maybe it isn't a hernia. but I feel it twitch. I've felt those tightness in certain areas for around 6-7 months now.. but at this point I kind of want to start getting my life together and just make another appointment when I get insurance from my job. but my mom is psyching me out so much, and shes my transportation everywhere.

I love things that gets my adrenaline going, things like martial arts (I practiced for some time, but i left it, because of studies), i used to practice parkour (I would do it very actively), but i left it because there aren't many places to practice in my area, i love playing videogames (I got to have an adiction), but for the last 2 years i haven't really been too much into them.

This is where the problem is. My mom wants my grandma to stay over with us permanently. Which wouldn't be an issue if my mom didn't lose her goddamn mind every time my grandma showed up. Because see, I have a story for an incident that occurred...

One year that my mom invited my grandma over, grandma wanted to go get some food item from the store. I figure since she's old and stuff, then it's probably best if she stay at home and I go get the item. I insist that she stay at home and that I go get the food. Not to mention that it'll be faster this way too. So I get the food item. I get back home and give it to grandma and I think that all is well. Then later my mom comes home and chews me out for not instantly noticing that my grandma probably wanted to go outside and was too embarrassed to say so. She accuses me of trying to mess with grandma on purpose and then attempts to KICK ME OUT OF THE HOUSE OVER SOME GODDAMN FOOD. I beg and she lets me stay, right?

168,Hi I am a 18 year old who just graduated high school this year is is regretting my past and it is causing me major depression. Last summer me and my friends started hanging out with these group of girls and one of the girls liked me. I decided not to date her because I was to focused on my business and saw that every month she was dating a new guy and I didn‚Äôt want to be just another guy. Time went on and the school year began and she found the guy she was going to date all school year. I regretted my decision right after she started dating this guy and it ate away at me all year. The boyfriend is a sophomore and she is a senior. Anyways we both just graduated and are going to the same community college this year. The boyfriend will stay in high school as a junior. I would say I am a good friend of hers and if she broke up with him she would be interested in me again. During their relationship this year they broke up a total of 4 times but got back together almost the next day. I have heard some negative things about their relationship however they are still together which is confusing. I am just wondering what are the chances they break up ever? I am going to give some random details because I don‚Äôt know how to put them in order. I go to the gym with her 3 times a week. They are constantly texting each other about something. I run a business that makes 60k a year in passive income and have a significant amount saved up. I have went from a tall skinny lanky kid when she first liked me to a tall stronger looking man thanks to working out and growing a beard. Which she complements me on every time I see her. Anyways if you had to put a percentage on them staying together what would it be? Also any tips or advice you have please comment. Thanks,04Jul2019,1

170,"So I'm currently living in an apartment that is taking up 50% of my monthly income. The rent price is normal, I just live in an expensive area and don't have a lot of reasonable alternatives. This, along with my car, phone, and student loan payments, leave me with about $200 each month for groceries, gas, etc. I'm not able to save anything, I have to clip coupons to buy food, and last month I had to go to the doctor and went without lunch at work to make up the difference. It's just not sustainable.

One of the alternatives that I'm considering is moving into a basement apartment that my parents own. They've offered me below-market rent that is much more affordable, so it would put me in a much better financial position.

188,"The past couple of weeks I‚Äôve sent texts to my co-worker who works the shift before mine at a group home. He usually leaves a bit of a mess and in the past I‚Äôve cleaned up after him without saying anything. It‚Äôs been this way for nearly a year but recently we‚Äôve been short staffed at the house so I‚Äôve been working alone and it‚Äôs much harder to absorb other people‚Äôs work and get mine done. Anyway, I asked my supervisor if I could text him to ask him to put his pots and pans away before he leaves. She said I could and so I did. It didn‚Äôt go well and he became very defensive (which I can understand as criticism tends to sting me) but he also was very dismissive and belittling. I‚Äôve heard his take on women and what he thinks their role should be (domestic work). We both sent screenshots of the text convo to our supervisor. She explained that we should be open and honest in our communication with each other at the house. I expressed regret at how I worded the first text but dismay at how he took it. 

Fast forward a week‚Äî I come in for my shift at there are pots and pans left in the drying rack but this time they have some dried on crust. I text my Liberian coworker a gentle text that I think might go over better since my supervisor talked to him last week about how important open and honest communication are. He doesn‚Äôt respond well to this‚Äî becomes defensive and says slightly disrespectful things to me. Since my boss was on vacation I sent an email to our HR representative and met with her the next day to talk to her about what I should do. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to get this guy fired but I feel like the way he talked to me was really out of line and I needed to stand up for myself.  The lady in our HR department reached out to coworkers to ask them if they felt uncomfortable with anyone they worked with. My coworker told me no despite the fact that he has had negative things to say about this particular staff (his work ethic and sleeping on the job). The second coworker that said she wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable with anyone that she worked with recently switched morning shifts to avoid working with the Liberian man because of his work habits and the fact that he wore a white tank top to bed and would lift it up to scratch his belly as well as the fact that he would pee with the door ajar. I guess now would be a good time to talk about this man‚Äôs history of sexual misconduct...several female coworkers have felt he‚Äôs been inappropriate with them (verbally) but there was a case of one young female staff quitting and finding another job because of his harassment. I guess the young female didn‚Äôt want to report him so nothing ever came from it.

So this week I come in and there‚Äôs a pot and lid in the sink‚Äôs drying rack. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like he was sending me a message. I didn‚Äôt text him this time but I did reach out to HR updating her and letting her know about it and the fact that coworkers have reached out to me about her contacting them. My supervisor called me a short time later to set up a meeting with her and the HR lady. I was worried she was mad or annoyed with me about the situation because she has had that kind of reaction to things like this in the past. She seemed to feel like the pots and pans in the sink weren‚Äôt a big deal as it happens at every house and the other stuff with my male coworker was cultural. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being unfair to him and his cultural background or if I‚Äôm justified in being upset about the way he talked to me and his clear lack of wanting to fix the issues. I don‚Äôt disagree that it seems petty but it‚Äôs part of a larger issue. Also I feel like if someone reaches out to you with a reasonable request that you can accommodate  at your job why wouldn‚Äôt you. We really have to work together as a team to keep the house running smoothly. 

I would love it someone could point me in the right direction towards gaining information about Liberian culture or how I can better handle this issue going forward.

Previously he told me he wanted to be fwb but I said no. He said we could move past it and that he would respect that. Now after what happened this weekend I'm not really sure what's going on. He sent me a shirtless picture and told me to send him one back but I'm not sure if he meant with a shirt or not. I didn't bother to ask. This has been on my mind since the weekend. Should I just be straightforward and ask if he was just trying to see what he could get when we met up and what his intentions were that night?Should I wait until tomorrow to ask or just ask now? It's about to be 10pm. Any advice welcomed.",04Jul2019,0
191,"My friend seeeems to have the greatest family in the world. He's aaaaaaalways spending time with them. He is nearly 20 years old and he spends every single day away from college with his family. Every single day. He'll come get coffee with me sometimes but not without doing things with his family first. And I get if he needs a shorter leash because he is on the spectrum, but he's well adjusted, and I think the way his family treats him is insane. He never has friends over, he can't have a sleepover with people of the opposite gender, he can't drive out of the city, the family has blocked off nearly all his time for family activities, and he can barely come see me for coffee without them getting worried. I'm starting to wonder if my friend is his parents' only friend, along with his other siblings. It's insane in my opinion. And my friend doesn't even realize it. He just thinks he has a loving family, that loving families spend 24/7 together all the time. He's almost 20 for petes sake. I don't know what to tell him or how to help him.

192,"So I'm 15 and need some advice on some stuff, sorry for the length but it goes back awhile. In elementary school my parents divorced, I wasn't really affected since I was too young to release what I was going through. My mom and dad eventually remarried to good people for them, my step dad is cool and my step mom is smart. Dude to some circumstances my mom had to deal with I mainly lived with my dad, seeing mom ever other weekend. Anyway my summer schedule use to be every other week would be with my mom, but that changed when my dads branched closed. He was able to keep his job if he moved to a bigger branch. We decided to move with him since we mainly moved with him, and we loved him. But in order to move with my dad, he basically forfeited our whole summer to our mom, and allow her to see us for spring break, her birthday, and holiday breaks (which flip between parents). I use to be okay with it, but know that I'm in high school I'm realizing how unfair it is. I dont want to say, but this state I use to live in was a farming state, and there is litterly nothing to do, education is okay, but recreation is noexistant. But in the state my dad moved to, education is much better, I have more opportunities, and choices of fun recreational activities. When I started high school I learned we have a good summer school program, I mostly wanted to do it due to drivers ed so I dont have to take it in the school year. But my mom was adamant about having us, when ever I bring up how I want to spend less time at her place because I want to go to summer school, she says ""this court says I get 8 weeks in the summer with you"" and when I ask if she can change it she say ""no"" when I ask why she repeats that statement about 8 weeks. I'm starting to resent my mom the more I learn about her divorce. When ever there is a break she has my dad fly us down to her for 5 days where we proceed to do nothing, when I could be doing fun stuff with my dad. So because of her, I'm missing put on classes I want to take, missing out on a summer job, and making it difficult to get a scholarship in boy scouts, I miss out on all the summer trips, and the big fund raisers due to going on week trips where I miss school because she wants to see me for her birthday. I dont know if I'm being unfair, but I dont know what to do, she isnt being reasonable. What should I do?

Should I feel like I need friends? 

I always ask myself this question. Whenever I try to make friends it always feels like I‚Äôm forcing myself to make them from outside pressures, like if my parents think that I am a weirdo, or not to look like a loser at school or to gain something etc.. I just hate the whole topic.

I never really feel ‚Äúlonely‚Äù, which I could assume would be feeling sad without anyone, but more stressed and pressured over the fact my parents, and society want me to have friends and I don‚Äôt really care. This sometimes makes my anxious in social situations. 

I hate the question, ‚Äúwho are your friends?‚Äù

Making friends is hard work, and I‚Äôm pretty happy with my life. Why should I be forced to to this?

But these pressures really do make me hate my life and contemplate why I don‚Äôt have friends, as well as make me shame myself for having none.

Then he proceeds to ask for my phone number if I‚Äôm serious about pursuing business and that he and his wife could mentor/give me connections.

Obviously I‚Äôm not that stupid to ignore that fact that this dude could legit sex traffic me(part of being paranoid).

I texted him saying I had an emergency and was pretty busy so I couldn‚Äôt meet up. And couldn‚Äôt reschedule bc of personal issues happening at this time. Then I blocked his number etc. WELL I told one of my friends this story and I shit you not she said that same thing happened to her/story(I‚Äôm currently trying to get more info to see if it‚Äôs the same guy).

I need advice: when I meet new people there's always some turning point when I start to feel very vulnerable around them and I cut contact and distance myself for no reason.

I feel like I eventually will lose them, either because they will stop liking me, they will replace me for someone else or they will go away/die. So, I make sure my relationships with them don't prosper any further so I can prevent the theoretical pain that it would bring me to lose them after.

First it started with the girls I liked, then I did the same to potential new friends and this past year I've even been doing that to my old friends and family.

I became completely absent on all social media so I can't keep in touch with anyone. I feel like I'm becoming very reclusive and developing some sort of anxiety, I was not like this during my childhood or during my teenage years. I'm 24.

If I had to guess I'd say it's a combination of trust issues and a lack of self-esteem, even thought I can't think of any reason for having those flaws.

206,"For once I feel like I gotta be honest with myself. Hopefully I find a good, grounded advice here after exposing myself.

Ever since I was little, I always had the pressure to become better than anyone, at least in one thing. Whether that be drawing, math, golf, or having the most amount of certificates and awards, I always tried to excel. What motivated me really wasn't my passion. It was the acknowledgements from other people. The idea that I was better than them. Mom would yell at me for not getting 100's, still shows disappointments when I don't get perfect scores in HS.  (Yes, I come from an Asian family) This is probably the reason why I never went that far in any of these. As soon as there weren't people around complimenting me, I'd lose interest. I'd lie to impress others. I'd lie to myself that I was ""special."" It was never toxic or braggy, but I knew that I only wanted admiration. Gradually I lost interest in the said activities. I met people who were much, much better than me. People my age who were at the top of their games. In a public school where there are hundreds of kids in your grade, it's not hard to see their accomplishments in a daily basis.

Moving to a smaller school kind of helped. It's an expensive school, with around 70 kids in a single grade. Even there, I was not the best. I was smart, yes, but I was never spectacular from their point of view. Maybe that was the real reason why I did things no one else did. Things like motion graphics, things that cost money and immense time. If I did something no one else did, I am the best at it.

Then I fell in love with a field of science (I won't name it since it might give too much away). To me, it's really fun, but again, I fear that it may be because it's so unpopular at my school. Everyone loves CS or Bio, but not this science. Naturally I got good at it, and again, became the best at it. I thought I did a lot with it. I made videos about it, tutored kids, did a couple of failed research projects. Teachers would say I was the most passionate at it, that I'd win the Nobel Prize. Friends would characterize me as ""\[Insert science name\] God"" or some bullshit. I'd embrace that, but I knew that I liked being on the pedestal. I loved the validation, and the awards I got in that tiny school. I feared coming to the realization that I am, really, a mediocre kid who has weak foundations and motivations, consuming time and money in the process.

The truth hit me when I applied for a competitive scholarship for college. In the final round for the scholarship, I went against a gold medalist for international olympiad who got into MIT. Really impressive labs, impressive services. Knew exactly what she wanted to do as a scientist. The most I've done with olympiads was the local round, though I'm not eligible due to my nationality/residency status. Even there I was mediocre. I don't know what I want to do in the future exactly, other than ""do some research"". I didn't get the scholarship, and I'm unsure if I'll be worth my parents' sacrifice. I'm unsure if I can keep on doing well when I face kids just like that gold medalist. I'm unsure if I can really find my passion separate from people's validations.

Everything I thought I was proud of in my high school career was really just full of lies and mediocrity. I lied to myself that I was talented, that I loved doing it, that I tried hard. I got into a fine college, one of the best for the science I wanna do, but it's expensive as hell. Even now, I'm not exactly sure what to do there. ""A frog in a well"" is the right idiom for me.

To keep things short, I have a lot of dreams and passions in life including music, writing, video games, and other things, but I have autism and super bad learning disability in general which makes it seem impossible to understand the most BASIC tasks and sintructions. It's so unbelieveably bad I can't seem to find a solution.

One thing I'm trying to do currently is getting into video game developing, I know it's complicated and difficult, but I wanted to give it a try. I'm trying small things with RPG Maker for now and then I hope to move to bigger things in the future, but as stated before, it's almost impossible for me to learn literally ANYTHING because of this insanely annoying flaw of mine. I've been asking subreddits for rpg maker and game devs and stuff asking for instructions on these basic tasks that I can't figure out, like using variables and conditional branches in coding, and everyone keeps telling me its really easy and there's been a few very useful and lengthy answers, but I STILL DONT UNDERSTAND THEM! I feel like they're explaining it so perfectly but I just feel like im too stupid to understand. Im crying like every night now because i literally cant do anything. I feel like the only way I'd be able to even have a chance with this is if a super high experienced professional sat right beside me in a chair and pointed with his finger and talked super slowly about what im supposed to do and be willing to repeat the same thing 20 times before i even begin to comprehend what he's saying, but that's impossible to ask right?

I just need some general advice if you have any to offer. I'm running out of all hope and I don't know what to do.

210,"tl;dr: My Dad's GF is a nutball, and I think she has postpartum depression, she never lets me around my sisters(one is my goddaughter), how do I get to seeing the babies more when she is always crowding them and shielding them from me?

&amp;#x200B;

So, how do i put this? I was an accident, my parents were really young and broke up when I was 2, they were never married and weren't even half way through college when I was born. Since my parents broke up, it led to my half sister being born a few years later, on my dad's side. My dad and my sister's mother got divorced about 2 years later, and for the next 6-7 years everything was great, it was just us 3, outside of when I was at my Mom's. Then my dad met his now girlfriend, after less then 6 months of us knowing her, she got pregnant, and moved her 3 kids, and mother, into our house, which was home to the last 3 generations of our family, my grandfather was raised there, my dad was raised there, and I was raised there. My dad's girlfriend is territorial with her kids, however, and is also a terrible influence. My dad doesn't listen. Fast forward a year, and they just had another kid, I've known this woman for about 3 years and my dad already had 2 kids with her, I really dislike her and her family, they are all obnoxious and unwelcoming, even rude to me and my sister. I stopped going over my dads for almost a year 2 years ago because of this, and missed the first baby's birth because of fear, and the second because of college, but my thing is, I genuinely, even though their mother is an awful influence, their sisters on their mothers side are an awful influence, and I am 19 years older than both of them, I see genuine potential in both babies and see myself being extremely close to them as a brother growing up. I want this terribly, its just that anytime I am over my dad's house his GF and her daughters(Who I am forced to call siblings, even though they aren't even step siblings yet), crowd both babies and literally put their backs to me, they all get to influence them and hold them, and its as if they're shielding them from me and my sister, and they completely ignore me when I come over, his GF and her two oldest daughters completely ignore me even when I say hi they literally act like they didn't even hear what I was saying. The youngest of the three is the only one who acknowledges me, all I get is a hi, then back to being ignored. All I want is to be close to my sisters, but my dad's gf hordes her kids, example: I was over his house a few weeks ago playing with my 1 year old sister, and she was laughing really hard, I taught her how to make funny faces and got her to say my name(Sort of, she added an M in there and an extra syllable lol), and according to her mother, I am the only person besides her the baby let's hold and give raspberries. After a while of us playing around, my dad's gf picked up our youngest sister and ran outside saying angrily she needed relaxation. I knew it was because I was bonding with my sister. When my dad went to drop me off I kissed my sister and said goodbye to them and GF ignored me, so I said it again, and she gave me a smug look, nodded slowly and slammed the door on me. Then at my youngest sister's baptism(To which I was the godfather) she acted weird, and it came to my attention that no matter how much I wanted, I never held my sister/goddaughter until that day, she is 6 months old. And on that same day(The baptism), my one year old sister wouldn't stop running around, the church, Dad's GF solution- Yank her by the arm and hold her like a ragdoll by the arm to get her to stop, my solution(Which worked)- Kneel down and make silly faces and tickle her. She stop and started laughing, it worked, and yet GF said ""She doesn't want to be tickled right now, she doesn't like it STOP! STOP!"" and pulled my sister away. Its like everytime I interact with the girls she gets territorial and only lets those blood related to her interact with the babies, I hardly ever see my dad interact with them. I want to be close with my sisters, especially because one of them is my godchild, its just so hard because their mother purposely keeps them shielded from us. Another example is how my mom wanted to meet my sisters, she was really close with my half sister and her mother, so she saw this no differently, and came into the house, and my dads gf picked up my sister and started screaming at my dad to get the \*\*\*\* out of the house, and she ignored my mom, literally didn't speak verbally to her, and her mother literally didn't look at my mother(like an amish shun) the whole time she was in there, even when she asked her questions she ignored my mom. A few days later GF was posting videos all over social media(of which she has over 6,000 posts on instagram alone no exageration), of my sisters first words, can you guess what they were? Yup, ""Get out"". All these examples show how crazy both her and her family are, and how she is literally shunning me(not my sister though, just being an awful influence on her and not letting her around the babies as much as her own kids), but she is shunning me from her kids. I know, from what I've gathered, she probably has postpartum depression, but based on the extreme measures and how her mother treats me and my own mother, I can't help but think that they are both completely insane and think they are in their own real housewives, and using my dad for security, because she dropped her job and took over our house of 3 generations. I just want to know what I can do to talk to her and see my sisters, or if I should just dive in head first and when they are blocking off my sisters, interact with the babies anyway, instead of what I've been doing(Letting them have full control over the babies like the control freaks they are because I am afraid of the confrontation of hurting my dad's gf, and therefore hurting my dad's feelings. Plus I am really bad at arguing and lose my cool quick, if it came to that it would not end well in my favor.), I think the latter is my only option as I see no way of talking to this, \*ahem\*, ~~Bitch~~ woman, and if it does not result in a fight, but just the mother's unhappiness, as long as I get to bond with my siblings I am fine. I just can't stand that she does this to me, I want to be close to these kids, I am literally one of their godparents. What can I do? Is the option of just stomaching the awkwardness and tension and obviousness of them not liking me, and playing with my siblings anyway the best option? Because I see no other options and if I have to do something that makes me uncomfortable to be close to my sisters I absolutely will, I would do anything for them, even given the messed up circumstances of why and how they were both born. They are my family and I just want to be close to them. How do I get around this bitch and exercise my right to be there for these babies? I don't like their mother, so while making someone mad or upset is not something I want to do, I wouldn't care for her feelings in this situation. I fear that I am their only good influence, as their mother and 2 of her daughters talked about how weird it is if you don't drink and smoke in high school and how cool they were for running from police, that is the dumbest thing to be proud of. I am fearful that I am the only good influence in the babies life and I want to be there to tell them what not to do (Many of the things there mother has done or may think is cool, like her supposed alcohol induced tantrums my sister told me about), but I don't know how to do that without their mother getting in the way. Postpartum depression or not, how do I get on this weirdo's good side and/or bond with my sisters regardless of her awkward and aggressive feelings toward me?",04Jul2019,1

She‚Äôs six years older than me. I met her when I was twelve years old, when she came to live with us. I grew up understanding that my dad had divorced an unstable drug-addicted woman, that most of my schoolmates‚Äô parents were divorced too, and that people just don‚Äôt talk about it.

I never knew what it‚Äôs like to be in the middle of a divorce, or about her mother‚Äôs issues, or what issues she might have. Apparently she started prostituting herself and using drugs at a young age, and saw me as the strange sister who stole her dad. So most of our memories are of being petty or passive-aggressive and very negative.

Now I‚Äôm 23, she‚Äôs married with children, but the only time we‚Äôve really spent together as grownups were holidays. I‚Äôm a college kid and needed to leave my parents‚Äô house. So I moved into her (and her husband‚Äôs) basement and I just don‚Äôt understand where we stand, or how welcome I really am here. All I can think of is to take her out for drinks, but she‚Äôs pregnant. I don‚Äôt know how to make her like me or even have a normal conversation with her.",04Jul2019,1
215,"Hello. Throwaway because I dont want anyone I know to see this. So I started noticing in myself that I tend to get very attached and borderline obsessed with people when they show me attention and compassion. For example, when a certain person wouldnt text me back quickly I assume they are ignoring me or upset with me, or if theres a slight change in 'tone' over text. 

This is affecting me because recently I met a very nice guy on reddit, but I'm noticing that I'm obsessing over him. I try do to everything that I can so that he will like me and not abandon me, but even I know that I can get annoying with double texts, and similar things. Today he was busy and didnt give me much information as to why, so I've spent the whole day in bed just waiting for a text back, and I keep checking my phone. I had a very similar experience with an ex girlfriend, and I just dont want to fall into the same patterns. Any advice ? also is this the right subreddit to post this on ?",04Jul2019,1
216,"So I‚Äôll try my best to explain this situation. 

Basically I was in a friendship group with 3 other  people that met each other through school. I was the only male, the other two were female. We were very close, did a lot together like drive to another city, drank and played games, concerts,  secrets, etc. Girl A was already friends with girl B previously and always have been closer, which didn‚Äôt seem to bother anyone but I will expand more on that later. Girl C is also the type of person to be talkative, extrovert, much different the other 3 of us. But in summery it was girl A, girl B, girl C and boy D (me).

Now two years later they were interested in getting me a partner, and it just happen to be that a girl I had a crush on just became single. So the plan was in October to have her join our friendship group to have us introduce each other. I‚Äôll call her girl E, as she admitted to Girl B that she had a small crush on me already but wasn‚Äôt ready (I was all ok with playing the super long game). 

So over time from October to March we did a bunch of stuff but mainly hung out at Girl C‚Äôs house because it was the best place to have people. But what happened over time was girl C really took to befriending girl E to a point where girl A, B and myself were getting annoyed because Girl C was basically an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù/know it all with all stuff of Girl E. Instead of myself and Girl E getting close, Girl C and Girl E did, bonding over GoT, and more. They would always do things together, because they had more in common (which is totally fine) but it shaped into a degree where they had so many inside jokes that the three of us just didn‚Äôt understand and it got on our nerves. I‚Äôd even say obnoxious in a way. There were a few other aspects that were adding up like her constantly talking about when she was in Europe, and complain about not having money but spend a lot drinking, and more hypocritical things.

Then during April, girl A, girl B and myself were doing our last semester of school before graduating so we were fully stressed out. I was especially because I had to rewrite a 4000 word essay in 3 days with 25 sources. I spent all days writing and reading but on the last day before it was due, Girl A and Girl B come over and drives me to go for supper because 1) they thought I need a break and 2) girl B was going on holidays so she wanted to see us before she left. Then she posted on Instagram that she was out with us, and Girl C replies asking if we were out, said yes, and her response was ‚Äúoh‚Äù. Girl C and Girl E bother we‚Äôre not graduating so they were not as worried about anything.

I‚Äôll pause here and attempt to deserve Girl C a little more. She‚Äôs on of those people that has to be involved with everything but will feel left out if she isn‚Äôt excluded. Not in a negative way, she would invite us to do things but the three of us just never wanted/had time to go out and do house parties, drink on a farm so we would lost of the time not participate. 

Now then after classes were finished and exams too, Girl E had suddenly changed her mind about me and that it was ‚Äújust hormones‚Äù. While I and girls A and B can not prove it, we have a strong suspicion that Girl C convinced Girl E that we would not be a good fit together. We gathered this because at a meet up Girl A and B were already at Girl C‚Äôs house and smoked a joint. At that point Girl C said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they would make a good couple/would work together‚Äù. Girl B said she was super shocked and didn‚Äôt know how to respond, as she said, it‚Äôs not for Girl C to make a decision, it‚Äôs not her place.

Nothing more occurred from that night until a month later were Girl A and B were talking with me and we all just got in the convo about how each of us had feelings changed towards Girl C. So we decided to not fully ignore but just not purposely start convos, or be as talkative. The three of us were starting our full time jobs again too so were more busy but the general consensus was that we would kinda separate ourselves without a large issue, drift away in a sense. And to be fair, Girl E and girl C were always doing stuff so we just saw it that there wasn‚Äôt an issue really, they seemed fine without us.

Then a month ago we went out for Girl B‚Äôs birthday, poster on Instagram again and then not ten minutes later received a message from girl C asking if she did anything, she missed us and stuff like that. Girl B replied, basically saying that her and Girl E seemed to be fine just the two of them, they were going a trip with two other friends (one had posted it on Instagram saying they were excited, and it sounded like it had been planned months in advance) and that we felt pushed away. In the Girl C said she didn‚Äôt mean to and wanted to meet in person. To that point Girl B just never replied and nothing new has been said. Girl C unfollowed the three of us on Instagram, defriended on Facebook. Interestingly enough they invited us to a house party the two of them were having but none of us could make it because we all worked on a Friday night. 

My problem is that I don‚Äôt know if I should regret it. Girl C was genuinely fun but somethings really didn‚Äôt rub me the right way. I‚Äôm not into bar hoping, I have a low amount of social anxiety so places like that which are crowded make me nervous. I don‚Äôt have anyone to do stuff with, I‚Äôm going back to school for a second degree so I haven‚Äôt started a proper full time job like girl A and B have. (I‚Äôm still great friends with them, we just can‚Äôt do much because of not similar free days) 

Part of me wants to send a message to Girl C and be like hey, I don‚Äôt know if you wanna befriends still. Etc etc but the other half feels betrayed in a way because essentially she though of herself more than me, she wanted the closer friend because A and B were close, it would have been Me and E, ands he‚Äôd be alone. Instead it was C and E. 

Aways thanks to anyone who read this, normally don‚Äôt do anything like this but I felt I had to get it off my chest. Should I message her? Or is there no point because that ship has sailed?

If anyone has any advise or just feed back in all ears.

218,"For some reason, whenever I get the chance, I sometime talk to this person that I‚Äôve created in my head.

A bit of backstory: he‚Äôs a character in my fantasy novel that I‚Äôm writing. He‚Äôs a demon (not a totally evil one).

Sometimes if I feel like I‚Äôm not totally understanding the situations that life presents to me, I want a third-person view on the situation, and it seems to help to ask him stuff. I just imagine what his responses to my questions may be.

My concern is that he‚Äôs a murderer. A big-time murderer, but he‚Äôs not evil. He kills the bad people who deserve to die (he‚Äôs kind of like a judge in the book because he judges them and gives them what they deserve)

Is it concerning that I talk a character I‚Äôve created in my head or is it fine that I want to get a different point of view on my very confusing problems that I‚Äôm faced with?

221,"Warning, ramble ahead. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not religious or spiritual at all. I don't believe in an inner energy or soul or anything of that kind. I don't believe in ghosts or aliens or any sort of mythical/supernatural being. But I've always wished I did. Insert here my lifelong identity crisis of wanting to be religious--a Muslim. Since I was a kid I've always been drawn to Islam and the cultures and customs and everything that it consists of. More specifically, the action of wearing hijab. I'm enamoured with it and what it represents. It's something that even when I was very little I've been attracted to. I remember being a six year old kid cutting up pillow cases so that I could wrap them around my head. Even now, years later, I sometimes wrap scarves around my head and go out. This desire to wear hijab has always been a part of me. I've gone through multiple phases where I say fuck it and ""become a Muslim"" and I go buy hijabs and the Quran and actually go to a mosque. I do fine the first couple of days but as I start getting into it my atheist ass makes a big comeback. I cannot, for the love of me, force myself to believe in Allah or any kind of God. It (religion in general) just sounds so incorrect, so impossible and quite honestly, silly. And it becomes a cycle. 

Now, here's where I need help. I've been dealing lately with this cycle again. The urge of wearing hijab is kicking in stronger than before, it's all I can think about now. I want to commit and wear it because it's just so beautiful to me and whenever I wear hijab it makes me feel beautiful and it feels so right. I feel so at home when I wear it. The problem is that it clashes with every other interest that I have. I'm a big goth/punk fan and the way I dress reflects that. This makes it pretty damn difficult for me to dress like a proper hijabi. I love to style my hair in a punk fashion and dye it crazy colours, so having it covered 100% of the time bothers me. I don't know how to deal with this. In one hand I want to wear hijab and fully convert to Islam but on the other I can't let go of my atheism and other interests. I try to ignore this urge but it always comes back. What should I do?",04Jul2019,0
222,"Long story...
A bit of the backstory - I've known this woman for many years, never became friends but were around similar groups and been Facebook friends for over ten years. A couple of years ago we started chatting and realised we had been travelling similar paths. Both have health issues (fatigue), mental health issues (depression/anxiety for both of us, PTSD for her) and were looking into similar treatments. We also both drink a lot. She kept saying we should catch up but when I would follow up, she wouldn't respond and the conversation stopped. This happened several times so I just left it, confused but I moved on. 
She contacted me again a few months ago, again were connecting and talking and told her I was confused about what happened last time. She apologised, said she didn't mean to upset me, etc. This time we made plans to actually catch up. We had locked in a day to go out for an activity we both like and the afternoon before she said she had a migraine and would get back to me later. Then nothing, not a word until late the next afternoon. I had sent a few messages but she didn't respond. I was a little concerned but let it ride since I understand about health issues. A few more plans were made and cancelled by her at the last minute, then she finally invited me over and didn't cancel. We had a great time, lots of good and at times deep conversation, laughter, we went out foraging natural foods the next day etc and both acknowledged how much we enjoyed each others company. 
We decided to get a weekend house in the hills so we could go foraging in nature again and hang out. I paid as she doesn't have a lot of money but said she would pay me back. I was planning to do go anyway so I didn't mind. That was due to happen this weekend. On Monday I fell out of bed and broke my collarbone about 3am. I live alone and was getting ready to go to hospital when I noticed she was online and had tried calling me. I'm never up at these hours. She'd had a big argument with her Dad and she was really concerned about me and we spent most of the time I was waiting in hospital talking or messaging, supporting each other. She offered to come stay with me to help out since my dominant arm is now incapacitated. I said I could call mum but she insisted she really wanted to be there for me. 
She had some things on during the day and hadn't slept but said she'd get over as soon as she could. I went home and slept on and off, then sent a message about 5pm seeing where she's at. I sent another about 9, then another about 11, no response. I assumed she was still asleep. She finally rings at 11:30pm, obviously drunk and I said I'd get her a taxi over, as she was at her parents' place still. Drinking around them only causes conflict. She kind of mocked me when I pressed the point and said ""do you need company or something?"" then said she needed to sleep and would be half an hour and we ended the call. Turns out she hadn't been sleeping during the day, but getting drunk and arguing with her mother and just ghosting me. Didn't think at any point he should let me know she isn't coming. So after an hour I sent a message letting her know I was upset, that it was obvious she never intended to come over and that I was cancelling the weekend house in the hills as I need some support. I then went to sleep. I woke up at 6am to find a string of messages apologising, saying she's ready now and whenever I want her caring/nursing/soup making skills to let her know, and that it wasn't intentional she didn't come over the previous day. One minute after I'd read the messages on facebook (literally one minute), she sent me a message accusing me of ignoring her and that she can't do this. More than a little confused, ""I said can't do what?"" She said ""did you read your message to me? WTF? Wow."" We talked some more, got past it, she admitted she was very drunk and she apologised again. So then I asked her what was happening today as I still have a broken collarbone, she sent a message but ignored the question. I asked again, and then she dropped offline. Became a ghost. 
I've done quite a lot to support her and help her try and navigate her path over the last couple of weeks as I've come a long way with my health issues, and she's been very appreciative. I cooked a meal and took it over last weekend before the fall and a few of her friends came over and we all ate and drank and laughed. And now this. 
I think the writing is on the wall and I've told her as much, that I'm not interested in a friendship after all this. I feel a little guilty as I know she's unwell and her mental health and alcohol use are far more significant problems than I realised. But even still, I don't think anyone should put up with this treatment. Have I been too harsh?",04Jul2019,2
223,"My mother has been a heavy alcoholic for as long as I‚Äôve been alive, and has had a history of mental illness in her family (parents, niece, great nephew, sister, daughter). She also has terrible hygiene. 

A few years ago, she had a brain aneurysm and came away from it, seemingly fine (aside from weakness). Three years ago, during the summer, she started to hear my tenant‚Äôs mother (we live in a 3 floor, 2 family house) saying stuff like how she would burn the house down; or blow the house up; or how the tenants mother supposedly jumped out of the back window of the house, naked; or how the tenant‚Äôs mother was threatening to kill the tenant. Mind you, she supposedly heard this by listening with her TV off, two floors above the tenant. My bedroom is one floor above the tenant and I tried listening when she said she heard her, and I didn‚Äôt hear anything. All in all, this culminated to her taking a sledgehammer to the door of my tenant‚Äôs apartment, and prior to that, a run in with her calling the police and they told her she just needs sleep.

I convinced my cousin to help me get her to go to the hospital (she‚Äôs a very stubborn person). So she goes to the hospital and they tell her she has a UTI and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing the hallucinations. I then explain to the doctor all of what she said/did and asked them to move her into a psych ward just to see if she does hear the voices again. 72 hours pass and they see she isn‚Äôt in any danger to herself or others and she gets released, under the strong belief that it was just a UTI.
I see no reason to doubt it, so I accept it and go on with life.

Then these past three years happen and she mentions hearing the same voices over again, but it was very random so I didn‚Äôt think on it much.

Then tonight comes and she hears it again in full force. Claims that tenant‚Äôs mom is going to set fire to the house. Claims that tenant was bit by a raccoon that my mother supposedly set on her, etc. My mother is going on vacation soon and I asked her what happens if the tenant sets fire when myself and my sister are asleep while she‚Äôs on vacation? (I try to draw more info about what she‚Äôs hearing when she has these episodes). My mom says ‚Äúyou die then.‚Äù Deadpanned and just like that. Mother then says she is going to cancel the vacation to ‚Äúprotect us‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point because I‚Äôm worried she will take action against the tenant, I‚Äôm worried that she might escalate and come after me or my sister, and I know that if I bring her to the hospital, it will just be the same cycle. She‚Äôll go in, and maybe doctors will say she‚Äôs been having more UTI based hallucinations, and then she will pretend everything is okay in the psych ward and then go back to hearing voices. I know if I get her to the hospital again as well, she won‚Äôt trust me enough to tell me when she hears voices and she could actually injure someone in the future. My younger sister is in college for becoming a nurse and she learned about some things in psych that leads her to believe it could be schizophrenia, brought on by her heritage and agitated by the aneurysm.",04Jul2019,2

She‚Äôs a new driver so he‚Äôs always trying to give her confidence by letting her drive.
I wake up this morning and she tells me that she hit something while parking but it‚Äôs just a scratch. I say ok but also tell her that she needs to tell her brother. When I mentioned this my MIL (mother-in-law) told me not to tell him because we don‚Äôt tell soldiers bad things when they are doing military service.

The thing is we're going to an amusement park sometime in the near future with some of our friends. I've got a few questions I'm hoping could be answered

One question is **I don't know how many dates it takes to make us an offical item.** It will be 2 dates but, I have never been on a date till recently. 

""*Anotha one*:"" **I don't know how to exactly 'make a move.'** I'm a pretty socially awkward 17 year old and she's socially awkward too. I hear stuff about people having sex on the 3rd date and it'll be the second one and I haven't even kissed her. (To be honest and as embarrassing as it is to admit this, I don't know how to kiss). 

The final question: **She wants to invite a couple of friends to go with us.** I mean I think it'd be cool to have a group of people to go with us and I'm down with it. My concern is I don't know if she wants to invite people so it doesn't seem as much as a date, or if I'm boring with just me. I think I'm over reading it because I'm too self-conscious and  have anxiety. The other part of this question is how do I go around with being more physically around her with some friends around us. Such as 'making a move.' And in a rare case we somehow magically start getting closer and I make my move correctly, how would I avoid getting too close and ruining the vibe of everything for the other friends with us?

They live off of welfare and we struggle to pay the bills every month. My dad recently left my mom for another woman. They are not even divorced yet. My dad has basically left us high and dry. We don't have a working car either. My dad is the only one that knows how to fix it. I live in a very small town so there is basically no public transportation. We are basically stranded in a house with no water and we get very close to running out of food every month before we get our food stamps on the 22nd. Even with food stamps we don't have many opportunities to go and buy food because of our lack of a car. We can't wash dishes or clothes, take showers or baths, or do anything that needs water. We get water from our neighbor's well via buckets. They are the probably the only reason why I'm probably not under the care of CPS. Our well, how we get our water, is going to cost $3000 to replace. Nothing we are doing is working. I've tried GoFundMe and other forms of raising money. We've tried saving up, but every time we get a decent amount we have to use it so we can keep our lights turned on. My dad scares me because I'm pretty sure he does crack, and when he's drunk and/or high, he can get violent. I'm happy and sad at the same time he's not living with us anymore, but the biggest problem is that he was pretty much our only source of income.

No one else can watch her because of how unpredictable she can be and the experience needed to take care of her. My dad isn't really planning to fix any cars for us so we are at least not stranded.

He despises my mom and I'm pretty sure he sees me as an extention of everything bad about her. I don't have any friends within walking distance and have a very limited connection others, basically only via cellphone data. I honestly don't know what to do. I don't even know if a CAN do anything.

TL;DR: I don't have running water, my dad does drugs and I'm pretty sure would kill me and my family for getting us taken away from him and him getting forced to pay child support, my family makes less than $1000 a month, we almost run out of food constantly, we don't have a form of transportation, and I want to kill myself.",04Jul2019,4

234,"I‚Äôm a 20 year old female and I live with my aunt (my cousin‚Äôs mother) to escape the abuse that took place at my mother‚Äôs house.

Here is not much better and I‚Äôve been here for about 6 months so far. I hate it here. Ever since February 2019. my cousin has been making my life miserable. I thought I was doing okay as a person and hardly even remembered events of my traumatic childhood. But that‚Äôs all changed because of him. First, he exposed himself to me on valentine‚Äôs day. I‚Äôm talking full exposure. He continued this for a month up until I told his mother who made him apologize and then swept it under a rug. His actions awakened trauma that I didn‚Äôt even know I had and there‚Äôs not a day that goes by where I don‚Äôt think of the sexual abuse/neglect I endured as a child or the domestic violence that I‚Äôve seen.

I look over my shoulder constantly and have vivid nightmares of being raped by my cousin. Some nights I don‚Äôt get to sleep because I am just that anxious and fearful that he will hurt me. I can‚Äôt stand to be in the same room as him and I try to keep any casual conversation he tries to make to a minimum. He makes an effort to be in the same room as me or make verbal contact with me, but not in a good way. If I am wearing something a little tight fitting, he gawks at me. When I am doing the dishes in the kitchen, he stares at me through the mirror. 

I sleep in the basement. There is a room in the basement, but my aunt sleeps in there, so I sleep in the open space part. When I wake up, he is usually there and already watching me, but he plays it off and pretends that he‚Äôs looking for something. I don‚Äôt know what he could be searching for; the basement is completely empty. Sometimes if I‚Äôm sleeping hard that day, he touches me. It‚Äôs done lightly so that I don‚Äôt wake up. He usually places his hand on my ass. When I do wake up, he quickly removes his hand and pretends that he‚Äôs searching for something.

I wish this would stop, I‚Äôm so tired of crying all day and living in fear. I can‚Äôt act out because I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to live. I have no other family. I have one friend, but she‚Äôs said that there‚Äôs no room for me at her place. 

I wish that I could have a door that prevents him from entering my space. I want to be left alone. If I had a bedroom like any normal person, I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about him entering to ‚Äòlook  for something‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know how to block off my personal space without a door.

235,"A little over a year ago now began a chain of injuries that has now culminated with me breaking my foot, tearing a ligament in my ankle, and being diagnosed with arthritis as a 21yr old by playing a sport heavily. My broken bone has now healed (though arthritis not going anywhere) but my ligament still is painful.

Exercise and playing sport is an integral part of my life. For the past year, I think I‚Äôve honestly surprised myself at how I‚Äôve been able to stay largely optimistic, laughing off the situation with my friends and keeping it in perspective that many ppl have it worse. But recently after I decided to walk with some friends for a little I kept feeling pain in my foot and it kind of made me spiral into a negative outlook thinking I‚Äôm never going to just be able to go for something so simple as a walk with friends pain free. For anyone currently with or have had any situations similar, how have you managed to stay positive and continue enjoying your day to day life being limited?",04Jul2019,2
236,"How do you go about telling someone without a malicious bone in their body who's only ever been a good friend to you that you'd like them to back off a bit because you can't deal with their obsessive level of clinginess? Other factors to consider are that this person has very few friends and immense difficulty making new ones. They also struggle with mild schizophrenia, have been rejected without fail by every romantic interest they've ever had, and are seemingly incapable of taking hints (I often screen this person's calls, hardly respond to their texts, am ripe with excuses to avoid hanging out... But it hasn't phased them)

For some context, myself and this friend of mine are both straight males in our mid-twenties. We met two years ago at an 8 week group mental health program. We helped eachother overcome a lot of trauma that had been inhibiting us for many years. I'll forever be grateful to him for that. But I feel like I've outgrown the friendship we made. In the two years since we met, I've made a ton of progress on almost every front - but I feel like he's been comparatively stagnant and he seems almost content with that. 

And what I mean when I say he's clingy is: he calls me every day. EVERY. DAY. No exceptions. I often don't pick up, at which point he texts me saying ""Hey man, wanna hang out?"" and/or tries calling me again a couple hours later. When I do finally feel like shitty enough of a friend to actually answer his phone call, he'll typically point out precisely how many days it's been since we last hung out and ask if we're still friends. But this is merely part of the problem.

He and I have very little in common, and so our typical hang-out consists of beer in his parent's living room, drunken conversation for an hour or two, and then sitting around awkwardly trying to figure out what to do next, which usually concludes with me deciding to go home. I was fine with this once upon a time, as I found great solace just being in the company of someone who could relate to my mental health struggles. But I'm in a different place now, and when I spend time with him it feels like it's more out of pity than anything else. But to him, our time together is as precious as anything could ever be. I know because he tells me every week... which in turn makes me feel like a terrible person 

I've tried dropping hints at how obsessive he comes across. First I brought up a very good friend of mine and remarked that neither he or I in 16 years of friendship have ever been so unrelenting in trying to reach one another just to make plans for casual chills. I pointed out to clingster that if I called or texted this good friend of mine solely to ask ""do you wanna hang out?"" as often as he does me, my good friend would not be my good friend because I'd have drove him away long ago. I've also talked about how time apart from friends isn't necessarily a bad thing and can in fact often serve to strengthen the relationship. I've brought about the importance of finding joy in solitude; finding hobbies and exploring passions beyond video games. I've said about all I can say without coming right out and telling him that his dependence on me is annoyingly obsessive and needs to stop.

Am I in the wrong for feeling as I do? And if I decide to tell my friend that I need room to breathe, how do you suggest I go about it?

237,"My friend and I made plans a week ago for the 4th of July. We planned I'd hang out with him after work, spend the night and we hang out the 5th. His work schedualed him to work almost every day but the 6th. I found someone to cover my shift at work that day 3 days ago and we changed the plans a bit. Today he texted me he has to work since his boss asked if he could work that day and he said yes. I told him since he did that I wouldnt be bringing the vodka we had been planning in drinking and wouldnt spend the night (I mean he has work the next day and will need to sleep and not be hung over as well as he doesnt know when to stop drinking sometimes). He is now angry that I'm not staying the night or bringing alchohol. He is giving me the silent treatment and I almost feel like just saying fuck it and not going over.

243,"Since the end of grade 11, I (M19) started to fall for my best friend (F20), after someone pointed out how much we talked and hung out together. She apparently really liked me secretly, but was too scared to tell me. I'll skip what's transpired over the last 3 years, but to this day we are really good friends. She got a boyfriend in grade 12 and has been with him ever since. She lives in a different city for University, but visits our friend group occasionally during school time back home.  Over that time, she's had lost the closeness with her female friends a bit about certain stuff ( they don't like her boyfriend, lies to them), but we have remained close. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is every time I see her and hang out as a group or alone, it secretly hurts me that it can't be me dating her when I had the chance. I sometimes want to just avoid her and try to not talk to her when she comes back or even through text, but I feel like a dick just ignoring her like that for no reason as it isn't her fault. When I do try to stop talking to her, after two days she'll try to talk to me and send me stuff to get my attention and try to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

It just hurts me sometimes to talk to her as every time I see her in person, I kinda fall in love with her again even though I can't have her. It is worse for me as it makes me feel sad, and sometimes it ruins full days that I could spend being happy over a situation I can't change and will never happen. It will literally make me depressed sometimes. It is conflicting as I like her boyfriend and I'm so happy she is happy living her best life. When I'm hanging out with buddies or busy, I feel happy and no stress and forget about all these useless problems. The second I'm alone this always comes back and haunts me and makes it hard for me to even enjoy my life. (not the only dumb problem that bothers me)   There are times where I just suddenly disappear from her life but I want to be friends with her, she is really cool and fun to talk with. We've had so many memories, even before I realized I liked her, and for that all to go to waste over me not being able to look past this stupid regret. It sucks.  I don't even feel in love with her when she's gone, but the second she tries really hard to talk to me or when we see each other in person all the ""what ifs"" and regrets come up in my mind again. I can't be straight up to her about it as she has a boyfriend and do not wanna destroy one of her closest friendships she's had all her life. It would hurt her a lot if I just avoided her completely. I know she would be devastated if I just dipped on her like that, but sometimes I feel like it is the best thing to do to live my best life. None of this is her fault though and it hurts even having thoughts like this :( she doesn't deserve to treated like that at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I approach this situation and still stay good friends? Should I just tell her how I feel? I just wanna be happy and all my life I've worried about other people's feelings about all my decisions and never focus on what makes me happy. Do you guys have experience with falling in love with your best friend and how you guys handled it? I just don't wanna lose her as a friend because I feel like if I can get over it, we can go back to what it used to be. Even now, hanging out with her with my friends is awesome.  I just don't know if I should take a long break from her or just completely delete such an awesome person in my life for my own selfish reasons? It isn't about me feeling hurt, but her feelings. Everyone says I'm one of her favourite people, and if someone like that left my life I'd feel terrible and thinks it was my own fault. I feel scared about what to do. IS there an approach where we are both happy at the end? I've met other girls, but all those feelings disappear when I see her. I'm just sick feeling like shit. I'm in my 20s and I should be having fun and try to meet new girls in my life and finding someone. It is holding me back and I realize it. Like I'm just lost. I would appreciate any past experiences on how someone handled it or advice on what to do? What can help me get over it?

244,"Background: I'm 18 years old, just finished my A-levels last year and now I work in an engineering company.

Situation: Last year in September I started work as an trainee engineer, where the company sends me out once per week to do a college course, which is great, but.... Not so great as I was pushed to do it by my parents. Don't get me wrong, I love engineering, but I feel (and still) feel like I should've of gone to university.

Recently over the past 9 months, I've started to feel like this is not for me and just got really sad at work.

I'd like to make a change, but I feel overwhelmed to do so. My Parents won't let me quit, and even if I did with one year of this course to go, I'd have to pay the company ¬£5000 back, if I quit half way through a 2 year course.

Eventhough there are some good days,  on the bad days,  I still think about why Im working there.  

Additionly, work has affected my mental health to a degree where I find it hard to be happy, the only days I'm happy are Saturday and Sundays. It also doesn't help that I don't have any friend's cause the old ones went to university or do other stuff now.

247,"So, long  story short, I'm now in 12th grade (part of college here) studying science-related subjects. You can't choose individual subjects before Hons. levels, instead you pick a group like  Science or Humanities. I had wanted to study Humanities since the 11th grade, but my parents wouldn't agree, acted like I was some kind of criminal for even thinking that and now fast forward to present times - Surprise! I'm failing in pretty much half of the subjects. Sure, science is cool and knowing how stuff works is interesting AF, but it's not something I can do academically. They assigned me a bunch of private tutors and always going about ""You need to try harder!"" No, I'm not going to try harder. I force myself to study five hours a day, not counting actual college. Or maybe I'm too lazy.

So either I keep this up for another year and end my college life by failing, or switch to Humanities or alternative education. Switching would waste one year, since I would have to start again from 11th grade, but that's better than failing altogether, but still  my parents are buried in their ""You need to try harder!"" Any help?

Thank you.",04Jul2019,1
248,"I've been struggling with addiction and body image issues for a long time. I am a female in my early 30s and feel like I have a lot to offer the world. My childhood was semi-traumatic due to the death of a sibling at a young age and my family separating. I was a really weird kid and didn't really fit in. As an adult, I eventually became a wonderful young lady, beautiful, happy, in a good relationship, outdoor pursuits, etc.

I started taking Adderall to stay thin and had a couple come to Jesus moments with myself, got into yoga and meditation, and went through a breakup, gained 20 lbs and struggled dealing with that for a few years. 

Now in my 30s, I am in a deep rut and have a hard time getting motivated to meditate and control my alcohol use and food issues. I lost 10 lbs recently, but then gained it back. I am constantly obsessing over my weight and I feel like I have no control over alcohol. Whenever I feel happy or confident, I think its ok to drink or eat certain foods, then I gain weight and hate myself again.

I've been trapped in this anxious cycle and I just want to be better and make a change. I want the strength to control my bad habits and negative self talk. I impulsively do things for pleasure and I'm unable to think about the consequences. I often act foolish and inconsiderate and then deeply regret it, but continue to make the same mistakes. I think that these experiences are valuable learning experiences and I want to use them to help people one day but something is keeping me from bettering myself.

254," I am 19. I am very focused on school, getting a career, getting married, and moving into my own place. I try really hard in life and get pleasure from seeing my hard work pay off. I really like getting into politics, history, languages and recently theology. I work at a place that requires servers to be young, typically 16-24. I try to talk with my coworkers about things but they just make fun of me. I have one in particular who is very annoying. My best friend likes her so I have to be really nice with dealing with her. 

This one coworker constantly calls me a child, yet she acts so much like one. I know its because I look 14 while being 19. But she is very rude. For example, I like wearing dresses to work especially because of my small frame. But she goes on rants on how I look so young and guys won't want to talk to me. Saying, ""They'll be like, 'I don't want to catch a case'"". She criticizes me for wearing dresses and that ""its not the place for that"" 

Another example is when my coworkers were talking about being excited for college. I was giving them advice being a sophomore in college. 
‚Ä¢ Parties are not as fun as you think. You can go but don't make them your priority 
    ‚Ä¢Don't get drunk around a group of ppl you don't know. I don't want anything bad happening to you. 
    ‚Ä¢Also getting drunk is also not as fun as they make it seem. I did it before and will never do it again. 
Etc...
The same girl is going to argue with me that getting drunk is fun because her friends said it was. Yet she has never been drunk or gone to a party. Then proceeds to call me a child. She tells me I'm boring because I don't go to that many parties and because I mostly focus on clubs at school. (President of one club and vice president of another) I just wanted to give her advice. She's the one talking about a duel duel major. She's even faught with me over the importance of saving money for textbooks. She now likes to call my college trash and cheap. 

This same girl has also bashed me for my sex life. We got into the conversation at work. I didn't want to engage much because my sex life/ sexuality is my business. Plus its work, if someone gets uncomfortable, that's our asses. But they finally got it out of me that I'm a virgin and that I really do not want to sleep around. I'd like to wait for someone I really love. Being in a abusive relationship before, I know how important this is to me. This girl begins to yell at me that ""times have changed"" and that I should sleep around. Mind you, she has never slept with anyone before. She tells me I'm going to fall behind in today's world and that people aren't getting married anymore. Everyone's just sleeping around and that I should too. Bruh...god help me. 

I said I liked kids once and how I was excited to be a mom one day. Then she said, ""I don't want to see you as a mom. I hope I never have to."" WTF?! That almost made me cry. My biggest hope in life is to have kids that I can love with all my heart. I work so hard now so they don't ever have to struggle like me. And for her to just say that, it makes me even emotional to write it. The only reason why she could he so rude to me is because we both used to like the same guy. But me and him are still friends, yet he never talks to her. We've never dated and that was years ago, so its a long stretch. 

I can go on but its annoying me. I don't know what to do or how to approach her about being so rude all the time. She'll argue with me. My other coworkers like her too. Not only my best friend. So I have to be nice in putting her in her place, any advice?",04Jul2019,1

To be able to finish next spring, I had to take 3 classes this summer while also working full time. A feat, I know. But I need money and a degree. Two of the classes were 4-week courses one after another. They‚Äôre both important classes for my major. The first class, I wrote 3 papers. The second class I have a research project. I recycled one of the topics of my previous class. I wasn‚Äôt intending on straight up copying my paper. I originally was just going to explore the topic further bc i didn‚Äôt think I really had the ability to. There‚Äôs a difference between a paper and a research project right?
Now when I say I work full time, I mean 4-5 days a week for 9 hours a day. So I had finished other portions of the project except a specific assignment. There were three portions. I finished #1. I asked for an extension on portion #3 bc of a scheduling issue (which I received). I admitted to my professor that I recycled the topic when asking for the extension and I straight up told them I was not going to rewrite my paper. Portion #2 I never started until the night it was due bc I was at work all week and used my last day off for the other portions. The professor does not accept late work and I was just thinking ‚Äújust turn it in before midnight, just turn it in before midnight.‚Äù So I put together the necessary data and I looked up and I had 15 minutes left. So as a last resort I just threw in stuff from my old paper from the last class. I turned it in with 3 minutes to spare.

So I tore through conflict policies and actually read through the academic dishonesty part of the syllabus.     It explicitly says ‚Äúnever turn in an old paper‚Äù and that the professor has to report it if it happened. My heart dropped to my stomach and all the sudden it seems like my desperation cost me the 4 years I‚Äôd had been at school. 
Maybe I deserve what‚Äôs coming. But I don‚Äôt even care if I get a 0 or have to get a failing grade and have to retake the class. I just don‚Äôt want to get kicked out of my major. I‚Äôve changed my major 3 times and this is finally something I really like and am really good at. Like I said, maybe I deserve to get kicked out but idk if I can start over again. 
I put together an email admitting to what I did and explaining why I did it. I told them it‚Äôs okay if they fail me. 
I haven‚Äôt sent it yet. I know this is probably my best move but idk what else to say. Beg for mercy?  Should I just take my L? I feel like because I straight up said I wouldn‚Äôt rewrite the paper, there‚Äôs like no reason for them to be sympathetic.  

TL;DR- waited last minute to do an assignment, previously admitted that I recycled the topic, said I wouldn‚Äôt rewrite my paper, did exactly that out of desperation to turn it in on time, not realizing self-plagiarism was a thing. Don‚Äôt know what to do or say to prevent being kicked out of my major.",04Jul2019,1
261,"My dad (60ish) is getting drunk off his ass every single night, and some days. He's been doing this for years, but it's been getting worse. He looks terrible and I think he has organic brain syndrome. He has elevated blood glucose levels, his stomach is hard and huge, etc. 

My family chose denial and blamed his erratic behavior on his hearing for years. (Yes, it doesn't make sense.)

Now, it's impossible to blame on just his hearing, but they still choose to just sit on their hands and not do anything about it besides fight with him. 

I've tried several times to get my dad to get help. I approach him and reassure him that I love him and ask if he would please go with me to W, or let me set up X, or look at Y, or consider Z, but it always fails. 

Last thing I tried was playing some documentaries on the Sinclair Method (pharmacological extinction), since it makes the most sense from a scientific and psychological back ground. It would include therapy and behavior modification with a qualified psychologist for best results. The medication basically keeps you from being able to get a pleasure release from drinking, and the addiction becomes unlearned in the brain. You don't go cold turkey (which would be pretty unsafe for him at this point). 

He let me get to the point where I was making an appointment with a prescribing doctor who could also do this therapy, but he backpedaled. 

So, I waited and then attempted it again, and this time he left the documentary and went driving while drunk. So I haven't tried again... He does that sometimes. I called the cops once, but he's so practiced at it that he doesn't get pulled over. 

I've tried appealing to my family, but they're no help. I don't have my father's power of attorney. He's still going to work during the week days, somehow. But from what he says about what happens there, people are very annoyed with him (he's gotten obsessive about collecting people's grammar, making noises, doesn't make sense, can't follow logic, makes weird faces, etc.)

I think he misses his parents (they've passed on), but he's been drinking since before this and I've also tried to get him to go for grief counseling but it's a no go.

I've tried talking to his doctor, but he couldn't due to patient non-disclosure. 

Hiding his alcohol doesn't work. 

I don't know how to get him to get help, or even stop on his own. 

We're not religious, btw. Or spiritual.",04Jul2019,1
262,"Option 1: rent my own place (currency not in USD, just trying to make the dilemma clear), I'd have to spend an estimated 150k, 50k i have in my checking, 100k i could get in savings. It's take me approx 10 months to get back to my current savings account level.

Option 2: share a furnished apartment with some unknown person, no initial big payment required, i could save up in 6 months and get my own place, no dipping in savings needed.

Notes:

100k would be 20% of my total savings

im assuming i spend 150k all at once and build my life within a month, ideally some nonessential items could be built up.

 I have had horrible experiences with roommates over the years (thieves, outted me to my parents behind my back, spread nasty rumors about me)

i have a thing against used furniture.

If i do the my own apartment thing, 20% of my savings would be gone but I don't need that money urgently, the rest would be enough to cover any emergency (10 months living expenses), ill have more peace of mind

If i do the shared thing, my comfort really depends on a lot of variable factors, but id keep my hard earned cash. 

My heart goes for my own apartment, but brain says to not dip into savings.

263,"So, I don‚Äôt want to reveal too much info because she is a very private person, uses reddit, and I‚Äôll probably show her this eventually and I don‚Äôt want her to think I violated her privacy in any way. 

My girlfriend from the ages of 6?-9? (somewhere in that range) was molested by a babysitter. Not every day, but very frequently. It was never really harsh or violent, she said she was held down and forced a few times, but most were just her waking up to it or being unwilling to fight back. It was never more than just the babysitter touching her (no insertion, rape, and she never touched him that she remembers). Her memory is very fragmented and blocked out, so she constantly remembers new details and things she had blocked out. The guy who did this to her just recently was locked up for doing it to another child.

I started talking to her about three years ago (we‚Äôve been together for five), and since she‚Äôs too scared to get therapy, I told her she could always talk to me about it. I told her I‚Äôd try to not prod her or impart advice since I‚Äôm not a psychologist in anyway and really don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about. I just listen and try to help her remember and say things I know are okay to say (like that‚Äôs she‚Äôs still valuable, she‚Äôs not gross, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with her, it‚Äôs not in any way her fault). 

It obviously tears her up and deeply disturbs her. She has nightmares, and when we talk about she will cry. If we play fight/wrestle and I restrict her or get on top of her forcefully in any way she nearly has panic attacks. Very obviously scarred by it. But now we get into the confusing part...

Last time we talked about it she was recounting memories and just generally talking about it because it had been getting her down. But this time she said she remembered something that really scared her, and she was obviously ashamed to talk about it. I didn‚Äôt force it out of her, I just listened as she recounted. But she said she remembers one time him coming in and her knowing what was going to happen and like thinking it felt good and kind of hoping he‚Äôd do it? And then an even foggier memory of one time trying to get him to do it by putting his hand on her back?

As I said before I am not a psychologist in any way and don‚Äôt think I am (not an arm chair psychologist lol), I know these things are very very very complex and the human brain is kinda shit at dealing with trauma and especially at those ages it can be confusing and I‚Äôm sure there was a ton of fear. And on top of that repression, shame, negative feelings about self and things like that. But I still find that deeply disturbing. I don‚Äôt know what to think about it or how to feel about it and I‚Äôd hate to talk about it further and my words or reactions retraumatize her or make her feel negatively about being able to talk to me.

What can I do to help her? Is this a sign she‚Äôs in major need of therapy and I should take steps to walk her through getting into that? And if she still refuses that, what can I say or do or think to further support her and encourage to vent and get it out of her mind and me not react negatively? 

She means the world to me and I know this is incredibly devastating to her, and these new memories/revelations are even more devastating. I just want to be a helping hand and get her wherever she needs to be to let this no longer be a damper on her life. Thanks in advance reddit!",04Jul2019,3

267,"So, I (15M) have a crush on this girl (same age and goes to sister school). I‚Äôve been talking to her for the past few weeks and on i‚Äôve met up with her a few times. I honestly have never felt happier when i‚Äôm with her, and she said she felt the same. We were saying ‚Äòi love you‚Äô and calling each other ‚Äòbubba‚Äô for the past few days until Tuesday, i decided to confess to her. I told her that i liked her, i told her how happy she made me, and i wanted her to be my gf. She said she likes me as well but she isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship.

Now, yes, i completely respect her wishes and decisions and i don‚Äôt want our relationship to die out over something like this. I was okay with it but for the last 24 hours, it was just eating away at me, i broke down like 4 times last night. I decided to talk to her about it today, and go more in depth as to *why* she said no. She said stuff like she just isn‚Äôt ready, her parents wouldn‚Äôt allow her, typical stuff. She then said that liking her was a dead end. I told her that i do really love her and that i am willing to wait for her to be ready for a relationship (i know, i‚Äôm cringe) but she then said that ‚Äòthat could be years‚Äô.

268,"My ex and I broke up on terrible terms. I had pretty severe bouts of sadness during the relationship (not from his doing) which included feeling worthless, unlovable, incapable, etc. He was good to me but I ruined the relationship (by searching for validation outside of him) because of these feelings. I have owned up to my actions, accept them, and I‚Äôm currently working on them as well as moving on. 
However, he continues to communicate with my family. I wasn‚Äôt sure whether I was being overdramatic, making the situation all about me (again) or if my feelings are valid but the fact that he was able to build/maintain bonds with my family makes me incredibly sad as I had never met his family members to this degree (I opted not to because I never felt ready or capable during our year long relationship) nor have I ever been extremely close to my family. 
He gets along well with my mom and sees her as almost a mother figure and she‚Äôs constantly telling me about how he‚Äôs doing..which hurts a lot more than I thought it would. 

Am I being overdramatic or are my feelings valid? Would it be terrible if I asked them to stop contact?  I‚Äôd feel spiteful if i told my mom to cut contact because i know what it means to him but at the same time the idea of the contact makes me incredibly sad...",04Jul2019,1

But as much as I try I feel extremely discouraged to do it. I worked in my first job this year and... it was terrible. 12 hours shifts six days a week, living one and a half hours far from work. Good pay but abusive bosses who used to sexually harass all the female employees, and guess what, we only got like 15 minutes of rest and weren't allowed to socialize becose the bosses were paranoid we would discover who earned more money.

It was shitty, and in my third world country it's apparently the norm. I feel that if I get a job again I'll be in this awful position again and it won't get better.

I feel discouraged and I honestly don't know what else to do with my life, I haven't figured out anything and I feel that if I work again I won't have time or a chance to figure out shit, and I'll be abused and sexually harassed again, but after two weeks of unemployment my family wants me to do something with my life and they're right, I'm someone I definitely wouldn't date right now and I want to change it.

282,"So basically, we‚Äôre on summer break right now and I‚Äôm just trying to figure this situation out before I have to see him again. My interest in wether or not this is grooming has been piqued since I told my best friend about the situation the other day and she basically said, ‚ÄúTell your parents or I will.‚Äù I just wanna know if she‚Äôs overreacting or not. 

My teacher and I didn‚Äôt become close until maybe two months until the school year ended, before this point I thought he was a bit odd since he had certain female students that hung around him a bit too often, had small framed photos of some previous students on his desk (all female), and just generally was the topic of a lot of rumors. I‚Äôll admit that our getting closer was prompted by me complaining about the people in my discussion group (English class) to him, and he subsequently gave me a sticky note calling me smarter than the others and telling me that he was apologetic for having put me with them. I wanted to keep the note and he begrudgingly let me (I thought it was weird that he wanted it back after I had read it) and wrote one back and gave it to him calling him a softie and telling him that I wanted to get closer before I left his class. 

This led to more notes being passed between us, the more notable being one in which he told me he missed having me by his desk (you make the seating chart dude, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.) I remember that in my response note, I said I knew he missed me because he would stand by my desk and talk to me for a long time despite having seated me so far away. I called him cute for it, kind of pushing my boundary a bit, but he didn‚Äôt make any comment on it. 

He started giving me nicknames, which was flattering, and I‚Äôm a teenage girl so I won‚Äôt lie that I liked the validation, but he started calling me them instead of my real name in front of other students which led to a lot of weird looks at me. But we only got closer, I‚Äôd put my sports bag under his desk so I had reason to see him after class, I‚Äôd stop by during lunch, linger as long as I could after our period, and it was good for a while.

Then some drama started up in my life regarding my ex boyfriend. I was acting weird in class and he dropped a note on my desk, ‚ÄúAre you okay? Stupid question I know, but I‚Äôm worried.‚Äù Which resulted in me going to his class to talk about it for an hour every day after school, sometimes longer, for weeks. The first few days it was all about the drama, getting advice, confiding in him and all that. Sometimes he‚Äôd say things I thought were a little odd like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you talked to me, I work out better when I‚Äôm angry and I was fuming thinking about it‚Äù or he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúFuck you for what you did‚Äù in reference to my ex and it made me happy. 

He told me that our student/teacher relationship was one thing, but that we were genuine friends beyond that. It was at that point that I opened up about my ‚ÄòDaddy Issues‚Äô, and he took the opportunity to tell me that I was like a daughter to him. That took me off the defense a bit, I was more open to playful contact after that. He would flick my ear if I said something that he disagreed with, I would swat at his face if he took something of mine and held it above my head so I couldn‚Äôt reach it and we started hugging before parting in the afternoon. 

He let me in about a lot of personal life details, I returned the favor, and I started looking forward to seeing him as a highlight of my day. I picked up reading his favorite book series, and we started bonding over that too. I developed something of a crush on him, and wasn‚Äôt too covert about it but never flat out admitting it. 

As the last week of school closed in, he started getting a bit more bold about the things he said. When I wouldn‚Äôt let him hold my sketchbook he insinuated that it was because I was drawing porn, which was just a ‚Äòwhat the fuck‚Äô kind of moment for me that I brushed off. Then when we were talking about a character from his book series, I made a joke about being in love with that character (that, mind you, he often said he strongly relates to, who‚Äôs name he uses when referencing himself, etc.), and he then took it a more intimate route by telling me I ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be able to handle him‚Äù and when I asked what that meant he said during sex, that it would be too rough for me to handle or whatever. I, pretty shocked, replied with something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure I could‚Äù and he said I must have a lot of faith in my sexual ability, asking if I had anyone that could back up that statement for me. I said no and he was teasing me like ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre making a claim you can‚Äôt back up? You sound like Trump‚Äù and laughed when I got flustered, telling me he knew exactly how to push my buttons. The way he leaned back in his chair and hummed and pretty blatantly looked me up and down after saying all that just added to my incredulousness. 

Later that week, a girl that shared my English period and another period sat me down and told me about rumors that had spawned regarding me and that teacher. She wasn‚Äôt someone I knew that well, but she still felt the need to say that ‚Äòit‚Äôs like he‚Äòs in love with you‚Äô and that ‚Äòeveryone sees the way he treats you.‚Äô And informing me that there had been girls in the past that had been just as close with him, and ‚Äòonly got closer‚Äô when they were legal. She said I was a good looking girl, and that he was a single man with a questionable history, giving me a warning I suppose. 

I decided after that that I wanted to push my luck further, and wrote him a letter admitting my feelings for him. I was completely upfront, pretty much saying that I wasn‚Äôt gonna get over it unless I heard it from him that I needed to. In a way I really wanted to get in trouble for it, which is why I wrote it instead of saying it to his face, so he had some written evidence when he took the issue to the administration. But he didn‚Äôt do that. He took the letter happily, and didn‚Äôt have anything to say about it the next day. Went about as normal, complimented my hair, smiled at me, completely unfazed. 0 reaction or reprimand. He had me sign his yearbook, told me he was looking forward to next year and told me to have a great summer. 

I was pretty shocked by that much, but figured he maybe just didn‚Äôt want to get me in trouble so close to summer. My friend thinks it was because he doesn‚Äôt want me to get over him though, so our views on it differ a bit. She thinks it‚Äôs a big issue, particularly because his class is situated in such a way that I‚Äôll have to see him everyday, and he‚Äôs very involved with my chosen after school clubs, most school functions, etc. 

Does this sound like grooming? Or just me reading too much into a man who doesn‚Äôt understand the teacher/student boundary thing too well?",04Jul2019,1

288,I rarely ever actually talk about my problems to people I know irl and when I do it's usually surface level. Recently my grandparents have seeing right through me. My grandma has noticed how I bottle things up and my grandpa sees how bitter it makes me because he's been through the same thing. I would talk to my mom about my problems but she's not to big on listening and also there are just some things I don't want her or my other family members to know. I don't know who to talk to aside from my friends but I'm afraid they might learn how weird I really am and stop hanging out with me. It's been so long since the last time I had a full conversation about my problems that I think I've forgotten how to open up properly. I'm like a broken door.,04Jul2019,1

290,"It's  a long story but I'll try not to make this too long, and if this should  go on another subreddit please let me know and i'll remove it.

&amp;#x200B;

My  aunt runs a cult, mom has been a member for 10 years, i survived the  cult and was able to get out via my dad suing for custody. Due to her  life in this cult me and my siblings don't have a good relationship with  her, one of my siblings doesn't speak to her at all and i get extremely  uncomfortable each time i see her because i know something is wrong.

We  tried to back off and let her live her life even though it's been  painful, especially for me because i was manipulated by my aunt and some  other people in the cult while i still lived with my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

We  feel like can't ignore this anymore because some survivors of the cult  that used to be in the inner circle are now exposing my aunt and the  cult, she's been sued several times but nothing has happened until now.  These people have gone to the media and now an investigation has been  done and a serious lawsuit is being conducted. I worry because now that  she's been exposed i don't know how my aunt will acr and my mom not only  is a part of the cult, she lives with my aunt and is basically her  servant and roommate.

&amp;#x200B;

I  spoke to her a few days ago and tried telling her that we just want her  back, we want to rebuild our relationship with her but we find it very  difficult to do so while she's in this cult, told her we'd help her  rebuild her life if she'd just got out but it seemed pointless even tho  she did break at some points of the conversation and said some things  that worried her about getting out.

&amp;#x200B;

Cults  are very common here, the law in my country is different from the US,  and all of this means that its extremely possible that my aunt will go  to jail if things continue the way they are. My extended family suspects  she's either hiding out in her house or she's already fled the city  beause no one has seen her in days and another family member that's in  the cult refuses to say where she is because she doesn't trust anyone  anymore. It's literally that bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I  worry my mom might sacrifice herself for my aunt if it comes to that,  especially because (maybe it was a mistake) by the end i asked her that  no matter what happened she should worry about herself and protect  herself only, and she told me ""i can't leave your aunt alone, she's my  boss and my sister (yes, in that order) and if she needs me i will do  what is necessary"". I'm really scared for her, I don't know what to do.  Also, by the time i went home she'd twisted my words and sent me a text  saying i'd told her that i was only going to love her if she got out and  that that was conditional and she wouldn't be manipulated.

&amp;#x200B;

She  has no money because LIKE IN EVERY CULT she gets paid dust even though  she lives with the cult leader and is her sister. I already told her  that she will have my support and my sibling's if she gets out but i  don't know what words to use to convince her, she's really deep into  this because she has a lot of crushed dreams and the cult and the people  in it helped her not to feel alone while the divorce was happening.  She's loyal to my aunt to scary level.

&amp;#x200B;

I  fear that it might be too late but if it isn't, what kind of language  can i use to help her to at least doubt what is happening? Or what  things should i avoid saying?

Thanks.",04Jul2019,1
291,"My amazing SO and I are staying at her parent place for a while.  Over the last week I‚Äôve noticed a distinct shortage of available clean boxer shorts, which is strange because the SO does laundry regularly.   Thinking that my SO must have thrown a couple of pairs away due to their age/holes etc , I ordered a couple of new packs and thought nothing else of it until last night......

It‚Äôs summer here so we‚Äôve all been dining together on the patio in the rear garden for the last week or so, and last night  was no exception.  After returning from work last night and exchanging pleasantries with the in-laws and helping my SO in the kitchen, I walked out the patio doors into the garden to take my normal seat at the table.    They have a beautiful walled garden, it‚Äôs very private and if no one is talking the only thing you can hear are the birds tweeting, a perfect spot to chill out and relax.   Whilst waiting for everyone to finish preparing for dinner I sat back and surveyed the garden, noticing the change to the flowers the warm weather has brought, listening to the birds chirping in the trees, finally getting to take a breath after another taxing day in the office. My attention was suddenly drawn to something hanging on the rotary clothes dryer, my father-in-law had done his laundry that day and hanged his clothes on it to dry in the summer air.   Focusing in on the various item of clothing I noticed a pair of my black boxer shorts hanging there in the evening sunlight. There‚Äôs no mistaking they‚Äôre my boxer shorts, due to my sizeable man bits I wear supportive Lycra Cotton blend mix type, made by a brand with a distinctive name printed into the waist band. 

All through dinner and the couple of hours after whilst we sat around chatting I had to use every bit of energy I had left in order to hold in the chuckles and to stop myself from staring at my hanging boxer shorts, wishing that I would notice something one them that would make me doubt they actually belonged to me.    Although I initially the thought of the father-in-law happily walking  around with his junk secured in a pair of my boxer shorts was weird, it became very very amusing. 

Anyway,  once my SO and I retired to the bedroom I asked her if she had noticed my boxer shorts hanging with her father laundry, she had, she found it as funny as I did.  She‚Äôs done laundry for him lots of times before and knows that he doesn‚Äôt wear the same type or brand as I do.  She surmised that on his route from the kitchen in the morning after making breakfast, her father must be  grabbing pairs of my boxer shorts to wear that day off of the clothes drying rails which she stands in the dining room overnight if the laundry hasn‚Äôt  dried properly outside during the day.

I‚Äôm writing this on my commute into work and my SO has just messaged me to let me know that whilst watering the garden this morning she has noticed another pair of my boxer shorts hanging in the mix of her fathers laundry (he didn‚Äôt bother taking the laundry off the line after dinner last night).

I don‚Äôt mind at all about loosing boxer shorts, I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm ever going to be able to look my father in law in the eye again knowing that there‚Äôs a chance that his junk and testicles are being snuggled by a pair of my boxer shorts.  Should I say anything to him?, and do you think I should buy some of those iron on name labels and iron them on my boxer shorts to avoid the situation in future?.

296,"I'm from Canada(Ontario), so thankfully doctor visits haven't been an issue, but since last Wednesday, I started experiencing odd symptoms- sore, stiff neck which led to pains in my ear canal and behind my eye.

By Friday I left work early to hit up emerg hoping to be diagnosed (my family doctor retired recently, and I'm in a nebulous place with a replacement, so it's emerg or nothing), and they recommended lots of rest and painkillers.

Yada yada yada neck pain went away but a severe headache took its place, especially around my eye. Monday was a holiday and by Monday evening I was back in the emerg hoping for further diagnosis. They hooked me up to painkillers, and pushed me on my way.

I missed Tuesday and Wednesday, that morning I was back in emerg again this time only with severe eye pain. They took a ct scan , didnt find anything too serious but planned on further tests outside an emergency setting, something to do with my eyes.

I've never had to miss this many consequentive days before, and might need to miss more. What's the protocol? How do I make sure my employer doesn't impair my health by demanding I come into work or threaten my employment? Bright lights, loud noises, and SCREENS(fuck this hurts to look at a screen ATM) aggravate the condition, but that would be unavoidable at work. I could bump up to stronger meds, but then I can no longer use heavy equipment or drive into work. 

Basically I want to discuss this with my employer, but I've seen how they treat injuries workers in the past and I want to protect myself. What actions should I be taking? What departments should I be contacting? Should I apply for medical leave? WHMIS?

TL;DR: been struggling for a week for a diagnosis for my medical problems, and it may take a little longer. What actions do I need to take with my employer(who has a history of acting shady in regards to injuries for my co-workers in the past) moving forward?",04Jul2019,1

301,"Context: so my girlfriend and I have been together for years. And I do my damndest to make sure she has a decent birthday. Her birthday is in December around Christmas, so even though some people would just lump it into Christmas I get her both birthday gifts and Christmas gifts.

My birthday was not too long ago. I told her exactly what I wanted which was a pretty decent ship model off of Amazon. Birthday arrives, I get a text saying there‚Äôs cake down here.

302,"After thinking about t again and again, i finally decided to just throw my story into reddit and ask for help. I've seen enough cases to know that reddit can indeed help out people. So, here it goes:

Mid 2017 i got to know a danish girl living in germany in person, after we knew each other for 2 years on the internet (nothing romance-ish happened before). Shortly after we got together - nothing special, but not a bad relationship either.  In September 2017 she told me she wanted to move back to her hometown, all the way at the top of denmark. Finishing her studies, getting back in contact with her mother who still lives there. I understood, but it was hard to immidiately accept. We still wanted to keep it going. 

In Oktober 2017, i took 7 days off work and drove to her, as agreed. The following week was the best time i ever had in my life. It's just how it is. After i got back, we kept very regular contact until late december 2017. This is when i felt something was off. I couldn't pinpoint it, it was just a weird feeling that things are not like they used to be. Every day i got  a bit more aggressive, less restraint, but only in real life, not in front of her. This eventually escelated and in a huge fit i sent her a message, saying i needed some time off and wouldnt check back with her. 

Until 2018 i had no phone activity, didnt use a pc, and kept anything online related to an absolute minimum. I cooled down, and when i went back online, confronted her about my feelings and worries. This is where she told me the truth.

""I allready started meeting someone else when you visited me. The visit shouldnt have happened, it was my mistake, blah blah, i hope you can forgive me, please dont tell anyone about my new bf."" &lt;- Her new BF, a mutual friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldnt cope with this information, and cut ties immidiately. On all plattforms. It wasnt too bad at that time, it turned out my worries werent for naught, and that i wasnt paranoid. I was quite... okay with it. For some time. 

In Fall 2018 it started going downhill. I remembered the good times too often. THought stupid things. Started drinking. Eventually started smoking. Got more aggressive. Got more depressive at times. Ive tried battling this by doing all the things people tell you after a breakup:

\- i travelled to multiple countries  
\- i do a lot of activities with friends  
\- I work out  
\- i fill my day with things to not think about the past  
\- i moved  
\- i gained new friends, which i am really happy about  
\- i started studying in addition to my job  
\- i've used tinder and similar, but no success   
\- listened to a lot of music  
\- i went to festivals and parties

Fast forward to todays situation:

\- i have a stable job, a nice flat, a nice car, friends in my house, a good relationship to my family, friends at work, and friends in general  
\- I drink daily, it got more and more since last year, but does not affect my job, yet  
\- i gained weight, not enough to be fat, but my stomach did get slightly bigger  
\- i neglet my studies  
\- my aggressive tendencies when playing made me quit multiple communities (by myself, as i am self aware about that), hence my online time reduced significantly   
\- There isn't a single day where i am not yearning to meet her again  
\- I have an increased amount of negative thoughts regarding people that did me no harm, but made me feel... negletted.  
\- I have an increased amount of negative thought against myself  


You wouldn't notice any of this in my life. Im an easy going person, i joke with people at work, i smile a lot, even to little things. I don't fall out in public. I dont show aggression to others in person. You wouldnt really notice anything, i think. 

But its bad, as soon as i am alone. And there is nothing helping it. Besides drinking. When after work, i get into my car and start driving home, it usually hits me like a truck. The feeling of loss, of beeing alone, and knowing when i get into my flat, noone will be there. Noone will greet me with a hug, ask about my day. I won't have anyone besides me when going to sleep. An overall feeling of beeing abandoned. 

I usually sit in my backyard, drinking. When friends come home its all fun and games, we talk, make a small fire in the evening, have a drink, its awesome. And then they go to bed, and i go to my flat, and it hits me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, there you have it. Ive tried dealing with it, but it didnt work, i went to do new things, didnt work. Met people, did stuff, changed things in my life. Nothing worked. I don't wanna talk about what goes on in my head, its not something i like to share. But im at a point right now, where i just go with the flow, and stick to having drinks, and more drinks, as it eventually helps me over the day, and i can escape into sleep. One might think, i just yearn a, or any, relationship, but my feelings for her are still unchanged. I every so often find myself visiting her different online profils, looking at pictures, trying to catch a glimps of her life. Makes it worse, most of the time.",04Jul2019,1

Before cutting my hair I had grown it out for quite some time so it was understandable that the thin spots weren't visible. When I went to the barber I told him that I wanted a short haircut. He began cutting, and his facial expression quickly went from normal to confused, remorseful, and sympathetic in that order. I looked down and it was very evident that at the back of the top of my head my hair was very thin. What began as a simple trim ended as a complete buzz cut.

The catch is that he asked me to call him after I finish my work around 10:30-11:00 a.m. So, I called him yesterday, 10:36 and he told me 'Sorry, I'm on lunch. Go home, lets do it tomorrow.'

Today I called him 11:38 a.m (I checked!) and again, _he's at lunch_. He said 'Oh, wait a minute, go grab a drink or something please, I'll call/text you as to my whereabouts and we'll sign.'. Well, I did and now am sitting and waiting. It's been around 1 hour and 30ish minutes.

Should I bring it up and call him and ask where he is? He might've... Forgotten. If so I'm sure I'll become so much more irritated. Or, suck it up and wait for him? It's a warm room, I have my charger and good internet.
Leaving is not an option, since it can possibly hurt the whole thing. He can hurt my review and write that I'm irresponsible and blah blah.

310,"this is gonna be long, I'm sorry

a few months ago my sister (16) was approached by a guy while at the movies. he said he was 19, and my parents were a bit reluctant, but met the guy and thought he seemed nice enough. things seemed to be going normal for a while, until he started cheating on her with her friends. I listened to him manipulate her on the phone when she approached him about this, saying things like ""this is what's gonna happen"", literally not allowing her to call things off. this is when she told me and my parents he was caught stealing $500 in alcohol from her employer, and my parents forced her to call things off. 

at this point, my mom and I were worried for her safety, so we went to the county's court website to view his record. not only did we find out he's actually 21, but has well over a dozen charges against him (burglary, hit and run with destruction of property, and even domestic violence). this is when my parents forced her to call things off.

a few weeks later, I went into her room to ask her a question pretty late at night, only to find out she wasn't there. at this point I didn't want to betray her trust, so I just sat up and waited for her to get home. she told me she was with someone else, but I didn't believe her. eventually she opened up and told me that she was actually still talking to him. a few days later, she logged into her iCloud on my laptop, and all of her texts synced. I understand this may have been an invasion of privacy, but I read some of their messages. not only was he telling her what to wear, but telling her how she SHOULD act if she wants to be with him.

the next day, she was supposed to be staying at a friend's house, my mom even dropped her off at this friend's house. the following day she wasn't replying to any texts and NOBODY, including the friend she was supposed to be with knew where she was, so my mom called the cops. the cop had me log into her snapchat, where we then found out she was with him the whole time. the cop then prompted me to look through the rest of the messages, which included explicit photos from both ends, and plenty of manipulative messages from his end. 

this was about a week ago, and she's still talking to this guy. my parents know, and forbid them from hanging out. 

I know she deserves better than this, and its taking a huge toll on her mental state. I hope there's someone out there that might understand what she's going through, and can steer me in the right direction when it comes to being the best sister I can for her. I don't know what to do at this point.",04Jul2019,6

312,"I'm 17 and most of my life I found great enjoyment in spending time in front of a computer. While a lot of people decide to spend most of their time in front of a computer it's generally because they are lonely or as an escape but that wasn't the case for me, I have a few friends and a family that loves me, but I don't spend a lot of time with them because I'm an introvert, but I still really care for them. I simply had a lot of passion and fun playing video games, watching youtube videos etc.

But recently I got into a mindset when I had a lot of anxiety because I felt like my life or the life of someone I care about could end at any second by something beyond my control and for 2 days I was very anxious. However after thinking about things I've come to terms with that fact and decided that because of that my goal should be to enjoy life as much as possible while I'm alive.

But for some reason after that, despite coming to terms with my emotional crisis, spending my time in front of the computer started feeling boring, and that really scares me because I've been so happy just doing stuff on the computer before, and that's all I've really known and now I'm kinda lost.

One thing that I probably should put here is that it's currently summer vacation and it could be that it's the excessive amount of free time is what's causing that, but in previous summer vacations I've also spent most of my time in front of the computer so I'm not sure.

We finish with the meeting I go to work and one of the Shu chefs tells me that I need to re-label all my bags of chips tonight because the sale is over so I make some chips and I make three boxes of chips and then I go label.

I want to send her this:
‚ÄúHey, I think it‚Äôs very immature and disrespectful of you to post something so bitter that you knew I could see the other day. I‚Äôve tried to be respectful of you after everything, but you just lost all of my respect because that isn‚Äôt fair at all.

I finally got some courage to go to school provided counseling programs but I don't know if I made any progress with them due to my reluctance to open up.

So I went home and had a talk with my parents. They're great people, willing to listen to my sad ramblings and provide wonderful parental insight but I also feel so empty and ashamed talking to them; I just feel like I have to hold my tongue. They tell me it's really in my head and that therapy is just like the talks I have with them, and I can see that. Therapy is really just me having those 1am life conversations with someone except it's a stranger that I pay to have conversations at 1pm. (Kinda like a hooker but not sexual, wow).

I don't know what to do, I really am trapped in my own head and, while I know that I can step out any time + progress can't happen unless I decide to progress, I'm just very frustrated with everything. Is therapy even worth it? I've been feeling this way for the past 10 years will it even change? If I can't even vent to my parents how will I even work things out with anyone else?",04Jul2019,1
317,"I work with someone who has the same position as me on our assembly line. I'm very quiet so I don't say much. Other people on the line ask me how I'm doing and ask me the regular questions like what I'm doing on the weekend or tell me about something in their life or day because I like to listen. But this guy I work with only talks about himself, that's it. 

He won't ask anyone questions about themselves, won't greet you, or contribute to your side of the conversation if it's not about him or something he does. He's ALWAYS telling me something that happened then he goes off once he's done telling me to tell every other person we work with the exact same thing. He does this constantly with pictures on his phone or to attempt to brag about himself like doing some house diy that anyone can do but he'll tell you he's an expert. All he wants to do is seem superior to you because all he does is pretend to know how to do everything and talk about himself. 

I've also noticed he seems acts weird toward me. I'm a female and we're both welders which is a male dominated field. I use to think he was better at the job but I've realized he sucks. He brags about welding since he was a teenager, tries to show off by welding faster than me, tries to do practice welds in between working just so he can show me. We do the same welds on a huge number of identical pieces and I've noticed his welds in some spots are usually shitty. He use to try to blame it on me all the time and  he's friends with the supervisor so he believed him. But we recently took a company test for welding, I passed first try, and he's had to take it four times now. People we work think it's funny and realize now that I'm better at my job. The guy gets all mad and says ""It doesn't matter! I don't care! It's stupid, they're just being really picky"" instead of deciding to change anything about himself or ask for help. 

As I've said I'm very quiet and kinda shy. He's someone who will stand there and wait for me to say something positive when he's bragging or showing me pictures on his phone. So I've just been saying something so hell leave me alone. But I'm sick of this guy. He's not interesting at all and I've noticed how he acts which makes me want to ignore him completley.

318,"Long story short: My parents are divorced and my Biological Mom was very toxic and abusive (mentally and physically) in my later childhood. My older sister and I were told we had to decide who we wanted to live with when we turned 13. My sister chose to live with my Bio Mom to get away from my stepmom (who had her own separate issues) and I chose to live with my dad. Bio Mom ended up gaslighting us and turned my sister against me so we didnt really have a good relationship until now. I stopped visiting Bio Mom and cut off ties until recently when she came back to apologize for all she has done. 

My sister and I have started talking about our childhood mainly to sort out Bio Mom's lies. We were talking about our relationships with family members we dont have contact with anymore. But she brought up something she felt had happened to her when she was littler but cant remember the exact situation, who it was, or what age. Funny thing about this is I had the same feeling for YEARS but kept it to myself because I thought it was all in my head.

We are both on the same page about this. We cant remember what happened, but certain and very specific situations make us uncomfortable and sometimes even give us panic attacks for no conscious reason.

I used to work part time in a big food chain supermarket and would get ~470¬£ per month. I terminated my employment last month and collected my last paycheck. I know how the paycheck dates rotate and today is their payday. I was coincidentally checking my bank app and noticed I have a large sum of money. My initial thought was that it was a mistake and I'm still in the system, but what's bizzare is that the amount is ~940, which is exactly double my old salary. It's been 13 hours since they've transfered me the money and still nothing's happened (I know this, because I know what time they transfer it to our accounts).

331,"OK so this is not a relationship of any kind this was a friendship I had with someone in primary school. You probably thinking how the hell could this be abusive but it was. She would tell me what to do, stop me from talking to other people, make fun of me, hit me and the teachers never noticed.

I never told my parents because I was too scared and embarrassed to do so. I felt under her control and was scared of her. I would purposely not say things to upset her and when I did she would go crying to the teacher and I got yelled at.

This parallels to abusive relationship somewhat and I know it‚Äôs not nearly as bad but keep in mind I was only 7 and was learning things about how people are. Now I have trust issues, self esteem issues and as soon as someone acts manipulative I get scared and avoid them. I keep thinking about this everyday and it has fucked me up.

I didn't want to ejaculate inside her anus, but it fucking happened by accident. We immediatly realized what happend. I couldn't see any cum outside of/ around her anus after I had pulled out my penis but I cleaned everything with tissues nonetheless. I cannot say for sure, however, whether some cum might have leaked into her vagina. Her vagina was very wet as I had fingered her during the sex. I couldn't see any traces of cum however.

She has a 30/31 days cycle and yesterday was the 6th day of it. So, theoretically this should be outside of her fertile days?

She's very afraid of hormonal contraception (which is why we use condoms only). The one time she used the morning after pill, she had serious side effects, so she only wants to do so again if it's truly necessary.

Yesterday my calves weren't in a lot of pain, and I could manage walking around just fine, but when I woke up this morning the pain was way worse and I can barely walk because of it.

361,"(Sorry for length and formatting)

My boyfriend works at a fast food joint about a mile from our house, and usually works until close to midnight. Neither of us have a car so we walk everywhere. I walk down to his work and wait for him to clock out so he doesn‚Äôt have to walk home alone in the middle of the night.

So last night I walked down there and waited outside at one of the tables as usual. I was scrolling through Tumblr when all of the sudden I hear a dudes voice yelling ‚ÄúHey‚Äù over and over. I turn around and see this older guy (probably in his 30s) headed towards me on his bike. I turned around and pretended I didn‚Äôt hear anything, but it was too late.

This guy comes up to me on his bike and asks If I can do him a favor. I kinda hunch up and quietly ask what he wants while covering my chest. He asked me if I could buy alcohol for him, which I thought was really weird. I told him I wasn‚Äôt old enough to buy some, but he brushed it away saying I ‚Äúlooked old enough‚Äù. I told him I was 19 and definitely not old enough to buy that stuff. He then apologized for bothering me, but this is when it gets weird.

He commented that I was really pretty, and that I shouldn‚Äôt be covering myself up. (That instantly set off red flags in my head.) I tried to ignore what he said and told him to have a good night. He shrugs and takes off on his bike. At this point I was pretty freaked out and was texting my Bf to hurry up because of that dude.

Not even a few minutes later the creepy dude comes back around the corner and comes back up to me, close enough to where he was almost on top of me. He says that he didn‚Äôt catch my name and wanted to know what it was. I asked him why did it matter and he said he was just curious, and that his name was Alejandro. He asked me why I was outside by myself that late at night and I told him I was waiting for my boyfriend since he works where we‚Äôre at. He acted like he didn‚Äôt believe me, and commented again that I was pretty and that I shouldn‚Äôt try to hide it. 

Now, I was pretty much going into panic mode inside. I carry pepper spray and a knife on me, and already had the knife hidden underneath my arm, Incase he tried to grab me, but only as a last resort. Luckily, he saw me staring at the restaurant window, and when he looked my Bf was walking past the counter inside. I think the dude thought that the place was empty/no one else was around, because right after he apologized again and rode off, but not before saying ‚Äúwhite girls are a blessing‚Äù (wtf?). He didn‚Äôt come back after.

I‚Äôve had to deal with similar situations before, with one dude actually getting out of his car and coming at me in the middle of the day and another dude stopping me on the way home one night, trying to get my phone.

Before it‚Äôs suggested, I‚Äôm not going to get a car. There‚Äôs no way I can afford even a used one, plus gas, insurance, upkeep, ect... and also I have bad anxiety when it comes to cars in general. 

What I‚Äôm scared of is being completely alone one night, and someone tries getting up on me or tries to grab me. I‚Äôm willing to fight and scream, but as a last resort. I don‚Äôt want to stop walking my boyfriend home however, because I want to make sure he gets home safe and I don‚Äôt know what I would do if he got hurt.

Does anyone have any tips on how to better deal with these creepy guys I run into?",04Jul2019,1
362,"I felt like getting this off my shoulders for a while so without further adieu:

I have a teacher I'll call B who has been relentlessly targeting me for 1 1/2 years. I don't know why she does it too. Every single lesson I have with her, she somehow manages to put me on detention. Whenever everyone is going apeshit at the back, as soon as I open my mouth, she puts me on detention. When I ask for glue, I get put on detention. When I look behind me, I get a detention. And when I asked to wash my hands (covered in ink from a broken pen), she let everyone who asked after me, go to the toilet before I could and didn't let me go. It's as if she has selective hearing because she she somehow can't hear everyone talking at the back but she can always hear me when I talk for 2 seconds. I've called her out on this multiple times but she just continues to ignore me and act like I don't exist. Kids who've done worse than me somehow get off detention but for some reason I never get let off even when I behave better than them. This kid who kept hitting his pen on the desk behind me annoyed me so I asked him to stop, and guess what? I GOT A DETENTION! she tells me to tell her if it happens but whenever I call for her she doesn't come to me until 30 minutes later! She always answers everyone else before me and never puts anyone else who is worse than me or talks more than me on detention because apparently I'm the problem and not the 30 other students talking all lesson. I've also heard a student from another class swore at her for doing the same thing to him aswell. She ruined my already shitty day and it's annoyed me to the point where I don't ever want to see her filth anywhere near me ever again. Thanks for reading if you have I guess.",04Jul2019,4
363,"For as long as I (21F) can remember, whenever my parents came home from work, they would take some time to complain about their staff, commute, coworkers, work, or boss. Without fail - every day.

My mom and I used to do cottage weekends with her sisters who she sees approx 1/month and I would fall asleep in a nearby room listening to my mom complain about her job (one she chose and claims she loves). She‚Äôd fill them in on the worst of the worst or whatever happened most recently. 

By time I was 11 or 12, they shifted from complaining to one another to complaining to me on the drive home from school or at dinner or after dinner. Of course, when my dad came home a few hours after my mom, they‚Äôd have to repeat it all again for one another.

My dad would go on a drive to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù after work where he would take me and talk about his day (almost always resulted in ranting).

Looking back, I have done the same thing. When I was 16 and working in a restaurant I would go home and talk negatively about work (wasn‚Äôt a bad job!). When I was 19 and working in retail I would go back to my roommates and complain about work (made great money and had great coworkers). I quit a 16 week job 4 weeks early because I was getting so upset every day I was losing my appetite and was crying so hard about work that I couldn‚Äôt sleep well (had been dream-job at time).

Now, I‚Äôm 21, working in my field for an amazing wage in a gorgeous office with a lovely and pleasant commute, doing almost exactly what I‚Äôd want to do long term - and I still go home and think about all the negative aspects. 

I shouldn‚Äôt be focusing on the negative parts of my job but I can get myself so upset I want to burn bridges and quit (over really small issues in the office). The negative mindset I get in is going to impact me in the long term if my work-life balance doesn‚Äôt improve and I can‚Äôt keep a job for more than 6 months because I think myself into hating my coworkers/commute/work.  

What can I do to stop this behaviour?",04Jul2019,3
364,"Basically, someone transferred money to my account yesterday, but it hasn't arrived yet. It takes time to transfer between different banks but I want to know if he didn't somehow fake the payment. I don't even know how that'd possible, as I saw him make the payment, but you never know right?

I'm not gonna ask for personal information, don't need it and they won't give that anyway. All I need to know is if money was actually sent to my account.

Is it possible to call his bank to ask if a transaction to my card number took place? Can they even see a transaction knowing only the date and the account it was transferred to?

365," 

My boyfriend and I had made the decision to move and study in Spain (we live in the US). We're both EU citizens and it's less expensive to study there. However, it's a big risk for him because of his status here in the US (if he leaves the country he will be deported every time he tries to enter.) We started our application to a university, but for reasons out of our control, he was unable to finish his application. I, unfortunately, got accepted and now have to decide whether or not to go. If I go, it would put a strain in our relationship and end it. If I stay, I lose the respect and trust of my dad, the university, and the opportunity to study there this year. I had already made the decision to just stay for another year until my boyfriend's situation got better, but I am losing quite a lot. Is it worth it? Should I just risk losing him for better education and respect? Or should I risk better education and respect for love? What if I'm risking it all for love that doesn't last? (he's tried many times to convince me that he's never going to stop loving me and that he'll always be happy with me).

Now lately when it's just a conversation between us it can lead to his feddishes. I never bring them up, he does though. I let him talk, I don't mind because this is level A stuff AKA pretty mild. Though if it gets too far I've told him how uncomfortable I am. Sometimes it gets put in the back burner. He's not exactly the sharpest knife. We're not together or anything like that. 

Recently he talked about something involving us, he normally doesn't do that, that went way too far.

369,"Ok, long story short:
About a year ago: I (17M) had a crush on a girl (17F). We don't talk to eachother at all though. At a party one of her friends tells me that the girl, lets call her Amy, likes ne as well.
I don't make any move to talk to her for ages for various reasons which aren't important. Then about 3 months ago I finally got up the courage to message her on snapchat during the holidays. We end up talking for a week straight, she seems really sweet and I like her even more. I progress to talking to her at parties and in person in the classes we have together. I asked her to prom the other week and she said yes! Things were looking up and we are on holidays again now and messaging eachother everyday. So I finally decided to ask her out to a movie next week, depending on her availability, with no specific time given. She had already told me that she has no plans for the rest of the holidays. But her response has me questioning everything. She said maybe and that she would have to see if anything came up. I said that that was fibe and I apologised for putting her on the spot by asking like that. She only saw the message when she woke up abd she said she wasn't fully functioning when she responded, which I again said was fine. Then she swiftly changed the topic of conversation and we sorta just pretended nothing had happened. So now I'm thinking is this a hint that maybe I should back the fuck up because she might not even want a relationship with me. But at the same time I really like her and the facts that she told her friends she liked me and said yes to my prom invite still give me hope that she might be interested. What do you all think?

370,"so not too long ago my sister gave me one of her old iphones (it was an iphone 6 plus) which had huge cracks on the screen. no big deal, my dad went and fixed the screen and it was like brand new. i was extremely excited to have finally gotten a proper phone and i used it wisely and carefully. yesterday, it was acting a bit buggy and i had no idea why, even some apps were acting a bit weird. i thought it was the software so i updated the IOS and then went to sleep. i woke up this morning realizing my phone wont even turn on. i instantly got out of bed and searched the best solution on my macbook. 

it ended up working as it turned on but it was acting worse than before! i was pissed off and blamed the software update, knowing full well to not update old phones since it could ruin it (i should know that since my best mate had warned me a million times about it) weird strips were appearing on the screen and the color went dark as if it was tv static. i tried to restore my iphone on itunes but it took way too long as my iphone was quickly getting worse by the second so i soon gave up. i plugged it in and left it, but then i got curious. 

i took off my cover and realized there was water residue all over the back and in the cover! i was so confused and that brought my anger up to a thousand. i went into my room where i had last kept my phone and saw that there was a puddle of water leaking from my water bottle. that was the last straw as i began to cry (im a 17 year old girl so obviously this is tragic news to any teen) 

out of all the things in the world that could have ruined my phone, that was it? something that i DIDNT do? as im typing this i cant help but feel intense regret and depression (i had a bad week in general so this was just the icing on the cake) 

i left my phone on the counter to dry for 24 hours but honestly i cant even go an hour without wanting to mess around with it again.

i dont even know how to tell my dad...he's gonna be so pissed! 

so my questions is..how do i get over this feeling of regret and is there a chance i could revive my iphone?",04Jul2019,1

373,"I've been with this girl for a little over 5 years. She is my first girlfriend (met when i was 19, we are now both 24). We've had our ups and downs, mostly downs, but i feel emotionally drained and i don't think i can do it anymore. 
I'm gonna try not to make this too long or too incredibly detailed. But we started off as a long distance relationship, moving in together after not being together very long. It was nice at first but quickly started going downhill. We moved out of my apartment and into my mom's house to save money, but that went bad quick. My mom was and still is addicted to prescription pain killers, and my mom was trying to put a wedge between me and my girlfriend, saying she stole her money, didnt do anything around the house, all lies. So we moved out and got ourself a rent house. Again it was nice at first but went bad shortly after. We always argued about little things. We also had disagreements on beliefs. She wanted me to become cristian (I'm an athiest), and wanted to get married asap because we were living together and having sex and we weren't married. I kept telling her i dont believe in god, probably never will, but i didnt want that to stop her from believing. I even went to church with her. And i told her i wasnt ready for marriage (At this point we had been together for about 9 months or so). But she kept going and going till finally i just caved and said okay i'll believe in god and we can get married. Which i know is my own fault, I've never been good with voicing my feelings, most of the time i just hold my tongue and agree to avoid confrontation. But eventually i told her how i really felt and it hurt her. As time moved on our fights got worse, yelling and screaming, she would insult me in the worst ways. And as a man this is embarrassing to say, she put hands on me multiple times. Shoving, slapping, hitting, and even holding me at knifepoint. She says i put hands on her too but the only thing i ever remeber doing that was even close was pusing her off me when she wouldn't let me leave. It was extremely toxic. Eventually we decided to move out, she moved in with a couple friends and i moved into my dads new house. We still saw each other, still fought, sometimes we went a couple weeks without seeing or talking, but always came back. A couple years of this goes by and we start dating again saying we'll take it slow. Well that didn't happen, we moved in together shortly after. This time things were great at first, we got along, no fights, i fell in love with her again. This time, i asked her to marry me, and she said yes. (This was last summer) but after that things went back to how they were. Fighting and yelling, insults etc.  After about a month or two she didn't want to get married. I said thats okay, as long as we're together. Then she said she wanted to flirt with other guys. Thats when i emotionally gave up. We stopped sleeping in the same bed. Barely spoke. Finally i told her i was moving out. While she was at work i packed my stuff and left and tried to start moving on. That was last October. And again we're still seeing each other casually. But I'm not happy. A few weeks ago we fought and she said ""its no wonder i put hands on you, you drive me crazy!"" That really hurt. She apologized for it a few weeks later after i brought it up. About a month ago she told me she had a miscarriage. I know she's hurting but wont talk about it, she just makes jokes about it which i guess is her way of coping. But I don't want to see her anymore. I want to see other people, she's the only person I've ever been with and i want to date around and meet new people. Even though we're not technically together i dont feel like i can do that unless i tell her I'm done and cut her off completely. We've just been through so much together i dont know how i can just break it off. But like i said before I've never been good at expressing my feelings. Its like I'd rather be in this limbo state and say nothing and hope it just works itself out than break it off and move on. I also feel like we're in this never ending cycle. Get together, fight, break up, talk, get together, repeat. I'm so tired of it. But with the miscarriage would it be wrong of me to break up? I don't know what else I can do. I want to tell her that in my opinion she should move back to her city and be with her family.

I‚Äôve been at the same job for 4 years and my hours only range from 20-30 weekly and I get paid 11.50 an hour. I do a delivery service on the side and bring in about an extra 250 dollars a week. I am currently about 2 years away from completing my degree as a heath system informatic technician (if I were to go to school full time without being able to make any money whatsoever). I fell in love with a girl in September 2018 and her and I have been dating ever since. She is everything I could possibly want and more, and I am often in awe that I have her. It is my dream to move out with her and to live with her as soon as possible. I am embarrassed about how much money I make and how my bank account is lesser than hers (she works 40 hours a week at a somewhat flexible job and will go to night classes). She is very beautiful and very stunning and I often get worried that I will not bring enough progression to the relationship if I don‚Äôt start progressing with myself. 

Unfortunately I recently started correlating my overall worth to how much money is in my bank account. It has been a persistent bother to me for the last few months since my girlfriend and I have spoken about living together. Both of my parents are always supportive of my actions, but my mother has always pushed me to be very school-oriented and if it was up to her, I would be going to school full time and living at home until at least age 25 or 26 as I am an only child. I am watching some of my friends who never went to college and trash talk it make 40-50k a year in certain positions they were given from just knowing people, and watching some of my other friends graduate college and actively search for a position in their career.

377,"This is a bit of a long story, but I'll try to condense it as much as possible.

Basically, I worked on getting my prerequisites for a radiography degree done over the past few years, but I kept failing the entrance exam so I started working on backup plans. One of my backup plans panned out eventually and I landed a decent entry level job in the manufacturing field. I make close to $19/hour, which is good where I live (Maine) and we are typically allowed overtime and get holidays and 15 vacation days plus 5 personal per year and we can buy an additional week of vacation if we want. It's a decent job, it's just not really one I'm super interested in, but it pays the bills plus some. I finally passed that entrance exam around the time I started here, so I figured I'd work for a while until school started and save money. Here's the problem: the program starts at the end of August. I can't work at my job on any of the shifts offered at the same time as going to school because of scheduling conflicts and general lack of time to study if working fulltime and going to school, so I must leave my job to go back. I am worried I won't be able to afford going back to school because I don't think I'll find anything parttime that pays even close to what I make now. This job will pay for schooling related to the work we do if I stay for two years after finishing, but I don't know if there's anything I'm interested enough in that would be related. What should I do? Everyone I know who works here keeps saying I'm making a big mistake and I am kind of starting to agree with them. I'm 29F and married, but we can't start a family right now because we don't have a house and are renting an inlaw apartment from my mom. My life is basically on hold because of this and will be on hold for two more years minimally if I go back to school. I don't even know if being an xray tech would be any better than what I do now and the pay when I finish would probably not be that much better than what I'd be making in a few years if I stayed here the whole time plus I'd have to start at per diem.

(Cotards delusion is where you believe you are dead or dying). I guess I still have some of it. I also have really bad ocd so I think about age/numbers and aging all the time. My life is the most amazing it's ever been but my mental health gets worse and worse. I don't know what to do. I just want to be able to enjoy video games, skateboarding, movies, painting, etc without thinking there's no point to it since I'm old and dying anyway. I need these evil thoughts out of my head.

384,"So leading up to this, me and my mom got into an argument about an extremely small thing, unimportant. At first, when she constantly, loudly knocked on my door, I was annoyed, but when I told her to get out for the third goddamn time, she told me something along the lines of ""drop the fucking attitude"". I got yelled at because I was extremely tired, from my lazy as shit mother. At first I just wanted her to go away, but now, I have made it my mission to disobey her at every chance, if she gets to swear at me so openly, but I don't get to be even slightly angry at her, no, I refuse to give into such bullshit double standards. As such, she threatened to have the internet cut off for several weeks. If everything else should fail (movies, cellular data. etc) should I go on night time walks to alleviate boredom? I've heard of other Redditors doing that, and I haven't seen too much crime where I live at, but I'm not so confident either. What are your nuggets of advice?

They used to go out a long time ago and it lasted about a week. I asked both of them about it and she said she never had feelings for him he was just someone she had around. She ended the relashionship because he was too clingy. Him on the other hand did have feelings for her a little bit but he said she really hurt him because even after the break up she kept confusing him (like sometimes she was cold to him the other he was convenient for her to kiss and stuff).

(Should also mention that she was the one who got us together)

They're over that now and left it in the past but for me it hurts alot to think about. I know they would never hurt me but i keep having nightmares about them which break my heart more and more and i can't stop being paranoid. They both told me its in the past and they forgot it and they make sure not to even mention it in conversation. However, i still can't help but feel like I'm breaking inside..
Maybe it's because of a past relashionship but i keep having a feeling that something bad will happen and it'll ruin my relashionship with my boyfriend.

393,"My brother was dating a girl that I had slept with before, but she didn't know we were siblings, my brother and I dont really look similar. She knew knew my last name and never made the connection. 2 months later she met my brother and they ended up getting into a relationship. 

When she realized who his sister was (me), she was maybe going to say something but didnt because it meant outing my sexuality, so she left it. They had a rocky relationship, he said that she abused him, but I think it was the other way around/ they fought. I know my brother and his anger issues, he's even almost hit our mom before. Besides, when I asked him if he ever hit her, he said no. When I asked her, she said yes, she's fought back a few times so she hit him. So that's a completely separate issue. 

I began talking to Sophie* again, I wanted to know more about what happened and I believe her because she's showed proof, my brother never had any. Other people had told me of what an asshole he was and seen him mistreat her without her there, and they didn't realize I was his sister. But lately I told my brother that I was bi, and Sophie and I had slept together in the past. He got mad at Sophie for not telling him, especially because sophie had been pissed that he cheated on her in the past. (Crazy logic to me.)

395,"I inherited this from my mother. The anger. Ironically, I was almost never mad when I was a kid. I was always peaceful. Good with everybody.

397,"Well, this is quite complex, and as such I don't expect a solution - just advice on how I can develop myself in the right direction.  


For context, I'm a 35/M living in a medium-sized city in Sweden.  


The main obstacle I'm trying to overcome is that I from childhood got too good at ignoring pain and painful emotions, which lead to a bad habit of shutting down emotions. Which in turn developed into a mild psychotic disorder. Basically, I'm fine as long as I'm in control of my emotions, but if I completely lose that control I go hypermanic, which in worst case can lead to a psychosis. Even if it doesn't, I experience long depressions after I regain my composure.  


Therapy as such hasn't helped me (though it was years since my last attempt), but I do try to make use of as many emotional outlets as I can. Mostly playing music and reading emotional literature. This gives me a way to stress my barriers without risking breaking them.  


In most contexts I'm completely fine with simply keeping that control and getting on with my life. The reason this is a major issue for me is because of women. I'm only really happy with a woman in my life, and it's now been more than a decade since the last one.  


Even though I'm quite introverted I've tried to expand my social circles several times. This has resulted in me having hundreds of aquaintances, but because it's difficult for me to really open up I still only have a handful of close friends. All who are male.  


Also, I get the feeling that women I get aquainted to either:  
1. Are only interested in me in a platonic way, and quickly distance themselves if I start to show any romantic emotions towards them

2. Have a romantic interest, but feel rejected as I'm too slow in the emotional department  
3. Are attracted to the ""strong and silent"" archetype, and thus lose interest when it turns out that I do, in fact, have emotions  


I believe both of my previous GFs have been in the #3 cathegory, but I don't think it's good for me to be with somebody who won't let me display any feelings.  


Now, the above points mostly refer to women I meet through mutual friends, at parties etc. I've given up meeting women at bars or on dating sites, because of the implications. It's just not socially accepted for a man to need to take things slow in romantic situations, so I feel I need to make friends with as many women as possible and let my emotions develop at a pace that's more natural for me.  


The thing is that I don't make female friends. I've tried hard for years, but the only ones who seem really interested in getting to know me better are men. And yes - I've done my share of experimenting, only to realise I can't develop a romantic attraction to a man.  
So every time I try expanding my social circles I end up with hanging out with a new set of guys, more or less.  


And it's not simply a question of interests. I have no problem at all connecting with women on an intellectual level. I have all kinds of interests and hobbies, so I can always find common ground with people. It's connecting on an emotional level that seems to be close to impossible for me.  


And it doesn't get better with age. At this point it's much easier for me to take a punch than a hug, if I can't steel myself first. That is - hugging somebody when you meet them or say goodbye has never been a problem, but if I get a hug (or even a kind word) at the wrong time I break.  


So, Reddit...as I said I don't expect any solution to this, but I'd be really happy to hear your thoughts and any advice in how I could change to overcome my difficulties.  


As a PS; I prefer to control my disorder myself rather than through medication, as the heavy medication of my mother was the main reason I turned out like this in the first place.",04Jul2019,2

Okay, so I‚Äôm a 25M and my ex girlfriend is 25F. Had to break up because of work relocation a few years ago. We‚Äôre still extremely close and remain great friends. 

So, a few days ago she called me and told me someone tried to rape her the previous night. She was drinking at a bar with friends and ended up crashing at some guys place who she knew from her friend group. So she falls asleep and with her alcohol consumption mixed with her being an already deep sleeper, she said she woke up with this guy on top of her and basically trying force things in. She freaked out, still drunk, and ran out of the house and drove home. 

I was fucking furious hearing this story because this is one of those situations where I legitimately want to fly 5 states over and kill this guy like some movie. But I tried to just remain calm and be supportive to her because I can‚Äôt imagine how traumatic that must be. I mentioned her reporting it to the police and she said no she didn‚Äôt wanna do that. On the inside I was baffled and upset. She knows who this guy is, and she can report this asshole and try and get him what he deserves. Who knows how many times he‚Äôs done this before and is gonna do it in the future. Stop this fucker now. But again, it‚Äôs not my story and I feel like this is something I have no say in. I can only support her right now and just try and comfort her during this traumatizing experience. 

I‚Äôve suggested at least talking to a therapist/professional about this and she‚Äôs considering it. She‚Äôs a hard headed person who will try and just put this behind her and chalk it up to ‚Äúshit happens and that guy was a piece of shit‚Äù.

So should I bring this up at all in the near future? If so, when? How?

413,"Hello!

I've run into an issue, and I really don't know what to do. This also pertains to my future prospects.

I started a job in January right out of University, and it is decent. Really lax, good pay, not a ton of pressure/stress, and a short commute. The people don't really talk to/include me in things, but I am also introverted, and depressed. It's hard for me to be social.

Anyway, our work does this thing called summer hours, where the department (small department) leave at noon on Fridays throughout the  summer. The catch is that someone has to stay all day in case something happens. We each had to sign up for two days, and I signed up on July 26th. This was a royal mess up, because I committed to leave for vacation on the 26th. Now I am supposed to work the whole day that day, and everyone else leaves in the morning for a 9 hour drive. I can't request it off at this point.

This is my first official salaried role, and I don't know how to handle. I was thinking about just working, and going after, but this is a 9 hour drive and we leave on Sunday. It's not worth going for one day, and even flying out for that.

My options are basically work it and figure something else out, or work remotely in the car on the way there. I have a third option, and I this is what I need an opinion on.

I am not sure if I made a mistake doing this or not, as I'm six months in and didn't pay my dues, but I asked my boss if we were allowed to switch with people. He stated he sees no problem with it. There are two people I can ask to switch days with. This is what makes me really anxious.

I've heard from other people who work in the same industry that  I'm ""supposed to be paying dues"" and to ""not even think about getting on someone's nerves"". I don't get a pass on this because I am not a ""senior employee"". I am relatively new to the job and shouldn't be pulling this stuff.  One of the rudest things I heard was ‚ÄúEven if your boss says it‚Äôs ok, people will remember your inability to grasp simple work/vacation standards. This is unacceptable and you won‚Äôt be treated professionally. 

Also heard "" Your coworkers probably have their own plans set too. You may give them the impression you aren't a great planner (deciding to go on a trip without checking on your working days). In this situation I'd postpone the trip a day and work. You have been committed to working that day. You might need to use such a favor with coworkers or your boss for something more important. Don't squander it.""

My grandma and my mom knew they needed to get out as soon as possible because they were getting violent and we‚Äôre not comprehending anything so they left with my siblings to my great grandmas for the time being. My brother talked to my uncles friend and his friend said that he dropped by the house to check on him and my uncle had been dealing and doing meth for months and that when he went to see him at the house he was pacing around house. My uncle was saying something like ‚Äúif he goes down everyone in the house is going with him.‚Äù He was also putting evidence in all the rooms and beds. My uncles friend told my mom and grandma about this and they have no idea what to do about it or what the best way is to go about getting my uncle out without them also losing the kids or possibly going to jail. They don‚Äôt have any of their belongings, all of there stuff is in the house and if they call the police they are afraid they will either go to jail, lose their home, and lose my siblings to the state but they know/need to do something about my uncle who completely took over without any warning. What is the best way to get rid of my uncle without my family going to jail and losing my siblings to the state?",04Jul2019,2

419,"Hello! I‚Äôll try to keep this short and sweet. My brother and I are suspicious that my father has taken money that belongs to us from our grandparents will. I don‚Äôt even know if that is possible, but I was hoping I could get some advice on how to definitively find out if it‚Äôs true or not. 

The reasons why we are suspicious are because my grandparents were definitely well off and we had a great relationship with them. They both passed away about 4 years ago, I was 20 years old and my brother was 18. Since then, my father and step-mother have been vacationing all around the world for almost months on end, buying new cars and really living their best lives. 

I hate to sound like an entitled brat, but I find it hard to believe we didn‚Äôt even get a penny... I finally finished my university studies and am living on my own, so money is tight and I feel like it isn‚Äôt fair that what should be mine is either being stolen or held hostage. Obviously, I could just out-right ask my father if he is hiding money from us or not, but I would hate to tamper our relationship because we really have no issues other than this suspicion (that may not be true) or he may just lie and say he isn‚Äôt. I live in the province of Ontario in Canada, if that helps narrow down the laws involved. I tried to use google to find some information on the matter but to no avail, so I‚Äôm hoping some of you may have been in this situation as well and could offer some advice going forward. Thanks a lot!",04Jul2019,2
420,"So, me and some friends have a soccer group where we play casually with each other once or twice a week. This group has been around for 5 years or so. It's mostly a few core members then we bring in some friends to play matches at a local field. About 2 years back a guy joined and started playing with us regularly. He kind of played recklessly in the beginning but no one got that hurt. But now he has started to play a lot more seriously and recently 1 member of the group got injured for a month because of him. He has injured someone once almost every week. Most of these are minor but 4 were injuries that put someone out for atleast 2 weeks. 

I don't really have a problem with him playing seriously and to win, some others do it too. But he plays really dangerously and recklessly. He often charges forward without being able to stop and running into people as a consequence. A lot of players there will let him just go past them because they would rather not get injured than try and get the ball. We tried talking to him about it but he just brushes us off. Recently he injured a 15-year-old playing with us (we are all in our 20s-30s). I told him to take it easy with the young guy but he just said that he would play the same even if he was young.

I don't like excluding people from the game but I would rather he not play with us anymore. The problem is that one of the core members is a close friend to him and won't be okay with us kicking him out. So, if we kick him out we risk splitting the group we have. I wanna keep playing with the group but I don't want to risk injury all the time. Some guys are starting to talk about making a new group without him and his friends. I just don't know what to do, I want to keep the group together but also don't want to play with him anymore. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about it?",04Jul2019,2

425,"Okay, this is an extremely high school post. Probably the most ridiculous thing ever written, but I would like y‚Äôall to take this semi seriously. 

*TL;DR - Ex Best Friend blatantly lied about something that got me into legal trouble. Considering sending in an anonymous tip about her vaping in the school bathroom, which would get her heavily grounded and sent to an alternative school for 30 days.*

Not giving out any detailed information about what she did, but she completely lied about something that caused me to get into genuine legal trouble. Luckily, I am still a minor and can get this sealed, and will not have it on my permanent record. It also was a slap on the wrist, no jail time involved, but still rocked my world for a while. 

Basically, I don‚Äôt go to this high school anymore, and am not in contact with her, so she would have no reason to believe it was me. My school has an anonymous tip line, and I want to send a tip in about her vaping in the bathroom after school is back in session. 

She was caught with a substance last year, as well as caught twice with vaping, so they would definitely take this seriously. I know that she vapes in the bathroom, and so technically, I‚Äôm just sending in a tip, not lying. 

Our school has a policy - your first two offenses, you get 10 days of in school suspension. Your third offense (this would be hers) you get sent to an alternative school for 30 days. She was sent to this school last year for the substance she was caught with. 

Not only would she be sent to alternative school again, but her parents are incredibly strict. They would definitely ground her like the last time, which was over a month of having no phone, not hanging out with friends, nor doing anything at all. 

She would not get into trouble just by the tip, but they would be looking out for her doing it and they would probably catch her in the act. I don‚Äôt know if this is morally wrong to do, and I am conflicted. This would not result in any legal trouble for her, just a really shitty time. I just want to get revenge, but in a way that won‚Äôt harm her, nor have too serious of consequences. 

This was an entire novel, but I really want someone‚Äôs input on if this is wrong or not. I told my family about the plan, and they think it‚Äôs a reasonable ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù plot, but I just don‚Äôt want to be wrong.",04Jul2019,1

At first, I tried talking to them by knocking on their door asking them to please be a little more quite. The response was always the same, I had the door slammed in my face. I tried talking to the land lord, and he doesn't care at all, as long as the ""windows are closed and they pay their rent"". My issue is that their kids (5-13 years old) are running around until 3 am, stomping so hard that my bedroom is shaking. The TV is turned to max all night, I can hear people yelling/arguing/talking. I think the kids are playing ball indoors and screaming. All of this starts around 10 pm and stops around 3 or 4 am. Every night!   


This has been going on for over a year now, and I can't take it anymore, so I have found a new apartment where I am moving in around September, but I am not going quietly!

I started a new job recently in a field I love, and at a company I really love. All my coworkers are great, culture and compensation are equally amazing. But one person on a team I work with has more than hit on me outside work. 

The intention was to go to Central Park after work with a group of coworkers, and last minute people dropped out so people from our team headed home. It was just the two of us, and he asked if I still wanted to go and reminded me that he still owes me a birthday drink. I went because, being friends with coworkers isn‚Äôt something I mind and I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to be home. While at the park we‚Äôre talking and he leans in to kiss me. I turned him down non confrontationally, with reasons why this wouldn‚Äôt work or be appropriate, but he had an excuse for a lot of it. 

Days after, our team (3 guys and me) meets up and I was talking to another member about 4th of July plans and invited him as a joke (he‚Äôs not old enough to attend the event, we both knew that), but because the invite was public, Other Coworker invited himself.

My sister ran to live with her father, after seeing how cheated on my mother and she herself told us that he abused her back when we were in Nigeria.

Ik is very hard to deal with, but almost everyday all she mostly talks about is how my dad wasted 20+ yrs of her life(which he did btw, he is not a good man), and more recently: how my sister is ungrateful for her sacrifices. I woke up at 7AM to hear her, loudly otp telling her friend about my sister's behaviour(smoking weed, cutting class, fighting, repeating a grade etc), it's literally SEVEN IN THE MORNING.

It's   a long story but I'll try not to make this too long, and if this  should  go on another subreddit please let me know and i'll remove it.

&amp;#x200B;

My   aunt runs a cult, mom has been a member for 10 years, i survived the   cult and was able to get out via my dad suing for custody. Due to her   life in this cult me and my siblings don't have a good relationship with   her, one of my siblings doesn't speak to her at all and i get  extremely  uncomfortable each time i see her because i know something is  wrong.

We  tried to back off and let  her live her life even though it's been  painful, especially for me  because i was manipulated by my aunt and some  other people in the cult  while i still lived with my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

We   feel like can't ignore this anymore because some survivors of the cult   that used to be in the inner circle are now exposing my aunt and the   cult, she's been sued several times but nothing has happened until now.   These people have gone to the media and now an investigation has been   done and a serious lawsuit is being conducted. I worry because now that   she's been exposed i don't know how my aunt will acr and my mom not  only  is a part of the cult, she lives with my aunt and is basically her   servant and roommate.

&amp;#x200B;

I   spoke to her a few days ago and tried telling her that we just want  her  back, we want to rebuild our relationship with her but we find it  very  difficult to do so while she's in this cult, told her we'd help  her  rebuild her life if she'd just got out but it seemed pointless even  tho  she did break at some points of the conversation and said some  things  that worried her about getting out.

&amp;#x200B;

Cults   are very common here, the law in my country is different from the US,   and all of this means that its extremely possible that my aunt will go   to jail if things continue the way they are. My extended family  suspects  she's either hiding out in her house or she's already fled the  city  beause no one has seen her in days and another family member  that's in  the cult refuses to say where she is because she doesn't  trust anyone  anymore. It's literally that bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I   worry my mom might sacrifice herself for my aunt if it comes to that,   especially because (maybe it was a mistake) by the end i asked her that   no matter what happened she should worry about herself and protect   herself only, and she told me ""i can't leave your aunt alone, she's my   boss and my sister (yes, in that order) and if she needs me i will do   what is necessary"". I'm really scared for her, I don't know what to do.   Also, by the time i went home she'd twisted my words and sent me a text   saying i'd told her that i was only going to love her if she got out  and  that that was conditional and she wouldn't be manipulated.

&amp;#x200B;

She   has no money because LIKE IN EVERY CULT she gets paid dust even though   she lives with the cult leader and is her sister. I already told her   that she will have my support and my sibling's if she gets out but i   don't know what words to use to convince her, she's really deep into   this because she has a lot of crushed dreams and the cult and the people   in it helped her not to feel alone while the divorce was happening.   She's loyal to my aunt to scary level.

&amp;#x200B;

I   fear that it might be too late but if it isn't, what kind of language   can i use to help her to at least doubt what is happening? Or what   things should i avoid saying?

Thanks.",04Jul2019,1
450,"In a case, if you are interested in the context:
I‚Äôm not sure whether I should ask about it here or maybe there are already posts concerning this issue. Nevertheless, this is my story. I(22yo) started dating a girl(18) a year ago. And a couple days ago we broke up(it was her decision). I know breaking up is always tough, but this time I genuinely feel that she is special in some way(yeah, I know how naive it may sound). This time I not just feel depressed or regret about stuff. Aside from my emotional state I actually consider her a great person, which is very rare(at least, by my standards). I know that she had actual feelings and loved me, but I fucked up a great amount of times(unintentionally). So one of the main reasons is that she doesn‚Äôt believe I am able to change. She also struggled with the fact that I wasn‚Äôt sure about my feelings. I feel like I only realized how much I want to be with her in the last month, where when we didn‚Äôt contact(she suggested to spend all our time preparing for exams. I was such a fool to agree with that. She even was bothered if I will lose my interest in her over this time. But actually it turned out to be the opposite). Now we are preparing to move to another city to enter the university.(well, not together). And I‚Äôm afraid that I can lost her forever. 
So I decided to check what people say in the internet(out of curiosity) and all of them write that a man should never return to his exgirlfrend, under any circumstances. What bothers me is that most of those comments were written in such a manner like a man has to treat girls like shit otherwise he is weak(in the English-speaking section they weren‚Äôt so harsh)
Well, what do you think? Are there circumstances when it would be a right choice to try to do that?In my case or in general.

454," We're very similar and tight friends so we tend to get a little too deep when we're both on drugs and start conversations neither one of us really want to finish (Neither of us have even told our moms about this). Well we got through our secrets and I honestly have no regret as we related on alot and I think we both grew.

 But now that we both know we're bi to some degree there's this extra sexual layer to everything and it started immediately. Neither of us find men sexually attractive but we've both explored. I had a friend in gradeschool-middleschool that I did some stuff with but our friendship turned into a game to get eachother off without being the one to ask and eventually fizzled out as we got older. I don't want that to happen again as I greatly value my current friendship (but at the same time I wouldn't mind the occasional bj but I know once we start there's no stopping cause it's just another easy drug). I feel my current friend doesn't understand that as I explained it to him cause I was a nervous wreck throughout the whole conversation. He kept throwing hints like 'I know how we can pass some time or take our minds of this crash' (we did coke) and I just don't know how to say that its not him at all, but me. I feel as though what I did in school is the only reason I consider myself bi today and that the whole experience tainted heterosexual sex for me because guys are so much easier to talk to and while women are wildly sexually attractive to me, they aren't even remotely socially/emotionally compatable atleast in my limited experience. So I suck with girls, guys are easy but I don't want to 'settle' or usher myself down a road I'm unsure of. No offense to anyone, that's just me. 

 I've never been with a woman and I don't want to be with another man until Ive tried both because I don't think I'm gay but desperate times call for desperate measures I guess. Measures I more or less told him I'd be willing to take and quickly hypocritized in response to his move. I can say the time wasn't right cause it wasn't but... I guess what I'm asking is how do I tell this to him in a way that doesn't seem like I'm shooting him down or back stepping on what I said entirely because I don't mean to do that. I just feel like I said too much and as a generally agreeable and naturally helpful person, I didn't want to let him down but I feel like that comes off a bad mixed signal, telling him what he wants to hear and/or just lies. I was honest about what I did and I think that qualifies as bi but I feel like if I get a good girlfriend I'd be straight as an arrow. So maybe it was a lie... Idk honestly. God that sounds awful. 

 I've never even had a close friendship with a girl so it just seems like wishful thinking to me to believe I'm not bi. Nevertheless I feel really stuck and any advice would be more than helpful. I feel like I left him hanging (pun intended) and like I've just sparked the beginning of the end of the best friendship I've ever had no matter which way I choose to go about this. If I do anything with him I fear history will repeat itself and if I don't do anything I feel like it will just slowly descend into a game of subtle cat and mouse until we stop talking cause I put my cards on the table... but under a piece of bulletproof glass to be metaphoric. 

 End thoughts: I now fully understand what courage means in the realm of sexuality and what lesser accepted sexualities/genders have to go through when coming out to a friend/family member. Before it just seemed like attention seeking but I get it now. I feel like I poured my heart and soul out only murky the water cause I'm still unsure about all of this but holy shit did it take balls of tungsten carbide for me to open up about it and I'm pretty proud of that. But at what cost if I can't find a way forward?

 Sorry this is so long winded, this is still very much uncharted territory for me.",04Jul2019,1

He was the main provider and knows rent was due on the first however refuses to pay anything in a recently started child support case that wont begin until August because he does not want his money to be taken twice in a way. So although I have explained it over and over twice to not begin so soon he refuses to pay anything practically accusing ME of being distrustful and he doesnt trust anybody per his words to say I wont be getting paid 'extra' and not give him credit for it. I feel like an idiot practically begging him to pay half so I can make the rent payment (995 + late fees). He refuses and when asked what does he think I can tell the rental company ""you left"" he responds "" yea I got my own bills to pay"" I guess stating he has acquired his own apartment ( it's been 4 weeks since he left). For someone who says he resents and feels inferior to me for being ""smarter than him"" he treats me like trash and seems to enjoy a power trip in being needed. Given he did this before and we had nowhere to go and he continued to stay gone to be with the other woman, I know he is capable of watching us have to find somewhere to live and maybe this time because he had his own place, if true hes a liar, he will think he can take our child with him, that he barely sees consistently.

460,"I'll try to keep this complicated situation relatively short. I (lesbian 19F) had been with a my girlfriend for 3 years. She always claimed to be a lesbian. We broke up on good terms but drifted apart for 3 months. Within the past few days, we got back together. But over the break up she had a FWB thing going on with a guy that she said was just for companionship as she was lonely. Now she says she's bisexual. And she's also worried she's pregnant. And she refuses to cut the guy out of her life, she wants to keep him as a close friend. But stuff happens between them that makes me uncomfortable. For example, the other night he came up behind her and put his hands on her belly because they're going to planned parenthood tomorrow to find out if she's pregnant.

469,"So basically, we‚Äôre on summer break right now and I‚Äôm just trying to figure this situation out before I have to see him again. My interest in wether or not this is grooming has been piqued since I told my best friend about the situation the other day and she basically said, ‚ÄúTell your parents or I will.‚Äù I just wanna know if she‚Äôs overreacting or not. 

My teacher and I didn‚Äôt become close until maybe two months until the school year ended, before this point I thought he was a bit odd since he had certain female students that hung around him a bit too often, had small framed photos of some previous students on his desk (all female), and just generally was the topic of a lot of rumors. I‚Äôll admit that our getting closer was prompted by me complaining about the people in my discussion group (English class) to him, and he subsequently gave me a sticky note calling me smarter than the others and telling me that he was apologetic for having put me with them. I wanted to keep the note and he begrudgingly let me (I thought it was weird that he wanted it back after I had read it) and wrote one back and gave it to him calling him a softie and telling him that I wanted to get closer before I left his class. 

This led to more notes being passed between us, the more notable being one in which he told me he missed having me by his desk (you make the seating chart dude, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.) I remember that in my response note, I said I knew he missed me because he would stand by my desk and talk to me for a long time despite having seated me so far away. I called him cute for it, kind of pushing my boundary a bit, but he didn‚Äôt make any comment on it. 

He started giving me nicknames, which was flattering, and I‚Äôm a teenage girl so I won‚Äôt lie that I liked the validation, but he started calling me them instead of my real name in front of other students which led to a lot of weird looks at me. But we only got closer, I‚Äôd put my sports bag under his desk so I had reason to see him after class, I‚Äôd stop by during lunch, linger as long as I could after our period, and it was good for a while.

Then some drama started up in my life regarding my ex boyfriend. I was acting weird in class and he dropped a note on my desk, ‚ÄúAre you okay? Stupid question I know, but I‚Äôm worried.‚Äù Which resulted in me going to his class to talk about it for an hour every day after school, sometimes longer, for weeks. The first few days it was all about the drama, getting advice, confiding in him and all that. Sometimes he‚Äôd say things I thought were a little odd like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you talked to me, I work out better when I‚Äôm angry and I was fuming thinking about it‚Äù or he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúFuck you for what you did‚Äù in reference to my ex and it made me happy. 

He told me that our student/teacher relationship was one thing, but that we were genuine friends beyond that. It was at that point that I opened up about my ‚ÄòDaddy Issues‚Äô, and he took the opportunity to tell me that I was like a daughter to him. That took me off the defense a bit, I was more open to playful contact after that. He would flick my ear if I said something that he disagreed with, I would swat at his face if he took something of mine and held it above my head so I couldn‚Äôt reach it and we started hugging before parting in the afternoon. 

He let me in about a lot of personal life details, I returned the favor, and I started looking forward to seeing him as a highlight of my day. I picked up reading his favorite book series, and we started bonding over that too. I developed something of a crush on him, and wasn‚Äôt too covert about it but never flat out admitting it. 

As the last week of school closed in, he started getting a bit more bold about the things he said. When I wouldn‚Äôt let him hold my sketchbook he insinuated that it was because I was drawing porn, which was just a ‚Äòwhat the fuck‚Äô kind of moment for me that I brushed off. Then when we were talking about a character from his book series, I made a joke about being in love with that character (that, mind you, he often said he strongly relates to, who‚Äôs name he uses when referencing himself, etc.), and he then took it a more intimate route by telling me I ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be able to handle him‚Äù and when I asked what that meant he said during sex, that it would be too rough for me to handle or whatever. I, pretty shocked, replied with something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure I could‚Äù and he said I must have a lot of faith in my sexual ability, asking if I had anyone that could back up that statement for me. I said no and he was teasing me like ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre making a claim you can‚Äôt back up? You sound like Trump‚Äù and laughed when I got flustered, telling me he knew exactly how to push my buttons. The way he leaned back in his chair and hummed and pretty blatantly looked me up and down after saying all that just added to my incredulousness. 

Later that week, a girl that shared my English period and another period sat me down and told me about rumors that had spawned regarding me and that teacher. She wasn‚Äôt someone I knew that well, but she still felt the need to say that ‚Äòit‚Äôs like he‚Äòs in love with you‚Äô and that ‚Äòeveryone sees the way he treats you.‚Äô And informing me that there had been girls in the past that had been just as close with him, and ‚Äòonly got closer‚Äô when they were legal. She said I was a good looking girl, and that he was a single man with a questionable history, giving me a warning I suppose. 

I decided after that that I wanted to push my luck further, and wrote him a letter admitting my feelings for him. I was completely upfront, pretty much saying that I wasn‚Äôt gonna get over it unless I heard it from him that I needed to. In a way I really wanted to get in trouble for it, which is why I wrote it instead of saying it to his face, so he had some written evidence when he took the issue to the administration. But he didn‚Äôt do that. He took the letter happily, and didn‚Äôt have anything to say about it the next day. Went about as normal, complimented my hair, smiled at me, completely unfazed. 0 reaction or reprimand. He had me sign his yearbook, told me he was looking forward to next year and told me to have a great summer. 

I was pretty shocked by that much, but figured he maybe just didn‚Äôt want to get me in trouble so close to summer. My friend thinks it was because he doesn‚Äôt want me to get over him though, so our views on it differ a bit. She thinks it‚Äôs a big issue, particularly because his class is situated in such a way that I‚Äôll have to see him everyday, and he‚Äôs very involved with my chosen after school clubs, most school functions, etc. 

Does this sound like grooming? Or just me reading too much into a man who doesn‚Äôt understand the teacher/student boundary thing too well?",04Jul2019,0

483,"Hey Reddit,

About two weeks ago I started a new job.

We‚Äôre a SaaS startup. The team exists of 5 people. The CEO (M), me (M) and 3 girls.

I have a really good connection with everyone, but maaaaybe a little bit more with one girl in particular. Just friendship, no worries.

I‚Äôm in a 12-year relationship and I‚Äôm pretty sure she also has a 4-year relarionship (but with a guy from another country, studying here)

Today, she called the CEO and he told us she was going to be late, i started worrying.

She came in pretty late and it was obvious that she had cried.

Throughout the day she was texting all the time and on the way to lunch at a restaurant nearby, she told me that life isn‚Äôt always easy. We were in a car together, just the two of us.

I told her that I wasn‚Äôt going to ask what happened, or that I didnt want to force her to tell me, but I cared a lot and I kinda felt sad for her the whole day.

The day is over now, and every inch of me wants to text her to tell her that if she needs someone, that i‚Äôm right there to talk, or that I hope she‚Äôs okay or something like that..

487,"Guys...i really need advice. I'm so lost and I'm struggling. I'm so stupid and I don't know what to do anymore. I hate myself so much for being like this...

Back when I was in middle school I used to be a bully...I would pick on people...fight alot. I was the worse possible student in school. I got kicked out of the school,and was transferred to another. Then got kicked out again for punching the head prefect. My parents said enough was enough and...sent me to a counselor to try to sort me out.

In high school I changed. I hated the things I did...I hated that I was a bully. I felt like I deserved to be punished. In high school there were like ""gangs""...3 major gangs. These gangs would bully people all the time,including me. I never fight back with these guys...in a way I felt like I deserved it and also had promised my mom to never hurt anyone ever again.

As the months pass, i made new friends. They were really good people,so down to earth. But they often get bullied by these gangs. One day there was fight in the field...one of my friend was getting beaten up by like 5 people. Yet nobody bothered to help him,instead they just stand and watch as if its like a norm.

I was tired of watching them get beaten up...these gangs had their ring leaders. So I told my friend that if we're going to stop getting bullied...we'd have no choice but to break these gang leaders physically and emotionally.

We would strategize when we would attack these guys...when would they be alone. And only then we strike. We would beat these leaders up until they cried and were on their knees. We did it so that we would stop being bullied. But what we were doing was in fact bullying...what I thought them was in fact bullying...and most importantly I broke my promise to my mom.

Word got around pretty quick that we beat up the school bullies...but the thing is they have labelled us the new school bullies. I hate that...i try to stop the bullying, i try to stop being a bully but it seems I just can't help it...everywhere I go people are afraid to talk to me...it was as if the same I had experienced in middle school.

498,"I've actually tried this post on several subreddits, so I'm hoping this is finally the right place. Sorry for the mobile formatting.

While my boyfriend and I were broken up, he began a relationship with another woman. This woman has two children already and is legally married, but not with her spouse. We ended up getting back together after about 3 weeks and he ended things with the other woman. However, the woman now claims to possibly be pregnant with his child. 

To clarify, the reason for the uncertainty is because both he and the other woman would want a relationship structure where I cannot have any contact with the other woman. I don't really see how that's conducive to a healthy relationship for anyone, including the child, when all three of us would theoretically be a part of the child's life. 

My boyfriend is also the kind of guy who feels no one has a say in the child's life except him and possibly the mother. As in, not even his own mother has a say. So, if I can't talk to the other woman about how she feels, and i have no say in the child's life, even though I would be in it, how would I know how to interact with the child? If the mother doesn't want to have anything to do with me, how can I feel justified in being around her child? How can I knowledge boundaries if I can't talk to both parents? 

 I love this man more than I've ever loved anyone else, but there are so many questions and so many issues I have with the possibility of that arrangement and I don't even feel like I can address them.

503,"I'm trying to be a better person, I've decided to live honestly (without being too honest that it becomes unkind, because society would crumble if everybody was completely honest all the time), and I've decided to try and reduce conflict and drama by accepting opinions without trying to argue. The issue is I'm somebody who struggles with anger. I get heated up inside when somebody tries to push my buttons and I automatically blurt out in anger. I've had people all my life who have tried to knock me down but i've always gotten back up. I got rid of toxic friends and adopted a more positive attitude in life, and so far it's working wonders.

The problem is when you live with the people causing you problems. I used to argue with my parents a lot but that's gotten better lately, but now it's my Sister. She seems to think the world owes her something and she's always the victim. It's gotten so beyond ridiculous now. As a kid I'd get annoyed and always wind her up, but as I have grown I've been nothing but supportive and loving. Even when I find the moaning about her work or 'lack of friends' annoying because I personally am really struggling to survive without work and money and I also don't have many friends, yet I keep myself to myself and try not to burden everybody else with my worries. She is the opposite. 

I need advice on dealing with conflict in a way where I defuse the situation rather than ignite it. There was recently an argument over the fact I had a glass of the drink she bought. I was thirsty and all other drinks had been in the fridge for a long time now, and I decided to have some and reimburse her. I immediately let her know and said I would go and buy her some more, but she was annoyed about something so decided she wanted to argue with me. So she went on about how apparently I am somebody who takes everything that doesn't belong to me. (Ironically she has my desk, shelves and bedside cabinet in her room). We are a family who all live together and share many things so when something is in the bathroom for everybody to see and use, I use it. If somebody specifically tells me not to use an item, I'll always oblige. It's obvious there was just an opening for her to rant about something I've done (or haven't done) so she can achieve her goal of an argument. When she's in a bad mood she'll do this often, and it usually causes my Mother or I to become upset. She used to do it to my Dad too whenever he tried to help and this used to really get me angry. 

How do I let it go? I don't want to argue, it's boring and negative and absolutely unnecessary. I'm so done with trivial and meaningless things. It's not worth getting angry over. There's too much hate in this world without having silly little things like this play a part. Anybody got any tips? I'm trying to better myself every day. And one day I hope to get myself on my feet and leave this place and be myself and live care-free.",04Jul2019,2

505,"Background facts:
My name is Michael. I am 17 years old and live in a small country in Europe. Currently I visit an well-known kinda expensive (far-away and supplies) IT-School and will finish 2021. After that I will have to be drafted(every boy has to visit the military here). Obviously I live with my wealthy parents and brother, they allow and fund me to visit my school.

Background:
My Parents were both raised in terrible households and never learnt parenting. My father ignores my whole life situation and does everything my moms says.  They both fought with everyone in my family and I never met my cousin and aunts/uncles beside two, since they hate my parents and won‚Äôt allow any contact with us.

One of my Problems is the following:
My mother sees me as her puppet (She didn‚Äôt allow me to wear what I want to wear till I was 16) and she tells everyone that every single achievement I got in life is thanks to her:
Passed my drivers license? - She helped me study (She didn‚Äôt, she did not even practice driving with me, my dad did)
I am one of the best Programmers in my school? - My mom always helped me focus studying for it (I nearly failed this schoolyear because I couldn‚Äôt study after daily abuse from them, I had some final tests wich lead me to passing my class wich I had after they went on holiday for 3 weeks without telling me)
She also wants to control what friends I have and uses me as an example of her well done parenting(She never mentions my brother)

Another Problem is the lack of understanding at home. I tried talking with my parents about my depression when I was around 15 years old - At first they didn‚Äôt let me visit a therapist at first, because it would ruin ‚Äúthe family image‚Äù(They talk alot about that). But after getting worse I went to the doctor myself with some savings of a summer job and got diagnosed with BPD. BPD, Borderline Personality Disorder, basically means I am very unstable, I only see the black and white parts in life, not the gray ones.  Wich means I have good an bad days. On a good day, when I show good mood I get comments like ‚ÄúSee? You never needed to visit the doctor. You are fine now and wasted some money, are you proud of that?‚Äù~Followed by a big grin or disgusting giggle.
I also came out as bisexual to my family, at first I hoped my brother would be so kind to be nice to me but they all use to be pretty homophobic and make jokes about dying of aids and ruining my life after raping kids(Like every other Gaylien)
About my brother(21) He is lacking the whole part of parenting he got what he wanted and still does - Got gifted a new car and his own house &gt; without a reason.

I tried talking with them about visiting a family helper or therapy wich only leads to the ‚Äúif we need that, you don‚Äôt need any money from us. Be proud of your parents for giving you such an amazing life‚Äù ~ They ain‚Äôt wrong about that part, wich is the problem - I will need the money to finish school and visit my few friends wich life far away.
If I try seeking any help, any money will be taken away from me: I wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford alot of thinks like: getting to school(3h drive a day) my school, food(I often need to buy myself food because I get home at around 7pm wich I then need to buy myself). 
So trying to call youth services would break my chances of a great future, because my school wouldn‚Äôt be funded my an orphanage and other places(So I was told by the youth helping hotline)

Well I did nothing and I am pretty unsure about what I can do.

I'm actually pretty happy but I feel like I'm missing out on a ton of things. 

I'm going to be graduating from college in a year or so. I am starting to do more things in real life and pick up old hobbies, but I think a more strict enviorment that completely cuts me off would be better for me in the long run. 

I'm looking for something like a rehab type setting where I can't use technology. It would also be beneficial  if this was like a group activity with other people.

We are having issues keeping the apt cool. It will not cool below 78-80 degrees. Its only June and hasn‚Äôt even been super hot for Texas summers yet,  in the 90s outside. The A/C runs all day!! We have it set on 75-77 and it just won‚Äôt get there. Finally around 9pm at night it will start cooling off. It was 80 at 830 pm the other night. Our energy billl is showing we are spending $10-15 a day!  Our last apt was also top floor, we lived there 5 years and never spent more than $110 in the summer. 

Maintenance has been called multiple times. They come and add more freon, changed the filters. Held a laser temperature reader up to the vents  and it shows it is blowing out cool air. It is just somehow not circulating or cooling. We of course have the blinds shut and even have black out curtains. Asked other top floor neighbors and they have no trouble keeping their apts cool.

What can be done? Ive never had cooling issues before and not sure where to start with management. We cannot be paying $300 a month for energy in an apt that won‚Äôt even get cool.",04Jul2019,1
515,"I(20M) have been hanging out with a girl(20F) for 4 months. Anyway, one night were were drinking and she told me ""I drink too much and want to find fun sober things to do"". However, she said she blacked out the night she told me this. Anyway, she comes from a home where one of her parents was an alcoholic, her brother and his girlfriend who she lives with were heroin addicts, one of her best friends died of an OD, and she said she thinks she has a speech impediment from doing molly with her ex girlfriend too much. I'm scared to bring it up to her because I've seen the way her family gets defensive and I don't want to end anything. Should I ask her about it?",04Jul2019,1
516,"My boyfriend broke up with me the night before the 4th of July. His 22nd birthday is on July 6th. I bought him a present but I still have the receipt. He‚Äôs being so rude and has been being disrespectful towards me and refuses to talk to me because I‚Äôm ‚Äúannoying‚Äù when all I wanted to know were his plan for the 4th of July night, since I‚Äôll be working and I asked him to let me feel secure because I‚Äôve dealt with him being unfaithful before, and he didn‚Äôt wanna talk and told me he didn‚Äôt have plans and proceeded to ignore me, which led to the break up. (We also live together) so anyways, do I return the present or is that petty?",04Jul2019,1
517,"Hi, sorry if this isn't the appropriate sub. I've got some anger issues and barely treated PTSD. I've been off my antidepressants for about a week. I just got a refill yesterday but ever since picking it up, I can't look at the bottle without wanting to just take them all. I'm really tired of this stress and I've been trying to stay optimistic but all I can think about is self destruction now. All I want to do is drink and hurt myself. I want to die and I'm shaking trying to keep myself from doing anything about it. I need help.",04Jul2019,2
518,Ok so I have had this friend of mine for a long time. I'm guessing he forgot about who I was and deleted my tag from the friends list on a whim. Now I can't find him. It's hard because this is his username: https://imgur.com/a/fARbubw It's a bunch of special characters that I can't type out and I don't know his battle tag number. Can anyone help and see what it says in the special characters and how to find him?,04Jul2019,2
519,"We are bit more than friends and she shared quite a lot of intimate things about her with me.

I in the other hand don't have much going on apart from one thing i did in middle school that had pretty big consequences on my whole town and only reason I'm not writing this from jail now is cause i was too young to be taken in amd got of easy with only having to counsel with psychiatrist for some time.

Since then i did everything to distance myself from this and am now living in another country where no one knows about this dark secret.

This girl and i became really close and i feel like she deserves to know this but at the same time i don't want it to surface again.

She knows as much as you now and i don't know what to do.

I don't have much else to add, just tell me what you think abiut all this",04Jul2019,0

521,"I \[F22\] just moved to a new city and signed a lease with 1 roommate \[F24\] who has lived there for 2 years and 1 \[F22\] who is moving in this weekend. The roommate who's lived here for a while is sweet and seems laidback. We are working on furnishing/decorating the house as her previous two roommates took most of the common area furniture, and she's said that she's not super interested in interior design &amp; is happy that I ""have a vision."" I'm pretty into decorating/like doing projects, all that. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few things in the common areas I just...hate. For example, there is a curtain to a storage area that I'd like to replace. I'd pay for whatever I wanted to change, but I also don't want to offend a new roommate who I don't know well. How do I tactfully bring this up?",04Jul2019,1
522,"I feel really depressed and o don't have a clue why. My parents have noticed and are worried about me and my teachers have even pulled me aside and asked if I'm ok. 

Can this happen because nothing bad has happened to me and usually on this subreddit people say there depressed because of a breakup, or being away from home but nothing bads happened to me and I just generally feel really depressed.

I've been feeling  this way for around a month now and it fluctuates. Sometimes I feel ok but then sometimes I want to curl into a ball and cry. Can anyone help and has this ever happened.",04Jul2019,1
523,"My parents are divorced so I switch between houses every week. I live with my dad, my brother, my two step-siblings and my stepmother every other week. As a child, I was neglected and as a result, there's a bunch of basic skills that I have never been taught. I am also incredibly fragile and insecure and I will overthink even the smallest mistakes and cry over something tiny for half an hour.  
 My stepmother is often very strict and judges me whenever I do something wrong. I also feel like my step-siblings are constantly judging me too. Because of this, I stay in my room all day completely isolated, and then I get called lazy for not doing anything. But whenever I actually spend time with them, I say something wrong and I ruin it for everyone else, myself included.  
 I'm spending more and more time at my mum's house and my dad constantly tries to get me to spend time with my stepfamily and it's stressing me out. I've talked to my mum briefly about everything, but it never went anywhere. I can't get myself to tell them because I feel like it would sound mean and ruin my relationship with them even more. I just can't help but feel like they would be much happier without me. What should I do?",04Jul2019,1
524,"for a little background, my sister is 23 and I am 18 now. I also have an older brother for which I've been going to advice for but I need an outsiders perspective so this is where this subreddit comes in. (apologies for phone formatting)
she is a compulsive liar and I have learned over the years to never believe a word that comes out her mouth. lately she has been going downhill again and I feel like she is doing meth again (she has been on all drugs of the spectrum and does illegal things often without being caught). 
the most recent story comes from yesterday when she asked me once again to pass a drug test for her and provide my piss so she can get a job. now my family and I have helped her in so many ways to get different jobs, support her, and show her we care, but no matter what we do she goes back to being mean and getting fired job after job. when I told her I wouldn't help her with the piss test, she texted me how I've never helped her and constantly hate her for no reason. she proceeded to go off on me and text-rant, then blocked my number and on all social media. 
what can I do now? I want to prove to her that her drugs and bad choices on gonna catch up on her. do I contact the police since I know for a fact she lives with her ""boyfriend"" that she has a restraining order on (long story in itself) and she has drugs in her house? or do I just sit back and let karma run its way around? I don't want to kill herself because I know she's in a messed up state but I feel obligated to do something even though she's always done me wrong in the past.

526,"To explain things quickly, I come from a poor and neglectful family. We're distant with our uncles, cousins, etc., and I was raised mostly by my dear gram. Gram died two years ago of lung cancer. While she was alive, we were close. She told me to always rely on myself, especially as a woman. 

I never realized how seriously I took that until I was on my own. My fiancee and I have a great relationship, but to be frank, he's not as worldly. He comes from a pretty well off family. Not Rockefeller rich, but in a league my family could never dream of. He's had his parents to handle everything.

Its important to me to take care of myself and he acts like its an insult to them that I have refused to take their money for school. I'm never mean but I'm direct and he doesn't always pay attention. He has high functioning ASD, if that counts for anything. I just feel like sometimes he doesn't get it and he never will.

I work with school loans and financial aid, as well as accounting. I hate the work and I want to move on. Hating it doesn't preclude me from understanding it. I explained to him that I will take out a loan on top of financial aid so I can quit my job and focus only on school. 

His stupid brother, who knows nothing, says it'll mess with his credit. Actually, it won't, if we file taxes seperately. Then his parents say they'll pay for school if I keep my job. Thanks, but no.

 Its important that I handle my own financial affairs. Its important that I leave a job that is going nowhere, that's boring, and is systematically toxic. 

I simply don't want their help. And instead of respecting that, they don't get it. I had to depend on myself for years. I was taught female independence. I'm not actively trying to insult anyone. They're not even grateful that I'm not a gold digger, wringing them for every dollar they have. I'm feeling disillusioned with him and his relatives. If they try to control things this much, I won't be able to marry him. My boundaries are set and nonnegotiable.",04Jul2019,1

532,"Life is going fine and like ass, I'm soon getting therapy for my traumas I have had in the past and recently. (Growing up with one parent, getting bullied, mum abusing me mentally and ex of my mum abusing me physically).
Fast forward a few 'moments of time' later (as all of that happened in the course of 15 years^^), I was 18 at that time, now 19. I met someone that showed interest to me out of themselves for the first time in my life (kind of like a big deal to me), so did I to her eventually. We met each other through someone we both knew, I knew that that person was an asshole though but that did not stop me from being kind, as I am very often.

Eventually that friend got jealous and used my kindness to shittalk to me herself, of course she deleted those messages, I told the person with an intetest to me and they did not agree with me, we both agreed peacefully on not having contact anymore but her friend got what she wanted, getting rid of anyone that gets close to her friend.

Me being a young male dude, I really felt a lot more lonely after that, not sure with how I could adapt or do anything, I started working out a lot but it only helped a little bit, I did get healthier though and took my initiative to stop eating or using animal based products. Which I still stand with every single second.

But the loneliness is killing me from inside, I used to draw quite a bit, wasting time trying to find distractions from my traumas, not drawing because my workouts get slow because of my need for distractions and just plainly the lack of true love from family and friends really sucks. 

Here is my request for advice:
What would be recommended besides therapy to find some company that can stop this unproductive procrastination? I tried what I could think of.",04Jul2019,1
533,"My cousin passed away a few months ago unexpectedly, and of course the family took time to grieve as he was at the end of the day a good man. He's kin so of course I love him, but that sumbitch died holding ends and some other scores to settle.

I've been spending a lot of time on the family land where we buried him lately. Partially helping out my aunt and his widow, but I also figured this would be the place he would haunt. Problem is he's being a little bitch on the other side too same as he was here and hasn't shown up once.

I'm looking to go haunt his ass myself to settle things man to man, but not sure how to do that. I don't believe in suicide and this ain't worth dying over anyways, but I'd rather not wait until natural death to throwing hands. He died young and God willing I'll be an old man when I go so he's gonna put me the fuck to sleep if I want until then.

I want to settle this like men while we're both still young. What's the best way for a living person to haunt a dead man? Basically looking to do exactly what a spirit would do on our side, but as a live man haunting the other side. Any advice on where to start? 

I dont want to use some ""medium"" cause I'm done with that pussy talking shit. That bastard needs an open palm to the ear. I want his ear hurting when it hears what I've got to say.

534,"so here‚Äôs my situation if I‚Äôm being 100% honest; I feel very lonely &amp; unhappy. 

BACKGROUND: I am a homeschooled senior currently, although I wasn‚Äôt always homeschooled. In fact, I was in public school up until the start of my junior year in high school. however, this year and a little bit of the last year wasn‚Äôt the best of years for me. throughout my entire life I‚Äôve always felt like i haven‚Äôt been able to connect on a certain level with people &amp; I‚Äôve always had a limited amount of friends. in middle school I had three best friends and we‚Äôd always hangout, once high school cane I transferred over to a school that none of my middle school friends went too. I hated my freshman year. It started off well but then there was some drama &amp; I got the bad end of things. throughout that year I started with like five close friends &amp; at the end of the year I lost all but two of them. My sophomore year I transferred to the high school that all of my old middle school friends went too &amp; it was much better then my previous school year. I made three new close friends and still remained in contact with one of my old best friends from middle school. the end of sophomore year came &amp; I cut off one of my friends from sophomore year because she was involved with a super toxic relationship, started smoking, partying, &amp; hanging with gross people. at that point, the end of the year, I only had three close friends. sophomore year ended and I had decided to enroll in a new school, an online home school program, in order to get ahead in school. I wanted to take courses at my local community college in order to better improve my school resume for college. I went into that new school year with the same three friends + one other friend from my previous school because the other one I had drifted apart from. so four friends total. I loved the new program and still do, the academics are great &amp; I‚Äôm my gpa was a 4.0 for my junior year of high school. however, my social life plummeted I felt like. my close best friend from middle school and I slowly drifted apart, only hanging out on rare occasions. my birthday came &amp; she promised me months in advance that she would make it, &amp; she flaked last minute. I cut her off for being a crappy friend to me. the other two friends from my sophomore year I also slowly drifted away from. one of them moved to an entirely different state so I never see her anymore. the other is also homeschooled but unlike me, she puts VERY little effort into our friendship or hanging out in general. hence we aren‚Äôt as close as I‚Äôd like to be. my other friend from my previous high school is kind of rude to me and everyone and I honestly don‚Äôt enjoy hanging out with her very much &amp; besides we have also drifted apart quite a bit. 
THINGS IVE TRIED: I thought getting into community college for two courses in person in a public school setting while in homeschool would help my social situation, it didn‚Äôt at all. no one really talked to each other and everyone was 2-25 years older then me. I got multiple jobs in order to get money and socialize &amp; that didn‚Äôt really help either. everyone, yet again, was older or had there own lives and didn‚Äôt care to be friends. I still work a job but it‚Äôs not very much fun, I only do it for the money. I also have a boyfriend, but that‚Äôs not really something ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried‚Äù, it just happened lol. 
MY POINT: I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I have very little people connections &amp; so few friendships. I have a boyfriend that I‚Äôve been with for a year and a half (ever since the beginning of my sophomore year &amp; now I‚Äôm about to be a senior) but other then him, I am not close with anyone really. I am so stuck. I‚Äôve never had very many friends and now I have like almost none. I feel isolated, abnormal, &amp; super lonely. please help me figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me?!!",04Jul2019,2

537,"My mum recently told me that she is pregnant and my step dad ( my younger sisters biological dad), is the father. My mum and him spilt up when I was about 12 and we moved out. I‚Äôm 18 now but throughout the past 6 years my mum has been in constant contact with him and their relationship has been on and off. My sister (14) still has contact with him but they don‚Äôt have a normal father/daughter relationship. She can‚Äôt act herself around him and gets visibly nervous when talking to him. 

He‚Äôs always been very emotionally abusive and manipulative. He can‚Äôt be in the same room as my mum without insulting her or bringing her down in some kind of way. He‚Äôs always mistreated me and made it obvious my sister was the favourite. One time, he even lifted me upside down and put my head in the toilet to scare me because he thought it was funny. I was crying and when I told my mum she refused to believe me despite the fact that my hair was soaking. He denied it and she believed him over me. I spent my whole childhood feeling like I was just an inconvenience to everyone around me. I can‚Äôt be around him anymore because I literally start shaking whenever he slightly raises his voice. I‚Äôm terrified of him. 

My mum now bringing a baby into this mess will now mean him having to be a part of our life‚Äôs even more. I don‚Äôt think a baby deserves to be brought up into this complicated mess. I can‚Äôt help but almost feel betrayed by my mum. She knows that her even still talking to him despite the way he treats me upsets me so much. She‚Äôs apologised to me so many times in the past but they‚Äôve never been genuine or she would have cut contact with him years ago. When she first told me the news she kept saying ‚Äòoh you‚Äôll soon change your mind once a newborn baby is here‚Äô. I just feel like she‚Äôs being so naive, how does she expect me to feel? She‚Äôs having a baby with the man who abused me for years. When she broke the news to my family, everyone was just mainly shocked and excited. No one seems to care about how I feel. I feel like I sound selfish but why can‚Äôt she ever put me first? Why does she never think about how her actions affect me? I‚Äôve suffered from mental issues as an affect of his abuse. I‚Äôm extremely socially anxious and have been severely depressed since the age of 13. Her being pregnant with this mans baby just makes me feel sick. It‚Äôs turned my life completely upside down.

540,"Recently I graduated from an engineering technology program. I had planned to do a transition into a degree this summer, and had moved my girlfriend and I across the country just to take this opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Well. Today I dropped out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The transition might as well have been in hieroglyphics to me. And with the pace it moved, there just was not the time for me to figure it out. I tried, I really did, but I am not able to shovel information into myself that fast (year long course condensed into 4 weeks) and still somehow comprehend it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was spared by the dean and allowed to drop out with no penalty so that I could come back at any time I wanted, even offering to come back for a slower paced normal stream in September, though it would take likely 3.5 years instead of 2.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not sure what to do with myself or what to do now. We are stuck here for a year due to our lease, and job outlook for just my technology degree is not so great, though I will be actively looking. On top of all that I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself, I can't bring myself to even tell my family or friends. I feel like they will all resent me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt so defeated or low in my entire life. There has never been something that has shut me down this damn hard before, and now I just have no idea where to go from here or what to do. All my life people have always tried to tell me I was smart or good at everything and this really just proves the opposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is being very supportive and she understands, but I worry that deep down she is judging me and resents me for all of this. I know that's not like her, but I can't help but feel that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me wants to just try and go back in September because I just don't want to let go of this dream, but it's just not financially feasible. I don't want to spend another 3-4 years in school to come out at 29 and have 80k+ in debt, and I will likely exceed my maximum student loan amount trying anyways. On top of all that, I don't want to hold my girlfriend back as she has been working to support me while I was in school, and I know she wants to go back and that she hates doing what she does.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the logical thing to do is just find a job with my prior education, as the pay is quite close to what this degree would have netted me, but something in me really doesn't want to let go. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this is just a mess all over the place, but I really don't have anyone to talk to or share my thoughts with. I just try and keep them inside and push them down and right now that really isn't working.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you people do?",04Jul2019,1
541," Sorry for the stupidly long post, but I feel it's necessary...

  
As a 13 year old, I never thought I would end up in the position that I'd have to turn to Reddit for personal advice, especially about something like this. But here I am. Whilst I haven't been through the sheer extremes that other poor individuals on this subreddit have been through, some things have happened to me that have fucked my life and mind seven ways to Sunday. So please, listen to what I have to say.

I was born into an Indian family and am currently living in the UK. However, my mum and dad were and, in a way, still stuck with the mind-state that was common within India. I hate to fit with stereotypes but, I was brought up with the fact that education stands above everything.

When I was around 8 or 9, my parents started to figure out that I was above average within the intelligence department - just like the genius that was my older brother (for an idea as to his intelligence, he was and is still within the Mensa society, which as a minimum entry IQ of around 130 or so.) With the hopes that they could breed that further intelligence that was in my brother within me, they started pushing my education. They started pushing and even bribing me with rewards to push me beyond my years. My life back then was just education, and with it brought heaps of problems. Other kids my age started singling and isolating me out because I wasn't 'normal' (and yes, I know normal is a stupidly subjective term, drop your torches and pitchforks and let me explain.) I had a different, 'unique' sort of humor, coupled with an intelligent mind. I guess the closest term I can think of is that I was eccentric. Even the goddamn fucking teachers started treating me differently due to how I was. The entirety of Primary school (or Middle school, for those confusing Americans) was just lonely - I didn't really have anybody I could lean back on properly for any form of moral support. It was, to be honest... shit.

Cue first year of Secondary school (or High school, for the Americans using the American School System, or as I like to call it, A.S.S) My life went from shit to a fucking shitstorm. I was already walking in as a eccentric, introverted Indian, with low self-esteem, social anxiety, above average intelligence, and to top it off, a beard (and no I am not joking. Puberty slapped me harder than a brick wall.) And well, it was rough. I found it challenging to make true, 'close-ish' friends in the real world, and to top it all off, people started taking advantage of my kind nature and intelligence, because I wasn't really on guard against people back then, when I still had my hopes. People started bullying even me even more for it. Walking out at the end of the first year of Secondary school was a blessing and a curse - people stopped bugging with me for 6 weeks, but I also felt so damn lonely without any real life friends. I was slowly crumbling, and I didn't feel so good.

Year 8 (second year of Secondary school), was when shit started to escalate to a serious point. I started getting spells of low moods that would last for days, moments where I'd begin to lose hope that change would come, and because there was no one who I could really talk to. It was then that I started questioning why I was even existing. However, I guess people were starting to notice that I was feeling shit, because someone reported it and I was told to go and speak with the Head of year and the rather shitty school nurse, who told me that I needed to go see a doctor, who in turn told me to go see a counselor. After the first session, I was sat down by my counselor, who proceeded to tell me that from the symptoms and what I had told him, that I was suffering from depression, with a mild risk of me taking my own life. The rest of the year was 'relatively smooth' (i.e. no major events etc.)

However, this year (year 9) was when shit started to hit the limit. I started getting paranoid around people, because in the past, whenever I had made 'friends' over the last 2 years, a lot of them just abandoned or started saying shit and spreading rumors around my back. All while I was expected to try and keep appeasing people, trying to become the different people different groups wanted and expected me to be. My parents expected me to be the extremely intelligent, almost submissive child who was at their beck and call. My teachers expected me to be the golden student - the role model, the example of their successes. My supposed 'friends' wanted me to be the fun, always smiling friend. It was like I had lost who I really was - I didn't and still don't know who I truly am. However, some people started approaching me and asked me what was happening. I felt no choice but to tell them, and they listened. They kept telling me that they were always going to be by me to support me, even though they couldn't really understand what I was feeling. Yet, everytime I had to go running to them when I felt absolutely shit or wanted some form of affirmation that I was doing alright, I just felt that I was being a burden. All my mental issues started to rise in severity, even though I had people - well I thought I had people. Those who said that they would stick with me started to leave me, and people started telling me to 'get it together' or to 'stop trying to seek attention', or just straight up ignored me. Every time a person says they care about me - a sack of shit with issues who shouldn't have a reason to be liked - the first thing I feel is doubt. ""How long are they gonna really be around?"" ""Do they really care or do they just not want the weight of a dead person on their shoulders?"" There is a girl who is currently trying to assist me, but I feel there's only a matter of time before she grows bored or tired of dealing with me, and just ups and leaves, or I just stop talking to her because my guilt of feeling like a burden overwhelms me.

Finally, to top the entire shit pile off, just as that additional 'Fuck You' from that piece of shit called 'Life', I found out a few weeks ago that my private counselor, after 10 months to a year of sessions, said that he could do nothing else to help me, because I was relapsing back into my original, base state too often due to mental problems and outside issues (i.e. the betrayals, loneliness etc.) So now, I can't even see a fucking General Practitioner for two weeks, but I'm not sure if I can last that long. I've been feeling suicidal for a while, and I'm not sure how long it'll be before I end up overdosing in an alleyway and wasting away, because lets be honest - I mean jackshit to most the people I know. I never really left an impression on people, so no one would really miss me for a while. I'm not a major piece within peoples lives. Just a shadow to be ignored as other people run around me, never noticing me. I could fade away and no one could give a shit. My mind is slowly betraying me, telling me things I don't want to hear about myself, how I'm insignificant, irrelevant. I'm fighting a battle and I'm losing it.

Reddit, I'm truly stuck as to what to do. Please, someone, just someone give me a damn lifeline to hold on to, even if its just for a day, a week, even a damn hour. I don't want to end up dying like this, but I fear I ultimately will.

Someone, help me.

544,"TL;DR: I‚Äôm effectively being demoted after being given feedback for the first time when it‚Äôs too late to change. How do I motivate myself?

#Context

I am in corporate. I left my old great job to take the new job a few months ago. I was graded as level 4 after assessments. My probation period ends in August. 

My boss, who initially gave me great reviews, has been avoiding me the past month or so. Eventually, I went to him to address the issue. 

He told me that he felt that I was not delivering at level 4 and that he didn‚Äôt think I could improve by the time August came round. He wants to lower my grading. 

He compared me to peers who he has trained from scratch. I have been trained differently, which was a known fact, and today is the first time he delivered this news to me and, that too, only after I took the initiative to raise my concerns. 

I‚Äôm upset that I didn‚Äôt get this feedback some time ago. Similarly, I‚Äôm frustrated because I haven‚Äôt been given the tools to integrate. I am the only ‚Äúlateral‚Äù with whom he works. Everyone, including my seniors, have been with him forever. 

I accept that the work I give him isn‚Äôt what he wants. The problem is that I can‚Äôt know what he wants without feedback. I _did_ get feedback today and I have a vague idea of what needs to change. This feedback could‚Äôve been given at least a month ago. 

I‚Äôm also frustrated because I‚Äôd have accepted a lower grading when I came in and I feel like the style of practice should have been accounted for when grading me. I was open about my complete lack of experience in certain areas in the field and experience isn‚Äôt acquired overnight. 

A friend of mine thinks that it‚Äôs because he isn‚Äôt making enough money and can not justify paying me as he does. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs entirely true but work is not exactly abundant (unlike in my old place of employ). Further, a part of me thinks that the higher grading could‚Äôve been to get me across with temptation of a higher salary and then to lower it once I was settled. I know this is unlikely and a bit cynical but I‚Äôm struggling to fathom why I got this feedback so late and only because I initiated the session. There are also other rumors I‚Äôve heard regarding a colleague who‚Äôs motives / agenda in re me have been called into question. Tbh nothing matters except the fact that issues weren‚Äôt addressed on time. 

At this stage, I need the job. I don‚Äôt have anything lined up but I‚Äôm looking. Also, I‚Äôm not unhappy overall. I like my colleagues generally and I like the overall set up. I do wish I was busier but I enjoy the work. 

How do I motivate myself to care coz right now I‚Äôm completely apathetic?",04Jul2019,1

My boss changes the schedule in the middle of the week and texts it to everyone in a group chat. I notice that my friend is taken off the schedule. So, I send her a text to see if everything is alright with her. She has no idea what was going on. So I ask my boss why she changed my schedule. She told me it was because she was firing my friend and that I can't tell anybody. I battled with it all night whether or not I should tell her. Today, she texts me and asks if everything got sorted out with my schedule. In that moment I decided to tell her because I thought it was the right thing to do not to let her go in and get blindsided. Now, she's angry with me that I was going to let her go in and get fired in front of everyone.

But if he truly thought there were consequences, why would he make up a story about his behavior that made him sound good when he was doing it?

&amp;#x200B;

Why did he choose to act so evil? And why did he tell me about his fantasies of being raped, when his actual actions didn't seem to be so out of line? Why would he write them so down when he was actually out of character as a guy if he didn't need to?

&amp;#x200B;

It would be impossible ‚Äî even if he was completely unrepentant ‚Äî to say this is a ""deliberate story"".

Why didn't he stop doing those acts for us if he felt like a monster. It was an extremely difficult issue.

561,"I just walked into my poor mom crying in the bathroom because of my sister, which is why I'm writing this post.

&amp;#x200B;

I (20F) have a sister (17F) who is straight up mean. This sounds abysmally stupid and subjective, but please hear me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Context:

* We're well off. Not 1%ers, but we have the money to live in a small house in a really expensive California suburb.
* She'll be a senior in high school next year. I can attribute some of her meanness to being a teenager.
* I came home from college for the summer about two weeks ago. This is my first time being home in 5 months. I had no contact with my sister during that period. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to go into the things she says or does that make me feel this way. I just have no idea what to do about this. For the past two weeks at home:

* I have tried to defend my parents from her, but that just deteriorates into yelling and her pivoting to attack me. 
* I have tried to ignore her. From inside my room, I can hear her fight with/yell dumbass things at my parents (""I don't want to drive OP's car and I don't want to take public transportation; I want to take mom's car!""). 
* I have (unfortunately) taken the low road and ended up insulting her back. This probably makes the situation worse.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have no control over her. She has rich friends who'll pick her up when she wants to leave the house. Her friends also bought her AirPods, so she constantly wears them around the house (even during meals). I literally can't make this stuff up. 

&amp;#x200B;

 She's nice and cuddly to them when she wants my mom to buy her something, but as soon as that happens, she just goes into her room and closes the door/does not interact. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked why they haven't started taking things away from her/grounding her/generally exercising some degree of parental control. They said that I was a dick back then as well (paraphrased), and that I turned out okay. I think this is the wrong approach, but I guess it's not my place to parent my sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

M(44) here.  I'm dealing with something very difficult at the moment.  I found out from the vet yesterday that my dog is dying.  He had been lethargic lately and I was worried about him.  I thought maybe he was getting old and fat and lazy, and I wanted to find out what I could do to help him.  It turns out he has a tumor bigger than my head in his abdomen.  It's pushing on his lungs and heart and intestines, and that's why he's lethargic.  He can't take a proper deep breath, but other than that doesn't seem to be in any pain from it.  They said he might have a month to live, but they're not really sure.  If he shows that he is in real pain, then he'll need to be euthanized.  I can't let him suffer.  He had a clean bill of health from the vet 6 months ago, and I thought I might have 5 more years with him.   My kids get back on Sunday and I want them to get their chance to say goodbye to Smokey.  The thought of breaking this to them and having to wait to do it is horrifying.   This has obviously just crushed me, and I don't have many people I can turn to these days.  Due to moves, divorce, etc I don't really have anyone close to vent to.  There are old friends that I talk to on facebook, but that's not an option right now.   My daughters are on vacation in Florida with my ex-wife, and I don't want to break the news to them and ruin their vacation.  Because of this, I can't post anything on facebook about it.  So, I'm just kind of toughing it out alone right now.  This has also kind of broken the bottleneck on the pent up and suppressed grief from my fathers passing a year and a half ago.  I had never really broken down and had the crying and grief you would expect from losing a parent.  Well, I certainly am feeling it today.  I went to his memorial and bawled my eyes out there in a way that I never did even at his funeral.  This all has my anxiety at peak.  I can't really sit still and feel like this is just agonizing.  This is partly why I'm writing this.  I feel like I need the catharsis of getting it out.  I don't know if there is any real answer to help with this other than ""time heals all wounds"".  However, I am hoping that people who have dealt with this kind of thing can shed some light, or at the very least let me know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  I'm also hoping that maybe someone who helps others professionally might have beneficial advice.   I really appreciate any help and guidance you can give.",04Jul2019,1

567,"As the title says, I'm 24 years old. I farm and ranch for a living. I've helped my dad since I was about 12-13 years old. When I graduated from college, he allowed me to farm a few fields on a 50/50 split. Where we would share costs and expenses. He did this to get my feet wet. 

A year ago, we found out he's got cancer. He was stage 4 and terminal. That year was rough, and it slowly got better as time went on. At least in my opinion. 

Today, he found out that the cancer is spreading, and things are looking bleak. 

He, and my mother don't see much of a future for me farming due to a few reasons. 

1. Health insurance exclusively BCBS is allegedly outrageous. 

2. My work ethic and attitude. I'm slow, calm and patient when doing things because I know how easy it is to mess things up.

2.5 Attitude: my dad was tough on me growing up, and you would think he'd mellow out finding out the news he's got cancer. But he hasn't. If anything it's been worse. He and I snap at each other once and a while. And, for example just today. He wanted me shovel some dirt, so I did it. And I can hear over the idle of the tractor. ""No! How can you be so f*ckin stupid.""

I called him out on it. Asked what the issue was. He wanted me to take dirt from aways away to ""save yourself some work"" rather than what was closest. 

3. Hobbies. I usually get started working anywhere between 8-10 am in the morning. I usually will quit about 7-9 at night. Mostly 8 at night.  

This doesnt leave much opportunity for anything else, and me being young, I enjoy playing computer games. So I'll play a match or two of a video game, watch YouTube, etc, etc. 

I recently got into woodworking as well. And, much to my dad's pissiness he does not approve of it. Because I'm not focused on the farming and ranching. He has tried giving me an ultimatum between my hobbies and farming and ranching. 

I guess I'd just like advice regarding him. He is going through a lot. A lot more than I'm sure most people realize. But the fact that I was told the following things over the years:

""Do as your told""
""Listen to your parents""
""Think for yourself""
""Don't do anything without my (dad's) permission"" regarding the farm. 

""What would you do if your mother or I were dead and gone? Hm? What would you do?""

And finally. 

""There's only so much your mother and I, as well as your banker are willing to put up with!""

This was regarding to woodworking, which I do towards the end of the day before coming in to go to bed. I'm not on my computer which is such a huge issue for him. I did have to take care of something for an hour and a half a few days ago to try and clean up a mess of wood sitting on a bench. So he wouldn't flip his shit, and he still did about something. 

(I screwed wood underneath and laid boards down to set wood on top of underneath a work bench I built)

There are family pets here. I care about them deeply. I would always feel like a failure if I were to abandon them. 

I've done this job enough to try to find my own groove of things. Not work, work, work, work. But Work... Work... Work... Maybe go do something fun. And back to work the next day. 

I used to want to leave and go back to college a few years ago. Pursue my 4 year degree. (I have an associates. I wish I would have gone for something else). 

However, when a time came where my father and I had a disagreement about something. He asked me if I wanted to quit farming and the rule is in his house you have to write a letter detailing that you are leaving. And they are not kicking you out. 

I was writing the letter, and while doing so, he took my picture with his phone more or less because I had a video game t shirt on I was big into. 

""Well, because I thought the opportunity fit"" or something like that. 

At that point in time, I was playing videogames pretty heavy as a coping mechanism. 

I guess it's best to end on that note. It just feels like I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't. 

I don't smoke or do drugs. I very rarely drink. I don't go out as often as I probably could. I enjoy a few different hobbies for what time will allow that won't offset my work everyday. 

I make mistakes, and things go wrong just like with every other person. Some caused from outside forces. Others caused by my own foolishness. 

But it just feels like it'll never be good enough.

568,"I (23f) have a wonderful relationship with my (33m) partner who has a 6 y/o son from a previous relationship. My PTSD following the death of my little sister and a traumatic abortion experience has resulted in me not being very engaged with his son, who is a lovely boy just fyi. I find myself lacking the energy to have conversations and prolonged interactions with the 6 y/o and somewhat resenting the fact that my boyfriend has a child and I don‚Äôt as a result of my decision, which is completely irrational. 

This lack of a relationship with his son is inevitably hurting my partner and he wants me to either make an effort (even if I have to fake being happy) or leave.

So my friend (C) has been using this one block of toilets in our school to have sex in because during lesson times they‚Äôre usually empty. She‚Äôs had sex in there multiple times (with 3 different people that I know of) and takes people there to make out etc. 
Most recently she was telling me about how she took a mutual friend in there (F), and how they had to quickly run into a cubicle and close the door because some kid from one of the younger year groups walked in. 
At first it was a funny joke sort of thing, but now it‚Äôs a regular occurrence (she‚Äôs been doing it for months) and is kinda gross, I mean they barely avoided getting caught and shouldn‚Äôt really have sex in school anyway. Plus it‚Äôs not really very sanitary, both for them and for people who are unknowingly using toilets that‚Äôve been fucked all over.

What triggered this is that I was out with friends with my ringtone off so I didn‚Äôt see her messages. From trying my best to comfort her today she told me that she was worried about me and then started to overthink. 

I was as caring and comforting as I could be and I told her we will get through this together but I am devastated for her.

Her mom will murder her if she finds out and her mom is conservative so I don‚Äôt know how she would react. I also think she may need stitches as it is an open cut and I had to force myself to not react when I saw it.

I‚Äôm also considering whether we should try and get a professional involved in the form of a psychologist or similar. 

I am so overwhelmed with decisions as I‚Äôm scared that if we go to a doctor for stitches, they will notify her mom and admit her into a program of some kind and this adds a problem with costs. I could otherwise tell her mom first and then see what happens there but my gf is saying that she doesn‚Äôt want to make a huge deal of this. 

In my eyes this is very serious and we need to do something but I honestly don‚Äôt know where to start. This is a huge and urgent deal for me but i don‚Äôt want to take steps against her will. I was with her for most of the day and she has said that she wants to take steps to fix this and I want to help but I don‚Äôt know what the right
Thing to do is.

Some background is that about two years ago she was on medication that had the side effect of depression and she used to cut but stopped soon after going off the meds.

581,"   I was asked to do the editing and illustrations for a children's book by my family's close friend, except he hasn't given me any instructions on what to do. The book is apparently for an organization called BackSack and the books are supposed to be distributed in schools in Africa- and they need the finished work fairly soon. (He won't give me a definite due date but keeps stressing on how he needs the illustrations and finished copy as soon as possible.) I've been mostly working on the editing which is strange itself since I'm a teenager and have no experience or training in the subject, but I can tell there are some parts of the manuscript that need major editing. (A lot of sentences aren't grammatically correct, excessive description where there doesn't have to be, chunks of text that don't have to be there, etc.) The problem with editing is that the guy is trying to -surprise- his wife (who wrote the book) by getting it published so it's hard to hand back the manuscript with notes on what needs to be changed. As for the illustrations, I looked up how to do them for a children's book and apparently there's a long process with paneling and a lot of communication with the publisher, author, editor, etc. The only instructions I've been given on the illustrations is to do what I think is best and I'm honestly having a hard time figuring out what I need to do. To make matters worse, my mom is hounding me to get this all done and keeps accusing me of not being focused. I'm honestly trying to get it done but I have no idea what I'm doing, and drawings take a lot longer than a lot of people think.

582,"I'll try to keep this brief. I have a friend, Hannah, who is going on vacation in the near future. She has cats and dogs, and she asked if I would pet-sit for her while she's gone. She knows that I love animals. I like them more than people and would almost always rather be around them than other humans. I jumped at the chance because at first glance, the idea of spending time with some animals in an empty house and getting paid for it sounded great. But lately I've been wondering if she's taking advantage of me.

Context: My friend and I are both in our 20s. I do not have very good social skills and therefore not many friends. I don't hang out with people outside of work/school often, and I think that Hannah knows this. While I've never talked to her about it and she's never asked me, we have hung out enough and gotten close enough that I think she could put the pieces together if she hasn't already. Hannah claims to not have many friends either, and even told me that is the reason she likes hanging out with me; because she doesn't have many friends ""in our town.""

Anyway, I haven't heard much from Hannah since I agreed to pet-sit. She also has been taking a long time to answer me when I text her. She did give me detailed instructions on how to care for her pets (some of them require medicine regularly), and I have spent time around her pets already; they seem pretty comfortable around me.

The thing that made me want to post this is this: Hannah and I have plans to go to a show tonight with our families. Yesterday, she asked if I wanted to get dinner or something before the show, and I said dinner sounded good. Today, I texted her and asked if she had ideas. After an hour plus, I get a reply that says I could go over there to eat with them. But then another text comes in and she asks if I can bring a certain kind of soap with me and help her bathe one of her pets before we eat. That seemed unusual to me, because to me bathing a pet sounds like a difficult, unpleasant thing that I wouldn't want to invite someone to do. It crossed my mind that maybe she invited me over just so I would bring them soap and take on some of the workload of the bath itself. As it turns out, plans changed and we are just going to meet at the show without anything beforehand.

I posted about this problem earlier, but it is now out of control. 
My sister is in an abusive relationship. She is 23 and he is 34. She lives with him 1700 km away from our parents and is now in her third trimester. 
It feels like she switches between him being the love of her life and she wants to leave him every other day. Its ALWAYS a crisis situation and she needs to sleep at me and my s/o‚Äôs place, or she‚Äôs buying tickets to move home. She‚Äôs now too far along to fly home but my dad has offered to come get her by car. They have broken up 3 times the last month and I feel like if our dad drives down there he will waste his time because her boyfriend ¬´will never speak to her or their child ever again of she leaves¬ª.
I have seen their text messages and its absolutely revolting. He calls her insane and crazy and slut shames her for her past and calls her a whore and a bitch. She has always been angry but she has now started throwing things when they argue. 
Some months ago she was admitted to a mental institution bc of suicide danger. This was due to their constant arguing. And I mean constant. 

What I am asking you guys about; is how do I convince my sister that she is being mentally abused and tell her to let our dad come get her, and if her bf wont talk to her again - thats great cus he‚Äôs awful??????,

I will have days where I am excited to learn and then days where I feel like absolute shit. 

I keep comparing my self to famous people and their accomplishments when they were teens, people like Einstein, Steve jobs etc, and I feel like I just wasting my time away. I know it doesn't help to compare your self, but I can't stop my self. 

I feel like everyday I am putting off doing something because I'm scared I might fail. I'm looking for a day where something happens and I get my drive back, but in reality I know thats not how life is gonna play out. 

I want to do something with my life, I want to make a change, I want to impact the world and I want people to look up to me(bit narcissist I know). But I don't think I will ever get to do that. My willpower is weak, and change makes me uncomfortable, I don't understand how people change their lives so easily. How they find that boost of motivation.   
I don't feel depressed I'm not sad, I like talking to people and am quiet social. I'm happy most of the time, but its as soon as I try to make a change(cutting down on internet time) that these thoughts of failure start coming to me.

587,"like the title says it all, my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt hit me, or push me, or really every touch me in a rough way unless warranted, as in we play wrestle/we lightly slap each other when we‚Äôre messing around, etc. we are just messing around and it never ever goes far enough to hurt or to make each other think we‚Äôre doing it out of anger. 

however, the way he talks to me when we‚Äôre arguing is what i‚Äôm asking about. about an hour ago we got into a heated argument because the window in the back of car gets stuck down when there‚Äôs a lot of pressure on it, my dog likes to put the window down and it got stuck today. it‚Äôs about 100 degrees outside and when we‚Äôre both hot we get irritated so that played a part in it. we basically just got irritated and he raised his voice to me while asking me a question but it was more of a accusation (he assumed i was putting the window down because i was blocking it off so our dog couldn‚Äôt push it down anymore) and i yelled the answer to him because i was irritated because i was hot as well as he raised his voice to me and i don‚Äôt like to be talked down to. 
he then told me to shut the fuck up. 
he told me i ruin everything (tonight is date night and we‚Äôre suppose to go to the river to see the fireworks, i‚Äôm american) 
he then has a habit of punching things in my car, normally this happens when he isn‚Äôt driving, this occasion he was, and he punches the dashboard. while he was driving i wasn‚Äôt looking at him so i‚Äôm  sure what he punched but it might have been the steering wheel? 
he then put his hand up in my face, like the sassy way? not on my face or anything. i hope you all know what i mean, as i was trying to talk to him.
he then pulled over and got out and walked away from my car. 
our dog has separation anxiety so he started freaking out when he saw my boyfriend walk away, he is a 5 year old german shepherd that‚Äôs 95lbs that we rescued a bit ago. 
so our dog was crying, trying to sit in my lap &amp; crawl out the window to run to my boyfriend and it was hot outside and he was being an asshole. so i was irritated. 
now, i‚Äôm very bad at crying when mad, so normally when my boyfriend and i argue i say a few things but then just stay quiet the rest of the time. i‚Äôve asked him over and over and over again to not talk to me the way he does and to please stop hitting things in my car and to stop talking to me the way he does when he‚Äôs mad with me. he talks down to me every single time and hits shit around him or throws shit. 
one occasion he punched a hole in the door. 
when we aren‚Äôt arguing, he is the greatest man i have ever met. we have both sacrificed a lot for each other and do so much for each other. i love this man with all of my heart, but this is the only thing affecting our relationship. 
i told him, out of anger, if he does it again i‚Äôm done. i don‚Äôt know if that was the right response or not. we haven‚Äôt spoken since we got home, we normally don‚Äôt talk for a while to cool down. i need to know if i‚Äôm blinded by how much i love him? or if he just has anger issues and needs to work on himself. i don‚Äôt know.

Little bit of backstory here I \[17M\] have been bestfriends with a kid I went to kindergarten with. We grew up together, spent a lot of time together, and always stood by each other. My friend is the stereotypical popular guy, has a gf, generally good looking etc... We went to the same school and always stood by each other no matter what the circumstances. All throughout 1-5 grade we would win the two peas in a pod award, very cringe but I want to emphasize how close we where.

Here is the whole story two weeks ago we where at a house party on the occasion that we graduated high school. Throughout the whole night we were drinking, smoking, you know celebrating, except for my friend in question, who we will call John, and another girl, lets call her Beth, who both don't smoke or drink. Throughout the whole night John was degrading Beth basically calling her a cow making fun of her appearance, he usually does this and we always shut him down telling him to stop and its not funny. Little later in the night and John and Beth completely disappear. 15 minutes later Beth appears and she looks like shes seen a ghost she comes over grabs one of the other girls, who we will call Ashley, and disappear into the house. John comes back sits back in the circle and doesn't say a word. Suddenly Ashley comes storming out and goes up to John and starts beating the shit out of him, I have literally never seen a women hit this hard or be this enraged, it scared the shit out of me. A couple moments later I pulled Ashley of John. Ashley turns around goes back inside and I see Beth in the distance crying. John was completely baffled at this point not knowing what just happened. I think I forgot to mention that Ashley and I are close friends. I go back with Ashley in the house to calm her down and try to understand whats happening at this point because I was more confused then ever. Ashley broke down and explained to me that John forcibly groped and tried to kiss Beth continuing to explain that he has been blackmailing Ashley with her nudes and forcing her to kiss him, send him more nudes. I was overcome with rage as recently my cousin was sexually assaulted and I was very open with John about how much it enraged me and how weak I felt that I couldn't do anything about it. I was completely baffled that John was capable of assaulting a girl and not to mention that he has always prided himself about how easy it is for him to hook up with girls. I had drank a bit and wanted to go beat the shit out of him but a group of people held me back before I was able to confront him. I left that party not only feeling weak, sad, and angry but confused. Its been two weeks since this incident and I haven't contacted or talked to him since. During these two weeks I have been in contact with two other girls who told me similar stories one of them where he got the girl drunk and forcibly groped her and kissed her, while the other girls story being that he has been forcing her to send him nudes for a while.

I have never been this confused and angry in my life not to mention what the girls had been through and having to keep it hidden. I have cut him out of my life completely and haven't spoken to him since. This type of behavior is something that I can't allow myself to be apart of, my brain would slowly kill me. But I just feel like I have to confront I feel the same way when I was told about what happened to my cousin, I hate this feeling I don't only feel weak, I feel lost, I feel powerless I can't even imagine what the girls are going through. Please tell me what to do should I confront him? should I just never talk to him again?

So the question I‚Äôve been getting asked at almost EVERY social gathering of the same people is, ‚ÄúAre you gay?‚Äù

I‚Äôm getting tired of giving them the same answer for the past 4+ years, which is, no I‚Äôm not.

I‚Äôve already formulated a plan to just say yes I am, but not tell them I mean the old English term (happy), just to throw them off and to get them to stop asking me.

604,"So just a little backstory, I was in a abusive relationship and was manipulated to the point where I planned and had a baby with this man. My father thinks my child was unplanned and the whole situation was very difficult for him to accept because of what the biological father did to me. 
I'm now with a man who has been my best friend for 4 years (and had massive feelings for about 2 years) who has pretty much been one of the best things to ever happen in my life, we've been dating for about half a year, but I already really want to have a baby with him. I know how much of a brilliant father he would be and I love him more than I have anyone else, plus the support I have from my friends and his family is just amazing. Trouble is, I don't think my dad would be happy about me having a second baby without getting married or getting a high paid job first. I've already made up my mind though because honestly the hormones are almost unbearable now.
I'm planning to stop my contraception around November this year, how do I ease the idea of having baby number 2 to my father so that when I do tell him me and my partner are trying for a baby it won't be to much of a shock?",04Jul2019,1
605,"  I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven‚Äôt talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  üëî  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‚Äòyou make me sweat, Graham‚Äô and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‚Äòwtf‚Äô she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",04Jul2019,0

607,"
I started dating my boyfriend whenever I was a senior in high school, so you can say that we were high school sweethearts. At the time, my boyfriends sister was 13, turning 14. I first met her whenever she was 13, and in eighth grade. I tried to always include her in conversations and asked what she was into and everything like that. Then it seemed whenever I graduated and went to college our relationship kinda changed? She seemed to resent me. She hated my existence. At the time, I was going through severe depression and relied on my boyfriend for everything, (I‚Äôve already come to terms that I was toxic, and we‚Äôve moved on from that). I accidentally found one of her accounts where she said that she hated me, and she thought that I was the biggest hypocrite, and that I just wanted sympathy for my problems that weren‚Äôt even that big of a deal. (okay yeah I can see her point on that one‚ÄîI used to be super dramatic over nothing.) but other than that? I‚Äôve mellowed out and let her have her space. 

I‚Äôm literally sitting on my couch in my apartment having a panic attack because of this issue and I kind of want to cry, but my boyfriend is here and I can‚Äôt. Anyway, I made a new Facebook. (There‚Äôs just a long story behind that). So, I make this new Facebook. She blocked me on the old account, so I was like ‚ÄúOh okay whatever.‚Äù That was like my sophomore year of college. I was a pretty shitty person back then. But now, I‚Äôve moved in with my boyfriend and I‚Äôve kinda gotten my life on track, so I was like ‚Äúeh here goes nothing.‚Äù Because we‚Äôre going to be in laws one day. But then I go to see if she‚Äôs accepted my request and I can‚Äôt even hit the add friend button anymore. I‚Äôm going to assume that means she blocked me again. And it‚Äôs really hurtful. Because I‚Äôve tried to be nothing but supportive towards her. I‚Äôve tried and tried so hard to get her to like me, and I don‚Äôt even understand WHY she doesn‚Äôt like me.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm dating her brother? But we‚Äôve been together for almost six years! And she has her own life and her own friends in college! Maybe I was a little pushy in the beginning by trying to get to know her and everything, and maybe she didn‚Äôt like that. Maybe she thought that I was too loud and annoying. Maybe she thought that who I was on tumblr was who I was in real life. Maybe she‚Äôs mad because I started dating her brother. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt get it. 

For some reason, and this is the reason for the confession, I just really want her to like me. I think it‚Äôs because she hasn‚Äôt told me the reason as to why she DOESNT. If she were to come up to me and tell me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you because of x and y‚Äù, then I‚Äôd be fine with it. But that doesn‚Äôt happen. She‚Äôs so secretive‚Äîa lot of her social media accounts are private, and she doesn‚Äôt let anyone in. I know she‚Äôs suffered with anxiety and depression, and I‚Äôve tried to form a bond with her over that, but I constantly get rejected. She doesn‚Äôt want to let anyone else in. And I‚Äôve tried. Maybe I‚Äôve tried to pry too much out of her, more than she‚Äôs willing to give. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to my mother in law about this, and she just states that her daughter doesn‚Äôt like anyone. I‚Äôve asked my boyfriend about it, too, and he just says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Why do you care so much about what she thinks? She‚Äôs not the one dating you. Does it really matter?‚Äù And I see his point, but...

I know about the things that people TELL me about her. I want to sit down and have a conversation with her. About anything. We‚Äôre going to be in laws, we might as well get along.
I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I give her Christmas/birthday presents and this year was the first year that she ever gave me a Christmas present. We can have little conversations, but whenever we‚Äôre in a room together it‚Äôs mostly silent. What can I do about this?",04Jul2019,1
608,"Ive been casually looking for a part time for a bit to bring in a little bit of money for my own personal purchases and outings. Landed an interview at a local sub resuraunt.

I've got no job experience but I threw together a resum√© including extracurriculars, hobbies, etc. 

I'm confident in my personality and my resum√© but Im still understandably slightly anxious seeing as it's all uncharted territory for me.

614,"Hey people of Reddit,¬† 

I‚Äôve started an internship at this company as part of a college program that I signed up for last semester and I‚Äôve been having some trouble fitting in with the other interns there. I‚Äôm really quiet, introverted and highly sensitive so it‚Äôs hard for me to win friends in the first place, and they never really invite me anywhere and always leave me behind after work. As you can probably guess, I constantly feel left out and unwanted. I had been bullied a lot in the past so some social situations trigger me.

So yesterday, I noticed they all planned to go out for dinner somewhere after work and, as per usual, I wasn‚Äôt invited. I tried to feel indifferent towards it all like I always do when this happens, but I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and immediately felt like I was on the verge of tears. I quickly got up and rushed out of the office, and one of my coworkers, a really nice guy that I collaborate with on almost every project, stopped me and asked me if I was ok. I kept walking past him and left, when suddenly I get a text from him telling me that if there was anything he could do to help that I let him know.  
 

Of course, my first instinct was to keep him out of it and that this was a silly problem to talk about to anyone anyway. But at the same time, I had this strong urge to confide in him about what I was going through. I really want someone to hear me out and offer a listening ear. I know I can talk about it with my family, but I don‚Äôt know why I want someone at work to know about what I‚Äôm going through. 

TL;DR: I got really upset at work and left crying. A coworker saw me and later texted me to ask if he could help me in any way. 

Do you think it‚Äôs ok for me to open up to him? Or is it just too inappropriate? 

Thanks.",04Jul2019,2
615,"I finished University a year ago and ever since I've been trying to find a job in content writing, copywriting, or journalism. I've been keeping up a portfolio and I've been told that my work is exceptional, but so far I don't have a job. I've only been applying for the last couple months but I don't have any leads and everything I find has additional requirements like backgrounds in finance or marketing.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing has always been my dream job and I would honestly be happy working as a content writer or journalist for the rest of my life. It just seems that a higher education in writing is worthless on its own.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been living at home though, and over the past year I've saved up enough to go back to college to learn a trade. I always toyed with the idea of auto mechanics as a fallback, but now it seems as if a skilled trade is my best bet. I'm also looking at carpentry and welding. The issue is that I would probably hate my job since it would no longer be a hobby. I also have issues working with the public as I grew up in a family would much money, and so I was always around when the family car would break down and hard decisions would have to be made. I feel like I would be worn down in 15-20 years.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I love to write and I could do it until I'm 100, but nobody seems to be looking to hire someone with my qualifications.

618,"I don't enjoy much of anything.  It's really hard for me to take interest in trying new things, I just expect that I'll get tired of them very quickly, or that they'll be all together boring.

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine if I had someone to do these things with, it would be more fun, but I don't.  I have no interest in making new friends.  I'm terrible at holding a conversation about things I don't know about, because I have no interest in anything else.  My ""friends"" talk about the latest shitty games or meme nonsense.  People at work talk about their kids or cars or sports or the latest blockbuster movie.  I have no interest in any of those things.  

&amp;#x200B;

I look forward to lunch every day but it's rare for me to enjoy a meal because there's always something I don't like about it.  Meanwhile everyone around me is remarking about how great the food is and the most amazing X they've had and why it was so great.  Even when I do enjoy something I can't display such passion for it like everyone else does.  I have more passion for things I hate, but of course no one wants to listen to someone being negative about things unless they also hate the same thing.  I have really high standards so I always find something to complain about.  I can't enjoy ""dumb"" things.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of this isn't new.  My whole life, my only interest has been computer-related.  I've never understood the things normal people are interested in.  I work with a bunch of programmers and yet they're all completely normal.  They all like programming more than me, they all like gaming more than me, they all like normal people things.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing video games since I was a kid but I'm getting tired of them.  Most of them are boring and terribly made these days.  A lot of times I'll open up a game I used to enjoy and then close it again almost immediately.  I watch a lot of youtube gameplay videos by people I used to enjoy for years but now I mostly just watch to have some kind of distraction that I don't really enjoy.  I used to laugh at these videos before but now I barely manage a grin.  I'm spending more and more time just lying on my couch doing nothing.  The only joy I have left in my life is music.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all alone and I hate it.  I avoid taking days off from work because I'd just sit at home and not see another person for an entire day otherwise.  I go to lunch with the people at work every day because I hate being alone and want to enjoy the funny conversation, but I can't contribute to it.  I'm not witty like everyone else and don't have the experience or memory to make clever references.  I laugh pretty easily but it's always a quick shallow laugh.  At this point it's probably been years since I laughed hard, and even then it felt awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be OK being alone, until recently when I started dating.  I feel like it's awoken something in me and now I can't stand the loneliness.  I'm sometimes so filled with sadness I end up crying.  Sad stories or movies didn't use to have any effect on me, but now I'm easily driven to tears.  My relationships never last, of course, either because I'm not funny or I'm boring.  I don't think I'm a miserable person to be around, I don't let anyone know I feel this way, I'm just not entertaining.  After I meet with someone I can manage to get myself interested in trying new things \*with them\* but we never get to that point, they reject me and I lose interest in everything again.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  My lack of enjoyment of most things leads to a lack of interest in almost everything.  I haven't experienced the million different things everyone else has, which leads to being unable to have any kind of substantial conversation with people, which leaves me alone and further unable to enjoy anything.  I tried to convince myself to go on a vacation to another country recently, I thought doing something crazy and experiencing something vastly different would help me, but I couldn't do it.  I can't imagine myself enjoying looking at things, I just imagine myself going out to eat, having a boring meal all by myself without saying a word, and then going back to the hotel and doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to continue on this way.  I feel like my life is boring and pointless.  I've thought about seeing a therapist but I don't know what's wrong with me or if this is even something they can help with.",04Jul2019,1

620,"I'm kind of losing my shit about this. I wasn't the most social person until about a year ago so a lot of my good friends are online. I met my friend when I was 13 and he was 11. We met on a multiplayer game that I was terrible at and he mentored me to get better at it, and we became good friends in the process. I didn't learn his age until later that year but it didn't really change anything for me. Our friendship only got better. He knew everything about me, I knew everything about him. Over the next 5 years we became pretty much siblings. I helped him through relationships gone bad and coming to terms with who he was, and he did the same for me and my anxiety. I'm planning to fly out to Germany next year to finally meet him in person. 

&amp;#x200B;

He admitted he saw me as more than just a friend when he was 13 and I was 15. I told him I loved him, but not in that way. I also didn't really have feelings for men at that point. Even if I did, the age gap still would've freaked me out.  By the time I was 16 I started thinking about my own sexuality and started to consider that maybe I'm not 100% straight. I still didn't consider anything sexual about my friend though.

&amp;#x200B;

We've never done anything sexual together other than briefly trading porn for a few weeks when I was 16 and he was 14. I was uncomfortable with it after the first couple of times and my anxiety flared up about getting arrested for ""distribution of child pornography"" (to be clear so there's no confusion, we traded porn we'd found online, I would've \*NEVER\* sent him a photo of myself in an nsfw situation or asked for one of him etc.)  so after I stopped being a bitch about speaking up about it I put a stop to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had anxiety convincing myself I'm all sorts of things that I won't get into here before, being a pedophile is one of them. I remembered getting hard and feeling pretty turned on when he made a half joking flirty ""you never know.."" statement over me coming to visit once. I've never felt sexually attracted to him, as far as I can tell. I do love him, in the way I love my brother or my mother. He's my closest friend. I worry that it's more than that though, I worry because my heart sinks after something he said (in a good way) and the only explanation my brain can come up with is that it's ""cute"".

  
I don't want to be with him in that way. If I am something bad, if these thoughts are wrong, I will go and get help immediately. I don't want to be a pedophile. Sorry if any of this comes off as dramatic, I just don't really have anyone to talk to about this",04Jul2019,7
621,"So before I start, Im a normal 15 yo girl. By the title a lot of people from when I googled try to get out of therapy despite being mentally unstable, but the problem is that I'm not, I don't need therapy at all, but ever since I got back from a trip to see an old family friend, its all gone downhill.

My mom had been acting more worried and cautious. All my atempts to calm her down have been futile. She kept asking me stuff like ""Is anyone doing something to you? Are you being bullied?"" Not only did that make me uncomfortable hearing almost all the time now, but she never thought I was telling the truth even after I say no which is the truth... then she cracked down on how I don't talk to my family that often and always on that ""evil faggot chatting"" with my friends (this is the only way we can communicate becase all of our parents are either racist, stict, etc...) she thinks its breaking the relationship with my family despite me not even being that close before i started talking to them.
So why don't I talk to my family? They never take me seriously, I can barely relate to them at all, and they are all extroverts. I could list more reasons if I wanted to.
The concept of an introvert to them doesn't exist.
This lead my parents to take my laptop and phone, and change the password on their computer. (If you're wondering how im typing this now, my dad is still sleeping and I took his phone) They actually think they're gonna fix me by making me to to the store with dad more often or watch live tv. They think I'm socially inept. But at some point in my life I had to socialize at school, i can talk to people just fine, I just prefer not to talk to them.

The only defining factor to support them, was my grades. They were terrible, F's.
Its a long story but...I just didnt care. This doesnt mean im depressed. In fact im doing fine in credit recovery. Already made up first semester of English 1 with a B.

Which now brings me here, Therapy.
I clearly told my mom ""NO THERAPY"" absolutely not, that was going too far and I knew it.
Still did it anyways and now shes here wasting her money on me for a problem that doesn't exist.
I have never been this bothered or mad before. The idea of going to therapy and my parents acting all sappy makes me uncomfortable. I prefered getting hit for bad grades, not this!

And if anything...I think my mom is the one who needs therapy for paranoia.

629,"Sorry if this is not the right place to post, I‚Äôm just scared shitless and google is not helping me find an answer.. I‚Äôve been meaning to go to the Dentist for a couple years now but was traumatized by an experience with my previous dentist a few years back (I don‚Äôt take well to anesthesia, felt everything, he ended up destroying some of my teeth and couldn‚Äôt finish). I‚Äôve been putting it off for so long I can barely even chew on any of my teeth anymore. Some of them move while chewing, I broke a tooth on a tater tot a few days ago.. 

My bad teeth are a result of Wilson‚Äôs Disease, a disease that prevents copper from leaving my body, so I suffer from constant copper toxicity. It‚Äôs caused many other issues, such as a gastrointestinal disease (Crohn‚Äôs or UC, not sure which yet), malnutrition, extreme weight loss, etc. The copper builds up in vital organs and causes damage over time, so I‚Äôll eventually end up with many many pains before I inevitably die if I don‚Äôt do something..

How the hell did people back in the day survive with stuff like this? Do I really need to go to a dentist to survive? I also tried taking medicine to help reduce copper in my body, a chelating agent called Cyprine, but it was so excruciating that I thought I was suffering brain damage, and I couldn‚Äôt move from my bed while on it. I‚Äôve also noticed an extreme loss in attention span and my abilities with math have diminished over time, idk if it‚Äôs the Disease itself or if it was the medicine. 

I started treating the pain with (illegal) medical marijuana a couple years back (illegal is cheaper as far as I‚Äôve seen), so far it has been the only thing that has helped me through it, but also contributes a dilemma regarding dentistry, since I‚Äôve become reliant on smoking to ease the pain and that cannot be done after oral surgery. No source on edibles / tinctures either but it is dabs and it is vaporized so maybe it‚Äôs not the same as smoking after a surgery. Another aforementioned issue is the fact that the anesthesia doesn‚Äôt do shit for me, so I‚Äôd need to be put under for any dental work, and it isn‚Äôt easy to find a dentist willing to do this under my insurance. 

I‚Äôve been living with unearthly amounts of pain and with the fear of unexpected death for years, and I never thought I‚Äôd make it this far. It‚Äôs honestly gut wrenching to even admit it, but I thought I would‚Äôve been dead by now. I‚Äôve been rushing, pushing myself to my mental limit trying to develop a video game to sustain my family / girlfriend‚Äôs financial future after my death, but I just don‚Äôt think I can keep going.. 

If anybody has any advice as to how I should proceed so I don‚Äôt have to leave behind my family and beloved girlfriend, I‚Äôd be forever grateful. I‚Äôve pretty much accepted that I will die young and everybody is angry at me for it, but I don‚Äôt want to spend my remaining days in a hospital, or spend it suffering through potential years on end of dental work just to die anyway. 

Am I just being overly-paranoid or stupid? Is my fear of the dentist unwarranted? Maybe I‚Äôm not as hopeless as I feel, but nobody is helping me, my parents keep suggesting essential oils, which is essentially just snake oil to me. Idk, but I need help. I generally have the willpower to help myself but I just can‚Äôt figure out what it is I need to do. 

Thank you so much for reading, and I will very much appreciate any helpful advice or kind words. The only advice I can offer myself is how to manage the pain or how to overcome the depression / mental anguish that comes with all this mess..",04Jul2019,1

631,"I (21f) don't know whether I should tell my boyfriend (28m) about my past (see post history for more details). 
It's taken a long time to trust him and I'm so scared of how he could react. I can only imagine him being weirded out or repulsed by me. 
I've never been able to tell anyone about it before so this would be a really big deal for me and I don't know how I would handle a negative response. 
I just think that maybe he has the right to know. Especially since it causes trouble in our relationship when he tries to be intimate with me. 
I'm worried that if I don't tell him about it, I won't be able to open up to him about more intimate things like how I want him to act with me sexually. I'm also scared that he won't understand if I tell him that the reason I can't get aroused during sex is because I can only become aroused when thinking about violence and rape. 
It happened a long time ago but I still haven't moved on from it and it's left me with alot of different issues.

637,"Idk what to do. A year ago, I started dating a girl. We broke after 2 months, she's being abusive and toxic as fuck with me. But, at the moment, I didn't know about those things, I was just in love with her. After we broke, she made many things on the purpose to hurt me, such as banging with my closer friends 2 days after our break. She was continuously doing those things that she knew would hurt me. I've fallen into coccaine addiction, there was many bad things occurring on my life, and then I started drug abuse. I don't blame her for that; even when she did it all to me, it was my fault to discount everything on drugs. On that time, I would blame her, but I've changed a lot since all this shits (i'm completely clean now, got out of depression, i'm 100% okay with myself and i'm happy with my life). At the moment, I was on severe depression and very, very childish.  
 3 months after our break, I was still in love with her, but we did talk rarely as friends, I never tried anything again cuz I knew it would be an absolute no. Nowadays I know that this ""love"" was purely obsession. But at the time, I thought it was love. On this time, my brother just started to talk with her. He kept telling me that he had no intentions (he knew how much it would hurt my feelings).  
Then, he started to leave our hangouts with our best friends (we was on the same social circle) to go on hangouts with her and her friends. I thought he was just acquiring new friends, but it was not his intention; he joined her social circle cuz he wanted her. He didn't loved her, he just wanted to bang her, and kept hiding his intentions from me.  
Weeks before, they started to date. Since them, I just can't look him on the face. I just can't forgive him. It's not about her. I think i'm better without her after all she did to me. But it's about him lying for me, and doing one thing that he knows that would hurt me as fuck. He could have gone into any other girl in the city; he didn't loved her before started to talk to her, he just wanted to bang. There's many pretty girls on this city, but he chose to start flirting exactly with my ex. As I said, i'm not worried about her, after all we're not in a relationship and she's free to do whatever she wants, but about him having the option to not hurt my feelings (if he loved her before they started going on hang outs, I would understand him, maybe I would be happy for him) and still choosing that. He saw me on drugs, he saw my many suicide attempts, he saw everything I got into; and he still done that.  
Now I just can't look him on the face; I don't even see my dad since they started dating cuz I don't want to go at my dad's house and see him. He's mom encourages what he did, but when I did something similar to my friend, she blamed me as fuck and told me things that made me feel like the worst person on the planet. Now she says that I deserve that for what I did to my friend, and keep making me feel like i'm paying for something. I think that's hypocrite, but i don't discuss.  
I don't know what to do. I just cut him off my entire life. But he still is my brother. I feel pretty bad when I think about those things.",04Jul2019,1
638,"Hello, I need help figuring out if reaching out to my online friend is logical or not. It's hard to tell given I used to have a very big crush on her. I think I still like her in romantic ways. Perhaps I always will but at the same time I'm feeling much more comfortable with the idea that maybe she we don't fit together in that way. It's been a few months now since we last talked (argued).

My romantic feelings paired with my own lack of self-awareness caused our friendship to fall apart. Overall, I don't feel like I was a good friend to her and I genuinely want to be a good friend now. And if I ever feel like I can't do that then I will distance myself from her so she doesn't get hurt this time around.

She's blocked me everywhere. The only way I'd be able to reach her now is through someone else's phone. I sent her an email explaining how I really felt a few weeks ago and she has not replied. Then again, that is not an email she uses regularly so perhaps that's why. She also may have blocked me there too, I don't know.

Everything was going great, I had assumed I was well on my way to a fourth straight title to cap off my high school career but then a tall, boney sophomore girl started mowing through all of the other top candidates. She ended up making the championship where she would face of against me. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, as I had figured there‚Äôs no way a young girl would beat the experienced senior guy. I lost.

The second year was better because I didn't get bullied, the friends situation was the same, but I talked more and had overall a better experience than the first year, but still didn't hang out with people from this school outside school. 

Well, I decided to go on an exchange year because I wanted something new and to test myself and learn more about life and also because I was tired of the place and people.

We have managed it alright, but I am starting to break at the seams.

Husband: Needs security, peace, and consistency in his environment. He is driven by fear, shame, and guilt. He is incredibly kind, generous, thoughtful, a bit pessimistic, and open-minded. 

Me: Needs variety, stimulation, and excitement in my environment. I am driven by rewards and the feeling that I need something more to be happy. I am sensitive, empathetic, excitable, a bit selfish, and optimistic.

Our problem: I feel like he is holding me back in innumerable ways which is causing me to resent him. He feels like at the end of the day he can't count on me and I'm going to push us into debt which causes him to distrust me.",04Jul2019,1
644,"So long story short, I met up with a couple of high school buddies like a month or so ago (the two were like best friends and still sorta are even though one's away at uni most of the time, whereas I'm a friend but not a ""best"" friend) and we had a fun day together. 

One of them suggested we go camping for a few days in the summer when everyone's around and can get time off work etc. and I just kinda went along with it saying yeah that's a cool idea. We decided on next week Mon-Fri.... fast forward to now, it's 4 days away. 

However, gonna be totally honest, I don't know if I'm up for it, I'm suddenly having the ehhh I don't want to go feeling. I'm really introverted and don't like traveling or holidays so the idea of spending 5 days up in Wales camping, being around other people almost all the time, is kinda driving me nuts. A part of me wants to say sorry and bail but another part of me thinks that'd be a seriously dick move so last-minute and that I should get over myself and push myself to go along, 5 days is not the end of the world.

649,"No throwaway or anything. I want to be honest right from the start rather than hide. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom since this'll be on the long side.

So, I'm nearly 31 years old. For the past roughtly 10-15 years of my life went to work, played video games, and drank. I had no social life (outside of people met in games). I have never had a girlfriend, I had no confidence. I hate myself.

At the start of this year I decided to finally start turning my life around. I'm in my 6th month straight going to the gym every day after work. I've started putting spare time into trying to write a novel because literally my only good quality as a human being is my imagination, so I hope one day I can put it to use and write something that other people like.

Now, here is where I need advice. I'm doing my absolute best to improve physical health with the gym, drinking less, etc. I still play video games a lot because I mostly play MMO's and quite frankly I don't know what I would do without at least that social interaction. That's my problem. There is nothing I can just flip on or 'just do it' like I did with the gym. I can't suddenly make friends.

I tried joining a bunch of public discords to talk to people but people my age are people who have experienced life and they're so different from me. I basically went to sleep at 18 and woke up at 30. The discords with people who ARE in the 16-20 age group made me feel like that 'Hello fellow kids' meme even if I did get along better with them, so I ended up leaving those to not be a weird creep. And on the topic of meeting people online, it doesn't take much digging in my Reddit history to find me drunkposting or just being a complete dick to people online. I feel so fucking bad about so many things I say to people and I want to get better.

I just don't know what to do. I don't live in a city with much going on. My Mom suggested going to a cooking class since I've started learning to cook (part of a long term goal to move out, started at the beginning of the year with the other stuff) and to meet people, and my city literally does not even have that. Just one restaurant in town doing little 'learn to cook something on our menu' things and it's high priced+sold out. I really think for me being at the level I'm at I have to resort to meeting people online first since even that basic stuff sounds out of my comfort zone.

I just don't know what to do at this point. I wasted what should have been the best years to experience life and love and now it's too late. I don't want to be a charity case for somebody. I want to be somebody that really matters to somebody and that's not something you can force.

650,"I'm sorry if this comes out as egoistic or a tad bit cocky. I hate being this way. I have a lot of ideas and opinions I want to discuss during class but I don't want to look like the 'smart one' so I just shut up which really sucks. Maybe I'm not even that smart..I feel like I'm just overthinking about it but I don't know how to overcome this. 

Like, when our teacher asks a question, a lot of ideas are forming inside my head and I raise my hand to recite but I can't organize the information properly so I just stutter the lame stuff. Because my mind is split thinking in two: 90% about how everyone aka my classmates are going to react about my answer  and 10% on organizing my ideas and thought so I can actually express my ideas accurately. 

It's dreadful. When I come up with a good answer in class, my automatic thoughts are ""my classmates think I'm smart I should be really effin proud because they're lookin up to me"" but having these thoughts are stupid and scary because even in my mind I sound like some cocky,arrogant person so I get nervous and my thoughts switch to ""you're nothing, be humble and stop being so cocky"" but it makes me feel really low and worthless.Like not just low, but really low. I feel like this is because of self-esteem issues.. Because my sef-confidence is almost non-existent. 


Reading this, you may think I'm being an idiot for overthinking stuff. I mean, why can't I just get up and express my answers and ideas accurately everytime the teacher asks someone to participate in class? Believe me, I don't know why or how to fix this. I feel like this whole post sounds childish but it's really how I feel and it's terrible. 

From a scale of 1-10,with 10 being the highest, my fear of appearing smart in class is on 11.This is dreadful..Has anyone also experienced this?

Once high school started I had lots of trouble meeting news people, making new friends, etc. Well eventually I started to make new friends. Good friends - even a boyfriend - and it was amazing. I felt great. I ended up moving in with my dad and I was 2 hrs away at a new school. 

I was fine with friends and everything until about a month in. I never had that many friends. Maybe like 3 good ones. 2 of my friends never kept in contact with me. A lot of people didnt even know I moved. The last friend called the cops on me because I was depressed and they were worried. They said they were just a kid and they couldn't handle me being depressed and suicidal. I'm 17. He was also 17. 

Anyways after that I was so unbelievably mad they couldn't be there for me and called the cops instead, so I was left with some acquaintances my new school. I already felt lonely after I had no friends starting a new school, but I didnt think it would get much worse. 

One guy I got really close with had a crush on me and we messed around for a little bit, but I made it clear before that I really shouldn't be dating due to my mental health and my living situation, because I move around alot. He said he understood and we became friends.

666,"Okay, so, I'll try to explain the situation as best as I can, despite my english being far from flawless, if you have any question I'll answer. I'm a twenty-year-old, fulfilled, generally happy,  university student, and I happen to be a virgin (I have dated some guys, made out a few times, but that's pretty much it). Also, I'm a girl, sorry, I realised at the end of the post that I haven't made that clear. Being a virgin has never been a big deal in my life before, a lot of my friends haven't had sex either, I know I'm generally considered attractive by most men, so I have always felt like ""I'll just do it whenever I feel like it"". In the last year, I got a huge crush on someone, and it got pretty bad, because he has a girlfriend, but they where on and off and we had like a loooot of physical contact thoughout the year (as in, sleeping toghether, cuddling, neck kissing, shit like that), so one night I'm like ""fuck it, I can't keep wondering what this guy thinks all my life "", and I kiss him. He gets all ""sorry, I can't, I mean, I like you a lot, but my gf, I can't...."" and he goes on  about how they have been toghether since fucking kindergaden and they always fight and they broke up like six-hundred times but a witch once told them they'll be toghether forever and blabla (I'm being sarcastic, but you get what I mean). About four months have passed since that conversation. The thing is, we kept spending  a lot of time toghether because of external situations (did I mention that him being my flatmate?), and I think I might have fallen for him even more (I know, bad idea, but also not really an idea). He keeps sending mixed signals and gets me very confused. In the meanwhile, in the hope I would forget about him, I started dating another guy, let's call him Paolo, he is nice and sweet but I know I'm not into him that much bc I still think about my flatmate, and I feel a bit guilty for that. What has all that to do with my virginity? I'm getting there.

First thing, I realised, when me and my flatmate cuddled up, but also while making out with Paolo, that I felt a lot of stress and tension at the idea that they had much more sexual experience than I did (they both had sex when they were like fourteen), it's like they had an head-start. That stress piles over all the other kind of stress I described above and I wonder ""do I really need this thought in the back of my head?"".

Second point, as much as I keep saying I have no problem with being a virgin, I also sometimes feel the pressure of missing out on a fun and important part of youth.

Third, and maybe most important,  I want to experience my first time in an environment where I feel no pressure, where I can quietly learn, and the only way I feel I can do that is with a friend with benefit, basically.

So, I'm finally getting to my point, sorry you had to read so far,an idea in the last week came up into my head: I could look someone up on okcupid or tinder, or whatever, someone that looks like a nice decent person, explain the situation fully and ask him to be my friend with benefits until I feel confident enough to date without all this stress of ""should I tell him? when should I tell him? How should I tell him?"".  Does it sound dumb to you? I would choose him carefully: I would chat with him and talk in person at least a couple times before. I don't want my first time to be surronded by all this drama, I want it to be light and fun like sex should be, especially at my age. Tell what you guys think, thank you all for the answer and the support, please, be kind, it's a rough period for me.  :)",04Jul2019,0

670,"I am a 35-year-old woman who also suffered through endometriosis, resulting in five surgeries over eight years. The last and what I thought was my final surgery, was a hysterectomy performed only last July. So I am accustomed to pain, nausea and my life being in an on-off state of pause. The River of Uncertainty, I call it, and this recent diagnosis has me further in uncharted waters. 

Last week I found out I was born with my right subclavian artery wrapped behind my esophagus, causing chronic nausea and some dysphagia due to compression.

I haven‚Äôt been able to work, let alone really leave the house, in over five weeks. I tried walking to the train station this morning, only to turn around after I dry heaved and eventually threw up a few times. 

I spend most of my days beached on my couch watching terrible reality television - I‚Äôm nauseous anyways so I figure shame tv can‚Äôt hurt. 

I am reading through the few medical journals I can find online. However, it would be great to talk to someone who has experienced or is familiar with this super rare condition while I wait to hear from the cardiac team.

If you have the same diagnosis/been diagnosed, or if you know someone who has been diagnosed, or if you are a doctor/surgeon/med student/anything in the medical field relating to this diagnosis - so basically, if you know anything more than the google search, please reply. 

Also if there is a better subreddit to put this under, let me know.

Earlier today he came up to me looked me dead in the eye and said I know what I wanna do for my birthday. He then told me he wanted to go hangout at a nudist beach or resort for the weekend.

673,"I'm 20 and I made a huge mistake that I can easily say has changed my life. I cheated on my girlfriend while drunk at a party and on top of that this girl had been cheated on twice before me by ex-boyfriends. For whatever reason, maybe denial, maybe fear of what would happen and also not wanting to hurt her, I kept the whole thing to myself. We broke up shortly after, she didn't love me and felt the whole thing was a mistake and I went along with it, knowing we needed to break up, but still kept it to myself. Fast forward a few months and everyone is at uni, but most of us still meet up and hangout for birthdays and drinks that sort of thing. She approaches me and tells me how she has found out and we talk it out for a while. I still love her and try everything I can to make her see it's not her fault but I can't tell how it works and I guess I'll never know. The whole episode ends up sending me crazy mentally. I was shut in for about 6 weeks and had made multiple plans to end my life during this time before my parents pressured me into getting help thinking it was some underlying problem or something. It's worth noting that I can't ask my parents for advice at this point in my life. Several past expiriences have me at the point where I can't talk personal matters with them at all anymore. Fast forward again to a 4 months time and I've made some real progress with counseling. I'm trying to make friends in class and going out with my old friends as well. Im trying my best to socialize and get involved again, but still avoid said ex girlfriend not wanting to make anything difficult for either of us. Fast forward to today, about 3 weeks later and we've even chatted whilst out with our friends, nothing more than stray banter but still, feels like progress and it helps to convince me that maybe I didn't completely destroy her life. I get home and removed from the group chat a few minutes later. Looking for people to message and ask I realised I have been either unfriended or blocked by everyone and I'm stuck writing this Reddit post not knowing what to do.

It's one thing if they ask ""Can you call rn"" because then I have time to either say no or prepare for it, but if I don't get that my stomach jumps into my throat when the phone rings because I wasn't expecting to have to be social, and just being on the phone for whatever reason (with the exception of a handful of people) is surprisingly more draining than face-to-face interactions. I like them with some people because they have calm or really easy to read voices, but for most people, it makes me just want to jump off a cliff and hide in a hole so I don't have to talk to anyone else for at least the day.

682,"Last September I got hired at what I thought it was my dream job. I was assigned an amazing project and given as many resources as I needed in order to achieve my objectives. The first few days prior to my start I was super excited and motivated. Now, I can barely get out of bed without feeling anxious about my day ahead. 

My boss makes jokes and comments every single day that are disrespectful, inappropriate and just rude to every single collective that exists which doesn't match his own personal and ridiculous criteria. Just as a few examples: he thinks that because I'm a woman I'm gonna work less on my period days and should therefore work harder on my ""human being"" days (he said this to me on my second day at work), that we should claim to have a queer member in our team to look good, that we should pretend to be depressed if we ever want to quit  because, quote: ""depression is a trend and we should all get advantage of  paid leaves that we are entitled to in our company before definitely leaving"". 

Among others, he has justified the Holocaust, white race superiority and sexual harassment. 

I spoke with my co-workers about this behaviour but they've told me it's just his way of expressing himself. That he doesn't really mean it. However, I can't cope with it anymore. I do not agree with any of this nonsense, nor with making jokes and comments every day and undermining people's value in hurtful emails (where more than one time he has called us useless pieces of shit). It's gotten to the point that I just leave the room when he enters it because I know he's gonna start a rant that I'm not gonna agree with and it's gonna get me on my nerves. I tried speaking up and saying my own opinion. He doesn't listen and just keeps ranting about whatever injustice he thinks the world has done to him. 

I wish I could do something to make him stop this behaviour. No one seems to care. I have a few more months ahead before I can leave and I need a new strategy to be able to smile at work and feel motivated. 
Any piece of advise is more than welcome. At this point I just want my motivation and happiness back.",04Jul2019,1

685,"I‚Äôm a feeder. I‚Äôm into overweight women, ranging from slightly overweight to ~400lbs, and encouraging and supporting them to put on weight (up to a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù point).

I don‚Äôt know whether I can be properly satisfied in a relationship unless I‚Äôm with a feedee, i.e. someone into the receiving end of this. Trouble is, I don‚Äôt live in a big city and a person like this is obviously difficult to find. I‚Äôve only ever messaged one person who explicitly stated she‚Äôd be interested, but she stopped returning my texts (I wasn‚Äôt acting weird or anything, she just stopped texting back). 

There is Feabie, a social network/dating site for people like me, but I can‚Äôt have a profile with a face picture on it because I am trying to get involved in public life in my home country - if I gained a substantive public profile, and then was exposed as being on what some may view as a weird fetish site, it would obviously be pretty devastating. On the flip side, the Feabie community frowns upon who doesn‚Äôt have a face pic and is extremely abusive to anyone who speaks out, even though I have a perfectly good reason not to have one, and the few local women on there will not respond to messages from people without profile pics anyway. The only other potential way I had of finding a feedee was through Craigslist Personals, which has now obviously been shut down. And meeting people conventionally, revealing what I‚Äôm into and asking if they‚Äôd be interested in it is a non-starter - there are few people interested. (I‚Äôd never force this on anyone against their consent, obviously.)

My most recent relationship ended 3.5 years ago, it lasted a year and a couple of months. It ended because she lost 4 stone (56lbs) and I decided I wasn‚Äôt physically attracted to her any more. Close friends at the time told me it was a shitty thing to do, but I was adamant that I could not stay in a relationship with someone I wasn‚Äôt attracted to, and that she didn‚Äôt deserve that. I fear if I get into another relationship, this will happen again.

Sometimes I think I‚Äôd be fine to be in a relationship with someone who isn‚Äôt a feedee, or at least isn‚Äôt losing weight. Other times, I worry if I committed to such a relationship, I‚Äôd either end up marrying her and living out my life without ever getting the chance to completely fulfil my sexual fantasies, or go through another fractious break-up as before. Honestly, I could take someone not being a feedee, but even if they‚Äôre big enough that I‚Äôd be interested, they can always decide to lose weight and that puts me in yet another quandary where I risk looking like a dick and causing her hurt. The indecision is getting to the point I can‚Äôt make any progress when I‚Äôm dating a girl, because I end up backing out from committing and alienating her.

In principle the easiest way out I can see is figure out some way to find a feedee. But beyond that, I am plagued by uncertainty and indecision.

687,"I've been at my job for a long time and I'd stay thereif it weren't in a really stressful metro area. My salary is in the mid-$100s plus bonuses and 401k matching, and I get along with most of the people there, and we work on cool stuff, but I can't handle the traffic and stress of the city or the traffic and sprawl of the suburbs. Like, I don't want to give too many identifying details here, but it doesn't get much more stressful than this place.  


I've got an offer coming in from a western state with beautiful scenery. There's still traffic, but it's not the same, and there's not the kind of soul-eroding sprawl. The company looks great -- the people are welcoming and warm and I'd enjoy what I was working on. My salary wouldn't be great, though; it'd be in the low $100s, with no matching and likely no bonus, at least the first year. According to internet cost-of-living comparisons, the salaries are roughly equivalent, but rents on Zillow and Trulia belie that. Plus since you're not paying 100% of your income on rent, the rent disparity is only a small part of the cost of living differential. So it'd be a pay cut. I'd be going from rich-for-a-single-dude to having-to-budget, and that's a sharp edge to fall off of.   


That said, if I stick around here, I'm paying in sanity and the feeling of not having a home I appreciate. I like to think of myself as not motivated by money, but I'm wondering if that's really true, because I feel sort of paralyzed.

&amp;#x200B;

I (18F) had a small crush on this guy (18M) and we started dancing together at a party. I was pretty drunk, but not to the point of blacking out. We started to make out and he said we should leave, so I followed him into an alley behind the party. We kept making out and he bit my lip a bunch and I asked him to stop doing that and he did for a bit. He then proposed that we go to his sports team's locker room and I said yes. He opened the door with a code (all players have the access code to the locker room) and we kept making out inside. He kept biting my lip to the point where it started bleeding and I asked him to stop again. A few other players came into the locker room and so he said we should go out onto the field. I had an uneasy feeling because I knew there was no way to get out of the locker room and field without the access code, but I decided to go out onto the field with him anyway. As soon as we got out there, he pushed me onto my knees and said ""blow me baby"" while unzipping his pants. He held my head onto his penis and I kept trying to move my head away but his grip was too strong. I was also sexually abused as a child so this caused a flashback and I kind of froze. He then pushed me onto the ground and took off my leggings and went inside of me. At this point, I was crying but I can't remember if I said no or asked him to stop. I was completely frozen and crying and was just waiting for it to be over. Luckily, a cop saw us on the field and yelled at us to get off. I grabbed my phone and waited for him to let us back into the locker room so that I could get my purse and I ran out as fast as I could after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is considered rape because I didn't say no and I didn't ask him to stop. It all just moved very fast and he was very aggressive, but I'm not sure if this counts as assault. Plus, because I was abused as a child I'm not sure if I was so scared because I was having a flashback or if he was actually dangerous to me (I hope this makes some sort of sense).",04Jul2019,1

707,"I'll try to keep this short and as unbiased as I can manage.

My fiance's sister is currently going through what she should have gone through in high school. This is the 5th guy she's brought home since her relationship of roughly a year ended in the spring. She's the kind of girl that wants every guy she's with to be the one, but jumps in with both feet and they either run or she gets bored of them because it's too much too soon. So she's not necessarily a Run Around Sue because she usually has the right intentions.

She wastes no time getting to know them and has them sleeping over before you even know his name. Whatever, some people are like that. But awkward when she's bringing them home to mom and dad and mom and dad don't seem to care they sleep in her room.

The last guy she was with lasted 2 weeks (her doing), but still met the family and stayed over etc etc. This was also less than a month ago. 

\*\*side note\*\* in the eyes of her parents she is untouchable and she does what she wants (one girl of four)

\*\*side note\*\* my fiance and I live with her - in a separate suite but in their parents house. shitty I know but $$$ 

ok so for the biased bit...

SHE HAS KNOWN THIS MF FOR 2 WEEKS. 2 weeks and she's already had him stay over and of course he's met the parents. My fiance is so choked. He hasn't said a word to this guy. Hasn't made any effort with the last two either. He's embarrassed for his sister as we all are. She's also the kind of girl who posts about all of these guys publicly via social media so as to embarrass everyone further. 

SHE IS ONE OF MY BRIDESMAIDS. She is not going to have the TIME to entertain this bozo ..which leads me to a quick segue ...

&amp;#x200B;

A year and a half ago we had an engagement party thrown for us. At the time she had a new boyfriend that nobody had met yet (they had probably been dating a month by then) and I had an issue having him there. It would just be an excuse for her to introduce said boyfriend to the family and I didn't want any unnecessary awkwardness. Sure enough I lost that battle and he came - he turned out to be an alright dude but just principal. She was no different then so I had similar feelings towards her boyfriends and meeting them.

&amp;#x200B;

...

&amp;#x200B;

my rationale for not having him come:

* her track record suggests he'll last 1-2 months 
* family photos would be super awkward
* if she wants to include him in photos (likely) I don't want to look back on photos and go who the hell is that guy
* she's in the wedding party and she doesn't need a date
* it would be yet again another excuse to introduce a new boyfriend to her entire family
* I haven't allowed plus one's (not even cousins are allowed them)
* general awkwardness and embarrassment 
* it's my wedding ??

&amp;#x200B;

I want to put my foot down. My soon to be mother-in-law will try to bully me into letting him come I know that already. Are my reasons enough to justify me just saying ""no"" ?

I'm pretty much 100% Americanized and worked hard to make a healthy distance from them. We're still close just they don't have a say in what I do anymore or control us with expensive gifts.

We're all in Colorado now and due to houses doubling in price, traffic, staggering pay and underemployment my wife and I want out. My family only looks at the unemployment rate and crime in the CITY, not COUNTY, and keeps throwing it at us. We're in our late 20's and want to start a family, but this market isn't helping us. Wife is from St. Louis and we decided to move back in a couple weeks (she got a job transfer).

My family is now treating me like I've betrayed them and like we've decided moving to North Korea as a better option than Colorado. They're quite racist and  keep telling me all the bad things that will happen to me there (we're moving to like St. Charles or Creve Coeur). In Colorado my wife is an accountant and I'm a business analyst and we're barely making ends meet (we're fiscally conservative).

My father basically hasn't picked up my calls now in over a month and everyone else keeps wishing us these vile backhanded good wishes. They also hint at stuff like you hate us and are moving states that's why (back to my healthy distancing days). Worst part is they believe my wife has tricked me into moving there and it was 1000% my idea. 

My wife's family (lived in St. Louis for 20y+) is here with us in Colorado and is in 100% in support and understands why we're doing it. My family simply treats it like we've decided to throw our lives away for something stupid like... Being able to afford a home before we're 40 and having a family. Being able to have our mortgage be 1/4 of our income (or even 1/6 or better). Not sitting in 1hr of traffic for 15miles. Also the jobs out there pay the same and have far less competition than Colorado. 

We insisted they come out to see it for themselves, but there are too many ""black people"" there for them go they saidüò°... We're about to move in a couple weeks and we don't want to leave on this sour note but we also want to progress with our lives like American dream promised.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 years ago I left my horribly toxic Ex (gaslighting, threatening to kill himself if I left, would have sex with me while I cried and begged him not to leave, said I was lucky he loved me because I'm so fucked up, the works).  He and I were together for about 3 years, and he was there for me after a very traumatic experience, (moved in with me and everything) but I couldn't live with him being like that to me anymore.  As I was breaking up with him, he gave me conditions: that if this was a real break up, I wasn't allowed to date anyone for 6 months, and that I was never allowed to date my best friend (he was jealous of the closeness we had).

Needless to say, I ended up with my best friend, now BF, about a year after I broke up with Ex.  Ex went ballistic when he found out, threatened to stab BF publicly, and ended up bragging about it for a whole year afterwards to every one who knew us.  

I pretty quickly blocked him on all social media soon after this happened, but I didn't get a restraining order on him (I know, that was stupid on my part).  After that, I worked on letting the past go and finding closure within myself.  I even went into therapy for a while.  For a while it was very nice. 

However, he moved in with a friend of mine last year.  My friend was there for my Ex when we broke up, since my Ex actually did try to kill himself.  

My friend has recently been recommending that my Ex help me out with stuff, claiming that it's been years since I spoke with him and that I should be ok with him being in the same space.  

I am not ok with him being in the same space.  I have told my friend this, and he has continuously asked the same question, expecting a different answer.  Since Ex moved in with my friend, I have been constantly scared of my Ex, and how he is (in a tertiary way) still in my life. 

Thing is, this fear of mine has been effecting my current relationship to BF.  

I still feel angry and scared of what my Ex did to me during our relationship, and I am angry that my friend is not respecting my wishes to keep my Ex out of my life.  For that year gap before dating BF, BF helped me work out my feelings about my Ex.  This last year has been a horrible relapse of that fear and anger.  I couldn't get back into therapy due to financial reasons.  I don't want to keep talking about this with BF, because even he is getting tired this, and that he is constantly trying to help me stop being paranoid (I have anxiety issues and PTSD that I have been trying to work on).  I love my BF very much, and I very much want to move past my Ex so I can fully be with my BF.

732,"I remember when I was a kid and my Mom was the community manager for a series I will not name (I don't want her identity exposed) and DeviantArt was the strongest source of finding art of any caliber.

Now that I don't care about whether or not I see two dragons fucking a squirrel dressed as Link, I'd like to use the site to grow as an artist.

And even though my profile obviously only has a couple dozen view and favorites since I just started week ago, my main issue is the fact that it's hard for me to find any smaller artists. I actually want to do my part and encourage other small artists, but even the ""undiscovered"" option only shows people who've already been favorited by 50-60 times and it's all amazing quality.

741,"Serious replies only, please. 

I am extremely socially awkward. In middle school I was the kid who would constantly make weird noises in class, etc. I had no friends up until high school, and at that point the only way I got to talk with new people was by following them around and standing with them when they talked about stuff that i found interesting, occasionally butting in with my own opinion on the topic. This has improved a lot ever since but it's still far from okay. 

I feel like this has ruined my chances at ever having real friends. I mean I have friends, but i'm afraid they only ever hang out with me out of pity. I do occasionally get invited to parties, when I do and get drunk, I start to say weird shit about myself that I feel like literally nobody would openly admit. It's not even because I'm too hammered to think, rather that I have the sudden very strong urge to say something in order to get some sort of appreciation, even if I know it will end with me being laughed at. 

I have previously attempted to help my awkwardness by copying what people I see on the streets do in certain situations and i know that it has helped me a lot but I think the past few months I have gotten worse at social stuff and I see no way to change that. My attempts at behaving normally have turned into finding that by copying others so much I have no real personality traits of my own. 

The worst thing is that copying people only helps me so much, there have been so many situations where I was at wits end as to what to say in that situation and I am sick of it because it always ends with me saying something that's either nonsensical with regard to the context (example: I often choose the wrong words when talking and usually cant end a sentence the way it started, resulting in a grammatically wrong mess of words that makes me sound like im illiterate. 

Can you give me tips on what I can do, please. I don't want to live a life of constant mild anxiety when talking to people. Reflecting on all the weird shit that I say and do really wrecks my confidence and I don't know what to do.

She loves me back however, is not single. We still talk and see each other however, I just don't know if I am wasting my time. I honestly thought of it as a sense of being with the woman I cheated with do make the divorce justifiable. (That sounds low I know, but the depression was so bad I was close to ending it all.)

Ex left everything she had (Corporate Job, Company car, the works) for much less many years ago and now I have just grown successfully while she hit rock bottom.

746,"hello i‚Äôm really not looking to be judged i just really need advice.

for context i‚Äôm diagnosed bpd, i‚Äôm currently working with a therapist and taking medication.

i get extremely anger over the smallest things. i don‚Äôt get irritable‚Äîi go into full fits of rage. i feel this rage throughout my entire body physically. 

an example : last year before i was diagnosed (and before taking medication), my sister put my favorite mug in the sink and i completely spiraled. i got so angry after she refused to take my mug out of the sink (i didn‚Äôt want to touch the dirty dishes, and in my mind she put it in after i told her several times not to, so she should take it out) this resulted in me getting so angry i couldn‚Äôt control myself and got hospitalized.

an example from today : my dog usually has a collar that prevents her from leaving our backyard. (it beeps when she steps outside of the backyard and instead of shocking her it just vibrates‚Äîhowever she doesn‚Äôt like it so she n e v e r crosses the boundaries) well today it randomly stopped working and i didn‚Äôt realize so when my neighbor was walking his dog she started making her way towards him and the dog + barking. (she doesn‚Äôt bite but i can understand that he might not know that and she‚Äôs a yappy small dog.) he knows my family very well so he should know my dog is not the type to bite + he knows she usually has a collar. well today he made an offhand comment like, ‚Äúone of these days i‚Äôm going to get really mad‚Äînot today but one day‚Äù and for some reason this reeeally irked me. while i didn‚Äôt lose my shit at that moment, i started to feel really angry after he left and had extreme urges to break something or self harm. i was telling my brother what happened and i got so angry i started yelling about the situation and almost spiraled. while i‚Äôm proud of myself for not self harming or expressing outward violence‚Äîi keep coming close to doing either of those things.

747,"So,
a friend of mine has a bad relationship with his step-dad. And his mom wants to split with him for my friend. They still have a good relationship though, so they wouldn‚Äôt do it if it wasn‚Äôt for him.
My mother thinks it is because of his drug use. When he argues with his step-dad he gets sent to his real dad where he has more freedom and therefor more acces to said drugs. But I _know_ he doesn‚Äôt go to his dad for the freedom/drug use, as he does the same amount if not more at his own place. 
My mom doesn‚Äôt want to say to my friends mom that he uses drugs without my permission, as i could potentially get in trouble. 

So my problem is in the end; if I don‚Äôt tell my mom she can send that he uses drugs, his parents split. But if I do allow her to send it, he will get in A LOT of trouble and I will too. As he is the type to rattle out my acts if he gets screwed over.
So it‚Äôs screw over my friend and me, or his parents‚Äô relationship.

748,"I don‚Äôt think I love my girlfriend. I think I was very much infatuated by who she used to be about 2 years ago when we first met, but now? I just find her annoying and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad, I just don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre compatible. 

When we first met and started dating everything was great. Our personalities seem to work well with each other. We got along instantly after meeting. We were interested in similar things. 

But I feel like I should‚Äôve tried being friends for a bit longer before we started dating. I think we‚Äôre just very different people who spend time with very different crowds. She‚Äôs a very ‚Äútumblr-y‚Äù person in her attitudes and interests and the way she speaks and how her sense of humour works and such. And none of those things are wrong, it‚Äôs just things that after a while gets on my nerves. Most of my friends are sarcastic, chill. I‚Äôm friends with a bunch of athletes and more extroverted party-going people. She‚Äôs friends with more internet-dwelling introverted people, theatre kids, kids with multi color hairs. sorry if I‚Äôm dwelling to much on stereotypes, but at least in our circles the stereotypes are very true. A lot of her friends do really fit the mold. And both her and I have tried to introduce each other to our own friends and while I‚Äôve been able to get along with them perfectly fine and even consider some of them friends of my own, she just doesn‚Äôt get how to socialize with extroverted, very outgoing people. 

And again, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with any of that. Whatever interests and personality makes you happy, fucking go ahead for it. I have friends that are exactly like what I described, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt mesh as closely with them as I mesh with others. 

And my girlfriend has become more and more like that. A year ago I started finding out that I might be bisexual. I told her and she was super supportive. A few months ago she told me that perhaps she was feeling the same way. I reacted just as supportive and we both know that we won‚Äôt cheat or feel frustrated by being in a hetero relationship while being bi. We communicate a lot about these things.

But anyways, she started dwelling more and more into LGBT tumblr pages and memes and stuff and frankly, the general attitude of the tumblr crowds and memes are very supportive and bubbly or super self deprecating. And she‚Äôs becoming more and more like that. It‚Äôs hard to describe what that general sassy queer tumblr attitude is like but if you‚Äôve ever been on twitter or tumblr you know what I mean. 


In any case, if that‚Äôs your personality then That is fine! It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs not my crowd and vibe and the more time goes on the more I think that maybe we would both be better off with partners that we were more compatible with. 

Like texting is a big thing for me. With my friends, male or female, I joke a lot. We all joke back and forth and we build jokes on top of jokes and keep going and and are sarcastic and have this general attitude that she doesn‚Äôt have. She will unknowingly often cut conversations by replying with simple one word replies because she doesn‚Äôt joke back a lot with her friends in the same way I do with my friends. Or her sense of humor is very ‚Äútumblr‚Äù or very ‚Äúhaha I‚Äôm Gen Z YEET‚Äù and it‚Äôs very unlike mine. 

I want to date my best friend and I just don‚Äôt think my girl and I are that anymore. And she‚Äôs seemingly really in love with me but I keep finding her personality more and more annoying. Ugh 


Anyways, that‚Äôs my situation. I can elaborate more but that‚Äôs the gist of it",04Jul2019,3
749,"hi all, I didn't feel that this was hardcore enough to post to legaladvice but just let me know..... 

I work at the hospital in my town (NC, USA) and I contracted TB from working here. It is latent TB so it's not active or contagious. They put me on medications a little over a month ago. The first set of antibiotics I was taking was about 10 pills, once a week. It was two different antibiotics and one vitamin. This treatment regime was supposed to last three months. I'd go into the clinic and they'd give them to me there. After the second week, I became really ill. It would last that whole day and the next. Same thing happened with the third week. I called out one time during that set of antibiotics. I contacted the nurse who handles my treatment and she contacted the doctor. They discussed and decided to keep me on just one of the antibiotics except I'd take two of the pills daily. This new treatment regime is supposed to last four months. After the first week (last week) I felt ill again. I pushed through my 3 12 hour work days just barely getting by. I contacted my personal doctor thinking maybe it's not the medications. They said the symptoms I'm having are related to me having the latent TB plus the antibiotic they have me on. So, once again, I called my TB nurse. She asked me to come in and have them draw labs (which they did the last time I felt ill) and to stop the medications until she spoke with the doctor. I did the labs and she contacted me by the end of last week telling me that my labs are normal and that the doctor suggested I try this treatment again. She said that if I still end up feeling too ill after that then they are going to put me on the other original antibiotic for NINE months. I'm like woah fuck that so I started the treatment regime again and have been taking it every day. Tuesday I was feeling ill but pushed through. Yesterday I wasn't feeling bad at all throughout the day until I woke up about 1 AM last night feeling so ill. I called out of work because there is no way I could go to work feeling like this. I'm not the type to call out of work. This is the first job where I've called out like I have and I HATE calling out. I don't know what to do. I don't know what my options are. We are allowed to call out six times per calendar year and I've called out three times now-twice because of this horrible medicine that I got because of this job. It's starting to look bad on me for doing this. It's a fucking holiday for god's sake. I can start the other medicine that I will be on for nine months but I don't see that not making me sick either. They're HEAVY medications to kill the disease so it'll never become active. 

I just want to know if I have any options so this doesn't count against me because I'm not calling out for shits and giggles. No one likes to work but I want to keep my job and I can't do my job if this keeps happening. Thanks in advanced",04Jul2019,1

760,"this guy at my work (who im pretty sure is at least 4 or 5 years older than me) has been calling me more pet names like ""love"" and ""gentle bean"" (in regards to how i do certain things. *i work in a pet store, so im obvi really gentle with everything*) he was also teaching me something new and during our conversation he said ""i'd love to cook for you"" and we both kinda laughed it off. it really doesn't bother me that much, but im curious if hes into me or just being friendly ? im trying to not overthink it, so any insight would be helpful ! üôåüèª 

not that this really matters, but i am 18.. making him around 21 or 22 possibly.

i have no problem telling him that the names make me uncomfortable or at least telling someone to talk to him about it, but he is a really respectful &amp; kind person and wouldnt make things weird on purpose. (im not trying to make an excuse for why he's doing this, but thats 100% his personality and the way he was raised especially, along with many of the other guys at my work. they call everyone ""ma'am, miss, sir, etc"") ive just never dealt with someone older before, because i have always been surrounded by guys/girls my age in high school, but now that ive graduated.. im obviously encountering new life experiences that i need to learn how to handle ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (that sounds dumb, but its true)",04Jul2019,1
762,"Recent college drop out here, moved back in with parents a couple months ago, have yet to find a job but have applied for many and gotten past hiring stages. 

So im usually in my room, except when I'm running every other day. I am either just watching Hulu, or doing amazon mechanical Turk to make some money while I try to find employment. I will come out though, for dinner and to watch jeopardy on week nights with my mom, usually when people are over but not for long. Being social is very draining, I'm just maximum comfy and non anxious when I'm alone (except when I'm with peers or my friends. Everyone visiting today was easily 6+ years older than me). 

Anyways, I just didn't come down today. I didn't really say hi, I didn't really do much of anything, just shut up in my room. It's not that I have anything against my family, they all wanted to see me, but there's a few reasons I don't want to be around them. One is they are all always drunk, I can tell when their voices slur. I have nothing against drinking, I get drunk myself about once a week or two. But I don't drink with them, I don't like too because they're not my friends or peers. So I basically end up sitting around 6 annoying drunk adults who have abrasive personalities compared to mine. The other reason is, despite the drinking, they all have pretty successful lives. My brother and his girlfriend make a lot of money and live on her rich parents property. My step sister and her wife as well make a ton of money, own their own home, taking vacations. My mom and step dad although not vacationing often, enjoy their lives and make above $70k combined income. And then there's me, I was kind of set on track to be really successful. I had really good grades in highschool, got a big scholarship from a private university near me. I went and through a combination of being in an emotionally abusive house (commuted to uni when I loved with my bio Dad) which kind of distanced me from school to the point where I didn't meet anyone, and just really losing interest in my major (physics) it took me 2 semesters to realize although I was good at stem and could enjoy it, I just didn't have the mindset for it as much as people I knew. But by that time my grades took enough of a hit from my first and second semester physics courses, as well as other semester 2 classes from me just not showing up (went through very rapid mood swings through college that I just got anxious when thinking about going to class) that I couldn't transfer, remained in that major, got even worse grades, now am suspended and will be dropping out. 

The long and short of it is, I just feel like a loser compared to these people. All I really want in life is a decent paying job I don't hate, I'd rather take less pay and like my job more than vice versa, and a wife I love and some kids. And all of these guys have that, granted not all at 20 but they were on track for something, I'm just completely off the rails here .


So those two factors combine into why I just didn't go down. Some of them came up, I opened the door and said hey to my brother, but to all I said ""I'm not feeling social today, thank you"" from behind my door.

My mother got defensive, and drunk. She came up, banged on my door, tried to get in (she knocks, but regardless of my answer she will come in anyways, so I started blocking my door with a chair and she can't get in, which makes her mad but I want my privacy respected). I told her the same thing, adding that it wasn't their fault and I just am not feeling social. She tried to guilt trip me ""what if we all died tomorrow"" and I could hear the slur in her voice. I didn't budge, she slammed on my door and swore something I didn't hear. 


And an hour later, here I am. I just really don't have any topic of interest in my life to talk to these guys with, I really feel inferior about myself and I feel everyone pitty's me, which I hate. And I don't feel respected like an adult, I'm quite literally the butt of some jokes and it's annoying. I always figured if they weren't my family members, I really wouldn't get along with them. But still, I do love them and don't mind seeing them most times, just not now. 

Am I in the wrong?",04Jul2019,1
