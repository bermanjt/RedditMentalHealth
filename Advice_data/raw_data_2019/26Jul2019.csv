0,"This past spring, I finished my associates degree at a community college with honors, graduating with a 4.0 GPA in a general studies degree. I went to a community college to get a better understanding of ""who I was"" or ""who I wanted to be"" as a person. 

Well, 2 years later and I still don't have those answers. I applied to a university and got in, and they offered me an academic scholarship where I wouldn't have to pay for tuition while attending. However, I've talked to friends about it and they came to the conclusion ""a free degree in what?"". I took a wide variety of courses at my previous community college and I wouldn't say any particularly clicked. 

Fast forward to now, this summer and upcoming fall, it's time for me to make a decision on what is happening next. I have several options that I'll list below. I guess what I'm looking for is some insight from some other minds and take in all the information so I can make the best decision I can. 

I'm from the United States by the way. Wasn't sure if that was clear.

1. Stay in my hometown, continue living at home and attend university for free with no direction in terms of major. (No clue what I'd study, I might FORCE myself to study business)

2. Stay in my hometown, take a year off of school and work full time. This is probably the worst option, because I've been having this growing feeling inside of me that I absolutely need to leave my hometown. A growing number of factors have contributed to this. If I wasn't attending school here, I think I'd want to do anything I could to leave. 

3. Move to somewhere new, work full time there while I ""find myself"". This would include having to pay rent, my own food, etc. I would gain more freedom and life experience while hopefully trying to find things I enjoy and discover ""my passion"". 

4. This one is kind of the same as 3, I would be moving in with grandparents who live on in island. I'd live with them and work full time in the town they live in. This would get me out of my hometown, allow a ton of freedom, give me the ability to care for them in their older age, and I wouldn't have to pay rent/for food/etc. I've always loved spending time where they live and the ocean/mountains have always called to me. 

5. Enlist in the military for four years. This would force me to ""grow up"", I would get paid, travel, and meet people from all over the world who may give insight on what I should do in my life. 

I'm just looking for a little advice here on what to do with the next steps of my life. Any and all is greatly appreciated. Thank you. I'll be active replying to comments as well as DM's if anyone wants to have a conversation about his.",26Jul2019,0
1,"Ever since i could remember.. i have always had a thought that i was a lesbian.. through high school i knew i never mentioned it to anyone. Anyways, i slept around with a couple of boys to proof myself i'm straight.. clearly didn't work out. I fell in love with this girl when i was 17 and it was the most amazing feeling ever.  Blablabla, anyways.. onto the next, i fell in love with an another girl and i knew at that point i was gay and not bi. I came out to my mum about 2 years ago and she told me she already knew. ( so supportive ). 
I have found myself attractive to a fem-to-male trans people which makes me confused?? Also.. there are boys in my work place and we have a banter/flirting???- i found myself being attractive to this guy and i'm always happy and nervous around him.. idk? What does that mean? - basically.. can't even imagine myself with a guy ever again and thinking of  *male parts* makes me wanna gagg LOL HELP ME ?",26Jul2019,2
3,"Before I start off I really love my mom she is very supportive of everything I want to do \[most of the time\]

but ever since I was younger whenever I felt sad I would be shamed for it by her, it started off simple by her telling me that I should be ashamed for crying in school for feeling upset or when I had a full break down during p.e class for the whole double and I couldn't stop sobbing for no reason but I'm not going to lie I was a bit of a cry baby back in the day but whenever she would say something like that it would just cause more upset she talked to me like you would to a five-year-old and she called me a burden and ungrateful whenever we were in an argument or she wanted a rise out of me in one.

she told me I could talk to her about anything and when I was about 10 I started having awful thoughts about self-harm and suicide I have no idea where they came from this led me to spiral and I didn't know any better but to reach out to a teacher this was because she kept telling us that we could tell her anything so I did and when my mom found out that I told her that I was thinking about harming myself she brushed it off as something for attention and told her I couldn't hurt a fly.

mind you I don't remember any of this except the car ride on the way home that was full of shouting and tears, because the school was concerned for my wellbeing when I was 11 they had a counselor that didn't have a degree so it was like talking to a person that just looked at you and couldn't do anything but stuff you with food and talk to you about school.

this was supposed to help me and i remember the day I broke down I started crying hysterically in his room and spewing out things about how I didn't want to be here anymore and about how I wanted to jump off a building that's the only part I remember after this break down the school grew more concerned and called my mother to force her to go visit a specialist.

when we were in the car she kept on shouting and screaming about how I should stop faking it for attention and how she knew I was only doing it for attention and how she raised me and pays for me and this is how i repay her this continued for another 20-30 minutes before we reached the place and they put in an appointment when we went to it a couple of days later I went with a smile on my face because I didn't want to upset my mother who was already done with my bullshit and kept calling me names like low-life and other things.

they took me separately at first and asked me questions about my household and if I live with my father and how I get along with him I kept up a happy face and answered everything with a cheer in my voice she finished and we went into the same room as my mother which to this day I don't want to remember once we were together in that room they asked me more uncomfortable questions such as did i want to harm myself and did i harm myself something along those lines and I answered them all with a no even if I did.

they asked my mother questions which I can't remember but after that, they told me to fill in sheets and head home nothing came of it.

I know this is a weird rant to go on this happened years ago and there is more to the story afterward but I'm going to go onto different aspects after this happened.

since I referenced before that my mother told me I could talk to her about everything I decided that I'm going to trust her with that basically I was at school and in school I was horrible at math its not like I have any disability but I'm just awful at it I could never understand how the clock worked and when I made it back to class there were questions on the board and the teacher told us she has a question for each of us.

I freaked out since I could only read one of the clocks she had drawn up on the board and so I desperately wanted to answer that one and if I couldn't I wanted to escape to the bathroom so I had my hand up in the air and I was sweating like crazy after it was my turn and I couldn't answer so i awkwardly sat in my seat and waited until another kid in class answered it for me I could feel my entire face flare up because of embarrassment and I barely got out to the bathroom because my head was dizzy it was spinning like crazy I was in the stall and I felt hot and cold chills on my body I was frozen unblinking I stared ahead and tears slipped out I felt shortness of breath and I knew I couldn't be in the bathroom for too long so I forced myself to calm down and headed back to class.

when i told my mom of this happening in school while we were both eating ice cream outside she didn't offer me any advice I'm pretty sure she told me that it happens or something similar and told me if it happens again to tell her which I never did because when I woke up and couldn't go to school because I was covered in tears and I just felt wrecked she mocked me by doing exaggerated heavy breathing and shaky hands.

I love my mom very much and even though there is more to the story I think this gives the idea I don't know if I'm at fault or if my mom is personally I'm unsure I wish I could understand as I really feel guilty for causing my mother this much trouble as a child.

any feedback would be wonderful

4,She’s treated her past boyfriends really badly and is often very childish and self centred. I know for a fact it would end in disaster but for some stupid reason I can’t get her out of my head. Does anyone have any advice to overcome this?

7,"Let me start out by saying she wasn’t a constant addict, it was not an everyday thing for her, she only wanted it when we went out to parties. Regardless, I still believe anybody who feels that they need to use illicit substances at any given time is an addict. With that being said, onto the story that lead me to breaking our friendship. 

Her and I weren’t even friends who an entire year. We met at a rave, her and I are really big in the rave and festival scene and it was a huge aspect of our friendship. She very quickly became my best friend. The first best friend I had had in an extremely long time. When she’s sober she seriously one of the most intelligent, funny, thoughtful, caring, most well put together and helpful person I had ever met. I can honestly say she felt like my soul mate and we were partners in crime. We could talk to each other about anything and we always stopped what we were doing to help the other. For the first few months of our friendship she was trying to stay clean and even ask me to help her avoid her drug of choice(coke) when we went to raves and festivals. She did really good saying no and staying away from people she knew would offer it to her, until Christmas. Her and I had gone to a rave because and I had just went through a very nasty breakup with my boyfriend at the time. We were both pretty drunk and made friends with a group of guys we had just met. Later in the night they offer us some coke. My friend looked at me and asked if I wanted to try it. I’m not sure what I was thinking but I said yes. At this point in my life, I had never done it. I guess it was a mixture of drunkenness, being broken hearted and just being plane dumb. So we both did it. A few raves later and a few more stupid decisions to do coke with my friend later I realized I hated the way it made me feel and swore off the stuff. My friend however continued to do it. I realized I hated the way she acted on it. She became the complete polar opposite of the person I met.  

Flash forward a few months and her and I went to our first festival together with a huge group of friends a few states away from where I live. The trip started out great, however the further we got from home the more paranoid and snappy she became. I found out this is because she had a decent size amount of coke in the car with us and was scared of getting pulled over and getting caught. During the drive we kept getting into tiny arguments and kept having lots of miscommunication which is something I had never experienced with her before. Later on in the night and we’re at the festival, my friend is obviously high and is being a major bitch to me. She would tease me and when I would try to give it back to her she seemed offended. Usually her and I have the type of humor where we were constantly busting each other’s balls and no harm was done. She pretty much ditched me and avoided me the entire night because of this. 
We finally make it back to the hotel and she’s basically calling me gross because I made out with one of the guys in the group and she ended up ditching me again and left me at the hotel with her other friends. They come back with a ton of people I don’t know after we had agreed to not invite new people into the room without a group consensus. One of the guys she brought back and was super creepy. Be basically kept accusing us of having drugs and just wouldn’t give him any. The guy ended up grabbing me and tried to dance on me as I was leaving to go to bed. At this point I was finished. I packed all my things, waited for everybody to go to bed, got an Uber to the bus station and took the next bus home. 

I left because I felt like she put me in a position that made me unsafe. I left because I felt like the drug brought out her true self and she was just my friend because she had no other friends in our state either. I left because I couldn’t stand the way she acted and the person she became when she was on the stuff. I was hurt, I was honestly heart broken because I knew I was losing my best friend by doing this. 

Ever since then I’ve been craving to have her friendship. I miss the sober version of her. I miss having her counsel when nobody else understood how I was feeling. I honestly just freaking miss everything about her but I just worry she wouldn’t receive my attempts to rekindle the friendship very well. To be honest I don’t even know how to go about trying to rekindle things....

I’m sorry if this is so long and hard to understand. I tried to condense it the best I could. Thank you so much in advance for any advice on the situation.",26Jul2019,1
8,"Hey Reddit !

So I’m in need of some financial and job advice ASAP!! About 3 months ago I had to quit my job of 2 1/2 years to go and help support my elderly and sick grandma (don’t regret this as she needed it ) the problem is I had to do this since she lived 5 states away and needed someone to live with her . All that aside , I’ve been struggling to find any work . Idk if it is due to where I’m from (northerner in the south ) or what but I’ve never had this many problems . I’ve been faced with bills getting close and no money to pay them including car insurance and other necessities. Idk what it is but Ive applied to over 40 places now , called and followed up with everyone ranging from entry level minimum wage to decent paying work . As for experience , I have 2 years as a warehouse manager and 3 as a general laborer . I’m experience in customer service , purchasing , inventory management and receiving . But I can’t even get a job at Taco Bell . 

This brings me to my question ,  could it be due to where I’m from , if so how do I combat this (   I’m a white guy from the north with a heavy “Jersey/NYC accent “ ) . Also what are things I can do for money that don’t require a job just to makes ends meet ( I’ve tried Door Dash it didn’t work out and can’t do Uber/Lyft because my car is to old ) . Any advice is appreciated !! Also if you think their is an underlying issue I don’t know then feel free to say , I take constructive feedback well . 

Sorry for shit grammar and spelling , doing this on my phone .",26Jul2019,2

10,"So I am just finishing up a graphic design diploma. As part of my last semester I had to complete around 200 hours of unpaid work at an internship. I found a company I thought I was excited about!

I have a few reasons that I was uncomfortable with the company and didn't enjoy my time. For one, I didn't receive much guidance or feedback, and I'd often make social media posts or work hard on something that went unused, but I know that's just the nature of being an intern at a marketing/design firm.

It also felt like mean girls sometimes. Some of the girls on the design team would coordinate wearing a certain colour/pattern on certain days, and exclude me. They'd go and take pictures for instagram (all while getting paid) while I stayed inside and worked... for free. 

I was there for two months, and people came and went like I have never seen before... to the point where I would be working in a different spot almost every week. Some people may have quit/been fired but either way it didn't feel right.

Some days I got along with people really well but other times it all felt fake to me and overall a kind of toxic environment. My host (the creative director) may or may not have been talking about me behind my back, but was often nice to me face to face. I heard her whispering in her office to somebody once about how ""I really don't like her"". I'm not sure if she was talking about me or not. This was on my second or third day, and I had done nothing wrong? But she may have been talking about somebody else. Either way it made me feel anxious that there was so much gossip and whispering going on next to where I was working.

I took some time off for being sick/unable to make it in, I was also working two jobs to pay my bills while I did the unpaid internship and it was all very overwhelming and did in fact affect my mental health.

Anyways, to top it off... my host sent me an email and said when I felt ""more comfortable"" to take on the hours I was welcome to come back when I was ready. I talked to my program coordinator about the toxic environment and she told me she would pass me and to just wrap things up and look for paid work.

I emailed a thank you letter to the director, and was very polite and thanked them for hosting me and allowing me to learn more about the design agency environment.

I received no reply, and a few of the employees have unfollowed me on instagram even though I did nothing wrong. (Not that this entirely matters but the anxious me unfortunately cares about stupid things).

I updated my resume yesterday and added the internship regardless of whether or not it was a negative experience because it still counts in my mind.

I just wondered if anyone had any advice on where to go from here after an internship went sour, or if anyone has had similar experiences that could help me stop thinking negatively about the entire experience.",26Jul2019,0

13,"Hi Reddit. I really need help and some advise.

My girlfriend of 6 years is everything in the world to me. I think we've had a very good relationship and we connect on so many levels. Shes always battled with depression and bad anxiety. However the past 6+ months have been an all time low for her, shes lost friends thinks she has no sense of direction and just cant think straight about anything. Last night she admitted her self into a mental health ward for about 6 hours.

When she got home she told me all about it then dropped them bomb that she just wanted a week of space. She say's she just needs time to herself to think about what she wants. She said we've been pretty much together everyday for 6 years now since we were 18 and she just needs to know what its like to have space from me. She promises she still loves me and we spent the night together, I barley slept just held her all night wishing it would never end. However tonight I'll be finding somewhere else to stay for a week.

Now I'm not the best boyfriend I have flaws, I'm overly needy and clingy a lot of the time while shes always been sort of independent it never really been a problem until recently. Our intimacy has pretty much dropped off a cliff the past 8 months. Now dont get me wrong we would always cuddle but that was pretty much it. We've probably had sex less than 10 times the past year but she's also had to go off the pill for medical reasons. Maybe once a week or so she would do somethings to me and the rare occasion I could do something to her. She also doesn't seem to like making out anymore just little kisses. Like it wasn't always like this, we used to always crave each other. We have talked about it she just said she's not really into that stuff anymore and doesn't feel a need for it. I know things change and people change I just cant help but think this depression has just taken over and is a part of it.

Literally not even a week ago she was telling me she loves me while we were cuddled up just lying together. I'm just hoping this a is a phase for her and we can make it past it. I feel like I do so much for this girl and I just don't know what I've done to cause this.

Just to mention about two years ago we had a big fight and she wanted a break but that was over things I was doing in the relationship and I've mended those and become a much better person because of it.

I'm sorry to ramble there's so much I want to say but I cant. I just need advise on how to handle this. I have no one else to go to, not even sure where I'm going to stay. I'm shaking feeling physical pain, I'm overloaded with anxiety.",26Jul2019,0

I feel like she's giving me really clear signs, but im honestly a little insecure, so I'm still a little shaky on whether she likes me or not.

Also, do you think she actually really likes me? Here's what I've been working with:

- She always wants to walk with me whenever I go anywhere
-She laughs at everything I say, and she remembers really small jokes and remarks I made from months earlier
-She stares at me any time anything notable happens in class, waiting to see my reaction
-She calls me all the time for stuff she really doesn't need to call for
-I studied with her one time for about an hour, the next day this other girl asked me to tutor her, and she turned to me and said "" I hope she's not stealing my study partner, haha"" and laughed really loudly and leaned over on me for a sec

I started talking to her when I was with a group of friends who didn’t want to talk to her and I was the only one who wouldn’t ignore her. Soon she began hunting after me when I would get to school. She would wait by a building and when I walked through the gate she would run over and start talking. And I mean *talking* . She doesn’t ever stop, she’ll talk the entire time even if I’m trying to have a conversation with someone else she’ll run over and start talking over the convo. Anyways fast forward to now, I started school (I’m in yearround school) and had slightly forgotten about where she waits to find me. As I walked in she ran over to me and began talking about her cousin or something and went on and on, not letting me talk to my friends who I hadn’t seen over our summer break. Then when it game time to go to classes, she happened to share *the exact same dance class as me* . She continued to walk and talk to me as we walked to the classroom and sat down. The teacher took role and as soon as she finished she started talking even more. She literally talked the entire hour of class to me and then to my friend, while we were trying to have a conversation about homework and other stuff. I’ve tried to be nice about it and tell her I’m talking to someone or I’m busy and she doesn’t stop. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t have a conversation with people as long as she is around.

26,"So I've been pursuing Acting and Music, in one form or another, for quite a while now. I've done all the food service jobs, tons of gig economy stuff, and while it gets me by I'm very very very over it. I've started trying to look at more ""career-based"" options while still pursuing what I actually want to do, but have found out that almost nothing appeals to me. Even jobs related to Acting/Music, like working the camera, or sound, or engineering, or an office-based position aren't things I want to do. I tried web/graphic design and marketing, since you can still be creative in those, but stopped after that path became just as awful as the food/gig economy stuff was.

The other thing that interests me is comics (illustrating, writing, creating), but I've barely even worked on that at all because there's only so much work I can fit into my days that doesn't pay me anything.

I sat down and tried to really figure out my ""Ikigai"" for a bit, but couldn't really think of anything to put in it except my passions (for those who don't know what that is here is an image: https://imgur.com/a/WTUitgp it's a Japanese term for finding out what you should do that will both be fulfilling to you personally and also beneficial to the world).

I've scoured posts on Reddit for a long time looking for jobs that may be of interest, but even in those ""weird job"" or ""I didn't know that was a job"" type posts nothing actually appeals to me.

We never got to the stage of dating but ended the weird relationship and stayed friends. We got to kissing back then. So then after we were just friends for a while and then she came along into the friend group. She and I got pretty close and then after some time, she told me she had feelings for him. Not long after, he and I were just hanging out and he initiated something that led to us having sex and I know it was wrong of me to not say no but it happened.

(Sorry for the bad grammar, my eyes kinda hurt).

 A few minutes ago I got into a fight with my brother. Here's some backstory: my brother hates everyone in our family. We all try to say hes shy but in reality he just doesn't like us, dude hates all my cousins too. Idk what we did to make him like this, but we haven't ever had a good relationship tbh. He doesn't talk to anyone, cusses at our parents and grandparents alike, even over the smallest annoyances. He just now slammed into my room and yelled at me to go do something, that my parents asked him to do. Me being annoyed told him to screw off (bad move), and closed the door. He slammed it open and I slammed it closed. After a back and forth of cussing we kinda just fought. Problem starts here: I don't like hitting, as I'm afraid of the consequences, so when he started punching me, I kinda just head locked him and let him do his thing. He punched me scratched one of my eyes, and also threatened to break my laptop and items in my room. Eventually, my grandmother came in and stopped us. He isn't that strong and he can't really fight, and I'm much bigger too, but I'd hate for me to make him bleed. Did I do the right thing? I was angry, but I don't want him to get hospitalized in case I do something stupid.",26Jul2019,0

39,"All right, this is a long one, and I’m sure there’s multiple ways of framing this issue. Still, I can only lay out my point of view. 

My mom and I have always had a pretty good relationship during my school and college years. What I'm only starting to realize now is that this was due to me subordinating to her. Problems arouse once I met my girlfriend (of 5 years by now). Naturally, part of that involves going out, spending money, having a good time together. Well, my mother has access to my online banking account and can and *does* apparently trace all my income and spending (mind you, I’m 25, and she still does that as I found out today). I’m not even sure why I gave her access in the first place, but I was 18 back then and probably didn’t think too much of it.

Making matters worse is the fact that she refuses to stop giving me €600 every month, which I have asked her to stop doing multiple times. I work as a freelancer alongside being almost done studying and make about €1,000, which will likely increase to 2,000+ a month once I commit full time. It’s fulfilling and I love it, and combined with my girlfriend's smaller income, we should get by okay-ish without these €600.

Now, the weird thing is, me spending money on stupid stuff I didn’t even need and beer was never a problem to her back when I was 20-21ish. But once I started investing in my relationship with my girlfriend at that age, she became wary, already saying that my partner would only be after me for my money. Well, hers, partly, I guess. But she would still refuse to stop providing me, even though my girlfriend and me could’ve easily managed to get by ourselves in our (back then) new flat.

Because of her legal status, my girlfriend does have some financial issues, that’s true. But she’s trying her best to contribute to our relationship financially, always offering to pay for things (and indeed paying for way too many things considering her situation IMO), so she’s obviously not some gold digger. She feels bad about me spending money on her. She's loving and caring, and so unbelievably attentive and understanding.

Recently, we moved further away to a big city. I gotta be honest here: It was my girlfriend’s idea, mainly. I think I wouldn’t have decided to move there if I were on my own. But that’s how life is, and I fully support the move, even though I first was really scared of moving that far away from home. Big parts of my freelance work allow me to be location agnostic, so I thought I would give it a try. And thus far, it has turned out great. Plus, the city provides both of us a plethora of job opportunities, especially my girlfriend, who wanted to go there for two opportunities. She would either study there or she would work, depending on how her legal status would pan out. It turns out she got a spot to major in the field she’s wanted to get for a while.

I’m visiting home at the moment, and my mother started confronting me right away when I told her (well, she asked, demanding to know what my girlfriend is up to). “Okay, so you’ll end up paying for everything now, now that woman has you in the spot she wanted you. You let yourself become subordinate to her. She’s also making you buy clothes at an online retailer.” Well jokes on you, I wanted shop there myself, and why are you still looking through my finances, I thought.

Another factor that comes into play here are my grandparents, whose health sadly is declining. I want to be there and support them, and I’ve announced that I’d be available to hop on a train at moment’s notice to support them. But whenever their health is declining, I’m not informed. Heck, one time I visited spontaneously it turned out my grandpa was in hospital! No one in my family thought of telling me. 

So, I guess part of the problem is communication. I never communicated the exact reasons why my girlfriend and me were moving, in fear my mother would react in the way she did react right now, in the end. At the same time, she doesn’t communicate problems or feelings on her part, and only grows angry, bitter, and confrontational while not being interested in finding a solution.

And, this reminds me, these problems didn’t even start with my girlfriend. She’d always badmouth my friends. “No, this one is never punctual, oh, he just comes around whenever it fits his schedule, he’s not good for you.” Maybe part of the reason why I never had many friends until college? Also, I can’t quite remember, but I think I wasn’t ever quite allowed to just go out and play as a child, and once I grew old enough to rebel, I’ve already grown to feel comfortable in front of my computer.

&amp;#x200B;

What advice am I looking for? Well, I’m stuck. I feel stuck. I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel happy, I feel stressed out, I feel like I owe my mother and need to run far, far, far away at the same time. I constantly need to fight the toxic gold digger thoughts she’s trying to implant on me. Sometimes I feel like I should just leave the country, so I don’t have to deal with this shit anymore. I feel like whenever I try to make my own decisions, they’re wrong in my mother’s eyes. And this carries into my social life, my relationship to my girlfriend, heck, even my professional life, with me never wanting to decide anything, always waiting for feedback or others’ initiatives, being indecisive.

Which is exactly the problem. I’m not a confrontational person. I just *HATE* conflicts. I’d rather avoid them as long as possible, maybe stirring them and making them worse, instead of engaging right away. And when I do get confronted by someone, I get defensive and apologetic right away, not able to grasp clear thoughts, and not being able to stand my man.

What can I do to finally fix this mess? Please help me. And thanks for taking your time reading this mess of a text.

TL;DR: My controlling mother, who doesn't stop providing me money even though I asked her to multiple times, claims my girlfriend is a gold digger for ""dragging"" me along her to another city, and I don't have the balls to fight back against my mother and live my own life.",26Jul2019,0
40,"I just graduated from high school, and am entering college next month. My close friend group from high school has officially “dropped” me; they made a new group chat minus me and they’ve started hanging out without me and posting it on social media. 

Part of this is my fault; I’ve been struggling with depression and often find it too much energy to participate in texting in the group chat. I end up replying a few hours later. They pretty much accepted it and everything was fine until like the week before school ended in June. Also, they always text about something that I have zero interest in but they all have interest in. They have a slightly different sense of humor and talk about things I’m not interested in (but somehow we’re friends, don’t ask). 

One of the friends is my close friend (let’s call her A) and I confided things I didn’t really want to tell the whole group about to her. And she confided some stuff to me back. It’s one of my most valued friendships, but here’s where it started to go bad. 

I got involved with a guy, and was figuring out my feelings towards him. A became friends with him because he wanted to talk to her about me, and I would confide to A how I was figuring out my feelings. The guy was taking me to prom, and I was 70% sure I wasn’t attracted to him but honestly this was my first romantic foray and I didn’t know what I was doing. I told A I didn’t really like him in that way. But I didn’t want to lose my prom date right before prom (immature, I know) so I told him after prom that I didn’t want to date him. Then A and another friend in the group accidentally texts our group chat talking about me and how I led him on. Clearly they had a different group chat all along where A was filling them in on how my relationship was going. I never told her not to tell them, and I really didn’t care if she told them or not, but the fact that they were essentially just talking about me behind my back like that in a negative way really bothered me. 

I confronted them, and A and the other friend who had texted were genuinely sorry about it and apologized over and over again. They said it wouldn’t happen again. I forgave them quickly and moved on. 

Then I see my friend’s phone a month into summer and see that they keep texting in the group chat that was made to talk about my relationship, except they texted less and less in the original one I was in. The name of the group chat was something I said when I was confronting them, and it was in a “funny” way. If I were included in the chat, I would’ve found it funny too but I wasn’t. I don’t know if they moved to a different group chat on purpose or if they just kept texting about the common interest they had, and just didn’t feel the need to text the original chat and it just stayed that way, but it’s obvious they don’t really care about me. 

Honestly I’m ready to let all of those friends go (I didn’t have a ton in common with them and they weren’t the best friends anyway) except A. A is one of my closest friends and I have a bond with her that is really difficult to find with literally anyone else. Like she gets me, and we have a similar sense of humor and interests, etc. A really rare kind of friend that I’ve struggled to find throughout my life. I’m really reluctant to let her go, even though she’s hiding the existence of the group chat from me and asking me why I don’t hang out with them anymore (she’s in a different country right now). As if she doesn’t know that I’m not part of the group anymore. 

If she were here, I know that she would include me in hangouts but it hurts that she won’t fight for me to be in the group chat. I know what this sounds like, like A is a terrible friend but she has truly had her moments as a great friend and has always been there when I needed her. So many times. And I’m grateful for her, but I know that if I confront her about it, it’ll cause drama and hurt me and will make it awkward between us and our friends. Because if they add me back to the gc it’s obvious it’ll be because they got caught, not because they actually want me there.

43,"Hello community,

As it does for many, the ess is hitting the fan for me really hard all at once. 

I graduated with an MPA degree in May and it’s been really difficult to find a job in the public sector (my goal) or to find something that my skills apply to in the private sector. I’ve been getting a lot of first and second interviews but I think my lack of actual experience makes me a less desirable candidate. It’s the classic “can’t get jobs without experience, can’t get experience without jobs” situation except I can’t even seem to find anything at the most basic entry levels. 

I’m still in the town where I went to grad school and I have been working at a popular coffee chain full time to pay my bills but I’m not making enough to save for a move anywhere. My lease is up in 6 days and after that I have nowhere to go. I’ve asked my friends who are still in town and no one can house me (and my dog) at all. I don’t have enough money for an Airbnb alone. The good news is that I have a place to keep all my boxes and things for free- I just can’t stay there myself. 

I’m not sure what I can do or what is going to happen when my lease ends. I can’t afford to stay and I can’t afford to leave. I want to get out of my grad school town but I’m worried that I will move somewhere where I also won’t find a job. 

I feel like such a wreck and that I’ve made a huge mess of my life. I feel like a failure for working as a barista with a grad degree and I’m very anxious about being homeless. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you get through it?",26Jul2019,0
44,"I should start by explaining that I'm homeless currently not by choice and for about 8 months now. I know that some people choose a life style of being a van/car dweller, but that is not my intention. At the moment I am or was living in my car until early this morning.

After I got off work last night I was headed to the gym to shower and then sleep. My car stuttered and then died while driving. I purchased a roadside assistance add-on when I got my car a couple years ago since it came with my extended warranty. I decided to call them and was told a tow would be there shortly.

Within maybe 15 minutes a tow truck showed up, and me being a dumb anxious fool didn't really verify he was the tow truck I called for. He did ask ""if I called for a tow"" and now when I think about it he probably just wanted to make sure he got it done before the actual tow showed up. He had me sign some forms and I know I'm stupid for not reading them, but yeah I just signed it. As we drove in his truck I even explained my situation and he seemed like he cared, and even asked if I wanted to be dropped at a shelter or something since he had to tow it to their storage lot and a mechanic would look at it when they opened.

Eventually I got to the gym and washed away the fast food smells from my job and took a nap.

When I woke up this morning I took a few buses and got to their lot only to realize that the company was not affiliated with the roadside company I called. Nothing was covered and I was on the hook for $200. I don't have that to my name right now, and it will be another week before I'm paid. They're holding my car/home hostage and are going to charge me another fee everyday for ""storage"". 

I know this is my fault for being so stupid, but I just can't take another hit like this in life. The past year of my life has been nothing, but a downward spiral. A lot of it was due to my poor choices and letting my depression/anxiety get the best of me. I lost everything. My sister's suicide was a huge trigger for me and I truly didn't handle it well. Even after taking time off, my performance severely declined at work and I really lost myself. I lost my home, my job and even my fiance. These last few months I've really pushed myself just to try again and only recently got a mediocre job so I could start saving to get a place to live again. I needed goals and i was trying, but having this happen is just taking 100 steps backwards. 

That car is the one thing I have left in my life and I can't take that huge of a hit on just giving up. I also can't afford to pay $200 and definitely can't afford $200+fees next week. I'm worried it will be impossible to get back from. 

All I want is to get my car back as quickly as possible. I need transportation and a safe place to sleep. I've already tried contacting police only to be told it's a civil matter. What they did may or may not be legal, but I just want to get my car and fight it later. I really need some advice. Please help me.",26Jul2019,18

46,"Hi! To start out I’m gonna give some background so you can easier understand the situation.
My ex is 18. He knows where I live and I know where he lives, he lives close. My best friend (now ex best friend) is still friends with him through all of this.
Throughout the relationship I was struggling with my depression and how it made me react to things which unfortunately he had to witness and I regrettably did take some of it out on him. 
A few days before our breakup we had a messy FaceTime call and it got ugly. I was in the worst mindset I’d ever been in and he was very angry about how my depressive spirals have affected him. It turned into him screaming at me that it’s my fault my mom can’t hang out with her friends and it’s my fault I have depression and I need to just be happier. Me being the lonely shit I was decided to keep telling him how I was going to fix it by taking small steps and he kept screaming at me that none of it was good enough. I stupidly stayed in the relationship for the rest of the week while my mom had me under surveillance to make sure I don’t hurt myself since I was at a 3 (a danger to myself), thank god she’s an amazing mom. 
I am now unable to imagine a man’s touch without the feeling of being verbally abused so for now I’m identifying as a lesbian until I can make that feeling go away.
After the breakup we decided to stay friends, and my best friend told me all of the things my ex said about me behind my back.
Recently a situation happened where my ex severely screwed my best friend and I over and I told him never to contact me again.

The thingy that happened:

A few days ago I got a text from my ex (I forgot to block him on iMessage) and it was a video of me and him and he said “this video still makes me laugh”. Me being the angry dick I am I told him the relationship made me gayer, he has a very fragile ego so I thought it would be funny to bruise it a little. Blocked him. Thought nothing of it.

Which was a mistake.

There’s this girl I like on Instagram, I tell my best friend about it a lot. All is well. Then I get a follow from an account. Thought nothing of it. Then I noticed the username had my crush’s username in it. I clicked on the profile and it was pictures of my ex. I looked at the caption and it was almost the exact text I sent him before I blocked him. Which means it’s either him or one of his friends he showed, since none of his enemies would know my account. I do more digging and found he followed me, my crush, and other random people. He even commented on her posts in the way I do but cringier and it made her uncomfortable. 
How he found out about my connection to her, I have no idea. I suspect my best friend let it slip even though he says he didn’t, I don’t trust him. I had to warn my crush about the account and she understood because she was dealing with something similar. Got a bunch people to report it for spam and it got deleted. I don’t feel safe. He has a tendency to torment people who’ve “wronged” him, I know that very well. He knows where I live and he has access to a firearm. 
I don’t know what to do if he does something like that again or something worse. I draw the line at him bringing my friends into his ego issues, they don’t deserve that. 
I’ll literally take any advice on this, preferably not stuff that’s “well why did you do that”, I just need anything I can do or say if he decides to go further and torment me and my friends. Blocking him apparently isn’t going to stop him. 
I’m sorry if this seems like I’m overreacting, I just want him out of my life so I can live in peace and forget about him and continue to improve my mental health.

55,"Sorry if this is a long post, but I feel there's lots to explain. I'm 15 years old and working on getting my driver's permit. My mom seemed super eager to be my instructor, but every time anything minor happens (I've never been in an accident or even came close to being in one), she freaks out and acts like I almost got into a crash. I'll give an example from earlier today. I was driving to the dollar store and everything was going mostly okay (she got mad at me for going 3 miles under the speed limit, but she was relatively calm other than that). Whenever I pulled into the dollar store parking lot, I had pulled into a parking spot and realized that I wanted to pull into a different parking spot due to the way the car next to me was parked. After asking for my mom's permission to do so and  checking for people and cars, I slowly backed out of my parking space and into a new one, she starts to flip her lid, yelling for me to cut my wheels into the parking spot (which I was already doing). This kind of stuff happens nearly every time I drive with her and it doesn't ever happen with my dad. I wanted my dad to be my driving instructor, but he's way too busy with work. I love my mom to death and want her to be my driving instructor, seeing that the only alternative is sending me to driver's ed, which is extremely inconvenient for the both of us. Every time I try to talk to her about it, I feel like I'm being more adult than she is. I always start by apologizing for whatever it was that made her freak out and my reaction to her, but as soon as I mention how we were both at fault for x situation or argument and how we both need to take steps to resolve our problems, she starts telling me that it wasn't her fault and that I can't ""shift all of the blame onto"" her, which is definitely not what I'm doing. Any advice on how I could maybe resolve tension between the two of us?",26Jul2019,0
56,"Hey, I'm a 13-year-old girl and generally quite normal. But, I often, almost all the time, feel like hurting somebody. 

As an example, today it was very hot in the place where I live, and my sister asked me to open our bedroom door so the room doesn't get stuffy (with the heat and all) and I did but forgot about it and closed it again. Anyway, she comes home screeching about how I'm selfish and a b*tch. Then 15 minutes ago (it's the middle of the night here) she came storming out her part of the room (our room was divided into 2) and forced me to open my window and opened my door and said I couldn't close it. I get insecure when my door is left open so I tell her to close it and she's like ""no"" and then I tell her jokingly, ""oh if a murderer comes and murders me you'll feel sorry"" because my door faces the big, dark corridor. And she says ""I won't feel quilty, f*ck you"" and then I began to get really hot and suddenly I just started getting really really angry and thinking of ways to kill her and how I wouldn't care if I killed her and I wouldn't care that I would get in trouble.

 I feel this almost all the time, even with the people I love. I get angry easily but I suppress it, because I think of the consequences. I get into this twisted state of mind, where i have f*cked up fantasies about killing people. And the weird thing is I enjoy it.

I went up to the table and heard the teacher talking to the girl in front of me about AP Psych and other scheduling. So, of course, I thought I could ask about it too.
I asked him about scheduling and then about AP Psych, and he gave me a weird look. He pointed to a schedule without the course and said, “well I would recommend this one.” After he said it he kinda ignored talking about AP Psych with me afterwards.

62,"If you are reading this thank you for taking the time to do so. I don't know where to start, I have a lot of things to say on this anonymous post which is the only pace I have ever truly opened up.

 I feel like I am a very closed off person as a result of the bullying I have been subject to from my own family and classmates from a very young age until today. I live with people who wait for me to make a mistake/ not look good/ show any sign of vulnerability so that they can make me feel ashamed or embarrassed. That has led me to become a very anxious and insecure person especially when it comes to my physical appearance. I can't help but obsess about how ugly I feel, I had body acne for 6 years before my parents let me take Accutane and now I have disgusting acne scars all over my body for which I will forever resent my parents, I have stretch marks I got after losing a lot of the weight I put on while I was depressed, I have rosacea and get very red, not to mention very thin hair and fat cheeks, I have man boobs that can only be removed via surgery... I cringe at the sight of myself and hate myself and my parents for never doing anything about it despite me begging them to. They just tell me to accept myself irregardless and no person can look perfect and that I should be contempt with looking normal. They are very stubborn and do not care 1% about how I feel, but I'm sure they will regret these decisions when they are old and dependent on me (I'm sure I won't be taking the high road when its time for me to take care of them and will treat them with the same neglect they have given me my whole life).

My parents never took care of me except financially, its like they gave me a roof, food, and an education, and that their job as a parent was done, they never cared to raise me and my sibling in a friendly environment where we could be honest and have open conversations, where I could invite my friends over or have a sleepover, where not every single family dinner ends with screaming and fighting. I feel like I never had a parent present to help me in my time of need or when I'm having a personal crisis.

I have no friends and spend most of my time at home alone, I feel like the best years of my life are passing me by and that the way my life played out has prevented me from ever feeling like I can be myself and be happy at the same time. I feel like the rest of my life won't be any better, as a person who cannot accept the way they look and the way they are how am I supposed to live a productive life and do something that matters or at least be happy? No one in my family knows my favorite movie/food/songs/... No one really knows who I am and no one wishes me a happy birthday or a happy new year or anything for the matter. I am alone in life and have no one but myself. I feel like my upbringing has tainted both my personality and my appearance for life.",26Jul2019,0
63,"To preface I have struggled a long time with BDD (Body Dysmorphia Disorder) and Major Depressive Disorder. I recently started working out and eating better and honestly am really starting to love my body, for the first time in YEARS and managed to get my weight up to the healthy weight zone on the BMI scale. My face however, I just can't seem to like in any way.

I have a pretty round face, it's hard not to compare myself to every girl out there with their sharp jawlines and slim faces. I know not every girl has a sharp jawline, but I feel like it's all I see nowadays. I'm pretty thin/muscular but still manage to look like I have a double chin at some angles due to my round face and lack of jawline. I don't like anyone taking photos of me because of this and have to take 50+ selfies before finding one I like. I feel like a Barbie doll but if you replaced the head with a troll's head and kept the nice body. (I know a Barbie doll's body isn't realistic, just a figure of speech)

I am going to therapy, but it has to be under my insurance because any other therapy is way too expensive for me to afford. Because of this though, I can only see my therapist maybe 2 times a month. I also don't live near any support groups because I live in the middle of nowhere. 

I would just like some advice on how I can learn to love/like my face more, more specifically my jawline I guess, besides just going to therapy or trying to find a support group. Any advice is appreciated and welcomed. I just want to learn to love my face and be confident one day. Thanks!",26Jul2019,0
64,"So I am going through a lot of shit and I need another opinion. I don't want to give away details but I am going to sum up my situation.

I'm a fourteen year old male and I'm about to go into high school. Now the thing is I'm getting an option for the first time in my life about where I want to live. But I am having much trouble deciding it. So these are my two options as of now:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Choose to live with my Mom and her new boyfriend

Now my Mom has severe mental problems. She is suffering from PTSD, Anxiety, Bipolar, etc. and I've always been blamed for a lot of shit since I was very young. She's blamed for shit I didn't do, shit that hasn't happened, and blames me for not doing stuff that I was never told to do. Most people look at this and go ""Well he's just fourteen, he is probably not listening to his mother properly."" And I thought so, too so I always took the blame for everything. But now, after listening very closely to EVERYTHING my mother says that I realize that she DOES blame for shit that I was never told  to do. She's constantly forcing me to do stuff that I hate doing (Fishing, hunting, etc. \[Im not a country boy\]) and blames me for not loving my family when I say I don't like doing that sort of thing. 

The only thing that has me wanting to stay is my siblings that live with her. When growing up, my big brother was everything to me. And once he moved away (Because he was 21 and found a house he could live in), that really sucked for me who now was the oldest child and was forced to live with her and take that blame. He was also an amazing role model and I aspire to have some traits that he does. But my I don't want my siblings to have to deal with my mother like I did and I'm scared the mental abuse she'll put them through. 

Not to mention she lives in the absolute middle of nowhere. I have zero friends out there and I'm forced to stay in my room every single day playing video games and I can't go outside because all there is is forest.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Living somewhere else

Now I don't know exactly where I would be living, either with my father and his girlfriend (Which I love the both of them deeply) or my big brother and his wife (Which I also love dearly). But I am now choosing whether I can have a better life living with friends and enjoying myself or stay and be that role model for my siblings that my big brother was to me and continue to live with my mother and her blame.

(remember i fucking watch anime so im not used to this kind of trouble, nor do i want to be around it) he cant keep a promise worth shit. he promised to take me to Walgreens and drove right past it so that sums it up for that, not wasting ur time because you cant fathom his ability to break a promise. the gf we're staying with has ocd so its very very annoying to live with her. plus im going into 11th grade with this trackphone that doesnt even have a plan. great start, yeah i know. i cant go back to Maryland with mom due to her being homeless now. and my dad stays on his phone while driving which is ironic due to him not being able to spell, also hes never wrong, and we're on the road 24/7!!!! PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS PART. 24 FUCKING 7 MY ASS HURTS!!! we go to Aurora and back, Aurora and back, Aurora and back, then we went to Louisiana, then we went to Arkansas, Aurora and back, Aurora and back, Aurora and back (we went to Aurora and Chicago more than i said we did) all in the span of two weeks. what am i to do? im lost, very lost, im to the point of virginity when i get jealous seeing a hot girl kissing her bf instead of me, im getting jealous seeing a girl drive a car, knowing i have no chance with her, im getting so desperate that i want to search the streets and ask a crackhead for a bj for $20. please help this broken, torn soul.

The fire was contained and made no structural damage. We only lost the dining room table(which dis not burn itself but had stuff burned stuck to it) and some clothes. It was determined to be caused by my laptop, which was on the table.


My concern lies in all the soot that now covers EVERTHING AND EVERYWHERE in the ENTIRE apartment. I know we can make an insurance claim and that it is recommended to get professionals but it was portrayed to me in such a way that seemed like it may not be necessary in our case. But  this soot everywhere is super overwhelming. Nothing is usuable. All clothes and bedding need washed, etc. Also, my family hoards so this compounds the stress and difficulty in trying to clean up and knowing what to do. 

My questions are:
1. Is it possible to clean the soot ourselves? If so, how? Is it really that bad of an idea?



2. Is there anyone with experience with hoarding and fires that can provide me any insight on handling this situation at all? Im concerned about dealing with insurance and professional cleaners

. 

4. How do we handle the HVAC issue of cleaning and making sure its circulating safe air?(we literally just got our A.C. fixed 2 days prior so this happening is insane and frustrating)



3. Is it absolutely necessary to throw out all food, including the stuff on the refridgerator, and all medications?  Why would this be necessary? Can the soot permeate the containers of the medicine?



4. What about stuff in my dresser, which is in the opposite side of the apartment? They seemed fine and i grabbed tgem so i have a change of clothes but could they somehow be contaminated?



5. What about random stuff like sun hats and bookbags that may have a bit of soot on them? I assume these are fine once wiped off but what is the best strategy for this?

We both need each other because the amount of emotional support and things we do together are just amazing. This all sounds great but i am not enjoying it because everyday we have a small argument that to me ruins the whole day. For example, i will make a small joke and she will get mad for the smallest reason. She later tells me that she did overreact (this is just a small example). The thing to me is that i never ever started an argument with her or got mad at her, and when she is mad at me all the time for things that are sometimes supposed to be sweet or funny, i just get upset inside.

i am not good at confronting her, because when i do she gets mad and i end up apologizing. i know she is a sweet person but she is very very comfortable with me.

the second problem is, we always do things her way. what she wants, when she wants it. i have never said to her no but she says no to me all the time.

the last thing, after a year and a half almost, at the age of 23, we never had sex. our sexual life consists of ""dry humping"" once every two weeks. and i have a lot of sexual energy, like i really think it is enjoyable - to her it is no big deal. she gets horny sometimes and i help her orgasm, a lot of times i dont myself, then that is it. she always gives me a milestone for us to have sex after and when we achieve it, she comes up with a new one. when i tell her how i feel, she says that it's scary to her or she is not in the mood. when i talk about it again she says ""it looks like you are with me for sex"" and i say in my heart ""if the reason i am with her is sex, then i'd be the most stupid guy in the world because it has been almost a year and a half and we havent had any"". the reason i am with her is that i believe in her heart. i love her because she gave me warmth i never received before her.

she is too special to for me to break up with. and even if i do, i will feel soooo bad for it. at the end of the day, i know she puts in effort. my friends dont think so but if you look closely, she does.

I'm doing this so I can have a better understanding of my potential issues so I can relay the most helpful info to medical professionals. I've gotten not so great therapists and doctors in the past who have probably prescribed the wrong medications for me.

Basing this on what Psychology Today says about BPD:

I’m very neurotic, and definitely have a mood instability/disorder, severe depression in the past (crops back up rather easily), severe general and social anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder. I have hyperacusis (absolutely horrible), but it's improved over the years.

Although I frequently fantasize about dying, I wouldn’t have the courage to intentionally self-harm. I usually don’t like physical pain, kinda scares me, but there have been some rare exceptions. So I guess I’m not suicidal, though I do have suicidal *ideation*.

I also have low self esteem/self perception despite being very musically inclined/talented from a young age and being told I’m very attractive throughout my life. My father thinks I was so into music and a perfectionist that I burned myself out at an early age writing songs, producing, going through bands, performing live, etc. This might explain my overall lack of energy and laziness today, especially when it comes to academia. I hardly studied through high school, and I just intentionally failed out of college (with a $96,000 scholarship) and stopped going to my first real job after the first day. As for attractiveness, I always complained about how I'm constantly told I'm attractive and get looks all the time, yet most of the girls I've perused never seemed interested. I was verbally (and sometimes lightly physically) bullied in elementary and middle school for my long, curly hair. I've also always been harsh on myself due to my complexion. I'm half black and half white. My mom is black, yet she seems to look down on other black people sometimes, and she tries to get away from stereotypes. She prides herself in living in a white, suburban area, and she apparently always wanted to marry a white man, though I can't fully confirm this.

I don’t think I try to avoid abandonment, though I do always express trust issues when in a relationship, even with friends sometimes. I'm now in an open relationship (to avoid commitment and all the time, energy, and money that goes into that). It honestly is a bit toxic at times (on her end), but I don't want to pull the plug because I don't want to hurt her, and she's also probably one of the only people I'll come across with the same interests and mindset, especially when it comes to sexual stuff. I've had the unfortunate experience of being addicted to porn from a very young age, and she was too. I may have some sort of sexual disorder, but I'm not sure. I do know that I have a sexual sensitivity issue - I almost feel nothing when engaging in sexual activities, making it nearly impossible to climax, but masturbation tends to feel good (not all the time, though), and it's not due to the ""death grip."" I think I also am obsessed/very picky with certain body types and physical traits. I often see someone in public that matches my type perfectly, and then I get extremely depressed because I know I'll never see them again, and I was too afraid to talk to them, or they had a boyfriend present. Even if I did get involved with them, I seem to lose attraction to others quite easily. Someone's facial features that I once found beautiful I might not see anything in later on, and lose all interest. In addition, I think I sometimes find non-op/pre-op trans women more enticing than cis women (due to pornography). I've grown to actually almost find the female genitalia a turn-off, and I don't like giving oral. I think me being a little bit bisexual plays into this. I actually used to fantasize about being a woman because it seems like women feel a lot more than men during sex (with the G-spot and everything).

I definitely have intense bouts of anger, depression, and anxiety that can last from minutes to hours, sometimes over a day. I'm often too anxious to drive, which also keeps me from getting another job. I was placed on Prozac in the past, which helped for depression, but not really anxiety I'd say. I was placed on buspirone/Buspar a few months ago, which seemed to work well, but I had maxed out the dosage, and it stopped working. I was experiencing some uncommon side effects - extreme drowsiness (felt like passing out almost every time I took it, even after halving the dosage) and sweating. Both my psychiatrist and primary care doctors refused to put me on a benzo/Xanax. Marijuana seems to really help me (not CBD, though), and I may get a medical card for it, but I obviously can't drive and go to work high, and whatever my next job is may drug test.

I have an addictive personality, but I’ve calmed it down a little. I went through a 1.5 gram THC cartridge in like 15 days. I also was recently very reckless with some money due to feeling extremely sexually desperate, and trying to experience all the fun in my freshman year of college that I missed out on in my pretty horrible years of high school.

I often get on manic highs when I feel I’ve found something life-changing, like a career choice or something - only to be shot down when the realization hits that what I was trying to pursue is unrealistic, usually takes a team of people to accomplish, is very difficult, and time consuming.

I'm definitely very sensitive to rejection, taking it very personally. Puts me into a state of depression.

I have a consultation tomorrow with a cognitive behavioral therapy group, so hopefully this will get me back on track.",26Jul2019,0
90,"He'd already given me the coffee and told me I was cute and wanted me to get in his friends car with him and ""hang out."" I said no I have to go pick up my daughter from daycare (I don't have one) and immediately turned back around and went inside the bar where I work for a few minutes to let him leave.

Then I brought the coffee into Gumby's on my way to get some cigarettes and asked the guy if they had anywhere I could dump it. They said yeah what's wrong with it? I told them the story and joked about not wanting to get roofied. Then the guy said ""yeah you never know who's into sex trafficking."" And my anxiety popped up again and I kinda laughed. He then told me a BS story about how he got roofied at a bar once. 

Then asked for my ID for the cigarettes and instead of scanning it, he looked at it and basically read all my information while I stood there and shifted back and forth like where I live and my name and everything and THEN scanned it. Then he told me about his long time girlfriend?? And I said wow good for you etc, we said have a good day and I left. But I left wondering why he read everything on my ID?

Should I be worried about the guy looking at my ID? It says my address plain and simple right on there and I live alone. And obviously he'd just talked with me about a group of guys trying to pick me up. So am I crazy for worrying? He wasn't your average cool guy either he was intimidating and sort of off-putting in his demeanor like he's scary. Thanks advice is appreciated please leave any thoughts

Something will trigger it, like a photo or sentence and I’ll just be hearing voices or seeing things that aren’t there. I am totally aware that none of it is real but my brain is just trying to trick me and it makes my heart race and I usually end up crying my eyes out and hiding in a corner.

99,"Six months ago I moved halfway across the country with my SO. I had little doubt that I could find a new job as we moved to a larger city and I had been full time employed for years.

Four months later I hadn't had any luck finding a job that didn't require a total of 3 hour daily commute. So I took a part time job walking dogs as I like animals and it's easy. I'm in the process of starting a business that would have the same clients as my dog walking job. I have the goal of having my own business. I have already put a lot time into it and even though I haven't launched yet I'm finding myself getting more passionate about it every step of the way. (I have about month before I know if it's even possible to make money with my business.) 

I've still been sending out applications for what I went to school for and was offered a job that I'm not sure I want. Its higher pay but still part time. I know I would find it more interesting and I would have holidays off. It is for a university so I'd need to commit to a whole semester.  I would have to work half days on Saturdays and I do have plans in the coming months for my Saturdays.  (I currently don't work weekends but work my business during weekends and evenings.) There is possiblity that I may eventually find full time work through this job but it's not guaranteed.

I have a couple of options, I could work both to not loose a possible client base and still work in my field. I know I'll have less time for my business if I do both, which would allow me down. I could work the job in my field and lose my client base, or I could turn down the new job and dog walk using it to motivate me to continue to work on my business.

102,"As stated in the title: I was introduced to said girl through our shared circle of friends. She lives a considerable distance away, but our group of friends would talk almost daily thanks to social media. She recently announced she will be visiting where most of us live and will be staying with a friend in the area because ""it's cheaper than a hotel"". After said friend logged out, she confided in a mutual friend and myself that she had feelings for this friend, but doesn't want to tell him, fearing it could damage their friendship. Now, I realize that real life is nothing like romcoms and pornos, but imo: if she's staying at his for some time, something is probably going to happen and I don't see any reason he would have to turn her down.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I say: i'm jealous. But not in the way that I or others expected. I'm not mad about her choosing someone else over me: i'm not entitled to anything and that's just how she feels. Plus, I think I just like the idea of being with an attractive girl who also has similar interests to mine rather than genuinely upset about a love which can never be. And i'm not mad about it being my friend; if anything this is great news for him because he's self proclaimed suicidal and I think having someone to share his life with will do him good.  


I'm jealous because...i'm so fucking lonely man. **:(**

&amp;#x200B;

Been single my whole life. I've asked girls out before, but I always get the same: ""you're a nice guy...just not my nice guy."" and i'm not sure where i'm going wrong. Before you point the finger at me and call me a: ""white knighting neck-beard"", allow me to make some things clear: I don't resent women if they choose not to date me, I don't feel i'm owed sex or anything of that nature if I do something nice for a girl, I have incredibly high anxiety and while i'm sure plenty of people have managed to have relationships despite their anxiety, it really makes it hard for me to approach people let alone girls I like. I will admit i'm guilty of acting slightly different around girls I like, but I associate that more with nerves; ""fuck, please like me!""

&amp;#x200B;

I try to improve myself: got a job, attend the gym to boost my confidence and physique, try to conquer my fears of social interaction and most importantly ""be myself"" but i've still gotten nowhere when it comes to having a relationship. And then there's my friend: he's suicidal, stays home all the time, equally socially anxious and he's got this girl wanting to be with him. I don't want to say i'm better than my friend, but what is he or others doing that i'm not?  People say be yourself and I get that I want someone to like me for me. But the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I've had girls like me in the past, but I never felt the same and declined their advances which looking back I feel like I shouldn't have: maybe I should have taken them up on it.  


I wish my friends the best in their relationship (if it happens of course) but I'll admit i'm jealous to see another one of my friends get to share their lives with someone else (who admittedly is pretty attractive and funny; so quite the catch). I'm losing interest in looking for a relationship these days; it seems hopeless. What should I do?",26Jul2019,0

I was not happy with the situation even before I knew that I was drugged without my permission. I called my girlfriend to complain about how panicked I was and just get a handle of what happening(I thought I was having an acid flashback.

I am welcomed to go and work there with a desk they lended me, but i can use it as long as it's not occupied.

A friend says i should go many times a week and work there to show my interest and dedication to make the process faster.

I get lonely working at home but it has some benefits as doing my hobbies and stuff and It is veery comfortable. I also have some time to do art commissions and gain some more money and i do other projects as well.

should i go there and make the extra effort, work more for the same payment, to show interest and dedication so they employ me faster

should i just work at home working and still doing my art hobbies that actually give me life and a bit more money until they decide to employ me and I can ask for a pay rise because ""i'm a super busy person with a lot of projects i will be leaving""",26Jul2019,0

We hung out on my parents front porch and talked for 2 hours. She left. I felt good about what transpired. I didnt ""make a move"" more or less because i dont know if id handle rejection in a healthy way. And i dont want to subject myself to that.


The next few days our conversations have been short and curt. At least on her end. Today i invited her to go on a hike whenever shes free and she said shes just super busy.

122,"Hey all...

So we were on an amazing road trip. We converted a shuttle bus, saved money, and quit our jobs... fast forward one month and our bus is broken down. We’re currently looking at $5,000+ repairs. It’s the notoriously shit 6.0 Diesel engine, made worse that it is a van so every mechanic hates working on them. We are considering buying a van, but are afraid we’ll get a lemon and be in this same situation a month from now. Does anyone have any advice? We saved around $4500 for repairs, but are unsure if we want to continue to feed money into this vehicle. 

We’re not “Instagram” van lifers who can afford $50,000 sprinter vans. We’re just two 20 somethings who worked really hard for 2 years to travel the country before we settle down. Any advice at all would be amazing. Specially how to find a reliable/affordable vehicle? 

Thanks all!",26Jul2019,0

I also have a girlfriend that I see pretty much everyday to meet up for either breakfast or just to see each other before work. Sometimes we hang out over the weekdays, granted we both are not working or have time after work. I was wondering how other people handle these types of things because this will be the first time I am working 6 days a week while also going to college full time trying to transfer as fast as possible and start my life. 

On top of that I also still want to have time for my hobbies like;

\-hanging out with friends

\-travelling

\-playing all kinds of video games (Nintendo Switch)

\-practicing the piano

\-working out at the gym

\-Leaning new languages

Is there any advice or tips you guys can give me to balance and do this all properly?  I want to change and be as productive as ever. I'm 19 and want to start forming talents that I regret never having in my early youth. I want to make new friends that I can actually be close to. I want to travel the world. I want to learn a bunch of languages. I want to become successful in school. One big problem that has always stopped me is the thought of never being able to reach those goals because i'm not good enough and physically getting tired too easily especially at work. Any advice is helpful and don't worry about sugarcoating things. I know many will say doing all that is probably impossible and I would have to give up some of those things to compensate.

126,"“Relationships” doesn’t mean sexual, it means being in a relationship with anyone. Friend/girlfriend, etc.

After 5+ years of living my life, I’ve only now realized how much of an idiot I’ve been. I’ve ruined relationships with friends just for being myself. I’m mostly negative, but I love my life. I only be negative because I love critiquing so I can build off of it. Apparently, people don’t like that about me. I need to fix that. 

I’m not going to tell which grade I’m in or how old I am. All I’m going to say that I’m in high school.

Now let’s talk about what I’ve done when it comes to girls (I’m a male) I’ve driven away multiple opportunities for a great relationship. For example, since I’m not a hug person, I’ve denied many hugs from girls, like “end of the school year hugs”, a “I haven’t seen you in a long time hug”, etc. I’m almost completely oblivious to hints. I’ve been yelled at from a female friend of mine from ignoring signs from both her and her close friend. I had no knowledge of doing this. I’ve also caused break ups because I don’t hang out with them enough/get bored of them. Not bored as in I’m completely bored with their personality and them, but bored is in I need to do something exiting or I’m going to die. I’ve also noticed that I have a huge problem with boredom. 

Now for boys. I’ve messed up relationships because I didn’t want to hang out/accidentally favoring some friends over the others. Not hanging out with friends due to missing/playing with friends from countries/states I’ve moved away from.

I feel really bad for what I did. I wish I knew the entire time, they were good, genuine people. 

That’s why I’m here. I need help from fellow redditors, because Reddit fixes everything, right? I need to fix this problem. I don’t want to live lonely. I’ll answer any and all questions if needed.

If I’m in the wrong subreddit, please be kind enough to redirect me. Thanks.",26Jul2019,1
127," 

I (m23) live with my parents. I suffer from emetophobia (fear of being sick) and have been struggling with this most of my life and I’m still struggling with my emetophobia where I struggle to eat. Whenever I was anxious I would go speak to my mum who would reassure me that everything would be ok. However recently a friend told me that he believed my mum was being abusive to me in regards to my anxiety.

Whenever I have anxiety about going to a new place or going to try new food or trying something new, my mum used to give me encouragement for it. Now she tells me I’m too scared to do anything. If I try to do something she doesn’t want me to do like move out or go out for food she will say things like “You will get there and there will be people wanting to fight you or you’ll get jumped”. She has also started blaming me for her health and for my dad health saying that I’m a shite bag and that “ If I cared about my family I wouldn’t be anxious” &amp; “if my dad ends up in hospital it will be because of me” 

I spoke to her about wanting to go to a hospital for help with my eating as I’m severely underweight and she tells me that “I have no shame and I am a shit bag for not facing my fear” and that “she lost a child but she got on with things”.

Recently I have been having bad thoughts about my life and what is the point in it. My mum found this out and said I ruined her holiday and that everything good she tries to do I ruin. She also told me that I’ve been given my life back and I’m wasting it (I had cancer 6 years ago). I am also throwing all the good my parents did back in their face and that once I’m better she wants me out the house. 

She has also been known to say to me things like “ I’m not right in the head” “anxiety isn’t attractive and i’ll never find someone” and that “I’ve given up and she doesn’t care if I get taken away in an ambulance”

I have tried to move away before but I took anxiety attacks without my mum their but since I’ve moved back I’m taking them all the time and can’t sleep or eat which my mum blames on me saying it’s my fault I’m like this.

I am looking for advice on this. Is this abuse or is it just because I’m too weak? Also is there anywhere I can speak to someone about this if it is abuse.",26Jul2019,0

135,"Alright Reddit, I need help, in understanding a woman I have recently taken interest in. Let’s title her Jasmine. Jasmine and I are coworkers, who a month ago struck up a sudden friendship, and apparent interest in one another. We’re both 20, and recently (6 months ago) got out of long term relationships. We began talking, and both displayed obvious interest in one another. As the first couple weeks went by, she began asking about my relationship history, met my parents, and was very interested in their impressions of her. We consistently flirted, spent time with one another, and seemed to be heading on the right path towards a relationship. Eventually, I decided to end the feeling of walking around the inevitable around her, and looked in her the eye and said “You know I’m into you, right”, in which I expected a positive and mutual answer in response, based on how things had been progressing. Instead, she told me she wasn’t ready to commit to another relationship, and wouldn’t want to hurt me by having me wait around until she was ready. I understand that the easy response to this would be to say I am perpetually trapped in the friend zone with her, however she did tell me she has feelings, just is not ready for commitment.

138,"This is kind of a long one so bare with me.

I am a 21 year old Female. I started college in the fall of 2016. Went in with some college already because I finished high school early, so my 2016-2017 freshman year went great! I was able to finish all my lower level courses without any issues. Things looked good. I was on scholarships and grants. 

The first semester of my sophomore year was great too. It’s the second semester where everything gets crappy. 

In October of 2017, I was about 4 hours into a shift at work. I was telling a story to all of my coworkers, I always liked to try and bring a fun atmosphere to work. I loved seeing everyone smile. I looked at my friend and I was seeing doubles. Everything was getting really hazy. I tried to play it off by saying “um” like I was trying to remember part of the story.

But next thing I knew I woke up in the hospital. I was SO confused and didn’t even realize I was there. My first question was “what happened to my brother?” I could tell by how hysterical my mom was, how hysterical my dad was on the phone (He was deployed), how shocked and frozen my brother was, and how many times my husband called my phone (he was also deployed), that whatever happened was very serious. Apparently I was out for two hours and no one could get me to respond to anything. I had fallen into a sudden grand mal seizure with a perfectly clean health history. I’ve never even broken a bone.

I got released to go home after some EXTENSIVE testing and I emailed my professors explaining what happened. I felt like I got hit by a truck.

I had MANY new restrictions. They took my license, banned baths, swimming, staying up late, etc. I wasn’t even allowed to shower with the door closed because I was “high risk.”

I tried contacting my school for help explaining that I would be at the hospital twice a week for an entire day for as long as it took for them to figure out why I was having seizures. They just said okay what do you want us to do? I asked to either receive incompletes so I could pick the courses back up, or for N/As on the classes. They said they would see what they could do. I provided documentation throughout all of this.

They never did anything. I tried contacting disability support, I tried everything. They ended up flying me to a neurology center in Seattle to hook my brain up and observe it for a week (over an EEG). We discovered that I have a lump in there that’s causing it all.

I explain ALL of this to my university and they tell me oh well, and mark all of my classes as failing. That means I have to pay out of pocket. I was so discouraged and had to take a semester off to pay. I went to work full time despite what my doctors said because I need this degree. (I’m a Biomed student.)

When I finally got back To school, overdid it, and had another huge episode. This time was worse than the last, and the doctor told me that if I don’t slow down, I’ll literally kill myself because my seizures cause my heart to stop intermittently, and that my seizures were getting dangerously long and worse due to stress. (They tell me stress is a trigger. I think that’s crazy.)

Again, the university did not help me. I finally got a little representation and decided to give it one more go. This time, they lied to me. My father passed down his GI bill, which pays for my college. They told me that they had everything and I was good to start school. It turns out they lied to me, and I have to pay for those classes. Out of pocket. Again.

So, I moved to North Carolina (military orders for both dad and husband at the same time, yay!) and I feel so discouraged. I’ve been so happy go lucky this entire time, often making jokes about this brand new life I have. 

But guys. What the heck do I do? Everything legally is done. But mentally I am not okay. I have to start my degree completely over at a new university. I’m in between jobs. The military messed up paperwork and my husband and I got separated for the time being, so I’m currently bumming on my parents couch. I do miss him and we are trying to get their mess fixed so he can clear. Everything just crashed and burned and I just really need to know what everyone would do if they were in my shoes.

I’m just feeling lost and like I can’t achieve anything. I don’t even know where to begin to get things back in line. 

[TL;DR] I developed a severe medical condition and my university used to it mark all of my classes as failed so that I would have to pay for them. They then lied about a GI bill and now I’m in debt with them again. I will have to start my 4 year degree over even though I was three years in. I’m between jobs and separated (by the army) from my husband and need help feeling like myself and getting back on my feet. (Not financially. Just advice. I would NEVER ask for money.)

The thing is she has a boyfriend and they been together for 6-7 months. So what's the problem? well, every time they fight over something she cries and has an emotional crisis. But that isn't her only problem you see she has this kind of bad relationship with her sisters and her mother, her mother treats her like a child sometimes because she sometimes is like a child, she constantly tries to fight with her mother over dumb stuff. With his sisters she tells me that they only want to mess with her and they always treat her bad and complain of her with her mother, they also complain about things like why she can go out so late and I cant? but every time I had the opportunity to go to her house her sisters' aren't that bad they just try to joke around with her and she is the one that escalated the whole situation. So a few hours ago she called me crying because she wanted to go to ""Gorgona"" (it is a place you visit in Panama) with I guess her boyfriend and she tried to seek permission from her mother, and his mother just told her no but that inst that much a problem the problem is she just told me crying that her sisters treat her bad and awful and she doesn't even talk to them and they treat her that way, that her mother just treat her like a child and she doesn't even ask for anything to her, she doesn't even studies what she likes and she feels like everything is her fault. She wants to go out and sleep in some other house for tonight and she will leave her home and go to somewhere else to make his own life.

149,"So I was walking with a friend of mine to a convenient store near their house. On the way back, we spied a Dead cat in the bushes near the side walk. Without getting close you could see there was a collar. I asked if we should check the collar because maybe it belonged to one of their neighbors. My friend did not want to and it was THEIR neighborhood and it didn't seem my place to investigate and get in touch with one of their neighbors. 

A few days later I'm hanging out at his place again and we're outside when a lady approaches my friend asking if they saw a tabby with a green collar. I was curious how my friend would respond. They said ""no but I'll let you know if I do"".

I said ""why didn't you tell them?"" They says I was right that we should have seen who's cat is was right away but if she says something now we'll look like assholes for not saying it sooner. 

So now I'm in the situation where I need to do something. I can't let that family think their cat is missing forever, but I don't want to out my friend for not saying anything the first time

What are my best options? Is there a way to anonymously tell them their cat died without outing my friend as an asshole?

Should I like, call animal control about the dead cat and assume they'll get the info on the collar and tell the family? Should I move the cat from the bushes closer to the side walk so they're found or will that only cause more trauma.

Clearly we should have just said something right away but my friend had their dog with them and didn't want to be bothered and clearly they were wrong. But I don't know what the right move is currently.

Today he was notified that he was getting sent home again, and that I can’t take him home he needs to Uber or lyft. When I found out I told him to speak to our manager and explain the situation. Some pallets take longer than others to do and he’s not able to move the required parts per hour, this is a problem we all face. 


So he talked to our manager and our manager showed him a “faster way” and gave him an hour to make the rate. He didn’t and was told to go home. This didn’t sit well with myself or and everyone else in our department. So I took him home and I stayed home as well, I’m not going to make 2 and a half trips. 

My manager and lead didn’t call or text me, another coworker did and she said our lead was pissed. 


This doesn’t sit well with me because I checked the final rates for yesterday’s work day and nobody made the hourly rate except one person. We’re all expect to move 25 parts an hour. Five of us had moved below 20 parts an hour. The one person that did make rate surpassed it by two parts. 


Any advice on how to handle the situation would be greatly appreciated. Not carpooling isn’t an option because we’ve both been saving a good amount on gas. Me personally I usually spend 50 dollars a week and now it’s 35. Thanks in advance !",26Jul2019,1
155,I need some advice. So my boyfriend of almost 4 years broke up with me a couple of months ago. It wasn’t dramatic or anything and we are still friends. The thing is he was my best friend while we were dating and even before than. Now he barely talks to me even though he’s the one that suggested we still be friends. I would like to tell him life updates and share things with him but I feel as if that’s too much since he hardly ever talks to me. I don’t want him to just disappear out of my life which at this point would probably be easier. What should I do?,26Jul2019,6
156,"I’m a beginner artist who wants to start selling my work online but I don’t have any credit or debit cards. I don’t think I can get a credit or debit card because I’m a minor and my mom is bankrupt. I’m also afraid of mismanaging my account and screwing over my credit score, so that’s a no from me. I live in Canada if that helps.

157,"I think I may have feelings for my dead cousins fiancee, and let me start off saying I feel horrible about it. My cousin passed away about 5 years ago from medication complications. She was engaged to this guy they were very much in love. Anyway I him on a dating site he ended up saying what's up asked what happened with my marraige  and gave me his number not a big deal he talks to her other cousins and sisters still some pretty close to but none live close like I do they live hours and hours away. Long story short we become good friends hang out alot have dinner together hes around my boyfriend and my kids. We text all day we have great conversations like alot I'd the same things have similar mellow personalities same views...ect... I wanna add I was never physically attracted to him when he was with my cousin or when we started hanging out like at all. That just started recently like maybe the past few weeks and weve hung out for months now. I think he feels the same too, it sure seems like he does. Almost to the point of it seems like hes hinting hard and trying to make it obvious. But he also talks to me about how much he still loves her and cant wait to find her again. I dont know I'm just really confused. I know it's wrong. I feel awful and dirty for even thinking about it. Should I just stop hanging out with him? I feel like that would hurt him hes a lonely guy since she passed. Hes told he how much he enjoys my company. Or is it ok to have those feelings as long as I never act on them because I know its wrong? Maybe theyll go away eventually? Please help! Any advice is appreciated.",26Jul2019,2

161,"So, I'm a sound recordist and a voice actor. I began my career about 7-8 years age, and I had a studio of my own but I had to shut it down. 1.5 years ago, I met this guy who was some how a pro voice actor. He was looking to start a business, and I offered partnership in a sound studio. Our deal was that, I would bring all my equipments, even the visor glass, and I would do the working part. He had to pay the rent, bring customers and provide whatever I need. Each of us would take 50 percent of the profit.

Things didn't work out as it was planned. From the first day, he started telling me he didn't have enough money to pay, even for small things like carpet. He brought few customers, which none of them pay, or paid half of the real price because he insisted. In other hands, I found a willing group of voice actors, and we've had more than 20 projects till now.

We've had few arguments, and he always blames me for not coming whenever he asks and do whatever he wants. He wants to work 3 shifts a day, just for him to record shit stuff and become famous, while I clearly know there's not a single cent in what he wants.

Now, I admit I've lost my eagerness when I saw there's nothing true about what he said. But I couldn't just let down everything I worked so hard for. He had paid the rent during the time, but I took every chance that seemed reasonable, too (of course making dubsmash is not reasonable for me).

Now, I just have had enough. I know I cannot continue anymore. I've started working night shift in a hotel, and I just can't bear his phonecalls while I'm sleep just to come and record his trash.

I'm thinking all day about giving up and starting to build a new studio, but honestly, it's way out of my reach. I'm working about 14-16 hours per day, but the payment as a whole is less than $121. And for instance, the rent for such a place is about $2850 before/$170 per month. And it's just for the rent, not counting the price of stuff needed to make it suitable. Also, I can't move out while I don't have another place to store my stuff. That's more than I can handle in my house.

And to mention, he is not a reasonable person. I've tried talking to him for many time. He is just ignorant and selfish and all he wants is the fame. So, talking won't take me anywhere. 

Thanks in advance.

162,"I’m been veering back into my sociopathic tendencies. For so long I practiced love and care and now I feel like being cold and I want to hurt people around me. I have a lot of internalized angers about things I can’t control. But I also want to overcome this. I’m at a fork in the road, I feel like. I either go one way or the other. The brave part of me wants to choose to be strong. To be able to love and care without being vulnerable. The cowardly part of me tells me to not be a victim target anymore. To take control and power over the situation. To intimidate those around me. To humiliate them. To hurt them. To belittle them.",26Jul2019,0
163,"Bit of a context, I’m 22 and have been pretty depressed for about a year now due to a bad breakup (5yrs), shitty family situation, and a string of bad luck. I’m very lucky to have a great group of close friends who are all patient, encourage and support my endeavours. One of their suggestions that I keep hearing is that I should learn to reach out and open up more.

I have a friend, who I will call S, that I met in University. We’re both musicians and have known each other for a number of years now but have never been too close. I noticed that she’s very extroverted and thought this would be a good chance to get out and try to meet more people and so we ended up hanging out a lot and I became good friends with fiancé and we play video games at night. She doesn’t like it when I talk about my job (teacher) or my performing life so usually I keep quiet about it. After a while I thought it’d be safe to invite her to one of my shows and she came. The performance went well and I was quite content with it. Afterwards I was looking forward to celebrating it with her only to find that she was not pleased with it at all and did not want to speak on the matter of the performance at all during the dinner after.

Fast forward a month to now, I’ve travelled around a bit and my mental state has dramatically worsened, I thought to reach out to her and try to do what my other friends suggested and open up a bit. So I called her up, we had dinner and I started to talk about how I’d been feeling lately. After a while she brushes me off and tells me to chill out and just let things take care of themselves. I didn’t like this response and I could kind of see that this wasn’t going the way I’d hoped so I replied by saying that perhaps we see life differently since we grew up differently, hoping to end it with a ‘agree to disagree’ resolution. S then told me I should just try to grow up and be stronger mentally. I’m usually good at hiding my emotions but a bit of frustration must’ve showed on my face because she noticed something and promptly told me off, saying that I should really work on my conflict resolution skills. Not wanting to make things worse I redirected the topic and we parted ways shortly after.

The next night whilst gaming with her fiancé he tells me that S is really pissed off at me and said I was being extremely ungrateful towards her for trying to help me and that I shouldn’t be so rude towards friends. I was utterly speechless and ended up losing a night of sleep over it.

S is also friends with my ex and frequently spills gossip to me about how she’s doing, the new guys that she’s dating now, and generally a lot of things I really don’t want to be hearing. I want to tell her to stop but I’m afraid of triggering a similar reaction.

My close friends told me that she’s not doing me any favour and I should just cut her off but I’m wondering if I’m overreacting to all this? Maybe she was trying to help me in her own way with the blunt statements and gossip? Was inviting her to my show insensitive? Should I keep being friends with her or just cut her off?",26Jul2019,1
164,"   I have very recently become very good friends with a girl at a summer camp I am at. She is 15 and so am I. She has a boyfriend who just turned 18 who she started dating not too long ago. Not only is their relationship technically illegal, but it is also, in my friends and I’s opinions emotionally abusive.
    She started talking to him around a year ago, and at Christmas time she went through some depression and cut off a lot of communication she had with her friends, including her now boyfriend. When they started talking again, he told her that when she stopped talking to him, he got so sad that he almost committed suicide. The first week that they hung out was the week she had her first drink, smoke, and vape. He now provides her with Juul pods and weed and alcohol. 
   I am really worried for her because she is really heading in a terrible direction. She’s smart, but she’s heading into a downward spiral. Any advice on this?",26Jul2019,1
166,"When I look back at myself two years ago, I see myself the way I want to be: Confident, driven, with a 4.0 GPA despite a vigorous and demanding course load. I was popular, and was involved. I loved the creative and intellectual freedom to take classes and learn anything and everything that interested me. Every summer I had prestigious internships in New York. My work received accolades from several trade publications, and my work as the creative director for the school magazine earned me awards from the AP. I loved being busy, envisioning my future I was in touch with myself. I knew who I was and where my life was headed. I was going to New York to become a trend forecaster or creative director- with the eventual intention of getting my PhD and becoming a research professor in Consumer Behavior.  I worked constantly, but I was busy, creatively fulfilled and happy. 

A week before graduation I met my now boyfriend. He and I hit it off instantly. He is a young real estate developer. We tried to make the long distance thing work, as I'd already accepted a summer internship in New York and his business had him stuck in the midwest for at least another decade- although he initially promised me that it would only be 5 years. Consumed by the passions of my first REAL love, I may not have been the best employee, and was not offered a job at the conclusion of the internship as I had anticipated. 

Lacking direction for the first time in my life, and missing my boyfriend. I ended up accepting a position working for a Fourtune 500 company two hours away from my boyfriend's growing business, with a horrible horrible- have I said horrible? boss, in a  toxic work place. After a year with the company, I was let go after a year with the company when I forgot to attach a document on an email to my boss. 

Before I was fired, I'd interviewed for a role as a graphic designer and social media manager for a small jewelry store in my boyfriend's town. I ended up accepting the role. Although it was not exactly what I had envisioned for my life, and a significant pay cut from previous job, I deemed it sufficient enough to pay my bills and wanted to avoid any gaps in my resume. 

Since we were tied to this small college town for another 5 years or so, I figured now was as good a time as any to fulfill my ambitions to get my PhD. I met with the director of my desired program who explained that she was very interested in my joining the program. I was elated. Unfortunately, I did not perform as well on the Quant section of the GREs as I would have liked despite scoring in the 99th percentile for Verbal- What's more? Although my curriculum was vigorous and I used to tutor algebra as an undergrad, I tested out of statistics through the AP program while I was in high school. Meaning I lacked additional the verification that I can handle the statistically heavy portions of the doctoral program- I am confident that I can- I'm not bad at math- I just didn't study as much as I should have for the exam. Consequently I didn't get into the program. The president of the program encouraged me to reapply, and I'm working hard to improve my math score, but that still leaves me in my current position for another year. 

Today, I discovered that I make less than 1/3rd what the rest of the people at my office make. Although I'm the only creative, my salary technically has me living below middle class income. I own a home, have savings and make enough to get by. My boyfriend has promised to help ""take care of me"" if I ever need it- although the idea of him paying for my expenses makes my skin crawl. The rest of my job is fine. It's a definite improvement from my last role. But there's quite a bit of drama at my office and I can feel under appreciated- discovering how little I am paid in contrast with the rest of the team only intensified that feeling. Likewise, everyone but me was invited on a trip with our president to New York in a few weeks, while I am expected to stay back at the office. Most days I work 10-12 hour days with a 20 minute lunch break. So I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. 

Looking back on the past two years of my life, I can't shake the feeling that my best years are behind me. The girl I was in college wouldn't have forgotten to attach that email. She wouldn't make 1/3rd of the rest of her team, and she would have studied more of the GREs to secure admittance to the program of her dreams. She'd be engaged by now, not dating a man whom she loved dearly, but can't commit to a point in his life when he can finally leave this tiny town she hates. She'd have more friends, be more involved, and be winning awards for her work or at least be able to afford traveling. Her friends wouldn't ask her ""what happened to you?"" when asking about her plans for the future like she'd recently undergone a botched heart transplant. I realize I was lucky to have had all of the good fortune I experienced in my early 20s, but I don't want to accept that all of my successes are behind me. Is this just a part of growing up? What should I do? How do I reconnect with the person I used to be?",26Jul2019,1
167,"UPDATE: Yesterday I got home and said hey, ignored by my dad. A few mins later he comes upstairs to ask if I needed my car in the morning. I love 3 miles from my work, I didn’t need it but it’s far more convenient for me to drive. Don’t ask why I drive in a city. I like to. 

Come to find out its afternoon. My car isn’t home, my dad is at a suburban hotel, that he spent Money on and presumably fucking some girl. 

So I had to ride my bike to work and be without my car all day so he could go do one thing for work and fuck some bitch on the way home. 



I’m 23 years old, my parents are together, I’m one of 5 children. Second oldest child, oldest boy. 

I grew up in a middle income home through high school. By the time I was in college my parents were living in a $1-2m home. 


*Im not sure if any of the above matters, I just wanted to provide as much detail as possible*

I’m not even sure where to start, but my father has been cheating on my mother for approximately 15 years, that I know of. I mean seriously cheating - cheating is cheating, but in this case we’re talking payments for cars; random payments here and there, dozens, **DOZENS** of partners, etc. 

Growing up my parents often fought, I never knew why. Now I do. It caused stress on everyone my mom used to threaten to call DCFS on us and give us up for the littlest things we did wrong, think: kids being kids (we were ages 2-10 at the time). 

I began to understand it all when I saw my father on match.com as an 8 year old.  He was using the family computer. I honestly couldn’t believe it and didn’t sleep for months. I was naive and thought maybe he did this for business purposes to gain clients for his law firm. 

It went on for years he even rented an apartment for a decade or more, that was secret. But I knew, and I even explored it. 

Things that hurt me:

Him spending money on these women, dozens of them, while I slept on a couch in the living room from 5th grade on. This didn’t just strain me but also the rest of the family; my bedroom was the living room. I got made fun of for this in high school too. Never grew up with any privacy. 

I love working out and my parents kinda refused to buy me a gym membership growing up. I remember getting sad about it and ultimately using a fake ID to join a gym as a teen. 

Complete lack of a sense of family, example my father spent 4-5 days this past week “working” in AZ with chick. 

It’s honestly been so upsetting to me and caused me many many sleepless nights as a kid. As a 2nd thru 4th grader. I always went to sleep laid in bed as sometimes cried wondering if I should ask my mom if everything was ok. Cause on my dad match.com profile it said divorced. My mom knew of the cheating btw.  I still Live at home and can’t decide if I should just leave my family behind, move on and never talk to them again. 

Another thing that makes me really sad is I’d often see tickets to a sporting event on the counter, my dad would then bring a “client”. Nothing got me more hopeful than going to watch a sport with dad. 

Other small things, that still bug me are things like him taking me to my baseball game as a kid, but instead of watching hed be talking to other women. 

It made correction hard, I was always mad and When he corrected me I was alway even more mad. 

It made school hard, I lost focus and motivation sometimes, but as many know even a week or 2 I’m a semester that you’re not 100% KILLS, it absolutely kills. That’s why I was a 3.0 student. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do sometimes I want to love him and my family but sometimes I want to just leave and never talk to my family again. Just do my own thing pave my own path. 

And whenever there is issue with money, I get extremely mad, and upset. 

Example, my lifelong passion has been woodworking, since I was a toddler. My parents on my college graduation “gave” me a saw, they never ended up getting it so about a year later I bought the gear. The other day he yelled at me and said who gave you permission to take over the garage with the equipment. It honestly made me so sad and upset because. When they said they’d give me a saw I was honestly one of the greatest days ever a GREAT gift that I will love and use from the people who watched me work on my craftsmanship over the years. 

If we really didn’t have money I’d be more understanding , but it’s just the way that he sends Zelle payments a few hundred dollars to like 10 different girls it seems like every other day, and also was paying $1600 a month for an apartment basically to fuck girls in. 


Now, if you read this far don’t assume clickbait. I said I failed as a son and a brother. Here’s how I failed as a son: I am very temperamental, stubborn, didn’t get great grades, rude, etc. I failed as a brother keeping my fathers actions from them. I tried the longest to shield them, cover his tracks etc.  try to keep the family together. 15 years ago, dad was my best friend. We didn’t bond over the years and I get incredibly sad seeing real father / son relationships. 

***Now there’s one catch to all this:   I don’t know factually, but, I believe my father may have been sexually abused as a child*** 

At one point he made a reference to his brother fucking him up the ass. He never was too close with that brother and when he died, he didn’t seem terribly bothered. We were actually driving back to college for my senior year when he got the news. 

Does anyone have any advice?",26Jul2019,5
168,"So when I get friendly with people or know them for a while, I like to be touchy. Like, I touch their hair, poke their cheek, hug them from behind, snuggle with friends(mostly girls because girls are cute except me), and basically I like to be all cuddly and shit. 
So I have this therapist ""team"" and one meeting I was sitting next to this one girl and I kept touching her hair and face. We had known each other for nearly two years, so I thought it was ok and I never even had a thought that she might be uncomfortable. I had only recently become touchy with my team, like in the past few weeks and stuff. When my grandma was driving me home she pointed it out and said I should be more careful cause she seemed uncomfortable. I felt really bad after that and I guess I try to be less touchy with people now, to everyone(except my family), even my teacher who I literally see as a mom, it's weird but I even kiss her on the cheek but it's not too weird since we're both girls and we do a 1 on 1 class(I hate peers). I know I should just out right ask them if they're okay with it but I know they'll probably just say yes cause they want to be ""polite"", even if they are uncomfortable. Recently I made up a test that I would put my hand under someone's chin and if they put their chin on it, they're probably okay with contact, or even like it as much as I do. If they pull away they're probably uncomfortable, and I'm still not sure what this is supposed to say but when they don't do anything they might not care? 
Anyway, the point of this is that I wanna know if there's any legit test out there that may or may not involve body language or something that can tell if the person is actually uncomfortable or not?",26Jul2019,2

170,"Hey, My daughter hasn't been the best listener for the longest time.

 Ever since she has been a kid, she never listens to anything anyone tells her. She always wants to do all the stupid stuff her friends are doing, copy her friend's lifestyles and even start acting like them when we're at home and it's very annoying. Her friends are the type that is like ""OH, I never study"" then when the results come, they're on top of the class. She copies them and well...you know. We tell her to put in the effort and she keeps saying that her friends never study so she won't. Every time we say something, she's always like but this person does it and that person BUT she's the main point of the conversation but she always tries to make herself better by saying others do it.

She doesn't know a thing about responsibility, she acts like everything in the world doesn't matter and it's frankly irritating(she recently lost her phone and she didn't even know she lost it till a kind stranger returned it to her). 

The main reason why I'm worried is because, she is going to college in a year and from the way she's behaving, I doubt she'll survive there. or maybe, I'm the problem with not understanding her.

171,"Hey y'all, here's a little back story.
I was homeless for 2 years in rainy old Oregon before I got the place that I'm at now. It's one of the best houses and locations in my town, I live with my best friends and a rad guy who owns the place. I've been here for a little under 6 months and things have been a bit bumpy and is getting far worse really quickly. lately everyone has been blaming me for things going on around the house. The dogs getting sick and them shitting all over the wood floor, even tho I wasn't home when it happened. I denied having any part in it and Connor, my best friend fucking SNAPPED. He start screaming at me, calling me worthless, pathetic, that I don't do shit for anybody or anything. Then slammed the door and started hitting shit.  Then the couch got peed on by the cat and I got blamed for that, he and his GF were ranting at me about how I never lifted a finger to help, when I was the only one actually trying to clean the cushions. They've been demanding I get them shit, and when I say no they get furious and start giving me massive shit. Our landlord came back from Oklahoma recently and even though I did all my chores plus theirs, I still got the shit end of the stick and got an earful. Even when I forget to do something and I'm reminded I go and finish that before I do any pleasure wise. As soon as I remind them they say they'll do it and just don't. Then when I ask them again they scream and huff and puff. My mental state is sinking down because I have no one to talk to about my daily issues, mainly involving the house, because if I were to talk to them about how I feel I get turned into the bad guy.

175,"My partner and I moved into our apartment a few weeks ago and the mailbox was filled to the brim with mail for previous tenants, and new mail for them was still coming in. Well, we put a thing in our mailbox stating to only deliver mail to the names of my partner and myself. Furthermore, because of the sheer amount of mail for the previous tenants that accumulated, we decided to put it in a grocery bag and take it down to the post office. We explained to them that they all needed to be returned to sender because they were previous tenants. Well, guess what. Today, we got a bunch of the SAME exact mail in our box with nice little stickers that say ""Unable to forward/for review""...the same mail we dropped off less than a week ago.

A few days ago, he sent me a message very angry because he thought I had made a vague tumblr post about him (I didn't). After clearing that up, he continued being angry and talked about how rude and inconsiderate I had been the last time we hung out. None of what he said made any sense to me, and it came down to an issue that has been present during our entire friendship which is that he expects me to read his feelings or a situation and I'm incapable of doing that. I have told him if he has a boundary, he needs to make me aware of it, but he always replies by saying he shouldn't have to confront me or call me out all the time. I don't really consider it to be calling out to say something like ""hey, I need some space right now"" or ""I don't like jokes about x topic"", but maybe I'm wrong. My partner was present the entire time we were hanging out that day, and says that I didn't do anything rude and that they also didn't see any of the vibes that he was supposedly giving off to make me understand his feelings. He also didn't mention my partner at all--it seemed like the whole situation was my fault and my partner is completely blameless. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Basically during this argument he told me I was being overly defensive, reading meaning into what he says that's not present, and seeking validation constantly. But I feel like those are things he does all the time. He is constantly needing me to reassure him that people like him and aren't annoyed by him. He gets extremely defensive very quickly when I'm not even saying anything about him. Like a common occurrence is for me to say something in response to something he's said, and he says quickly, ""I didn't say that!"" And I have to say ""I know. I said it."" His response is usually something like ""but you said it as though it was what I believed."" I have no idea what possible tone I could be using to make him feel that way, so I have no idea how to prevent it. I have a tendency to make jokes that are a little mean. I'm not sure how else to phrase it, but I guess that's what it is. Most of my friends understand that I'm joking and don't mind, but he got really hurt by them and told me about it. So I stopped making them. I have made a concerted effort to not make them to him. But he seems to interpret every joke I make as being at his expense. I don't really know how to prevent that. I don't want to say his feelings aren't valid, but I'm trying really hard and it's not good enough. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

At the end of this particular argument, I basically just told him he didn't have to worry about me being mean to him anymore because I was done, and that he needed to give me my stuff that he has borrowed back. He replied with ""I can't believe you're punishing me for this"". I'm not trying to punish him. I'm just trying to remove myself from an unhealthy situation.

After that I got offline and took some time to cool down, then I wrote a long message explaining myself and asking that he take everything I said into consideration before contacting me again because I needed space. He replied immediately with anger because I had accused him of lying. Maybe that was unfair but I just really found something he said extremely hard to believe. I replied asking that he finish the message and read the part where I asked him to wait to contact me, and he kept typing angry messages so I blocked him. 

A few days later he texted and asked me if an Instagram post had been about him. I make art and it was a piece I had been working on for over a week. It was definitely a piece with some negative feelings (I’ve been having a hard time lately for a lot of unrelated reasons) so this fight certainly didn’t help, but it wasn’t what the piece was *about*. I obviously told him no. He said he had a long response to my message and asked if he could send it to me. I told him to email it. 

The message was apologetic. He claims to take full responsibility for being mean and aggressive to me during our fight, but he also seems to think the fight is the only reason I wanted to end our friendship. He spent a large portion of the email talking about all the things I had said that hurt him. Again, accusing him of lying which I suppose I was unfounded in doing. I told him I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him, which he took as an insult and I’m sure it’s not easy to hear but it’s true. I told him he paints himself as the victim in every situation which, again, can’t be easy to hear but I guess I found it sort of ironic that he highlighted that as something that hurt him. He also claimed I called him crazy and questioned his sanity when what I did was tell him he needs professional help. Which he does. He clearly has untreated mental illness that is affecting his relationships with people. I’ve told him I’m the past that he needs therapy for his depression and anxiety and he said he went to a therapist one time and all they did was attack him for not having a job, living at home, and not going to college. I don’t really believe that now but there are bad therapists out there so I’m not sure. 

This obviously paints him in a really bad light but I really did enjoy my time hanging out with him. He’s funny, smart, and I enjoy talking to him. We’ve had a lot of fun together. 

I feel like if he understood what he was doing he would want to stop. I think he has the capacity for growth. If I was sure he was doing this on purpose and was a malicious person, it would be a lot easier to disconnect. I’ve talked to some friends about my feelings and doubts, and they all seem to think I need to disconnect entirely. My partner claims to have seen red flags but have given him the benefit of the doubt because I liked him. Another friend thinks he took advantage of me (I drove him places because he doesn’t have a car and I bought him meals a lot. He has so little money that sometimes he eats one meal a day and I’m doing fine so of course I wanted to buy food for my friend). But with people who already care about me, of course they’ll take my side because they don’t like to see me upset. I would really like to get some perspective from people who are outside the situation. Do you think it’s worth trying again?",26Jul2019,1

I have looked at places like indeed/ohiomeansjobs/monster/colleges job website looking for a start in the engineering field and no company wants a unexperienced engineer.  Every company for ENTRY level wants multiple years experience also with a background in X or Y that seems super uncommon since I haven’t even had classes that have discussed the programs. I have two classes this upcoming semester that start after 5 p.m. only two days a week which would be the perfect opportunity for me to gain some experience in the field.

I was shocked I feel like I look at him differently even tho I was born in the early early 2000’s and I’ve lived with him all my life, he’s been like heavily catholic ever since I was a child and lately I’ve been wanting to ask about it but it’s weird and I feel like he’s changed, I know he’s changed but he was 30 when this happened and he’s 54 now it’s been over 20 years, is it even right to throw his past in his faith, I also looked up court “documents” and see he requested furlough around the time I think his mother passed away but I’m not sure. Should I ask him or should I ask a family member or do I just leave it since it was over 20 years ago before me and my sisters were even born. I feel so conflicted bc he’s my hero and I feel like I just don’t even know him, but then again what makes me so conflicted is that I wonder if it’s my business bc I wasn’t even around or a thought in his head.

183,"I’ve been single for a while and I’ve started to feel really lonely lately. Tonight I was feeling lonely and horny, and so I was talking to this guy on Tinder (we have been talking for a few days, but we haven’t met in person). We added each other on Snapchat and started talking there. He sent me a dick pic (after asking for consent), and then he asked me for pics so I sent him 2 of them. I’ve never sent nudes to anyone before, so idk why I decided to do it now. I didn’t include my face or anything, and he didn’t screenshot. But after I sent it I realized that was really stupid of me to add him on my personal Snapchat that has my first and last name. I should have created a new Snapchat that didn’t show my full name. 

I feel like a slut for sending nudes to a stranger, but I’m not as concerned about a stranger seeing me naked as I am about him also having my full name. What if he finds me on other social medias and then tries to blackmail me or something? Like I said, he didn’t screenshot it, but I know there are other ways to save photos.

184,"I know people say that it’s better to have loved than have lost, but I disagree in this case.

I (21F) met my best friend nearly 5 years ago. We’ve spent so much time together and I’ve never supported and cared for anyone like I have him. I’ve met all of his friends, been there for his breakups, made it through every tough fight I’ve had with him, and countless other things. Today he sent me a message asking me where we stand and what limits we should set. He told me that he will value our friendship and respect my standpoint regardless of whether we are platonic or not, but he confessed that he believes our strong bond is stopping him from seeking relationships because a part of him hopes for us to get together romantically, though he’s not sure how it would impact our overall relationship with each other.

Here’s the thing: I’m very, very wary of romantic relationships. There are plenty of factors that stop me from seeking out romance. I’m a person who has not dated in over 2 years, and before that I had only dated once in my mid-late teens. Each ended in me being cheated on. I’ve only been kissed 2 times in my life, and once was by a girl that still has me questioning my sexuality. My life is not where I want it to be right now and want to work on that. I also have AVPD and definitely don’t think I’m emotionally healthy enough to function in a lasting, healthy relationship. I know that he would be my first choice if I felt I was ready for a relationship, but I don’t believe that I would be good enough. I don’t want to take the plunge and then lose him, or for things to change should it not work out. I’ve thought about dating him plenty of times, but there is an invisible wall in front of me that says “no” in tiny caps. I like the idea of love, but not the thought of actually getting involved with someone.

I just want him to be happy, and I don’t want to be the one holding him back from dating. I love him dearly but I don’t think I can give him what he deserves without ruining it. What should I do? I don’t know how to respond to him without confusing him.",26Jul2019,1
186,"My friend and I are both in our late 20s. I'm a woman and he's a man, if that matters. We've been friends for about 6 months, but we got really close really fast which I think was a mistake. He doesn't have many other friends, but he has a lot of stories about how he made friends with people and they turned out to be toxic and horrible. I kind of just believed this since I have had toxic friends myself, but now I'm realizing that I've had 2 toxic friends and dozens of decent ones, while it seems like everyone he's made friends with ended up being bad. But maybe I'm reading too much into it. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, he sent me a message very angry because he thought I had made a vague tumblr post about him (I didn't). After clearing that up, he continued being angry and talked about how rude and inconsiderate I had been the last time we hung out. None of what he said made any sense to me, and it came down to an issue that has been present during our entire friendship which is that he expects me to read his feelings or a situation and I'm incapable of doing that. I have told him if he has a boundary, he needs to make me aware of it, but he always replies by saying he shouldn't have to confront me or call me out all the time.

188,"So maybe someone else has been through this before but this is sort of new to me.  You need some backstory first before I get to my main question. 

A few years ago I dated this guy in high school and was really, really infatuated with him. We dated for 11 months and broke up a month shy of our anniversary. We had a lot of problems but I was devoted to him and it hit me like a freight train because I wasn’t expecting it. A few months after this happened he messaged me again trying to be friends with benefits. I was thinking maybe we were getting back together but he told me he wasn’t in it for love. I almost agreed to it anyway because I missed him like crazy, but then a mutual friend messaged me saying that he had been trying to hook up with her while we were dating but she didn’t want to break my heart by telling me. She had screenshots and everything. I had a huge fight with him and blocked him on everything I could think of. I don’t even remember what I said because I was so angry. I burned the stuff he gave me. 

Later on I met the love of my life on tinder and we got married, so my life worked out quite well after that. Over time I’ve forgiven this guy for the shitty things that happened between us and I’ve come to acknowledge that I wasn’t the perfect girlfriend I thought I was either. 

When hubby and I married we moved out of state for him to finish school, and we have just now moved back since he graduated. Now that I’m back I’m seeing old friends again and I have run into this old boyfriend twice now. The first time we glanced at each other and didn’t talk. Tonight was the second time, at my friends’ performance in Newsies. He happened to come back to see it again too tonight so we saw each other again. This time I said “hey,” as I passed and he said it back, then immediately left to go do something else to avoid me I assume.

The thing that’s eating me up is I think he feels like I still hate him. And for some reason that really bothers me. I don’t know why. I feel like I shouldn’t care so much about what he thinks. But I really really just want to tell him that I forgive him, and I’m sorry too, and I hope he’s doing well. That’s it. I don’t want to try to be friends or anything because there’s too much history. I just want to make peace. This urge for closure is eating me up inside and it has been ever since I saw him last week.

when she passed away i fell into a bad case of depression where i didnt want to do anything other then just try to ""get away"" through games and reading(no suicidal thoughts but just alot of stress and not wanting to be there) after she passed my nephew moved in with a friend while me and my dad moved out to one of his friends houses that offered us a room.unfortunatly shortly after moving out there our only multiperson vehicle broke down needing repairs while we still had a motorcycle to get to stores and other places. sadly with the depresstion i had i kinda wasted away and lost a bunch of the stamina i used to have especially considering i have asthma. i was also unable to look for a job since i was basically stuck 15minutes out of town with no ride that could take me to a job and back and without as much stamina i wasnt even sure i could hold down a job unless it was like an office job i could sit at a computer.

a few years later we have finally moved out of that friends house but its again to another out of town house(10min away) and have still yet to get a working multiperson vehicle. my dad also lost about a sixth of his disability check due to hitting retirement age(seems dumb to me that he gets less just cause he got 1 year older when literally nothing else had changed it was also very abrupt since they didnt mail the notice til after they cut the amount) im finally starting to get over my depression a bit but cant work up any motivation since i dont see how i can help out any being stuck out here with no vehicle/license and no job experience.

In our last fight I mentioned how she hasn't changed enough and was weak and still had really bad social anxiety. I talked about how I was so great and had changed and done so much for her sake, but really I was just pointing out her flaws. When she started dating me she came out of an abusive relationship and was severely anxious and depressed. At the time I was quite bipolar and my ADHD was untreated. We were a wreck. Everytime I blamed it on her and how she was too scared to have sex with me and how she would be better off with another less scummy guy, then a guy with a high sex drive who can't control it like me. I would often berate her and tell her that she needs to get over her problems. Without understanding her side and her struggle at all. I feel like a piece of shit and I don't know what to do.

Okay so there's cats that live in the area. In the alley I keep hearing kitten mews (first night I've heard them so they have been there for a bit I'm assuming since i don't know when kittens start to meow, if not they are just born today). I went outside to check and once I got in the alley they stayed quiet. I saw a bigger cat roaming across the street so I'll assume it's momma. I obviously know I shouldn't try to catch them. I just don't want anything happening to them since cars drive through here. I have a good idea where they are, either in the bushes at the bottom of a tree or under the duplex.

Should I avoid feeding them? I want to catch them when they are older and get them fixed since outdoor cats are terrible for the environment. How old is old enough to get fixed? Or should I just straight up leave them alone till they decide to leave this area and hope for the best?

I'm used to catching and fixing cats with my family but right now it's just me. I have trouble ignoring animals outside especially if I think they need help, but if it's best for me to leave them alone completely let me know! Thank you!  If I didn't word this right feel free to ask and I will clarify anything.",26Jul2019,3
199,"So the story is we all work in a restaurant.

Anyway, tbh they’re both attractive and I’d be down for a ménage à trois but I don’t think that’s their thing.

In any case, tonight she started kind of heavily flirting and then at one point asked me to do something I didn’t totally feel like doing and I said something like “You’re lucky you’re cute” and it kinda spiraled from there for a bit, then she backed up and said she was just kidding and she was just playing games, so I was like ok sure me too.

Title says it all

Straight to the point GPA is a 2.53

I had a rough freshman year, but recovered by making the dean's list twice, then father was unemployed 2x and had trouble finding work due to his drinking, and pulled out 150k in debt and put 70k on my mother without her consent. I didnt pull out debt to focus on school because I was afraid of being in the financial predicament, and chose to work overtime while in school, since I had to take immense financial responsibility since I was 20 with all the ""grown up"" expenses (rent, tuition, insurance,and food) I never drinked, smoked, partied, or even engage in a relationship just to not emulate my father. After taxing myself as an independent, and qualifying for more financial need based grants, I got my tuition so low to the point I can pay it in cash. This coming semester its $786.50 for 17 credits.

To express myself, I turned to research as an outlet, and have been published 2x in the field of robotic surgery, and working on my 3rd first author publication to be presented in Japan at an international conference paper in endoscopy.

I got one more semester left, and my mentor at Harvard Med, is telling me in order for me to be qualified for graduate school I need to make a 4.0 GPA to outweigh the result, but regardless, if I did, my overall will be a 3.25ish GPA.

I know there is hope, but I feel defeated and scared with the knowledge of the potential of the GPA.

I'm sorry if this is alot of information, and don't want to come off as desperate, but I need advice. Any will be great thanks.

210,"(tl;dr at the end)

I (19F) just got through my first year of college at a really small liberal arts school and I had a really difficult time getting motivated and finishing assignments. Because of this, I now have a 1.8 GPA and lost my state scholarships and $26k scholarship that was given by my college. I’ve always been the “breadwinning” child out of my other 2 siblings and I really don’t want to disappoint my family, but I also think the won’t really understand why I did so poorly, although I know I really fucked up.

The issue was that I really just didn’t feel like I belonged at that school, and it was only 20 minutes away from home, so there were multiple days each week after I finished my classes for the day that my mom would ask me to watch my (14F) special needs sister while mom was at work (this usually meant spending ~4 hours at home and cooking dinner for my family).

There were several days, and a couple of weeks, where I just stayed in bed all day and skipped classes. In my second semester I stopped attending one of my classes after spring break because I embarrassed myself in front of the class when I was unprepared for an assignment and I just had too much anxiety to go back.

The thing is that I aced most of my exams, but my failing grades came from me not doing assignments and missing classes. I think for a while I was having really bad existential OCD and I just couldn’t figure out why anything really mattered and found no reason to make an effort in school. 

So now, I’m living with my mom and sister, and my whole family is pressuring me to find another college to enroll in. I told them the reason I wasn’t returning to my other school was because it just wasn’t a good school and I didn’t like the community. My mom wants me to enroll in a community college or state school nearby so I can stay at home and take care of my sister but I honestly hate living here and don’t have the best relationship with my mom so it’s tense all the time and I feel like I’ve been more of a parent to my sister the past few months than she’s been. My mom won’t even consider me moving out and living with my dad (1 hour away) and going to school in his area.

Amongst all of this, I really just want to find a job and save up enough to get a cheap apartment and then enroll in a community college in the winter/spring semester and pay for it all so I can avoid telling my parents I lost my scholarship. My mom keeps saying I need to go to college and I really need to figure out a way to tell her I’m not going to do what she wants me to and distance myself from her.

tl;dr: Ended my first year of college with a 1.8 GPA and lost some much needed scholarships and haven’t told my family; want to put college off for a least a semester but my family is pushing me to enroll and my living situation with my mom is making all of this really difficult.",26Jul2019,4
211,"I am a college student and realize that I may be under stress a lot of the time, but I have a horrible habit of biting at my nails (and skin around the nails) and picking at scabs on my body. 

At one point in my life I was able to stop biting my nails using the bad tasting stuff but as soon as I stopped using it, I slowly began to bite them again. It would start with just 1 nail, then 2, and now it's all of them. And once they get all frayed, it makes it even easier to want to bite them. I have tried getting acrylic nails in the past but they just ruin my nails even more and are honestly too expensive.

My second, more severe and embarrassing problem is picking at scabs. I have had a scab on my head for over a year now because I keep picking at it and it ends up bleeding, becoming hard, and then I pick at it again. This isn't a form of self harm that I do, it's just a bad habit that I picked up at some point. The real problem is that I will pop a pimple on my face and then it will scab and then I pick at the scab and then the cycle just goes on...

214,"I’m a female Executive in a field predominantly run by men. I only say this because in the 20+ yrs I’ve been doing my job, I’ve developed pretty thick skin and have learned to let a lot of comments / behavior slide. That said, I attended a team meeting a couple of months ago. There were many departments represented, including a newer individual in a different department, but comparable level position to mine. Many people in the field had opined him as being “gross” and “inappropriate”, but I hadn’t witnessed it firsthand....until this trip. He was in my face, grabbing me, pulling me into him, being completely unprofessional and inappropriate. I’m sorry to say I completely froze, in part to being off guard but mostly not wanting to cause a bigger scene. All I could do was ignore and try to squirm away. There were no less than 8 other co-workers who watched, witnessed, and later expressed their concern and disgust, yet did nothing to assist in curbing or distracting the behavior. I was completely embarrassed and uncomfortable, both of which are hard levels to get me to. I got through the rest of the week, and made it a point to ‘heads up’ my HR partner when I returned to the office. His boss was also made aware by someone who I confided in the next day (wanted her to stick by me the remainder of the trip) but wasn’t present this particular night. I should note, I had all intentions of speaking with his boss, but didn’t want to do so until we wrapped up / returned from the meetings. When I learned he knew, I decided not to make a scene over it. His boss never mentioned it to me, even though we have regular contact. HR followed up 2 months later (this week) and said they were going to speak with him. I assume they did because I am now being treated as a ghost. It’s a weird position because I have to interact with this individual in order to do my job. The company I work for is very much a ‘good ‘ole boys’ club, one that I worked very hard in to move up to where I am, and I’m now feeling shunned and disregarded. For instance, we had another meeting this week which obviously led to dinner / extra-curricular activities. Planned, in part, by this individual. I wasn’t even invited or told of the plans. Both my HR rep and his boss were present, and had minimal (necessary) conversation with me. Additionally, and I know this is all me, I’m floored that they and other Executives who either witnessed or were made aware are interacting with him as though it’s business as usual. It irritates and hurts me. Even HR seems as though this is something they ‘had’ to address, given the amount of time it took and seemingly indifferent interaction with him, as opposed to it being the right thing to do. I feel like the people who matter are painting me as the bad guy, and I don’t know how to get over this or what to do. Thoughts??",26Jul2019,0

217,"I left high school wanting to be a tech-entrepreneur and help teach people music. I decided to study electrical engineering (EE) as it covers hardware and software. 

1st Year: Studying at the University of Washington. I picked UW because of its intense academic curriculum and ability to help me be apart of startups and research labs. As I started to act on this, I realized that the student body is pretty dead here. A lot of studying. Not a lot of partying and if there is a party, its typical students getting SUPER sloshed or a small group drinking and getting sad. Not a whole lot of fun. At the end of the year, I had to apply for my electrical engineering spot and got rejected (meaning I couldn't studying EE there). The students are pretty closed up as that's the Seattle Freeze culture. 

2nd Year: Because I couldn't study EE at UW, I left for a small private university which we'll just call UU. At UU, the education was GARBAGE and everything was based upon participation. This compromised the entire reason I picked UW (the academic rigor) and I was a bit thrown off. Regardless, the parties were AWESOME! I didn't drink but I met a bunch of cool and awesome people that really care for me and we played a lot of fun games every day. Often they would wake me up at 2 AM to wrestle in sumo suits and play Smash Bros. Super fun! The students open up really easily because the school is so small. But again, I learned actually nothing because the instructors were very poor. This does bother me because I want to actually learn EE. In the fall, I was accepted into UW's EE program. 

UW: \~7000 students / class. About 40,000 in undergrad. Great education. Poor social scene.

UU: Like \~900 students / class. \~4,000 students in undergrad. Poor education. Great social scene.

Cost is the same.

I am so fortunate to have the decision between these two schools but I do have to decide: return to UW and get a very strong education and degree but not fit in with the crowd and feel pretty unhappy about my social scene or stay at UU and have fun with all my friends but be unhappy with the education?",26Jul2019,1

219,"Recently I've started problems. 

-Mom(36-38 years old)
-Dad(36 years old)
-Me(16 years old)
-Cousin J(19 years old)
-Boyfriend(16 years old)

 I had told my boyfriend that my dad had came into the bathroom while I was showering to wash my back, and it had made me uncomfortable but I didn't say anything to make him stop because I have problems saying no and stop that and felt like I would be lectured I guess for it. My boyfriend had then told his grandma(I'm not really mad at anyone for this) and his grandma told the principal who then called CPS(we are currently in Summer school). 

Cps shows up either a few days later or a week or two later at my dad's/grandma's(Y family) house asking to see me. She had called an hour before because she had shown up at my mom's/grandpa's house(C family) to talk to me but I was at Y family's house to do a small job(Pick up hay/straw after the goats for money). When the caseworker showed up, my dad was the one to meet her first to which he comes to the backyard and says he's done. 

I go to meet her and i start explaining what happens. My grandma(Y family) follows me and tries to say that it was a different case(another case happened back in 2014 where my dad washed both my back and my vagina even though it made me VERY uncomfortable) and that my dad didnt even do anything but it was my mom's ex husband that did that. The caseworker shut that down real quick and my grandma started getting pissed off more and threatened to stop me from working any small jobs anymore over there and when I said okay. She turned nice really quick towards me and the caseworker. 

At some point she leaves and the caseworker starts asking me questions about what happened with my mom. I explain that she fast walk towards me with a butter knife(She came at me with a large knife. I changed this to butter knife because I didn't want her in bigger trouble) after we got into an argument about how she owed me 10 dollars and she said that she owed me 5 and how she's in debt. My reply back to her being in debt was,""You put yourself in that position. "" I shouldn't have said that, but it's in the past ig. But after that argument, I went towards my room and she came after me with the knife which resulted with me crying and backing up the stairs. 

After explaining all of that, the caseworker says that she doesnt feel safe to believe that I(OP) at home or at my grandma's is safe enough for me so she asks me if I have a relative that lives in Tacoma and I reply with yes but my mom doesnt talk to her So Idk if she'll take me in.  So we get law enforcement and I'm approved for a foster care thingy. The whole time my mom is pissed off saying that I just caused trouble for the family and that im always causing trouble. 

When i get to the place, my phone gets taken away and honestly I have to say that it felt good to be cut off my both sides of my family. While im 'stuck' in the place, my mom starts texting my boyfriend saying that cps is just a place for ripping families apart and that she and my family wont get to see me again. She starts blaming him for telling the principal, and lying to my famoly saying that CPS is going to ship me off to North Carolina where one of my aunts lives. 

When i finally got a meeting to see if I can go home or if I stay in foster care for another week or something, everyone in the call said that im okay to go home. My heart felt heavy and I start crying. I really didnt want to leave the foster care place, it was honestly better than home. So i had to mentally prepare to get yelled at by my grandparents and my Mom. 

But when i get home, my mom and my grandparents were quiet. It felt weird and uncomfortable to be home honestly. I stayed like 10-30minutes inside the house before my Older cousin J comes and picks me up to see me. We go back to my aunts house and I sleep over for the night. My aunt R offered to have me live at her house since I told them what happened. My aunt and J started sayinf that my mom was dramatic and boy crazy(She moved me, and my two brothers to california and to las vegas for a Narcissistic boyfriend) 

When I get home, I pretend everything is fine and that nothing happened. So when I go and talk to my mom, she's brooding and asking why am I pretending things are alright? Because of me, CPS almost took my brothers away from her, and that everyone in the house is traumatized. Even my uncle(He has 3 little boys) is being investigated. She starts 'ranting' and saying that she feels like an outcast like back in Cali(Bf's mom didnt like her so she treated her like shit).

 I told her that I'm going to leave now(I had planned to go meet up with boyfriend cause he isnt allowed to be at my house anymore) and her reply was that i was going to sit here and talk since that was what my social worker said. I told her that I was not going to sit there and talk until we have a counselor with us or until you have a therapist. 

My mom then says,""Im the one that needs the therapist or are you the one that needs the therapist?""

I reply with,""You need a therapist because you have a bipolar disorder. I need a therapist and we need to talk to a counselor."" Before leaving. 

When I go over to my boyfriend's, I look up jobs and start feeling like shit. I cant seem to find any jobs. I've tried every place that hires 16 year olds, and I cant seem to get an interview. I can't even pay for my own phone or my own food or my own clothes. I cant seem to get a job, and I've caused problems for my family again and I have no idea if I have insurance or not.

222,"I moved into a new apartment complex about two weeks ago. It's a smaller, older complex with about 50 units surrounding a pool and commons area in a trendy neighborhood of a major city. I thought the place, while older, would be a nice place for the price; however, there is a group of 5\~10 tenants that likes to play loud music in the commons area and hang out, especially on the weekends, but it could be any day of the week. By loud, I mean that the sound fills my living room and keeps me from watching my own TV, listening to my own music, etc. This happens 4-5 days a week, and goes on for usually 4-5 hours, sometimes longer, and it is always grating to me, even if I don't always complain. Anyway, after putting up with it for a few weeks, one Sunday afternoon I decided to ask, as politely as I could, for them to turn down their music. They refused, so I notified the management (who are not on site) and asked if it was serious enough to put in a noise complaint. They were very sympathetic to my concerns and came to ask them to turn it down (this kind of noise is a clear violation of the community rules in the lease). All good so far. But, the next week, on a Thursday night at 10pm, they were at it again, and when I went out to ask if they could turn it down, they ganged up on me, yelling over me and shouting me down, saying things like ""who the fuck do you think you are! You just move in and think you can change the place!"" and calling me a ""bigot."" After being yelled over for a few minutes, I gave up and walked away, and called the property manager and let them know what was going on. They came and closed down the commons and dispersed them, but later called me to ask if I had said any insensitive things. I guess the other tenants accused me of being racist in the way I asked them to turn down their music to the property manager (some of them were POC, and I am white). While I am open to reevaluating my potential bias, I can't pinpoint anything I said that I think could be racially insensitive. I get the sense they are trying to intimidate me into ceasing my noise complaints, and I expect they will continue to make lots of noise. I don't know if I can go on coping with this amount of noise, but at the same time, I don't know if I can handle the stress of an all-out conflict with a group of other tenants. What should I do? Is it too much to ask to not play the music on weeknights? Should I escalate the conflict, or try to deescalate?",26Jul2019,4

225,"Just a little information for reference— I never wanted a big ceremony or reception. My fiancée said he wanted to at least have a big party with our friends and family to celebrate (IE a fucking reception). So I figured we might as well have a ceremony right before. 

From the get go, I decided it would be only our parents invited to the ceremony. My fiancé agreed to any stipulations about the wedding as long as we can have the reception.    

We’re inviting a little under 80 people, 95% of which are family. I wanted to keep it as small as possible as I have severe anxiety, but I am also trying to keep it balanced and not have anyone feeling left out or butt hurt.

Now, I’m in the process of wrapping up most of the wedding planning, and about to hunker down and buy invitations. My fiancé and I went over to my dad’s house to visit and drink a few beers out by the pool. A few hours later, while discussing what florist we will we using, he abruptly says he is going to need me to invite 8 of his friends and also my step mom’s sister (she is married with four kids, by the way).. so 14 extra people that I hardly know.

A little relevant background— my paternal grandfather did something similar with my mom and dad’s wedding. He’s a business owner, and invited a bunch of other business owners from the area to *their* wedding. All in all it was about 100 people. None of my grandparents offered any financial assistance for their wedding.    Obviously my dad is not doing anything half as horrendous, but it’s worth mentioning.

What is really complicating this issue is the fact that only a week or two prior he had given me some money to go toward the wedding. It almost feels like that was bribe money to get what he wants.    It’s worth mentioning that my parents have been divorced since I was 7 (I turned 30 today) and is therefore estranged from my mother’s side of the family. Though I do sympathize with this awkwardness, is it really too much to ask that he sucks it up for one day?

If it’s relevant, I haven’t cashed my dad’s check yet, nor do I really need the money.

Please please give me advice.",26Jul2019,1

227,"This past spring, I finished my associates degree at a community college with honors, graduating with a 4.0 GPA in a general studies degree. I went to a community college to get a better understanding of ""who I was"" or ""who I wanted to be"" as a person.

Well, 2 years later and I still don't have those answers. I applied to a university and got in, and they offered me an academic scholarship where I wouldn't have to pay for tuition while attending. However, I've talked to friends about it and they came to the conclusion ""a free degree in what?"". I took a wide variety of courses at my previous community college and I wouldn't say any particularly clicked.

Fast forward to now, this summer and upcoming fall, it's time for me to make a decision on what is happening next. I have several options that I'll list below. I guess what I'm looking for is some insight from some other minds and take in all the information so I can make the best decision I can.

I'm from the United States by the way. Wasn't sure if that was clear.

Stay in my hometown, continue living at home and attend university for free with no direction in terms of major. (No clue what I'd study, I might FORCE myself to study business)

Stay in my hometown, take a year off of school and work full time. This is probably the worst option, because I've been having this growing feeling inside of me that I absolutely need to leave my hometown. A growing number of factors have contributed to this. If I wasn't attending school here, I think I'd want to do anything I could to leave.

Move to somewhere new, work full time there while I ""find myself"". This would include having to pay rent, my own food, etc. I would gain more freedom and life experience while hopefully trying to find things I enjoy and discover ""my passion"".

This one is kind of the same as 3, I would be moving in with grandparents who live on in island. I'd live with them and work full time in the town they live in. This would get me out of my hometown, allow a ton of freedom, give me the ability to care for them in their older age, and I wouldn't have to pay rent/for food/etc. I've always loved spending time where they live and the ocean/mountains have always called to me.

Enlist in the military for four years. This would force me to ""grow up"", I would get paid, travel, and meet people from all over the world who may give insight on what I should do in my life.

I'm just looking for a little advice here on what to do with the next steps of my life. Any and all is greatly appreciated. Thank you. I'll be active replying to comments as well as DM's if anyone wants to have a conversation about his.",26Jul2019,1

230,This is a throwaway. Recently my friends and I have become worried about our friends erratic behavior I’ll call him A. A posts odd Facebook updates where he either types out seemingly incoherent thoughts or he posts videos along the same lines. Our one friend recently met up with A and he revealed that A was homeless and has been using all of his money to sleep at motels or other locations when he has the petty cash and sleeping in the woods when he doesn’t. He hasn’t had a job for a while but I don’t believe he qualifies for unemployment in our state Pennsylvania after looking up the guidelines online. Our friend also revealed that A’s distant family has tried to help him but they all say he doesn’t want to be helped. He doesn’t have any family in the area to go to and we’re all young so we don’t have the proper means to help him find somewhere to live. He went to a doctor to test for any psychological diseases but couldn’t afford the blood test because he doesn’t have insurance. I’m worried that A will keep spiraling out of control and I have no idea how to help him.,26Jul2019,2
231,"22 year old [F].  I’ve been attending University for 1.5 years now. My first semesters were absolutely horrible in which I failed and was put on Academic probation. 

Probation allowed me to continue attending school as long as I earned a 2.0 GPA for 2 semesters in a row. If I fell under a 2.0 then I will be suspended from the University for 1 year and would have to redo my application process in order to get accepted again. 

My first semesters were pretty bad academically because I didn’t really have a desire or any goals, I was in the College of Science, just to be safe, and mostly out of my family’s expectations of being expected to go go College. I very much wanted to go to college but studying something something I didn’t want to in the college of Science was excruciatingly draining— so I failed 2 semesters in a row.  And I could honestly say I deserved to fail because I didn’t really try in any of my classes. 

I’ve always loved art and so I then decided to change my major to Design in the school of Architecture and my next semester I got a 3.3 and this changed everything, because I was so great full I finally found something that was my perfect fit! I was able to dream much bigger for what I wanted my future to look like, and set up my goals to help me get there. Because I did a major change I have 2 semesters left of pre-requisites to apply for an Architecture program and if I get accepted that’s another 4 semesters- so my expected graduation would be 2023 if things go well. 

Now my 4th semester (2nd semester since I changed my major) I am Currently attending part time taking 1 class,  Calculus II, and I’m on the verge of failure, my semester is done in 1 week and I have told nobody that I’m about to fail. Because my job is dependent on how I do in school, if I fail l I will lose my job, and become suspended for 1 year.  I still continue to go to tutoring and I understand the material, but I just feel so depressed because I’m actually doing everything in my power to not fail and I already  know the outcome because I have already calculated my  “what if scores” even if I get a perfect score on my final I would not pass with a C, which is all I need. 

Everyone thinks I’m so happy and that I’m doing really well but I am extremely terrified, beyond expectation and I just have so much anxiety, because this is actually something I want to excel in. And I don’t know what to do especially because I’ve actually put in my own savings to pay for school and everything is on the line from just 1 class and I don’t want this failure to reflect on what I am capable of.",26Jul2019,1

OK, so i been recovering from a severely abusive relationship living in my uncles house for just under a year, let me live rent free immediately after the craziness with my crazy ex, 3 months in starts chargin rent on room no problem, increases ever other month no problem, gets to point 3 months ago ok need market value on apartment. (so room renting to full apartment renting) me: ok just paid for room but you got it you saved my ass...get a roomate whats a reasonable deal? ...ok deal ill find a roommate""

now got my boy, a trade union kid, to take the other room, even though the apartment  isnt market ready and still basivally a construction zone. as a favor he moves in despite that, pays at the idea of helpin me help my uncle and its gunna be finished in a week or so anyways. thats june 1.

its now july 26, nothing has been fixxed yet, its just the front room fucked up the rest is fine (my uncle works his ass off he isnt some loaded shmuck he does alot of the work himself.) but, we went 4 days without water due to a busted pipe, which i understand nobody saw coming, the construction hasnt been touch so its still a problem, and now the utilities which were suppose to be included in the price hes trying to put in my name as hes taken his off of them. he came after the move in date of june 1 to take furniture he left behind, which in Mass is illegal. i smoothed it over by takin the heat from both sides just to keep the ball rolling.

whose side do i take, my boy has the law on our side heavily, yet my uncle is struggling, did save my ass, and told me to explain the situation. i did and thats why my boy agreed off the bat. yet its now been 2 months, no progress, no lease, and my boy is hitting the roof talkin bout withholding rent callin the city etc. still no front room, and trying to force the utilies on us. this fucks me either way. the relationship with my uncle is important to me, and the deal is the low end of market price, but still market. this is Boston.",26Jul2019,1
240,"This is a throwaway account as few of my friends and family members are familiar with my main reddit account and I don’t really want them seeing this.

Alright, so I’m 18 years old and I graduated high school around a month ago. My parents, ever since I got my first phone, when I was 14, so in grade 8, have not allowed me to keep my phone in my bedroom overnight, as they assume that I’ll stay up all night using it. I think this is absolutely fair, for a 14 year old, but even now, at my age, they still enforce this rule. Every night before I go to bed, I’m expected to place my phone in my father’s office to charge. His logic is “Well I don’t keep my phone in my bedroom, so you shouldn’t either. Nobody keeps their phone in their bedroom overnight.” I told him that this was completely untrue as most people I know, adults and children alike, keep their charger and phone in their bedroom. His response is usually “well nobody in THIS HOUSE keeps their phone in their room overnight.” To which I responded “yes, because you choose not to yourself, but you’re not even giving me the choice, I’m 18 years old.”

Funny enough, a few months ago, when I first told a friend of mine about my dad enforcing this rule, he didn’t even believe me and thought I was joking, and to this day he still refuses to believe that it isn’t a joke. 

I’ve tried speaking to my parents calmly and respectful about this many times, yet they don’t listen to anything I say and they keep throwing the same arguments at me over and over again. Every time I try to speak to my parents about this, it goes the same way:

“Well I don’t keep my phone in my bedroom at night, so you shouldn’t either. Nobody in THIS HOUSE keeps their phone in their bedroom.” 

Then the argument goes into me replying with “You choose not to keep it in your bedroom, but you aren’t even giving me the choice, I’m 18 years old. Besides, it’s not like I’m going to stay up all night using it, that would be ridiculous and I would never get any sleep.” 

Then he responds with the typical: 
 “Its completely unnecessary to keep your phone in your room overnight, you don’t need it, you said yourself that you won’t be using it at night, so it doesn’t make a difference if you aren’t using it, so you shouldn’t have a problem placing it in my office overnight.”

What makes things worse is that he allows my younger sister, who is 12, to keep her phone in her bedroom overnight. I’ve brought this up to him in the past, but he always brushes it off by saying “oh, she barely ever uses her phone anyways (this is not true, she’s using her phone all the time), it’s not like she spends all night on it.” 

I don’t know what to do or how to get him to listen to what I’m saying without him repeating the same arguments over and over and over again. He’s told me “As long as you live in this house, you will never be allowed to keep your phone in your room overnight.” Which I find absurd, as I’m 18, almost 19. When I’m 20, or 21, or 22, (I don’t have expect to be moving out anytime soon as the university I’m going to be attending is actually close to home, so I’ll be commuting) is he still going to be enforcing some arbitrary rule about my damn cellphone?  

Is there any other way I can approach this in order to get a favorable outcome? How can I convince them to allow me to keep my phone in my bedroom? I feel like I’ve tried absolutely everything and I’m just going to have to resort to sticking to this rule until I move out, which will be quite a few years down the line.

Or am I the problem? Is it unreasonable for me to expect them to soften their phone rules as I get older? Is it reasonable for my parents to enforce this rule at my age? Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR - I’m 18 years old, and my parents expect me to keep my phone in my dad’s office overnight every night. They refuse to allow me to keep my phone and charger in my bedroom overnight, as they assume that I’ll be up all night every night using it. I’ve tried to explain to them that I wouldn’t do that, as I’d never get any sleep if I did such a thing, and they respond with “If you’re not gonna use it overnight, then you shouldn’t have a problem keeping your phone in the office.” How do I go about convincing them to allow me to keep my phone in my bedroom?",26Jul2019,6
241,"From an outsiders perspective, I look like I pretty much have my shit together. I'm 24, I work full time as an industrial mechanic, I live on my own, and in general I am pretty well liked by my few good friends and coworkers. I have a dark history though. 
I'm two years clean from an IV heroin habit and I spent a year in jail 3 years ago for drug charges and running from the cops. For most of my teen-adult years I have been self destructive to the max. From about 14 I experimented heavily with research chemicals (quasi-legal drug analogues) and pretty much every other drug class. Obviously my habits got out of control and I ended up with an opiate addiction. There was also quite a bit of drug related trauma that I experienced in this time.
I eventually went to rehab and got clean. I tried several different antidepressants and a few somewhat helped. After rehab I found it hard getting refills on meds when all the psych doctors in my network were booked for months out, so I discontinued them. 
Fast forward to now. I feel like I'm falling apart. Anxiety and depression are ruining my quality of life. I have literally no motivation or energy for anything besides work. I just don't give a shit anymore, about much of anything. I have bursts of energy where I try and actually be proactive, but I usually can't even manage that. I'll intentionally do things that I know will make me feel shitty. It's like I truly hate myself deep down and I feel so ashamed for things I've been through I punish myself every day. I'll stay up until 2am when I have to work at 5. I'll sit and play video games to distract myself from actual errands I need to run or laundry or just like any basic shit I need to do as an adult. Sometimes I'll binge eat terrible food which further compounds not having energy to do anything (mind you, I'm 150lbs and relatively in shape). I don't know what to do, I'm always anxious to the point where my chest hurts. My depression is so bad that if I start to really think about how I'll actually feel, I'll tear up. If my parents press me over the phone if I'm sure that I'm 'fine' I want to cry. 
Everything feels like such a big undertaking to me. I put off trying to find a new psychiatrist for so long. I procrastinate every possible thing. I did a lot of damage to myself growing up and I hate myself for it. I feel like I really screwed myself up in the head and I'm not the same person and that I don't deserve to be happy. The worst part for me is that I feel like I know some solutions to this (eating healthy, exercise, being outdoors/around positive people), but I just can't bring myself to do any of these things. I just need some advice and I needed to vent, I'm worried about relapse if I can't feel any better sober",26Jul2019,1

243,"So I’ve just turned 18 years old and my facial hair is unbelievably slow like The Titanic slow on steroids. Idk why but there you go.

I’ve looked up online to see what the causes are. Biggest thing is genetics but my dad is a reasonably hair person. He has moderate chest hair, arm hair, leg hair, and can grow a beard fast. My dad is caucasian. My mum’s side there is also some facial hair but not as much. She is black.

I have a lot of leg hair, very fine arm hair, absolutely no chest hair (slightly amount on my stomach, and a little armpit hair which led me to wonder if maybe I have low testosterone as that seems to certainly be at least responsible for chest hair which I have none of. I’m wondering if maybe this is the problem. 

I read that the testosterone responsible for beard growth also makes men more likely to bald which is true for my dad and every single one of his family - they can ALL grow great beards. Every man on my mum’s side has gone bald (not a heap is known about the men on her side) so I’m assuming that means they had decent facial hair too.

The natural conclusion then is that I just have low testosterone which sucks and I was thinking maybe I should get my levels checked out or something. I mean what other conclusion is there to make. I even read it’s responsible for bone density or something and I’m a very lanky, weak person so rip. 

I’m not sure what advice I’m asking for but probably just should I get checked for my testosterone levels? Thanks y’all.",26Jul2019,0
244,"my best friend and i have known each other for at least three years now. so around the time i started dating someone last summer, she got a boyfriend. this is like her first real love and she talked abt him all the time but i didn’t mind it because i was all lovey dovey too. so as the end of the school year went on, i started talking to her less and less because she got really focused on him and she was extremely head over heels to point of getting his name tattooed after dating. 

so when i moved back home for the summer, my other friend we’re really close with told me that he hadn’t really heard from her either so i just assumed that she was with her boyfriend. so i went into the restaurant she works at to surprise her, and surprisingly, the manager hired me so we started working together. we don’t often work together during the same shifts, but it was nice to see her around. at a point though, i would only see her at work, which i understood because we both have busy lives. 

there was a point of conflict when she left to work at my ex’s restaurant but it was all resolved although i would never see her. we had hung out a few times after i was the only one initiating contact but i had mentioned that i missed not seeing her as much as we practically were sisters. it would be frustrating when we would hang out though because she would either be on the phone w him, be texting him or only talk about him.

 today we had planned on hanging out, which i was excited about because i haven’t seen her as often and i’m leaving for college in two weeks. she told me her parents told she couldn’t leave the house but that she was going to come anyways but her parents would only allow an hour. so her brother drops her off and she tells me that she secretly got married several weeks ago and that her parents were angry because they found out. i was completely shocked but everything was fine. about thirty minutes into us hanging out, her husband calls her and she tells him to pick her up at the chipotle across the street. i jokingly ask if she’s going to ditch me but she assured me that he’s just dropping her off at home. 

later in the afternoon, she tells me she’s at his house but i told her that i thought she went home. she told me that she lied to go hang out with him and that she was being a bad friend. i told her that i wasn’t okay with the fact that she had lied and that i was excited about today but that i wasn’t going to force someone to hang out w me. she told me that she understood and unshared her location with me. i overacted but i just wanted to spend time with my friend. i understand that friends are lower priority to a husband but am i in the wrong?",26Jul2019,1

248,"Long story short, I immigrated to Canada when I was a baby and parents had given me an “English” name. It’s technically not on any legal documents, but it’s the name I used for work, school, and my personal life.

I have always wanted to change my name legally to my English name, there’s always a lot of confusion at school or involving documents regarding my actual name vs. my preferred names. A little part of me also always hated the good-hearted (slightly traumatizing) jokes revolving around my name, and changing it would prevent that.

The real push was when I got in a program which would have me work in healthcare. I personally believe there’s a bit of stigma when it comes to jobs, as much as we all might not realize/not admit, but you’ll always have the people who see a foreign sounding name when looking for a family doctor or something and their first impression in their minds is “oh, bet they didn’t go to school year”, and proceed to not look further into it. 

The only real issue is, now that I’m “older”, the process is a lot more complicated than if I had changed it 10-15 years ago. I have multiple bank cards, a SIN card that I need to have available in order to work, drivers license, health card, universities, etc. in addition to needing to request a new citizenship certificate, passport and what not.

This seems like a very tedious (and EXPENSIVE) process, and after looking into it, I’m not totally sure that my previous reasons (wanting the name I actually use to be on legal documents, hating my name, and consequences in my future career) are enough.

251,"As mentioned in the title, self sabotaging behaviour is a recurring theme in my life. 

In schools, I usually perform within the top 10% in cohort when the grades doesnt determine my next stage of school in life. However, in my final year (be it high school or college), I would do equal to or worse than my peers that usually score much lower than me when something is at stake (school accepting you based on your grades).

Whenever someone compliments me about something I did, I stop doing that action in front of them.

This is the same for any goals I set for myself. For example, if I aim to be able to run x distance within y minutes after 3 months, the moment I shave off a few minutes in my timing, I stop. :( 

In relationships I sabotage myself as well. When my relationships become too smooth sailing and everyone is happy, I tend to find a bone to pick with that person even if I have no real reason to be unhappy, resulting in quarrels. I am generally nice and the quarrel is usually resolved within 3 days. 

Even when I was preparing for a interview for my scholarship, I did a lot of research on the company sponsoring, read all the interview tips available, typed out all my possible responses, asked my friends to check it for me and practiced it til I could talk smoothly without sounding like it was memorised. And yet, during the actual interview, I screwed up and failed. 

I don't think this is a discipline issue for me because I don't dread the process towards my goals. In fact I feel like I can actually achieve my goals (as you can see, I actually do have the potential to achieve it).  Yet somehow, at the crucial moment, I just feel like ending it anticlimatically and screwing up. 

I did not grow up in an abusive environment, but I do have anxiety and insecurities. I am just writing this to get it out of my head and hope for some outsider perspective. I am starting uni soon and have a driving test coming up. I hope not to repeat the self sabotaging behaviour again.",26Jul2019,1

I mentioned how we do our students a disservice by not teaching them Spanish at a younger age. Another teacher says we are not giving them a disservice because this is America. Another teacher says we can’t go to another country and expect them to speak English. My blood began to boil as it is now whilst I am typing this. I called their thinking arrogant. Someone went to the principal. Months later I am talking to said principal. It is nearly the end of the year. As the resource teacher, I need to come and go from classrooms and find knocking (we lock all classroom doors) to be disruptive. I asked for a key in Oct (before incident in break room) and when asking the principal for it, he said the secretary might be put off because I am “too brash”.

I explained to the principal how the conversation progressed and how I have traveled and the only way I was able to travel well is because everyone else spoke English. I also mentioned how studies show benefits of teaching children a foreign language at an early age, and even then said this dad gets special treatment for his poor work performance because he does speak Spanish. He agreed with me, yet said I wasn’t allowed to talk to veteran teachers like that. 
Fast forward to the end of the year and he puts in my review how there were tensions among the faculty. 
What bothers me is he didn’t mention this to me until I brought up the 7 months it has taken me to get a key. Still don’t have key. Had I not mentioned the key, would he have mentioned the squabble in the break room? 
Normally I do not like confrontation, but feel Spanish has just as much right to be spoken in the US as English. I also think you shouldn’t write an employee up over something you didn’t bring up to them personally. 
Please tell me how I should proceed",26Jul2019,2
257,For background info me and him have been together for 5 years (since 14) we met online and whatnot. We’ve met before but I’ve never stayed over at his house before until now. We got into an argument about a female texting him things and me questioning him about it. We stayed in silence for about 10 mins until he got up and I reached to hold his hand and to tell him we can talk it about and he punched my hand away and came really close to my face and dug his fingers on top of my head to where I couldn’t turn away and he started yelling at me. I just sat there and cried a little and then told him to not touch me. While he continued to yell. I also need to add that I was saying a few immature things such as telling him to “go talk to her” and “tell her what date you’re going home to she meets up with you” which I know was very stupid of me. But I feel like it’s even maybe? I just need advice on what to do or say I feel kind of numb and scared to be yelled at again he never really yells at me also like ever so maybe I did cross the line this time by saying petty remarks. TL;DR me and boyfriend argued and he kind of put his hands on me out of anger and I feel like I’m to blame for being petty and even bringing up the topic we argued about.,26Jul2019,5
258,"When i was young i felt like my mother touched me inappropriately. She would pat my butt, which i did not like. But I think it is questionable, it could have been non sexual in intent. But i told her to stop and it took many times before she did.

Secondarily, i would get rashes between my legs (i was chubby) and id have to put lotion on the rash, and my memory fails me but she seemed to insist on doing it. She never did tho. 
Anyways, these thoughts bother me, and id like it to stop. Im not certain she was necessarily being sexual but im not sure.
These memories cause problems for me, i dont like to be close to my mother and keep any physical contact to a minimum.

259,"To begin with, I am openly gay to all my friends and acquaintances, and my entire family basically knows too, but they pretend that I’m straight. They are extremely religious and conservative and I have already been sent to conversion therapy once (right when I first came out to my mom). I am 19 and about to enter my second year of college, but over this summer, my mom forced me to download the app Life360 which gives VERY detailed information about my location to her. I am very anxious because I use what little free time I have at school to go on dates and such. However over the summer, I connected with a guy who lives about 2 hours from me and we have really hit it off and would really like to see each other once I move back into my “college town” this fall. However I cannot drive anywhere outside of my university without my mother being notified that I have done such. When I do this, I know my mom will call and interrogate me, asking questions such as “Why are you out of town.” If she were to find out that I am seeing another man, it would likely be the end of my phone plan and I would no longer have a place to stay during the summer. I would really like to buy my own phone plan, however I will not have much time to work a job once school starts and I will not be able to pay for it myself.

Is there any way, without deleting Life360 off my phone or notifying my mother that I’ve turned off my location, that I can somehow trick the GPS into saying that I am at my apartment? This is causing me IMMENSE stress because I feel like my freedom is not truly mine, and this will continue for as long as my parents support me in some way financially. It is worth noting that my parents do NOT pay for my college. However my parents and grandparents (who are probably more disapproving than my parents due to the fact that my grandfather is a southern baptist pastor), do help pay for my housing.",26Jul2019,1

Recently probably within the past two years I've found him going out EVEN MORE if that's possible and pouring obscene amounts of other free time into working out which didn't alert any flags. However his dismissive and frankly rude treatment of my mother and I in the short amounts of time we do share now did... Come to find out as I was using his phone to play music in the car he is whatsapping and texting multiple women in a sexual manner despite my parents 21rst anniversary coming up.

My ex of six years was the only person I ever really went on a date with. I’m kind of scared to move on. Scared if I’m making the right choice, scared about my appearance, scared of pretty much everything right now.

263,"Not quite a half hour ago, a friend of mine (we'll call her Sarah) left me a voicemail from another friend's (let's call her Jessica) phone. In it, she said a couple things that have me concern.

1) Sarah said she would literally murder me if I ever tried to date Jessica in the future because 

2) I am apparently creepy to women.

I'm not sure how I should react here. I left her a message on Instagram saying that I was sorry if I had done anything that overstepped any boundaries in the past, but I haven't interacted with her in person since New Year's Eve, and even then I don't think I did anything that could be described as creepy.

More importantly, I am concerned for Sarah's mental condition. I admittedly haven't been keeping up with her super well since we went to different colleges, but it feels like there is an underlying mental health issue that is not being addressed here. I want to give some kind of support here, but I can tell that this is way beyond my knowledge of therapy. What should/can I do in this situation?",26Jul2019,1

I have a girlfriend who cheated on me but I forgave her and still love her a lot, and we will soon be living together. I have tried suicide multiple times and yet here I am still well and alive.

The thing is, most of these things are either partial lies or full lies that I tell to myself and others. What's scary to me is that I end up not believing what I'm saying, but experience the emotions that I think go along with any of these situations. Even when the lying is over, there are still left-over emotions and they're usually negative.

I have a tendency to make up things and then feel the emotions while telling those things to other people, and its been ruining my daily life for years now. I'm trying so hard to stop. The thing with my girlfriend cheating is true. But she thinks we're going to live together at some point in the future. What she doesn't know is that I want to break up with her as soon as she leaves our old flat and I get back my security deposit from the owner. The reason is that she can get out of control and break things if I break up with her as she's done worse in non-breakup fights.

268,"This was a while ago. Basically back in school I and a group of acquaintances did something that was truly harmless and innocent; we did the circle game thing during yearbook photos. We got the expected punishment and pictures were retaken without us. Oh well. Later I heard some thought we were doing white power symbols, or basically the Okay sign. We thought it was funny. After all what we did was in reference to a dumb game we played, not some neo-fascist dog whistle. Long story short someone made a group chat with the name ""the white power boys"" in reference to the dumb things a few people said/thought. I didn't really participate but yeah. Some memes were made to using ""white power boys"". At the time it really didn't mean anything. Around the past year, after this by a bit, a lot of shit came out, and the okay sign became a bonafide white power symbol and groups with very similar names like the proud boys starting popping up. Looking back I realize most won't see it as so innocuous and dumb, but that I was genuinely in a white power group. What the fuck do I do now?!",26Jul2019,1
269,"       Hello, this is my first time doing one of these so please don’t mind my username and if the post is way too long I just want to cover the either story with background detail.

             Recently I talked to my coworker about a female I was interested in and gathered up the courage to confess how I feel about her. Some days past and text have been going back and forth to point where she asked me in what way do I actually want her (whether it be for relationship or just a quick hookup). I told her honestly I wanted to hookup and see where it went from there. She agrees and starts asking me questions about my sexual interest and starts listing hers, we had a good amount in common. After getting further more into the conversation about sex I ask her “if she would like to come over the next day to go further more into it” (she accepts the invite). 

           I was happy excited to think that something would happen between us that my Loneliness would cut its tides here. The day she comes over I pick her up and we’re having a good conversation on the way to my house, when we get there I bring her into my room and we start talking I go in for a kiss and she just stops me in place and says “she’s hot” at first we continue for a bit and my anxiety gets the best of me and after having another fail attempt I ask her “ if she having doubts about this whole situation” she continues to tell me that she does and doesn’t want to do anything w me because she finds me too cool of a friend and rather do something sexually with somebody she doesn’t know. After telling me that I respectfully accepted the no and continued to ask if she wanted to play (smash, Mario Kart, Etc...) .  

       We played for a bit and I proceed to take her home after getting some food. The whole time we were together I couldn’t stop thinking of the no and the way I was just rejected it started hurting me emotionally more than before. After dropping her off home the drive was silent all I could hear was my heart bumping and my Loneliness and anxiety coming back quickly.

        The next day I started bundling my stuff to hop on a flight to see my family. The whole way I’ve couldn’t get her out of my mind. I sent a friendly text that said “Hi bud” and haven’t gotten any reply back. I’ve have been on vacation for 6 days now and she hasn’t texted me back in anyway and I keep bringing to thought that maybe if I would have straightforwardly kissed her instead going deeper into conversation when we got into my bedroom it could have been different. Maybe she would have enjoyed that. I don’t know if it’s my anxiety kicking in but I really honestly just miss her and want to find closure on what I did wrong... basically what did I do?

I like to draw, and i was high with my friend so i figured i would try to draw something, since i usually really like drawing when im high. Ive been drawing faces a lot so i figured id try to draw one starting from one of its features, which i decided would be a mouth. I drew the lips and went on to draw the nose, which i immediately realized the nose looked just like a dick. I was focused on drawing a face but the second i stepped back and looked at it where i was, it looked exactly like a dick about to enter a vagina. I kinda sat there in disbelief for a second and then i felt disgusted with myself and scribbled it out. Ive felt thoroughly disgusted with myself since, and smoking has elevated my anxiety tremendously. Heres where i need advice. 


Is there something wrong with me? That letting myself draw I subconsciously drew out something like that when i was only trying to draw a face? Is it just teenage sexual frustration? Is it something that i need to see a therapist about, like a subconscious obsession with sex? Is it repressed porn guilt? Is this all just a coincidence? Im sure it seems strange from an outside perspective but after smoking ive worked myself up into a panic attack worrying that it really is something wrong with me. Any help is appreciated.

279,"So I met this guy on tinder. Backstory: i was only on tinder for a hookup, and my bio said it, and it also said that im a freak in the sheets, which is true. So we start talking and realize we're really sexually compatible. But then it started to get weird. This guy started introducing me to his ""really hot friends"" who were apparently asking about me (cause they wanted to hook up with me too, maybe have a threesome). he said he'd told them im his girlfriend, when i hadnt even met him yet. first red flag.

Then he said this friend of his wanted to talk to me and showed me a pic of him, and the friend is really hot, so im like ok. But while i was talking to his 'friend', I started to get the feeling that the friend was catfishing me. He didnt have a snapchat OR instagram account, and just wanted to meet me. All i had gotten from said friend was one picture so after a few days of talking to said creepy friend I stopped.

I was angry at the original guy for introducing me to someone who might not even be real. the fuck was going on? I removed him from instagram too. A few days ago he hit me up again, and said hes sorry for his friend being weird and that he was real but i dont have to talk to the friend. he also asked for another chance for himself so i said okay.

Now hes trying to coax me into a threesome. I said im not ready many times but it doesnt get through his head. I told him lets meet and hook up by ourselves first because that was the original plan, and maybe if we start getting comfortable, we could consider one ( because yea i wanted to try one but only if im comfortable with it). but he keeps asking about it, talking about how much he wants one, and introduced me to YET another shady 'friend' who YET again doesnt seem real. the friend wont even snap me his face so i know who the fuck i might be talking to. Why does this guy keep lying to me and introducing me to fake shady people?

it seems to me that this guy doesnt really care if i say no. But also, hes more of the coaxing type? like hes trying to convince me rather than force me but i dont know; no should mean no. Hes also been super nice-- and said he respects my decisions and we dont have to have one. But i just cant trust him after he set me up with his creepy friend. maybe hes also a creep. im paranoid to meet him now. hes not a catfish btw, we've facetimed and he has a real instagram. So what should i do, cut him off? because there have been redflags and im scared to meet him.

im having a hard time understanding his intentions here. He knows i wont meet anyone till ive facetimed them, have their real instagram and know them. like i did to him. so why does he keep lying about his friends? what is going on. is he going to force me into something or kidnap me? im fucking confused.

he's also rich as fuck by the way. i said im visiting my family for vacation and he said he will fly to me, for one day, just so we can meet/fuck, i dont even have to fuck he said if im not comfortable. is he a sex trafficker? or is he just some petty guy who's REALLY into the idea of a threesome? i would be fine with the latter but i just dont like being lied to. im very openminded but lies piss me off, and when i catch someone lying i lose respect for him as i kind of did for him.

this has been going on for two months and i just wanted an outsider opinion because i feel like im so deep in my judgement is clouded. i still havent met him but we're coming close to it, and i just wanna make sure its safe to.",26Jul2019,1
280,"So, I should give a bit of context before the juicy parts. I had a few Xbox friends that I’ll call (S,P, and E) and there are a few others that are apart of our “squad” but they are still cool with me. I’ve known these guys for years, and it was always a blast to play every-day, and make jokes, tease each-other etc. There’s too much information that I can’t process in the moment but I’ll try too. 

We’ve had On and Off relationships for about a year now, for many disagreements and fights, however this last one pushed me to my last limit because E made a stupid and inconsiderate decision of ruining something I’ve put hard work into and ruined my entire day, to the point where I just got offline. This isn’t the only instance where this happened. Of course, I tried to hide the anger since I’m a pretty chill, and calm person, but ended up blocking them since I honestly felt the need to move on. P (my longest friend and even considered to be really close) completely disregards me, and pretends I’m not even alive. I am the type of person to message you to check if you’re okay, just for the hell of it. He cuts contact with me for months even though I didn’t block him since I’d thought he’d be like another friend that I have that I’ll call ‘M’ who is in the middle of all of this drama, and ultimately decides to play with them and me despite us breaking up, so all respect him. On numerous occasions they’d be jackasses such as; when I was on Instagram just scrolling through memes, I saw a group chat that we had and I saw S change the title to an insult towards me, so I obviously got irritated and did the same.  They contradict themselves by always saying shit behind my back sometimes then trying to make amends with me others. You may think this is petty drama or not serious just because it online on Xbox but I’ve seen other people make post similarly to this especially since the internet and social media is becoming more and more normalized in society, frankly, I believe it psychologically messed with you, and I made the decision to leave them to become happier to know my self-worth. Another friend that played with S &amp; P yesterday sent me messages saying they want to ‘make up’ and shit like that and I’m hesitant because it ALWAYS happens. They decided to contact me after several months of us living our own lives and trying to make everything seem okay. They try to ignore it by saying ‘Ohh he should have just told us’ when I clearly told them it upset me. 

My friend M talked to me and said S apologized and said “I was his good friend, we made great memories together.” To my surprise and I agree. I use to trust them and now my trust for them is gone. I feel as though they want me to come back— because it’ll be an ongoing cycle of forgiveness, and I’ll always come back.

Im coming into this situation from a distance, my family is having a feud with a rogue tenant. 

Back story : my sister and her husband have a property with a rental shop on it. They are trying to recoup funds to help pay the mortgage and Bill's so have decided to rent out said garage(shop) that also has an apartment rented separately but physically attached to it. Both independently rented. They also live on the property in a separate home. 

The renter of the shop started renting approx 1 year ago and all was fine to begin with. He had positive references that were  checked out prior to rental agreement. runs a chop style shop where he parts out vehicles.

He would help out my brother in law and my dad on some of there vehicle issues. Which was great and all but then things started going down hill.

That's about the only normal in this story.

Things started with late rent. 

Then promises to get my dads Bobcats engine rebuilt . Which never got done .. bob cat is still in pieces apparently at someone who is associated with hims shop(I'm unfamiliar with all the details)

Then some stories arose that some of the vehicles on the property were hot. 

Then there was grooming of my 7 year old niece that happend which was the last straw and action was required. 

Naturally the police became involved, an eviction notice and restraining order was issued.

He breached the restraining order multiple times.

The rcmp didnt carry out the restraining order.

He was incarcerated for an unrelated assault .

A stipulation in the restraining order was made that he could get 1 day to get all of his stuff off the property. 

Which he did,  he moved all of his vehicles to a neibours house about 1/2 km away. Which breaches the restraining order.

Cops still didnt enforce the restraining order.

He left a few items on the property that maybe total $3000.00 on a good day. Basically all junk.

Was served with a new restraining order today and had somebody send a text to my father and brother in law with the threat of death. Claiming if we dont allow him onto the property within the next 24 hours. To retrieve his junk . he'll kill my entire family and burn everything to the ground. via text from a random number claiming affiliation with a notorious mc. Which I know hes talking through his ass about the affiliation.  But he is obviously off his rocker to even insinuate death and harm to my family.

The police were immediately contacted.
I'm home and the family is at the police station currently.

There is alot more context in between the points that I've made but I'm  not about to right a novel . that is the overview of the situation.

289,"16 F . My anxiety was through the roof when I was 9 I was paranoid afraid that every floor would fall through, Every drink had a sickness causing germs in it and really just that type of thing. That never went away but it calmed down substantially. I always had that anxiety with me afterward to a point though. In jr high I started to go through maybe just a week a feeling blah or 2 or 3 days being sad. When I started freshman year everything went downhill so quickly. I was dealing with the blah feelings for long periods of time and I began to have pretty obsessive suicidal thoughts but usually knowing I would probably be fine, I started self harming and gained 20 pounds. Now I go to a therapist and a psychiatrist and I get medication and therapy work though I’m living in that empty blah existence again. I always think I have issues but then I talk to people and I think it’s probably part of growing up. I was diagnosed but it never seemed to mean anything to me or my parents.",26Jul2019,0

292,"Hey Reddit. So I am 31 and finally feel that I know what I want to do with my life. I dropped out of high school at 17, and then got my high school diploma after only attending 3 years of high school and graduating on time. This is not a big accomplish, especially considering I had moved states. My previous high school and school curriculum was far stricter than the new one, (moving from the best school system in the bid Midwest to New England). I am not of great intelligence, (as you can probably see) but more of a moderate to high intelligence. I hated school, even college. However, I did drastically better in a college format. I never took anything seriously, I had good grades without doing a damn thing. I recieved my associate's degree, and was a year away from my bachelor's when I dropped out. I was sick of changing my major and at that point didn't want to solidify something I never had any intention of using, especially when that degree would mean a drastic pay cut, as well as a very heavy emotional tole. Stupid, yes, I completely understand. Long story short, many things have happened since then, life experience is without a doubt, priceless.  I know I want to pursue a career of law, or investigative journalism. However, I do not have the benefits of grants or any help this time around.  I am also married now and have a household to run, and children to care for.  I was wondering if you wonderful people could give me some ideas, or possibly point me in the right direction. Thanks guys 😊",26Jul2019,0
293,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but if it's not I'm sorry. 

To make a long story short, I'm currently debating between killing myself and going to the hospital. I would like to get better, but I'm starting to lose hope that it's possible. I've been like this for ten years now and it's hard to think that I have the potential to ever get better. I have been to the youth ward twice before for this reason and each time I lied to get out early because it fucking sucks, but the last time was several years ago. The only reason I'm even contemplating help now is for my brother's sake and my pets, but even then it's hard to think about finding help. I have been trying to reach out these past few weeks and each time I've been sent to the ER, but I ended up lying both times just because I was so exhausted from being there and wanted to go home. I feel like going there again will just annoy the people working there. Assuming they even remember my face makes me feel like a narcissistic asshole. If I do get admitted, then I might be taking the bed of someone who needs it more than I do and I really don't want to do that. 

So I guess what I'm asking is should I go to the hospital, or should I just call a crisis line or something? I can't live like this anymore. I know I am capable of doing something with my life if I just push on, but knowing I'm going to feel like this for probably the rest of my life is honestly making suicide look like the better option. I just really need help to figure out what to do.",26Jul2019,1

Earlier my s/o posted a video of her with a friend at McDonald’s and she told me she’s going to draw with her other guy friend when everyone is asleep. I didn’t want to acknowledge that I was bothered, and I’m genuinely ashamed that I am. But I told her I would talk to her later about it, I didn’t give her reasons why.

307,"Hold on to your dicks because this is super long. I'll summarize at the bottom for those of you at home with short time and/or attention spans. Yes I'm on mobile and yes I probably didn't type this 100% correctly. Here we go:

So we're going into our senior year of highschool and I've known this girl (K) since about halfway through freshman year right? We talked and sort of flirted a little but ultimately lost touch somehow during that summer (I forget exactly how it happened). Nothing ever happened that summer since she had a boyfriend. We didn't talk for all of sophomore year until the summer after that sophomore year when I was out of town for my older brother's sport and she was on vacation. 

I also forget how we started talking again I think she just snapped me one day idk. But I had just gone on a mission trip a month or 2 before this and met a girl I started dating (M). And for God knows what reason, a few girls that I'd either dated or talked to or flirted with at some point snapped me on that 4ish day trip. But I had just started dating someone for the first time since the end of freshman year/the summer so I steered clear mostly but kept talking to K because I missed talking to her since we had been pretty good friends before.

I helped talk her through her breakup she recently had (that's what sparked her to snap me I think) from her boyfriend of like 3 years or something crazy. So we got even closer after that and talked to each other about pretty much anything.

We had both liked each other before this and I could tell that we both still did. She even text me a paragraph after it late one night about 3 months after that trip when I was talking to her about some conflicting thoughts I was having about my relationship with M. Over the next 8 or so months we talked a lot and would talk to each other about anything we needed to and we're generally really close. I broke up with M for like a week or 2 around our 5 or 6 month mark during homecoming season and took K but them missed M and got back with her the day before the dance (which K posted about on her spam story and said she was mad at her ""crush"" which I knew was me)(she later specifically mentioned wanting to be with me on it a few months later).

So that brings us to this summer. Around mid June I broke up with M for good this time for my own reasons and nothing she did. I was thinking about doing this for about a month before I did it and had been talking to K about it a lot. At this point, K had a boyfriend for about 2 or 3 months. So I broke up with M for what I said above and partly because I really wanted to be with K. 

So a day or 2 after I broke up with M, K snaps me and asks me if I still felt the same way about her as I said I did a few months back (we talked a lot about it sort of throughout my relationship with M) and I told her I think so but just got out of a relationship so I didn't want to jump into anything too soon and fuck it up.

She was with her boyfriend at the time and I told her it wasn't good to talk about it with him there and she said it was fine. I was at a friend's house later that night and her boyfriend sends me ""bye n*gga"" from her account and unadds me (no he isn't black). She adds me back the next day and said it was ""a Snapchat glitch"" and I tell her I know what happened and it's fine and she didn't say anything back to that and acted kinda distant to me after that for a few days

Then we're back to talking about us and she said she thinks her relationship won't last very long bc problems they have and wants to know if I still wanted to be with her. I sorta forget what I said but it was something along the lines of yes or probably. After this she doesn't open the my next snap for a full day and I open our chat history accidentally and it shows the message about not sending her snaps until she adds me as a friend. So I assume her boyfriend found out again and unadded me.

So now it's been more than a month and I still haven't heard anything from her. She never even sent me a message in some other way telling me what happened and she's still dating the dude. I don't wanna lose her, as a friend or more, it doesn't make a difference but I don't know what to do. 

I never really felt about anyone else the way I feel about her so I feel like if I let this go I'm going to regret it forever. I can't really explain it but what we had was different is the only way I can think of.

Tl;dr We've known each other a long time and we're both interested in each other. We've been hit and miss with dating (I was taken and she was single or vice versa) Her boyfriend unadded me from her Snapchat at least once when we were talking about getting together and probably did the second time too. It's been a month since I've talked to her and idk what to do to not lose her.

So what do I do? I don't want to push her into more trouble with her bf if I talk to her again and she seems happy bc she's still with him. And I also don't want to push her if she doesn't want to talk to me. I'm really at a loss here.

Before I start, thanks for reading and taking your time to read. English is my second language, so feel free to correct my grammar if you would like, but I would much appreciate comments about the issue here..

I want to get married. I have been dating for 2 and half years and we are very sure we want to get married. I am 26 and she is 24. We both work and make enough to live comfortably. We met in college, and got our jobs pretty much right after graduation. Her parents are all for us getting married, but it's my parents. My dad wants me to get a master's degree and become a ""the best version of me"".. if you couldn't tell by now, I am Asian. My dad has been pushing me to become like a crazy successful person. I don't mind it but sometimes he can get overwhelming. 

Yesterday, I brought up that I am willing to put in the best effort to get into a good school for an MBA, but I would like to get married before I go back to school. Problem wasn't because of finance, like ""how will I take take of my wife and myself if I'm at school"". No. He wants to be split with my girlfriend. He tells me that because I haven't fully reached my potential, I might be blinded to find ""the one"" later when I'm more successful. 

Maybe it's because I don't believe in ""the one"". His logic or reasoning did not mix well in my brain. 


If you could maybe help me understand... that would help me a lot when I talk to him again.


1. What do you think of this situation? 
2. How can I speak to him so that my thoughts will be best delivered to my dad?
3. Am I the only one believing that ""the one"" does not exist?

Hey guys long time leecher first time poster.

I am an I.T Support Technician and a freelance web and graphic designer. So I obviously know my way around computers. So a couple of days I received a phone call from an ex-clients husband. His wife was a very nice old lady who I used to help on my spare time. So when her husband(85 years) phoned I was a bit surprised because I have never met him and his wife usually deals with me. He explained that his wife had recently passed away, and he was asking if I knew of any places that does computer lessons. Unfortunately in our area there isn’t really any place that does computer courses, there is only one in our local mall but it’s mainly for children to teach them about computers when their parents are shopping, or going to the nearest city and joining a college.

The client explained that he just needs help using windows and Microsoft outlook. So we agreed on a small hourly rate and that in the afternoons after work I would come to his house which is fine. Its luckily about 5min drive from work. I was surprised when he said he would require at least 5 Sessions because he knew nothing about computers because his wife was working on it the most. But I thought to myself we would be able to get him up and going in one sessions.

Unfortunately after our first session I immediately realized he did in fact know nothing about computers. I am a very patient person, as I regularly need to assist elders with computers. But after about 45 mins he felt he was a bit overwhelmed with all the information. All we did was explain how the Desktop, Start menu and taskbar works and a bit of what programs do what, i.e Google chrome, Word and Outlook.  

So the reason I am asking for advice, because I realized I had accepted an immense responsibility. I am not concerned about the money but I truly want to help this gentleman and get him comfortable with his wife's computer.

I am a 17 year old guy, and my brother is 7 years older than me. We actually have a very good relationship, but there's a weird memory i have of him doing something and I just don't know how to feel about it. I've been thinking about it a little lately, and I really dont want to ruin our relationship so I don't really know what to do.

What happened was this: when i was young, like 6 years old or so, I really loved sleeping together with my brother so every night I would ask my parents if i could sleep in his bed. However, one night something happened. I think I was around 6 years old at the time so he must have been either 13 or 14, I'm not sure. Anyways, one night I was half asleep when I felt that my brother pulled down my underwear, and I felt that he slowly pressed his penis up against my butt. Of course this freaked me out so I ""woke up"" (I think he thought I was already asleep) and I pulled my underwear back up. He immediatly said: I'm sorry, I was just joking around, I will not do it again. Well, that was that. I don't think there was any penetration or whatever. We never talked about it again and I never really thought about it either. Like I said, our relationship is really good but lately this popped into my head and I'm just so confused by this incident. It doesn't seem like something he would do and I just don't know what to think about it. Apart from this, I don't think any other weird things ever happened so yea...Was this sexual abuse?

321,"I’m a high school student studying the IBDP away from my hometown and it’s extremely stressful. *Berate me all you want for being stressed in high school and say “Lol, high school is easy, you’re gonna die in the REAL world.” But right now, as an 18 year old, my only focus is to be happy and get good grades to make my parents proud. Don’t feed me this “real world” bullshit. I want to live my teen life before becoming a slave to the system.* 

Because of that, I literally have no time for any self destructive behaviour or thoughts because I’m so focused on studying, and I have funny asf school friends that really help to pump the good brain juice, so during the semester, I’m fine. That's probably the peak of my mental health.

But it’s summer now. I’m back in my dreaded hometown with my parents, helping them with their work, because I’ve nothing else better to do. I don’t have friends here, and even if I do, my parents are crazy strict and I’d rather not get into an argument with them when I ask if I can go out and do something. Which means I’m extremely bored and angsty (because I really do love going out), and that results in my very suppressed self destructive behaviour to come out. 

Smoking cigarettes on the daily (like what the fuck, I only smoked like once a month before summer), sneaking out to get weed fully knowing my strict ass parents are prolly going to see me, eating way too much, then too little, and finally, the cherry on top, watching waaayyyy too much porn lol. I even started talking a guy knowing he’s no good for me and that I’m just here to get my feelings played and to be heart broken. But fuck, the pain feels so good! Like I’m *basically* asking for him to play and manipulate my feelings because I’m so goddamn bored, and I need something to happen to me.

I think I started becoming a lot more conscious when my (non school, different clique) friends displayed their distaste. I joke about my self destructive behaviour a lot because the only way I get by in life is to joke about fucking everything, but at the same time, I whined to them a lot about how “life sucks” and mostly about the guy I'm talking to. Idk what I was expecting from them actually, I just wanted to vent about petty shit, and these friends were the only friends that would understand how I feel because they’re pretty similar too, self destructive, depressed, etc. Basically, we are a very, very problematic group of people trying to support each other. (I’m not extremely close to them anymore, but when I fuck up, I know they’ve got my back.) 

I was called toxic, annoying, a slut and a clown (in hindsight it's p understandable why i was called all these) by a few of my (non school) friends and it dawned on me that whatever I’m doing right now doesn’t just affect me, but the people around me too. The negativity gets to them as well. And even though they’re people I wouldn’t mind cutting ties with, I don’t want to end our friendship with a bad taste in their mouths. 

I’m extremely image conscious, because from young my parents always taught me how to be a likeable person, which is why I don’t like being vulnerable with my school friends and showing my ugly side. I already fucked it up with my other clique, and I don’t want the same to happen to anybody anymore. Because the more I suppress my ugly side, the worst it’s going to get and inevitably, my family and school friends are going to see it. How can I, for fucking once, just love myself? Or just not be self destructive when I’m bored? I feel like there’s an underlying root cause for this self destructiveness and I just want it to be gone.",26Jul2019,1
324,"I look for people to talk to because I feel lonely, then get overwhelmed by all the attention. Hence, I go on a month long hiatus to recharge, and the cycle repeats. I barely keep in contact, but keep searching for more.

I have so many friends, but I feel incredibly bored and alienated when I hang out with them. Although, what I always desired was to have a group of friends...yet I keep pushing them away. When people want to call me, I can't be bothered and ghost for days until I have a burst of energy.

I’ve been talking to this girl for a long time, we’ve had our happy, sad and awkward times together. I truly love this girl, I would do anything to keep her to a certain extent. I’m going to stop beating the bush(I lowkey want to make this lengthy) and explain my problem; This girl, she’s been talking to another dude, which I have no problem because i’m not the type to get jealous over something petty. Anyways, days later, she wants me to be in polygamous relationship with her and a dude. I told her ‘I’m not the type of dude to share’ and she responded ‘well I love you both but I dont want to lose both of you’. After hearing that, kind of ticked me off, but I still love her. And it aches my stomach to share this woman, I’ve spoken to this dude and I did not like him a single bit. He tells a lot of edgy nazi jokes, and uses 4chong. Again, my stomach aches to lose her, but I don’t want to be in this polygamous relationship. Should I play along and experiment? My ears are all open for any advice because i’m going to need it.

326,"Here's my situation: 

23M, live in a high cost of living area. I make about 90k a year and live with my folks. I'm looking at a promotion that could take me to 120k per year. I'm torn between moving out or just bunkering up at home and continuing to save. I'm trying to be financially independent by my 40's...if I stay at home a couple more years I could save some serious money. Enough to pay for an MBA out of pocket and still have a good chunk left over. 

Problem is, I don't get along very well with my dad. He's a good guy and we got along great when before I graduated college, but things have been pretty tense between us for the past two years. I don't really do anything with him anymore, we barely talk about anything except for work related stuff, unless it's to argue about something. Honestly, I feel like I'm adding a ton of stress to his life. He gets along a lot better with my little sister, and it's honestly really painful to see them bonding and hanging out while I exchange maybe a couple words with my dad every day. I get along with my mom and sister but I just feel like they'd all be better off without me. 

I've been at home for about two years. I'll always love and respect my dad but this is really starting to bum me out and affect my happiness. I honestly feel like a complete burden on him and I don't know how to fix this. 

In other respects my life is pretty good here, mom makes delicious food, my sister is awesome, I have tons of childhood friends in the area, and I live like five minutes away from my work. If I moved out in my area I'd still see them but I'd pay a high ass rent, I don't know how to cook, and shit would be pretty crazy for a couple months at least. 

But anyway, my choices are tough it out/figure things out with my dad, stay at home for a couple years, and save stacks -- I could maybe put away \~250-300k if I stay here till I'm 26, then move away for the MBA. Or I move out, save less money (maybe around 150k by age 26). As I'm writing it it's kind of a no brainer haha but I would love to get some opinions on the situation. From what I hear most people's relationships with their parents get way better once they leave the house.",26Jul2019,0

331,"Maybe I've broken some rules (relationship/safety wise) - I want to know if this rings alarm bells for you and, if so - how loud are those alarm bells, and what can I do to make this safe? 

This isn't a long distance romance, but it is a long distance relationship - the person I'm meeting has become my best friend over the course of a year. Easiest if I do this in bullets - 

\- He lives a 3+ hr flight away from me. I've booked the flight - nonrefundable - and I'm scheduled to leave in a few days. 

\- He's sent me lots of selfies, but we've never video chatted

\- Today, when I brought up wanting to video chat before the trip, he was resistant - he turned it back on me, questioning whether I wanted to come visit. When I insisted that this was a basic safety measure, he said that it ""must be more than that"" and that that ""wasn't adding up"". He wouldn't give up on this, but conceded to vid chat tomorrow, saying he's nervous about it. 

\- We average 2-4 hours on the phone each week. At times it's been more, at times less, but we very rarely go more than 2-3 days without at least texting. 

\- I met him on a social networking site. 

\- I googled him thoroughly - everything adds up. Photos and press online that corroborate some stories he's told me about his life; his facebook and linkedin profiles. Everything adds up, except...

\- Early on in the friendship, I discovered he had lied about his age on his profile, and I confronted him on it. He said he forgot that his age was still listed inaccurately, but he didn't think of himself as his actual age anyways and that his fake age was more accurate to how he acts.   

\- He's provided hours of career advice; we've talked about serious life stuff, both of us have been vulnerable, etc. We've only fought once - and it was a big blow out fight that he wanted to just sweep under the rug in the end. Each of us had wronged the other - but my transgressions were worse than his. 

I'm close with my family, but can't tell my parents where I'm going - they wouldn't approve. I've told my best friend, but I don't have full confidence that she'll be on top of things if I don't check in with her. He's offered to send me a photo of his drivers license and addresses for where we will be (we will be at an AirBnB) so I can share with my friends.",26Jul2019,1
332,"I hate feeling/thinking like this because I feel like it was pushed into my subconscious by media. I was bullied a lot growing up by a few African kids in the city who were rich and really good at sports, the popular kids. I was white with glasses and middle class so I got made fun of and pushed around a lot. I was sexually abused in 5th grade by another dude who was white but I pushed him off and away from me. My girlfriend was puerto rican and she left me cause she said I was too pale and a typical white privilege asshole so she left me for this Mexican guy. I feel like black people are stronger and I grew up listening to a lot of rap and spiritual people saying black people are the true Israelites of the bible and that white people are retarded and came from africa but got really pale and then made inventions to compensate for their genetic disability. I feel really inferior to other people, especially with whats going on in America today. I also stumbled on this really fucked up porn where this black guy with a bigger dick raped this white dudes girlfriend and made him watch and then the girl ended up liking it more than her white husband and they both humiliated the white dude.

23 m, and I don’t know what to do with my life. I’ve been through so much the last 5 years i really don’t know where all this time went. It’s literally a blur to me

(2014) Senior year of high school, I moved in to help her out. This was when she her Parkinson’s started to take a toll on her health.She was still walking, but did not have much strength at all. I decided to come help because she began falling. At first, I was doing what I was supposed to be doing . It began getting tough, I would wake up and she was on the ground , drenched in her own urine because she fell and was much too considerate to wake me up to help her. At that point, I began missing a lot school because I felt guilty leaving most days. It got to a point where my family began to realize it was too much for me, and put her in a nursing home.

The worst period of my life (2014-2015), I completely used her. For a period of time, I had her card saved and would order food periodically, unbeknownst to her. I also stole some stuff she kept and pawned it for to appease my weed addiction. There was one point where I lied to her about getting a computer for school, and she was fully supportive and provided me the funds to buy a “laptop,” which was really to replace an gaming system that was stolen at a house party. My family eventually figured everything out, and that’s when I stopped. So she did eventually find out and forgave me.

I used to be the type of person to find excuses for everything I do . I had a cousin, well name him Jeff, that mooched off her somewhat similar to how I did x10. I’m not gonna get into the specifics of that, but to give an example of how shitty he is, jeff was still using her card when she was in a nursing home as her condition began getting worse. 

About ten years ago , my grandma was in the hospital and all of us were there. I don’t know how the discussion began , but we got to the topic of how my grandma ALWAYS treated my sister and cousin so much better than I. (They are both 8+ years older than me) her reason was that she basically raised them and they were like kids of her own. At the time, she just confirmed what I already knew and didn’t care much. When I did the things I did, I don’t believe I acted out of spite , but I did keep that in mind so I could play mental circus and justify my actions within myself.

Fast forward to the end of 2016. Now I am working full time , and providing for myself. I was really beating myself up, because I did not visit her like I should have been. Ever since I was young, I’ve always imagined the day when my parents/ loved ones would die and I don’t know why. Seeing my grandma in bad shape at the nursing home would literally have me in tears by the time I left. Anyways, she eventually moved into my fathers house, and I stopped working to help there full time. I was in school, worked evenings (three of us, I was only needed until 5) and worked out consistently . Although I’m taking care of her and it’s killing me inside, I was doing a lot better for myself than I was before and even now. I had all the confidence in the world, and had an internal drive to show my grandma I changed. 

One big thing that always bothered me was that I was never able to do anything for her. My moods were like a roller coaster, I would be doing good for myself, but I wasn’t doing anything for her. It got to a point where it was hard just looking at her because she was in such bad shape. I continued to help take care of her from the end of 2016,
Until the beginning of 2018.

A few months before she passed, we were told she “was down to days,” much earlier than her actually passing. I heard the news while in class and walked out mid lecture. I broke down and tried prepared for it to happen. I told her I was sorry for everything I did to her in the past, and promised I would keep the family together. She was always the staple in our EXTREMELY dysfunctional family. 

I think about the day it happened everyday , and everything that came with it. For months, I had plans to go see my favorite basketball player of all time , lebron James, for the first time ever, play my home team, which was about 3 hours away. I went to bed pumped for the game, not aware was about to happen. She had some problems breathing and was physically convulsing the night before. I knew she was getting worse, but I honestly know what to expect given that we were told along time before that she didn’t have much longer to live. My mom called me out of my sleep, and I go down to what I thought was our normal morning routine of changing her .

When I walked in the room I could instantly sense what was going on. The looks on the nurse and my mother told everything. They made it clear that she was going to be gone soon, so I texted my GF that I was probably going to have to cancel. I only had about 30 minutes with her. Her breathing patterns were all off, and she was slowly fading out. I grabbed her hand and told her I loved her over and over. Shortly after, she stiffened up and the physical jerking from her disease stopped, and she passed away in front of my eyes. I never saw anything like this before , and being that she was in so much pain I didn’t know what to feel . A Mortician came, hauled her body off and that was the end of it. Despite the eerie feeling in the room, I felt I was somewhat at peace knowing she didn’t have to live like that, and I still am. I didn’t have any of my stuff ready for the trip , so Immediately after the mortician left i had to hurry. I went on with my plans as if nothing happened. I was at the basketball game i was waiting so long to see, literally hours after this happened. I didn’t really break down until the night came back at the hotel. 

The hardest part about everything was changing her corpse one final time. I can’t get that scene out of my head and I’m sick of that being what my brain comes up with whenever I have thoughts about her. I cannot get that scene out of my head, turning her dead body around and doing the routine I had gotten used to her being alive for.

literally nothing I have tried helps. Weed, therapy, nothing. I’ll just have random moments where I reflect on everything and just completely breakdown. I miss my grandma so much and I’m fighting the urge to breakdown completely right now. I caught myself thinking about her today, about her condition and what she was like before she got really sick. 

Once I got back from my 2 day trip, I began working again as if nothing happened. The whole situation didn’t really hit me until months down the road. This happened in march, and I worked up until about November(2018). I visited her grave and had the most vicious breakdown I think I’ve ever had. I sat for hours crying in pouring rain at her headstone, which happened to be shared with my grandfather. I had a budwiser with my grandfather, and shared a Pepsi with my grandmother(their favorites). I had a great talk with them. I did have work that day, so I said my goodbyes and went on with my day. I worked a regular retail job, and I requested the day off because I was “sick”(kept this situation to myself) . I was met with my manager giving me shit. I covered people’s shifts whenever they asked, barely missed any work, and was a great team member. With all that, I decided to quit because I felt like a slave when I read the message my manager sent me. Fast forward to the present, I am just now getting another job.

Although I feel that this job is the first that I’ve ever felt I would enjoy making a career out of, I am still feeling empty. I am in debt, have neck problems and out of shape. I haven’t been back to the gym, largely in part due to my car not working. I have been doing nothing for the past 8 months besides gaming , jerking off, smoking weed, chewing tobacco and eating like shit. Just Sitting on my ass all day being a complete piece of shit. To be fair, I went to the dr recently because of my neck problems to be diagnosed with diffusion of the neck and neck spasms, which I have been dealing with for over a year.

I am trying to find whatever I get out of playing video games all day out of the list of potential hobbies I had in mind. I’ve been making a conscious effort of gaming less and getting out more. As a kid, video games we’re always my escape with my mom working most of the time and not being able to leave the house when I’m alone. Ever since I gave up on sports, I’ve had literally no aspirations in life. Over the last few days, I’ve been reflecting on what I should do and what interests me . 

Those hobbies are
Photography/videography
Music production 
Writing poetry/rapping
Web site design 

I’ve always wrote, as you can tell by this essay. But I’ve been trying to write lately and run into a wall of writers block everytime I attempt to write again. I am at a stage where I want to begin getting good at something to make a career out of it, instead of being stuck at working 9-5 jobs that I utterly despise for the rest of my life. My confidence is at an all time low , and everytime I attempt one of these hobbies I quit because I’m not perfect at it in a day. On top of everything else, I just don’t know what to do with my life. Any help would be greatly appreciated 

TLDR: had a traumatic experience watching Someone dear to me pass away right in front of me over a year ago. I still think about it everyday, and I lost myself in the process of everything.

I’m 15, they’ve been together for 16 years and they’re kinda old to be parents to 2 teenagers (one being my 12 year old sister) with them being in their 50’s. Is this something I should worry about? Something I should talk to them about it? I also heard them talking about taking a trip just them with no kids later this year. I just want to know if I should even worry about that.",26Jul2019,2
354,"tl;dr I sometimes want to break up with my significant other but my parents bought us a place and I don’t want to fuck over my parents, plus I think I still love my sig other. 

Some days I want to break up, other days I’m content. They have so many pros but the cons really get me. Like, being difficult to “go on adventures with” like my family reunion is an hour away and I can tell they don’t want to go so they make up all these excuses. Excuses that seem legitimate but then the more I think about it the more I’m like “if they truly cared they would compromise.” They aren’t easygoing when it comes to last minute plans and going on trips etc. They are  a home body, however they do try to make an effort which I appreciate. Anyways, they keep constantly disappointing me and saying no to these things I wish they would come with me to. And when that happens I get upset and start thinking of all the other little issues. 

I start thinking “maybe they aren’t the one”, “what if there’s someone out there that’s better for me”. They’re my first relationship so I have all these feelings of missing out on other options. (I know that sounds horrible.)

The kicker is my parents bought a small, cheap little house for us to rent and they were thinking of giving us the place. (We’d still pay mortgage but no need for down payment, etc.) My parents like my significant other and I think the rest of my family does too and I think if I broke up my fam would be pretty disappointed. I am a super anxious person and care a lot about what others think so this truly worries me. And mainly, I don’t want to fuck over my parents and get rid of my significant other cause then there’s be this house that I couldn’t afford on my own, plus I kind of want to move away for a bit anyway!!! 

Fuuuuck, I feel so fucked and trapped. But then other times I feel happy and able to stay with my significant other. Are these feeling normal maybe?!?! Do we just need to keep working at the relationship?! Sometimes I wish we didn’t live together so I could just take a break, or move and do long distance or something!!",26Jul2019,2

   So in this region of Asia, we have traditional things that parents live with their children when the parents getting older. But when you are a hoe, left your 3 children and your husband for some fuck boi, you shouldn't think about returning, just go somewhere and die alone. 
   So my dad got a rough life, my grandpa worked all days in order to pay the bills. My dad was about 7 years old when things happen, he told me that was the saddest time in his life, he tried to find her everyday, even he had known it all, he fucked up his education, joined gangs and shit when he was 13 and grandpa had no clue about it. And one time, my dad got sick real bad, but grandpa still had to work, so my grandpa had no choice to called my grandma to look after my dad. My dad was so happy to see her, he was almost cried, after that he was to tired so he slept. And guess what, she left. My dad was just heart broken, and grown some real hatred for my grandma since then.
   He get through all ""mom love"" shit and got back to study seriously. He finished high school and tried for university, but he failed. Then he tried to look for a job. And that is when my gradma started to appear in his life again, when he got a job. BUT HE DENIED THAT BITCH. And now that bitch is coming back, got no place to stay, no one to take care of. But then my father accept her. 
   Why? I just don't get it. He is old now, about 55. And I asked him ""Why would you do that?''. He just said ""Although she have done all those things to me, but still she is my mother. And if I can forgive her, you can too"". I just feel so sorry for my dad, he is old, got some conditions and still have to take care of that bitch, he won't let me help him. And that bitch is a fucking asshole, greedy dirty piece of shit, always brag how talented she is, insult me and my mom when my dad not there. So there are many times I really want to fist into her mouth. I just don't know what to do, that bitch just make me go insane, make me really stress out.

First of all, english is not my native language, so i apologize for any grammatical mistakes.  

I'm turning 18 this year and entering my sophomore year of high school. We are a family of 4 with my dad, mom and little sister. My dad has had a drinking problem for as long as i can remember. At one time, it got so bad to the point where he had to stay in India for two months to get a liver transplant done. I thought after that whole debacle he would cease or at least reduce his drinking to a minimum. But, he just started drinking like always.  

I can understand and deal with his drinking problems, if it weren't for his drunken rages that result for few hours. He is a stoic and chill guy that minds his own business and occasionally joins me and my lil sister for some family time. But, when he is drunk, he does a full 180 and turns into the most insufferable person imaginable. He screams at me and my mom for no reason, threatens to break or confiscate my laptop that i do my school work and play some video games, insults and starts argument with everyone he sees and sometimes he even hits my mom. I consider calling the police when that happens, but i live in a third world country where police and law isn't that strict. Even if it works and he gets jailed, he is still main provider for our families finances. His typical routine for the past few months were, wake up, call his co workers or friends, get drunk, pass out after making trouble for everyone, rinse and repeat.

So far i tried everything. I had so many talks with him that i lost count, which most of them ended with him telling me ""I wont understand"" or ended with him getting mad at me. I thought about leaving and living with a relative until he quit drinking alcohol or seek help for it, But I'm worried about my little sister and mom. 

I don't wanna sound rude and ungrateful, but if I'm being blunt here, I don't love my father. I can't forgive him for choosing alcohol over his family But, i still want to fix this family. Thus why i am here.What should I do?",26Jul2019,1

364,"I've been friends with this really great person for about 5ish years since we met on an online forum dedicated to our favourite game as teenagers. Since then, we've gotten to meet in person a few times and hang out since we live in adjacent provinces, and it's always been really great. 

I've always kind of known that my friend has had a really terrible home life; when we first met, she used to casually say a lot of self-deprecating things and it was always really evident that she genuinely didn't like herself at all. She would also make a lot of references to wanting to hurt herself or worse, which always really scared me. It didn't really make sense to me since we were pretty young at the time and I didn't see anything ""wrong"" with her that would justify her feeling that way. I learned very quickly that she doesn't have a lot of money and lives with an emotionally and financially abusive mother who treats her and her brother really terribly. 

The undercurrent of ""she's living in a really horrible home situation and thinks she deserves to be treated poorly"" had always been kind of present in our relationship, but since we live in different provinces and we were teenagers for most of our friendship, there's never really much I've been able to do to help except provide emotional support and just have fun with my friend as a distraction and because I love hanging out with her. There was one instance where she sent me a message that sounded like she was about to kill herself and I was almost ready to call 911, but I got a confirmation message from her that she was safe and with a friend. It's always made me really sad and worried that I couldn't do more to help her, since if we lived in the same city I would happily provide a couch to sleep on or anything else. I care about my friend a lot and I just wish I could do more for her. 

Anyway, I flew over to visit her a couple weeks ago, and she confided in me that her mother has begun to escalate her behaviour to what I would consider borderline physical abuse. Apparently she's been physically violent towards my friend's older brother and she's worried her mother might be violent towards her as well in the future, as she told me it's getting worse. She also told me she doesn't feel like there's anyone she can really talk to, as most of the adults in her life are very trusting of her mother and, since she's now an adult, calling 911 would as a best case scenario mean she'd be out of a home with nowhere else to stay. It would also mean she would no longer be on her mom's insurance, so the cost of medicine she needs to take would go way up to the point of being unaffordable, hence why she still lives with her mother.

I can't even imagine how awful and trapped she must feel, and given that things seem to be getting worse in her home life, I'm honestly really scared she might try to harm or kill herself. That thought really scares me, since I live so far away there's really nothing I can do to help in that situation. I feel really powerless to help my friend, since she simply can't  afford to live independently right now and is thus financially dependent on her garbage mother. Her province has a really high cost of living, and I trust her when she says contacting 911 could leave her without a place to live and without a means to afford necessary medicine. All the resources I found for parental abuse are specifically geared towards minors, and all the resources I found for adults being abused are either geared towards the elderly or people being abused by a romantic partner. 

I'm so scared for her. She's a really amazing friend, and living so far away there's very little I can provide in terms of material support. I'm always happy to tell her she doesn't deserve to experience the abuse she's experiencing and that she's a good person (which is true), and be there to talk and be a distraction whenever she needs it. But I don't really feel like I'm able to do more, and that really worries me given that the situation seems to be escalating. 

I'm really worried that she might try to kill herself given that she's talked about having suicidal feelings in the past, and I feel really powerless to help with that. I want to help my friend, and I feel like I'm not doing enough as a friend solely by being there and telling her truthfully that she doesn't deserve to be abused and I'm always there for her. I just don't really know what more I can do to help her given the limitations of her situation. What more can I even be doing? I want to be there for my friend and support her, but I'm scared I'm not doing enough and I don't want her to hurt herself.",26Jul2019,1
365,"I'm going to spill my guts. Sorry in advance.

 I don't know where to begin. With that said, let's start where it did begin. Locking myself in a bathroom at an extremely young age being terrified of someone that I was supposed to know. I didn't know at the time but now I know that's where it all began. Moving away from all my friends also was unpleasant but little did I know, we were driving straight into hell. The events that transpired in that little ""community"" changed who I would become. From the molestation, to breaking my collar and being forced to raise my arm to break it further. Going out into the woods every single day after school to be alone wasn't to play, it was to do just that, be alone. I didn't want to be around anyone and what happened turned me into some kind of fucking freak that ended up do things that I would have never otherwise even thought about. The things with my sister, my best friend, all of it.. at that point I didn't know why, now I do. I hate it, so I took it and put it in a bottle when we moved back and stored it away hoping to leave it there but little did I know that bottle would be following me. 	

Moving back, I gained friends and began to feel somewhat normal which felt weird. I became more popular and gained more confidence than ever. It was a great feeling. Grew up for the most part, had as much as a normal life as I could until one day I began to trust people too much, people I thought were friends ended up becoming people I would loathe. I woke up bleeding from the nose, mouth, eyebrow..to be honest I couldn't tell where it was coming from. All I remember is in that instance thinking to myself that I was going to die alone in a street somewhere. The one time in my life where I thought I might actually die. In that moment and the next day that bottle came swinging back to hit me in the head. I grabbed it and shoved everything that had just happened inside that same bottle except this time the bottle wasn't leaving it was just tagging along. 	

From that point on I felt broken, my jaw was never right again because it was probably broken, my nose constantly feels clogged on one side and overly sensitive probably due to nerve damage and I constantly get headaches most likely because I can feel a crack still in my god damn skull. On top of all that fun shit I've got to force food down my throat because my body doesn't know how to do it's job properly. In the bottle it goes, like everything else. 	Now I join the Army, go me. I did something worth a shit for once. It was too late, I was already fucked up before I even knew it. I was shit in basic training, always the one holding everyone back, struggling to keep up. I was good at shooting guns, whoopie. Some how I managed to pass without getting recycled back into the next class. Then I move to Texas, the shithole of the United States. Luckily I was able to meet some decent people or so I thought. It was fine and dandy until I got ready to get out and come more that Vince decides to tell me that he likes to dress up as a woman and do some fucking weird shit and wants to suck my dick because he's fiending for it or something. So, I decided to cut ties and come home. On the drive back I hit the worst storm I've been in since sitting in the middle of a hurricane in Alabama and contemplated just taking my hands off the wheel and letting that be it or so I'd hoped. But I didn't I pushed through as I always do and come out the other side of the storm and made it home. 	

Hooray, I'm home. Right? Yeah, hooray. When I joined the Army was the same point (or around) that my parents began to need money. So I helped, in every way that I could. For many, many years after. They moved from their motor home, to a rental house and into a really nice house. Over the years the amount of money has tallied over twenty thousand dollars that I've helped them with. Getting them in the house, to small things here, little things there. Never really keeping track of any of it because the level of trust was far beyond normal standards. I knew I was going to get it back when my parents got their settlement for my dads workman comp case which ended up being twenty six years of bullshit to get that to settle, but it did. 	We move into this new house, awesome. It doesn't get much better financially. So I continue to give what I can out of my VA disability money to help, never tallying up any of it because you know, trust. Now the settlement happens, yay. Whoopie twenty six years and finally a shitty chapter can be closed finally. Preparations are made to buy trucks, RV's, Remodel, Pool's etc. I take it upon myself to ask about any money that I had helped out with. I was told I would be getting ten thousand. Now, I'm not a greedy person and never have been but the conversation between my mom and I had already established that the amount I was owed was agreed at twenty. So, I pointed this out..and the response that I got would change me for the worse. ""We will give you the ten now and the rest when we feel you deserve it."" More or less. 

This is when I completely died inside and it's also why I am where I am mentally today. Having the only people you really thought you could trust and did trust tell you that basically thanks but you'll get it when we feel you deserve it, shattered me. I felt stabbed in the back, slapped in the face, spit in the face and strings of words that I don't even know how to write. It hurt more in that one moment than almost the entire bottle I had stored up over a lifetime. So, I took it and put it in the bottle. To my surprise, when I began to stuff it in there I realized that the bottle was not taking any more. So, now I'm left with this fucking SHIT feeling all the time. Wearing a mask everywhere I go with smiles and awkward laughter. It won't be long before the bottle breaks as well because I can feel the tension in it like when you shake up a can of soda then throw it at a wall. If that happens, I don't know the outcome and I don't know what to do.

My birthday is tomorrow and I've invited every friend I've got to a local park. My plan is to grill some carne asada and enjoy all the company. Which includes my parents, sister and everyone in between. I don't hold grudges and never will, but I'm not so sure I can hold a smile at my own Birthday party. I'm hurting inside so much that words can't do it justice. I just hope that I don't implode and ruin my own birthday party. I'll be 35 and be wearing a mask the entire time.",26Jul2019,1
366,"I part-own a small company. Being small, our biggest challenge is cashflow, even one late paid invoice can lead us to worry about how we're going to pay peoples' salaries. We've always been alright, but it's a constant concern.

This means we have to finish and invoice our projects promptly, to keep the cashflow flowing.

We have a 9 week project underway at the moment, worth a decent amount of money. The client is expecting delivery 31 August. This week I've come to realise that we will not be able to deliver until early October (5 weeks late).

I can phase the delivery so as they get key functionality nearer their original delivery date, and deliver the rest early October.

*""Sorry, some of the work was much more complicated than we anticipated,so it's taken longer than we'd expected. We used some freelancers to help us make-up time when we realised the timeline was slipping, but it didn't help as much as we'd hoped - in addition we had another deadline \[for a different client\], which I needed to complete and invoice to keep our cashflow going - which meant I had to take my tech team off the project for ten days...""* &lt; this is the real kicker, taking the team off the bigger project in order to invoice the other one.

380,"I’m at a point in life where I don’t know where to go. Some background info is I’m 16 and live in New York. My parents are divorced and throughout my life I’ve always gotten in trouble for the stupidest shit. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety some few years ago after my grandfather passed but as of right now I’m diagnosed with mild anxiety (which I call bs for reasons I’m about to go into) Nonetheless I’ve always had a sense of dark humor that I’ve adopted from watching shows such as South Park and also from experiences in my personal life that have made me number a number person. Last summer I was in a group chat with some people I considered friends who would make or send obscure and edgy jokes about anything. I decided to send multiple pictures to the group chat, with my face, included mocking people in the media who ridicule straight white males. I did this in a first-person manner and mentioned basically every stereotype I could for every type of person I was making fun of in this “racist redneck character” I was “playing”. It was never intended to harm, only for my friends (at the time) to laugh at because I enjoyed making others laugh. I also hated the bad rep of white people in the media simply cuz they were born that way. Flash forward a few months and I forget I ever sent those photos (as I remember that that night was also one of the first nights I’d ever start getting high, so my tolerance was pretty low). I’m finally in a high school that I thought looked shit tbh but my dad thought it looked good for me so I played along. I find out from a few people that the majority amount of girls I liked were into are into me, including the girl I liked most since 6th, and I’m starting to form a solid friend group in my school. 2 days after the first Halloween that was ever miserable to me, these photos I’d never even remembered appear on everyone’s snaps. Somebody in the group chat had screenshotted and somehow, months later, it had only gotten around. Here I am, faced with the destruction of my entire reputation that I had built so hard to achieve in middle school. It was a point where I’d finally reached peak rep and things were better than ever. And in one second, shattered. So many friendships lost. Connections lost. Too many to think about.. People had perceived me to be the very thing I was mocking. A racist. In that same moment, I had bought my first cart, and chiefed it as hate messages and death threats swarmed my Snapchat. A kid who was previously my friend and also known as the “racist kid” had backstabbed me like many of my other friendships before and had painted a facade to my entire new school that I was a monster. My friend had come over that day to comfort me and told me how he heard that some of his friends had found out and they go to other schools. From there on the pictures were spread school across school. I walked into school scared shitless since I’m a pretty skinny kid and have always had trouble gaining weight or fighting. I had told my dad too (something I’d never do in a situation like this). Sooner than later, the school saw the photos and I was suspended for a month despite the fact that humor is subjective (although I will admit I went overboard), I never distributed the photos, I had no bad intentions, happened before I was even in the school, etc. I explained all of this to my school and they said they were justified because of the effect those images had on students and teachers. My dad was pissed and the school had interviewed every kid who went to my middle school or was associated with me. I’d hear rumors of me animating a rape of girls I knew, me killing a cat, etc. Despite these rumors being false the school deemed them as true and proceeded to send out an email to the entire school saying I was involved in hate speech. They even let a student-led protest happen where kids would protest against me. Whenever I’d meet a kid in my school who somehow didn’t know what happened, another kid would always be there to ruin a future friendship. I know now I’ll never date a girl in these young years unlike my other friends. I‘ve been robbed many times because of this. Gangs have tried pressing me. I can’t even go into the neighborhood I was born in without worrying about something happening, even when I’m at dinner with my mom. I was forced in circles where students I previously was friends with talked shit to me. Teachers did the same shit. I would literally get bullied and robbed in front of teachers and no resolution. At the end of the year, I got ganged up on and robbed by 30 kids on 3 separate occasions between 2 days outside the school and teachers saw me get robbed and beat and students just laughed. I had a mild concussion after the last encounter and I pressed charges but it’s not justice for my downfall. I feel completely ruined. My dad and I wanted to sue the school and have tried many law firms but none want to help me. The only thing I’m sure of is that I’m transferring schools but the school my dads looking at is one that looks nearly identical to my previously overly-progressive school. I’ll turn to drugs (for fun, sometimes cope) and my dad will blame it on my friends and force me into rehab or away from them (I’m not addicted to anything either, I just like the personal experiences I get when being on a substance). First time I dropped acid I underwent ego-death and had a bad trip and my dad thinks I’m a drug addict now when in reality I’m just trying to have new experiences. What good outcome can occur. Everyone whos ever knew me thinks of me as a racist. People want me fucking dead. I love my dog so much and he’s gonna pass soon. I can’t find passion in nothing I used to be. I’m seen as a potential rapist or school shooter. I just wanted to be a normal high school kid. All my friends have girls and I’m alone. No parties nothing. And I told myself as soon as high school hit, I would cut with the edgy humor, and I did. But they ended up digging my past anyway. I need legit help with the guiding of my life. Not some lecture from my dad. Not another fucking therapist. I just dojt know what to do. I’ve tried explaining my situation countless times but no one listens. 

TLDR: I made edgy jokes in a group chat which in turn were released several months later, ruining my reputation, getting me suspended, and plunging me into a depression I’ve never experienced before. I need guidance",26Jul2019,1

382,"This isn’t the usual post here cause I’m not dating any of these people. 

So I’m (15) a dude and I noticed that a lot of my female friends are driving themselves crazy and are seeming really unhappy because they’re comparing themselves with instagram models. 

The models obviously have plastic surgery and the ones that don’t clearly edit their photos. This is setting up some really unhealthy body comparisons and leading to some pretty bad body dysphoria. 

I want my friends to be happy and at the moment they’re clearly stopping themselves and getting worked up over something that isn’t very important.

388,"Hey guys! This gonna be a long one my apologies in advance

Okay me and my family recently moved into an apartment complex in February. During our time here so far we formed a relationship with our downstairs neighbor. They're pretty cool people by the way. But one person downstairs  has put me in my feeling as of late. We'll call her Annie. Annie is the most beautiful girl have ever seen in my short 17 years of life. She has the most enchanting smile, the most mesmerizing brown eyes, the most lively laugh, just her overall presence is astonishing. But it not just her looks that has me hooked, It's her stunning personality. She so Happy, helpful, funny, fearless, understanding, accepting, and so loving. To anyone who's about to say this is just infatuation or a crush, I've had those before but it's something about her that I have never felt for those past girls. So you asking why you do  want to ask her out now? So last week Friday she came upstairs bailing her eyes out, my mom and sister were consoling her and I walk out my room to control her too. I gave her the longest huge I have ever gave anyone. So my mom sent me and her to our porch ( my mom thoughts I'll be the perfect person to calm her down cuz we're so close in age she 17 also)  to calm her down. During the beginning we were there sitting all awkwardly, so ask I ask her if she  want to smoke a blunt and she shake her yes. So while we were smoking I ask her what wrong and she told me her boyfriend broke up with her ( pretty f***** up but a rush a joy filled my body). So I was consoling her and  listen to her all night about her relationship problems and her life problems. After us getting stoney bologna she left. During that night I was thinking about her all night...more than usual. During the weekend I was hanging out  with her to make sure was okay......than she told me the worst new, she was leaving Friday for New York to go to stay with her dad for the rest of the summer. Than she drop a bigger bomb and said she was thinking of attending college over there too☹️( to make it clear she graduated a year early). So this been messing with me all week and she leaving today at 1 in the afternoon. My question is should I just tell her how I feel or just hold on to our friendship. Help!!!",26Jul2019,2
389,"Without going into too much detail, I was having a relatively minor conversation with a peer on an industry forum regarding a product I had recently worked on, and a quote of mine was used by related media outlets to generate a lot of controversy about our product. The quote was taken out of context, but my company had banned me from making a reply so that the story will blow over. This situation was obviously my fault to begin with, as I should have kept up my guard when chatting in a public space... and this situation might indeed blow over, but now a quick search on google reveals my real name will be forever attached to this misquote and this controversy... and once it blows over I will never get a proper chance to explain myself or even apologize. I’m extremely stressed out over this to the point where I can’t focus on my day to day work anymore. Of course my cooperative silence is the best thing for the project and the company, but my industry operates mainly by word of mouth, and this controversy is going to forever tarnish my reputation. I love my job to absolute death, but I’m seriously considering resigning so that I at least get my own voice and identity back. I’m also concerned that this might interfere or even hinder any future job opportunities I may have. Im at a complete loss at the moment, and sort of spiraling out of control reading all of the vicious comments under these news articles about my quote. What should I do?",26Jul2019,2
390,"My job is a slap in the face every single day almost. I’ve been promised a schedule change twice now. It never comes. (I’ve been consistently scheduled until 8pm, full time for months now. I was told before I accepted the job it was part time, 10-6:30.) I’m thinking they think I’m too passive and won’t actually speak up. Days I’m actually scheduled a little earlier to get out, 7:30 or whatever, they’ll “accidentally” mess up my time on the whiteboard (they write everyone’s time up at the start of the day and then plan who is where at different points of the day according to time) and write me down as later. I’m the only one who ever gets their time messed up. 

I’m the newest hire and I’m not fully trained in either department I work in. Some people seem to think this means I have to do every single thing that comes up that I can do, even if it is in their section, because they can do the ONE thing I can’t do. (For example, I run around like crazy trying to help people as much as I can in their sections. We are technically supposed to help each other within a 2 section radius. I helped everyone get people out of their section while they were bringing them in- as I can’t do that part yet. When I had 6 people needing finished up to leave at the same time, this same girl literally sat and watched me struggle down to the very last one... but she will be the first one to flag me down and tell me to help her finish up one of her people.) It’s little things like that. No one will finish up their own people anymore because they expect me to help, but then when I have all my people needing to leave at once (because they’ll hurry up and fill it quick and leave me to babysit the section and then everyone finishes up at the same time and needs out the door) not a single person will help me. In the month of May, I closed out over 500 people. The next closest was a girl who was also only trained as far as me, and was used only for finishing up people, and she still only had 300. 

There’s a ton more complaints but then this would be too long. That just happened last night so it’s what is fresh. It’s probably the most petty one, though. My frustration is usually a bit more justified imo. 

I make decent money for little education, though. $12.50/hr, in a $7.25 minimum wage state. I drive almost an hour everyday one way. The Walmart a minute away is hiring for $11/hr minimum. With gas, that probably evens out enough. (If I was full time. I would really want to stay at the 4 days a week that I thought I was getting with my current job) but the draws to that are: retail usually equals working most weekends (my fiancée has a M-F job. I work every 3rd weekend at my current job and that’s nice), and the status. I feel like I was looked down on by my own family as well as my fiancée’s family when I worked retail vs something that’s seen as more... career-esque. 

I’m not really qualified to do anything. I’ve worked retail. I did a quick school program for a job with no opportunities. This job is my only option if I want to pursue what I went to school for and I don’t know if I can hold out long enough to get fully trained in order to actually do it. 

I want to go to school for a 1-2 year program, but I don’t even know what I’d want to do. I don’t want to waste the money just to realize there’s no job to be had. I’m super conflicted",26Jul2019,2
391,"So this might be kinda long cuz I have to explain there full relationship and why I just feel so threatened and uncomfortable with her. 

But so my fiancé 29(M) is absolutely best friends with his ex gf 28(F.) They only dated for a year but have had an on and off again sexual (and emotional) relationship for 6 years. She lives in VA and we live and CA and when him and I met he had just stopped the sexual relationship because he had moved here only three months before. We have been dating two years now and are engaged. When we first started dating I was very intimidated by her because from what he told me she is a very pop off in your face loud kinda girl. This is the exact opposite of me. Also at the beginning of our relationship my fiancé told me 26(F) he preferred bigger girls and was really into big boobs, something this girl has and I for sure don’t. This has always stuck with me for some reason idk why. 

So about 9 months into our relationship she came to visit and I’m not going to lie I was very rude to her. I basically called her fat and stupid in more or less words. She ended up going off on me... telling me if she wanted my man she would have my man and she could beat my ass. The only thing stopping her was my fiancé and his friend between us. I ended up messaging her and squashing the beef almost right after she went home and we are cool now. No where near friends but we are ok. 

She has never made any moves I know about to my fiancé and he even lets me read there messages just because he knows it makes me so uncomfortable. I’ve never asked him to drop her as a friend because I know the love he has for her but I’m often tempted to. Recently I’ve been hearing rumors she’s taking the engagement really hard and been talking to his and hers mutual friends about it. It’s just makes me so nervous to let her be there. My fiancé and I have been talking about the invitations list and I feel like I need to tell him soon I don’t want her there but idk what to do.

395,"I moved to a foreign country a bit over two years ago now. It was an unavoidable move and it was ultimately for the better in terms of my life as a whole. The problem is that I have felt extremely homesick ever since I moved. It has become so bad that it actively works against my progress in my new country. I stopped learning the language, stopped looking for a job, I basically have lost all motivation.


The country I live in is a perfectly good place to live-- the standard of living might be even better here so that's not really the issue. I just miss how my old town was. I live in a city now, but I grew up in a suburb, which might also play a role in my homesickness. The country I live in will never have anything exactly like where I used to live, but I know I will eventually be able to move out of the city to something more like my old town which is nice.


 A lot of the things I liked were very country specific though, whether it be certain foods you could only get there, holidays, particular places, etc. I try my best to replicate these things. I make a lot of my own food and throw a lot of my own parties, but it never quite feels the same. 


I have many friends who have made the same move I have and it sometimes really gets me down to see how well they are able to deal with it, while I have such a hard time functioning. I feel like me and them are two different people, some are made for this sort of thing while others, like me, just aren't. I really thought I was the type of person who could deal with it, but I'm scared I was wrong, which is a major problem, because I have to make things work here. Simply going back home isn't an option.


I guess I am just looking for advice on how to deal with it. Please don't suggest that I should just move back home because I can't right now, or at least not for a very long time. Thanks.",26Jul2019,1

I asked my mom how my grandma ended up like this, considering my grand grandma and mom don’t take any shit from men. My mom said it was her dad (my grandpa) who just destroyed my grandma, for lack of better words.

I’m terrified that will happen to me. I’m 19, and I’m like my mom and grand grandma, but after I was with my ex I changed. He was manipulative and pressuring me into different stuff, trying to make me feel crazy for having anxiety. I got out of there. Ever since that I’ve been so unlucky with men.

398,"Okay, so I just recently started this job and I've been asked to fill out customer surveys by my supervisor. Likely to boost some numbers for our store. They printed off a number of receipts from transactions during that day and asked me to finish the survey at the bottom. I feel rather conflicted by this ask because of what it implies, which is that the customer's voice won't be heard or it will be reduced given the employee's own rather bias responses. That being said, I also understand the flip side of it. Corporate wants a certain volume of these surveys done and will reward stores that do so. We as a store see all of them that come through so hypothetically we still see the bad ones and the ones that tell us ways in which to improve and even if there's a higher volume of positive surveys we still know to look for the negative ones. So while this may seem a bit sketchy, ultimately it might not even matter (and honestly doesn't probably matter too much because they are just surveys). From discussions from my friends, they're saying this is skeevy as heck and tell me to just accept my fate and get fired or quit if they want to do something like this.

I was shaking, got what I wanted from the shop and went to my car as quick as possible. They were waiting outside in their van (no reason to, they left at the exact time that would mean they drove past me getting into my car) and the same man stared at me waving, now I’m usually friendly but he’d made me so uncomfortable I shook my head at him, all I saw then was what looked like a lewd gesture as he drove off. 

Honestly I wanted to be sick, to go home and put on the baggiest clothes I could find and hide from the world, I felt so vulnerable and uncomfortable in what are my work clothes that I’ve been sat with a baggy cardigan on ever since despite how warm it is. I’m shaking just thinking about it now.

I have the company name and email and part of me wants to contact the company and tell them how their staff have made me feel, they’re tree surgeons so go to peoples houses and work on their gardens- I can’t help wondering if they would treat their female customers the same way? 

What should I do? Am I being pathetic or should I raise it? 

I wouldn’t even consider it BUT it made me feel so vulnerable and awful, I turned up at work shaking and I’m shaking still just writing about it. It made me feel sick, objectified and like I have no control, had the situation escalated I wouldn’t be able to defend myself

Shutting everything down would be a very massive hit for the company and i want to do this so badly, because still, they are not paying their workers, they are not paying taxes, they are over-working everyone and I truly believe that something massive has to happen, so they can make a proper change.

408,"I'm sorry this isnt in the same strain as everything else on this subreddit but I was just a bit lost where I should ask; sorry in advance

I took my girlfriend to the 2019 Sydney Royal Easter Show this year and we had some really nice macarons there and with how much she loved them I thought I'd get them for our anniversary so I saved the places website and name in my phone

Somewhere along the line I deleted the note and I've since cleared my internet history and lost the site and after an hour searching I'm here asking the internet if anyone has a good way to find the lost mystery site

All I can gather and remember is that the site:
- Had a brown background on the site itself
- Had a french name
- Had a booth in the food dome at the 2019 Sydney Royal Easter Show
- It should be located somewhere around Sydney

I'm sorry for taking up your time and thank you in advance for trying to help",26Jul2019,1

413,"She hasn’t given me any particular reason to feel this way. She just lives far a way and has been really busy lately and aint been as responsive on the phone... but when she is, nothing’s different.

I just don’t think I deserve to be loved


Not even actively...that answer just makes the most sense to me.


I just don’t wanna feel this way.

I know I’ve been cheated on befo- a bunch really but,

and I’ve never really been in a healthy relationship.


I have no reason not to trust her and yet every time I’m a lone I fear it’s already ended.


Why do I force myself to feel this way. Why do I place myself in this empty pit, where the world’s constantly ending, in a perishable attempt to make things “easier” to understand.

I’m just tired

I’m so very tired...and i just want to fast forward a few months in the future

And wake up with a job and my lover and some form of fucking location to lay my head with her in


And carry on 



But every day feels longer,
slower and
ever the more agonizing 


And i dont think i know how to help myself

Help me


Where do i go


What do i do so it doesnt feel like im screaming into the void


Im finally in a position where i should be happy and im tearing myself at the seams...maybe cus its all i think i know?


Just...how do i activate the “help your-self” skill in my rpg level-up flow chart?

How do I make it so I wake up one day, and tell myself to love myself as much as I preach it to others.


How do I get invested in my own life, a life surround and dictated by the existence and prolonging of others as some sort of pseudo-meaningful “hero’s journey” love is all there can be “effort is effortless” power trip that i never succeeded in manifesting.

Why am I scared of self?



How do i get invested in my own life? A life I never thought i would keep growing up...a life I spend now, maybe tiptoeing around suicidal catalysts, praying, tampering, wanting them to go off so I have a reason to do the thing I can’t do. 

The thing I won’t do.


I love this life... I just don’t know how to lead it...


Please help me...

I just wanna love myself the way I say I do

To let my love, love me.",26Jul2019,1

415,"I'm having a bit of a get-together/party at my place and there is a bit of a problem, i have two friends that i have known for like 5 years and they started dating a couple of years ago but few months ago they broke up. I'm still friends with both of them but apparently they can't be in the same room together. So my problem is: do i invite both of them? or just one of them?

417,"All right, so here’s my situation. I’m a M23, in a happy relationship with my girlfriend F21. We have been together for almost 4 years, and we live together in a major European city, and have traveled the world together – many great experiences and we love each other very much.

However, about 1 year into our relationship my girlfriend cheated on me with another guy - let's call him Rick (as it is close to prick). He’s not the primary responsible party, thats of course my girlfriend, but he knew perfectly well we were together, and still had no quarrel with doing it. Hands down one of the worst experiences of my life. I find out and I confront her about it and she breaks down and confesses everything to me. She is practically on her knees, crying begging me to stay – telling me that it is the biggest mistake of her life. I need time to process everything, and we break it off for about 4-5 months, where I’m seeing other people.

However, we find our way back together and eventually end up in a very happy relationship. It has now been about 2½ years since that time – and we are very happy – much more so than before her unfaithfulness. I don’t hold it against her, and we have both moved past it long ago. However, here is where I’m made painfully aware of it again, and where Rick enters the picture again.

I’ve recently been accepted into a great university in my home country. I have found an apartment, with two of my old high school friends (M22, F22) – something I am thrilled about, as it is next to impossible to find an affordable apartment in this city. The formalities are in place, I’ve tied up my money in the deposit, and prepaid about 3 months rent. (These are the terms, if you're even lucky enough to get offered an apartment in this city). My girlfriend is a little younger than me, and will not be starting college this year, but living with some of her relatives in the same city as me, working and traveling throughout the year.

My problem is, that one of my old high school friends that I’m moving in with (F22), is in a 3-4 month old relationship with Rick now. I did not find this out until recently, and I am unsure of how to handle it. We didn’t know each other back when Rick was a fucking idiot to me, and she didn’t know of our history until she brought up my name in conversation with Rick recently. To make it all worse, he is apparently moving in, in the apartment just next door to us, and he will be coming over regularly, to see his girlfriend. It doesn’t look like they are breaking up any time soon, my money is all tied up in the apartment, so there’s no chance of me moving out before about in a years time. I talked to my female roommate (Rick's girlfriend) about it, and she says she just hopes we can all get along well.

He actually came over for diner the other night (first time seeing him since the cheating), and I tried to play it cool, pretending I wasn’t really bothered by his presence. On one hand, I would like it to be just something I’m not bothered by at all, and where I don’t give him that power over me. On the other hand, I just feel like its really fucking wrong for me to just sit across the table in a civil manner, from a guy who wronged me like that. Do any of you guys have any advice for how to handle that situation?

He has had the chance to apologize to me, or say something, but just pretends we never met – I feel shitty, if I were to just let this whole thing slide as if nothing happened. And what if he does try to apologize at some point? Do I say “Yeah its all good”? Would I not seem weak or just like I’m letting him walk all over me? Thank you if you read this far, pls let me know if you have any advice for these precarious circumstances!

TL;DR – Due to random and irrevocable circumstances, I am forced to live in the presence of the guy who my girlfriend cheated on me with. How should I handle this?",26Jul2019,1
418,"DISCLAIMER: I am not nor ever will be a abusive or every aggressive person. I've never put my hand on a woman out of anger or anyone that didnt hit me first. 

Ive noticed lately that when i hear about my partners past sexual experiences it makes me angry for some reason and just choke up with a feeling of frustration. I don't know why im like this and i know it's immature but I can't stop letting myself be frustrated. It started with my long ago ex talking about people she made out with and not in weird or offensive way but in almost a bragging tone and it pissed me off so bad that I told her to get up and go somewhere else (it was at our lunch) and she looked sad and left. I understand it was a shitty thing for me to do but it's just impossible for me not to get this frustrated feeling. What can I do to keep this from happening or if someone could provide a better way of looking at it I'd appreciate it allot. Thank you for reading.",26Jul2019,2

420,"The school is asking for a reason why I’m applying to to get my MBA. The honest reason is that I’m trying to make more money at my job. My work is paying for it and company favors employees with graduate  degrees for advancement. 

Ive been doing my research and the samples show people glamming it up with “higher purpose” statements. At the same time, one of the recurring key points is to write with an honest voice.

I wrote My undergrad entrance essay on how I volunteered for this charity and we went and talked to Senators and Congressmen to help pass this bill to find more AIDS research. Am I that idealist kid anymore? Not really. I just want to make more money-so I can pay for my kids’ education, save more for retirement, and have a bigger cushion. Our daily needs are covered by what we make now-but life is just getting more expensive and wages aren’t growing fast enough to keep up.

421,"First I just wanna say that I know this isn't the biggest problem compared to other people so please read other posts if you're limited on time.

So basically I've had a few online friends who happen to live in the same state as me (opposite side of the state though) for around 6 years now, and they're really important to me. Recently they came to visit me without really telling me when they were coming and I wasn't able to make it. I felt awful about this for weeks and still do. Things have also been awkward and distant between us since then.

Before this happened, I learned from one of them that they were meeting up with one of our other online friends who is from a different state and was visiting. I think he assumed that I was also invited, and when he found out I wasn't he told me I should try to come anyways. I wasn't going to come uninvited though, even though it really hurt me that I wasn't invited.

Last week, I ended up being invited to that meetup, 3 weeks after it was originally planned. I was confused, but I wasn't going to miss an opportunity like this again. So I began planning my commute and cancelling any plans for that day.

Later that day I was added to an Instagram group dm where they were planning. I knew nothing about what was happening, so I scrolled up only to find that my friend who originally told me about that meet up basically pressured the other two into inviting me, and they were really hesitant about it, and in the end seemed to only accept under the pretense that I wouldn't come, I think one of the messages was something along the lines of ""at least invite her i guess"". 

After seeing that I told them I couldn't find transportation and apologized and left the group. I felt like only one person actually wanted me to come and I felt like I was intruding on their plans. 

Ever since this happened, all three of them have basically stopped talking to me and it hurts so much. Especially the person who wanted me to be invited, has just stopped talking to me. These people are some of the closest friends I've ever had and I just keep disappointing them and letting them down and not I think they're gone.",26Jul2019,1

423,"Okay. I know the title of the post is bit of an asshole thing to say. But hear me out. I met this girl back in highschool and we where friendly  towards each other but she wouldn't be considered my type.
Anyway at university we ended up studying the same thing and became good friends. Anyway she ended up liking me and  I had always made an effort to dodge her advances. But during university  I went bald. My dating life has gone down hill. Not many girls are interested in dating bald guy.  Just recently  after being rejected by a girl who is my type (down to the very t) I just realised that there is literally  no one I have been chatting up.
This girl however  has remained my friend and to be honest  I enjoy her company  and banter. I just don't  find her attractive at all. I make the choice on who I  want to be reflective of what I am. For example  I am top student so the person I want to be with must be also quite acedemic. Unfortunately  this girl is missing the mark on a few things.
My friends say I  will eventually  date her. But the thing is. I don't  want to. I like her company  and i just want  to be her friend.

Her parents guilt trip my wife into staying for family drama and it's making my wife sick. She has gotten stomach ulcers from the worry and the stress. Her parents always say family sticks and together and that my wife needs to think about what she's doing to them and all that crap. My wife hasn't talked to her parents In a week now and she keeps saying she wants to talk to them about it and I keep telling her she's only gonna get worse if she keeps staying involves in the drama. That she doesn't necessarily need to severe all communication but to not attend functions that her sister is invited to and to be able to leave or hang up the phone when her parents start with the drama. It's getting to the point it's affecting her health and Im at a loss for what to do. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you,26Jul2019,1
426,"and everything was good up until just now. There were several guys who wanted have some fun, no serious relationship whatsoever. I was okay with that because I don't really wanna be in any type of relationships either, but I just noticed that this one guy who have been talking with me for weeks now is actually looking for a woman who he could be in a serious relationship with. He asked me my phone number so that we could move on to WhatsApp and talk more freely there. I actually feel like we could make a good couple because I feel comfortable talking with him and even tho we haven't met up yet, he seems pretty nice. However, for some reason, I'm feeling anxious like crazy. I even want to puke. As soon as he asked my number, my ex boyfriend popped in my head and literally I'm functioning like a broken robot.

428,"Okay so here’s the story. My gf and I have dated for a year. We both live in the same town but went to different colleges. We dated long distance (800 miles) for this entire school year and now are together again for the summer. We have one more school year but next term my gf is going study abroad. We’ve been hanging out a lot this summer because we don’t see each other much during school and we won’t for the fall because my GF will be in Spain.

So her best friend has been a bitch to her recently and then finally texted her and told her she was mad because were always hanging out, and she can’t have time with just her. She said every time my GF is with her I am with her. She was bitching saying she hangs out with me too much etc. However I’ve only been around this girl 2 times when I’m with my gf so I’m not quite sure what she means by I’m always with her when she is. 

I’m not sure how to proceed about this? Or what to say? Is this friend just a jealous friend trying to split us up? Like what’s going on and how do i handle this because I feel like telling this girl she’s a fucking bitch next time I see her.

Growing up I never really had any friends. I was to quiet to talk to people and when people talked to me I never knew how to keep the conversation going. It use to bother me that I didnt have any friends and I remember wishing that I was popular. But that never was going to happen because I always lacked confidence. I obviously never talked to girls either because I was to shy. But I remeber wanting a girlfriend for as long as I could remember. One time in 7th grade this ok looking girl talked to me for the first time. I ended up developing feeling for this girl because she was the first girl to ever acknowledge me. I ended up writing a note to this girl and had my cousin give it to her because I was to shy to talk to her.

430,"I'm feeling a bit suicidal and i need some advice on what to do. I'd say, if i look at it from an outside perspective, i got it good compared to other people. But i do have some stuff im *pretty* sure and not desired. And i think i should clear something off beforehand, I'm 12. I know, i know, my post history is not something a 12 yo should be posting... or at least that's what my mom would say. But, I'm guessing it was bc i was exposed to more adult material than a child should have been exposed to. Like my mom. She has the mouth of a sailor and she smokes when i have asthma. Keep in mind she is not a Karen and purposely kills me, she knows my asthma is pretty serious and she does it outside but i think its still bad to smoke. Now on to the reasons on the suicidal thoughts. I'll start of basic, Being loved. As the older child in my family I'm not as loved as my little sis and it can be so bad that sometimes i just cry and cry until i fall asleep. The only person that i feel loved by is by my GF. She brings the good out of me. Well, now that i think of it, i guess its illegal to date a minor so i guess were just waiting to do anything serious. She knows about my mental state and she does the best she can to keep me happy... and it works! She the reason I'm not hanging by my ceiling or stabbing my wrists. Now, on to the other reasons. Second, My Grandma. She has an alcohol problem. When we go to the market she ALWAYS buys wine. And when she drinks, i can't do anything about it. no matter what anyone says, she'll keep drinking. Even HER DOCTOR says she needs to stop drinking otherwise she'll suffer the fate my grandpa and dad had went through. I can't go to the suicide prevention hotline because they won't believe me. they'll probably just say something like 'Your'e just going through a phase. You'll get over it'.

Went to school upstate and met the girl of my dreams. We dated for a while but it turns out I have to transfer schools forcing us to break up.

I can't imagine being together and only seeing her during the summer and winter or maybe I'm just too insecure to believe she'd want to stay with me. I just know I've never felt this pain.

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually quiet as a mouse.

447,"My GF and I are looking to move to Belfast from Dundee next month and are struggling to work out the best way to move our furniture, clothes and other personal belongings out of our current flat to my parents house in Belfast. We won't be moving large furniture items such as sofa or wardrobes. 

Removal company quotes seem really high so far and we are hoping to find a cheaper solution. I have looked into hiring a van and dropping it off in Belfast but can't find a provider who would accept that. 

We have a small car to transport back by ferry so will take some stuff in that but any advice or alternative solutions to paying for an expensive removal company would be greatly appreciated.",26Jul2019,1
448,"I live with my brother (22) and his gf (25) in a rental because my parents moved out of state. I'm 18 btw, I'm wondering, should I talk to my brothers gf about how she's abusive? From my perspective, hearing them fight, it's gone from them being as bad as each other, to her being much worse but she always accuses him of being the abusive one (he's most likely got bipolar, so he gets angry very easily, which in the past started most of their fights) Now she's at her breaking point it seems, she cracks it with him all the time (understandably, she's been under a lot of emotional pressure lately, from work and at home with my bro) but she thinks he's the monster, and I think it sounds like she's the one putting him down and gaslighting him) I want to talk to her about it to help her see it from another perspective, but when I've done that  in the past she's just gotten mad at me and said I've been convinced by my brothers lies (I'm pretty sure she believes this herself and isn't intentionally lying/exaggerating) so she might stop helping us pay the rent because he's unemployed and I make $100 a week but the rent is $360 a week, so we would be homeless.

450,"Three days ago I confessed to my crush, and they accepted it, saying they 100% think it isn’t a mistake, and they even said they loved me, though I was scared to properly say it back. Then the next day they say don’t think they’re quite yet fully ready for a relationship, and I said I’ll wait. Today they say they want to take a step back in life and pretend the whole thing never happened. Now of course, I couldn’t just go along with that. I truly do love this person, they really make me happy, but it’s confusing what’s going on, and it’s kind of scaring me. I told them I couldn’t do that, that I have my heart and mind set on them, so it’d be impossible for me just to pretend nothing happened, and painful too. I finally worked up the courage to say I love them, but then they don’t say it back so now I’m scared that they might not want to be with me at all. They have trust issues and stuff, and this is the first time for them that anyone has asked them out, but I just feel sad that they are re-thinking everything now. I mean, the day before they said they 100% thought it wouldn’t be a mistake, and now they probably do. I’m just scared of losing them especially when I love them so much already. I don’t know what to say, or do, I just feel sad texting them because I know we aren’t quite yet dating, though they know about my feelings and why I love them, I don’t know why they “love” me. I just wanna get this off my chest, cause I can’t really tell my friends or family, so I’ve come to reddit. I’m scared, sad, and anxious, I don’t know what to do, or say, or how to act.

There is a post about how his mother is a bitch, a comment about how he wishes he didn’t leave a previous relationship because he loves his last partner more, some comments on mild hentai posts, a comment suggesting that he may have a serious illness, and another comment suggesting that he has a secret he has to “take to his grave”.

I don’t want to freak him out, but I also want to limit the number of people that see his post history.

He wants me to bus (not take my car) to a random bus station, completely alone, (he was very adamant about not involving police) leave $$ in a coffee cup on the ground, and then 10 minutes later my dog will apparently be tied up at a shelter nearby for me to pick up.
He refused to send me a picture, stating that he doesn’t have a phone with good enough quality and that I should trust him cuz he has my dog. He described the colourings but that’s easily accessible info on my lost adds. 
I told him I don’t have any way to trust him or that it’s even my dog so he is now ‘compromising’ and telling me to instead buy a prepaid visa for $50.00, give him the code over the phone, and then once he receives it he’ll get his buddy to drop off the dog &amp; wants me to send the remaining $250.00 by e transfer.

I couldn’t stand my home country and needed to get out, I felt like I was slowly dying, so I went to a different county for university. I’m so lucky to have that opportunity and parents who (generally) support it. 

Background: parents had quite a nasty and long divorce when I was a young kid. Never were friends afterwards. Frequently tried to make the other one look like yeh worse parent, etc. you get the deal. When I went abroad I’m also saving money on college somehow too, so my parents really only need to worry about my living costs. 


My problem is that parent 1 promised a certain budget that I could live comfortably, albeit very frugally on, as I study. Lowered it quite substantially before I left two weeks ago, and now I essentially would be fine if I didn’t eat 10 days of the month and if I didn’t do laundry as often. So parent 2 lives far below the poverty line and can’t give me anything and while I’m very understanding of this, the other parent, who is solidly middle class ( I know for a fact how much income etc) is absolutely not. Parent 2 already pays child support and wishes to give it to me directly. Parent 1 had included this in their budget and called it “their money”.

I’d also like to mention that the new budget from parent 1 is literally the exact cost of me living with them, so they’re not paying anything besides what they normally would.  basically what I wanted was for parent 1 to continue giving me same budget while I can also have parent 2’s child support to make up what parent 1 took out of the original budget. This made parent 1 very angry and I’m quite scared honestly. Realistically I would only need half of parent 2’s (very small) child support to be able to survive ok.  

FYI working here is unlikely because I have limited hours, degree is quite rigorous and is in a foreign language. Obviously I will do it if I have to, but I didn’t think essentially asking for 100$ would cause so much anger. Any advice to deal with parents like this?",26Jul2019,2
474,"Hello all! 
I have found myself in a little bit of a pickle with what I should do about work. I’ll start with where I was at in my life prior to getting to the crossroads I am at now. 

I picked up a 6 month contract job that eventually led to a full time position. Although I took a 12% pay cut in order to get it. I just got my degree and don’t have a ton of hands on experience under my belt either, but I know how to do my job. 
My girlfriend and I are getting more serious now and I’m starting to make decent money and we have tossed around the idea of buying a house. We have been searching the market, talking to mortgage brokers, and essentially having fun with seeing what we can get with what we can afford. It has actually been an enjoyable little scavenger hunt. 

Crossroads: 
About a week ago, our boss had told us that the project that they have been working on for the past 25 years, is coming to a close and being replaced by a newer and cooler product. This new “product” is currently in the prototype stage and it’s not even a guarantee that it will be what “the/our customer” wants in the end. Our product doesn’t necessarily have all the new bells and whistles, but it gets the job done day after day. 
Our company has recently won an award for a new project. Well, they said “they won the award” but really, they are in the final four contestants for who is going to be lead on the new project.  So there’s the hope that there’s more work in the future, but as of now, there is not really anything else going on. 
Our company has recently lost a lot of people, some key leadership people, who have gone over to the new products company to work on that. 
I’m conflicted because I could possibly go there, where my future is kind of uncertain until the product is accepted by the customer, or I could stay here where I know I have an expiration date, but a possible rainbow of hope in the future. 

Either decision, I feel like I won’t have that “job security” I need to feel good about buying a house and either decision could fail at any moment. 

I don’t know whether it’s better to stay on the ship that you know for a fact is going down. (And the current ship captain doesn’t recognize my potential and education and drive and motivation) 
Or if it’s better to take a big chance and go to the new company and try to get in on the ground floor of this thing. 

Any advice, stories, experience would be greatly appreciated because I’m simply torn and don’t know what to do. It keeps me up all night and it’s just constantly on my mind and I have to make a decision. 

Thank you",26Jul2019,1

478,"I (M, 18) went to my town's party yesterday with a big group of people, and we started to heavily drink. I wasnt anywhere near sober, but I'm usually able to control myself and act properly so no big deal. One of the girls there, who was waaaay too drunk, started to get pretty affectionate towards me. It was pretty obvious now that i think about it but I'm genuinely bad at picking up hints so yeah. 

The shitshow continued for about 1h, when she suddenly said that she was going to the main party and grabbed me by my hand. At that point we were walking and she just said ""dude, i  have been trying for the whole night, you've had plenty of opportunities"". I thought about it for a sec, and although i could have done something there, i didn't. Not because i dont like her, but because she was way too drunk, i would feel like shit afterwards and i doubt she'd even remember. So i explained it to her, she told me she understood, kissed me and left.

5 minutes later, she was making out with another dude. For some reason I felt bad, even though there was nothing between us. That girl's best friend came to me and told me something along the lines ""dude i know her and when she's drunk she says what she's really thinking, go for it, you two make a good couple bla bla"", which confused me even more since she still was with that guy.

Right now, i dont know if i did something wrong, if i should've gone for it, if what she did was not okay, etc

Should i go for it next time? Maybe i shouldnt let her drink that much? (I'd like to say that she can take care of herself but she can't ). How do i feel about that guy? I guess I don't really understand girls haha.",26Jul2019,1
479,"For lack of a better term, I'm the stepmom to a wonderful, inquisitive 4 year old boy. I am in a relationship with his biological mother. She shares custody of him with her ex-wife (non-biological birth parent). Once he begins Kindergarten, we will have custody 85% of the time. For the rest of this year, he will spend about 30% of his time with his ""momma"".
 He's recently been talking about his ""dad"". His biological father is a friend of the family who he knows only as his uncle... and who he sees, at most, once a year. (Should be noted that he knows ""uncle's"" mom as ""Grandma"". She doesn't have any other grandchildren. She was happy to get one, even without a daughter in law)
 His biological mother and I have just been telling him that he doesn't have a Dad when he brings it up. He's said that men in movies are his dad, he's told random men in elevators that they could be his dad, and once, he looked at his ""uncle"" and said that HE is his dad. (Much to the delight of ""Grandma"")
 I think he's too young to understand biology, or be able to comprehend that his actual father has no desire to be a dad, and would prefer much more to be a distant, cool uncle. I think it would break his heart. 
 His other mother is adamant that he is ready to know, and wants to tell him everything. 
 I'm frightened by her lack of judgement. He's not asking who his biological father is, he's asking why his family is different than others.

480,"Not sure if this goes in this sub or not and to start off im not a transphobe or anything but the progression of events in my friends life came off as odd to me.
 When he started dating this girl everything seemed ok. Then slowly i started noticing changes. He wanted to get married, she didnt. He started suffering from depression at this time as well. Not only that, but when we would all hang out she would constantly call my friend, her girlfriend, well before he decided he was trans. Also well he was still male, she would constantly say stuff like “Im a lesbian. I dont find men attractive.” I had no clue then how it worked with her dating him. Honestly, she doesnt work and just sits at home in their apartment 24/7 playing with their cats and videogames. She doesnt cook or clean. He pays for everything. So at this point I think  she’s just using him for an ATM. While still suffering from depression, he slowly started wearing make-up, girly clothes, and dyed his hair before outright coming out as trans. With all the other factors coming before, it feels like she preyed on his mental state, and to convince him that he was trans was the only way to keep her. He hasnt had the best of luck with girls. In fact, this is his second relationship in life period. 
I may be wrong but thats just the impression this whole thing gave off. Am I wrong? Has anyone else seen this kind of behavior before? I cant ask because it would most definitely lead to a fight and possibly a breakup of the friend group. Its best to just keep it to myself but I worry about him/her.",26Jul2019,0

483,"I have two friends (male) John and (female) Diane. John currently lives with myself and my boyfriend, they have been best friends since childhood. John recently broke up with his long term nightmare of a gf and after barely a couple weeks has started dating my good friend Diane.

Now, a little back story about Diane. Her and I have known each other for a long time. I know her well. Last year she obsessed with another friend of ours to the point that when he “broke up” with her she wouldn’t eat, took anxiety medicine, came to my house constantly to cry and complain about him, would stalk his life and do anything to be around him. Mind you they were never actually together and he was up front with her about only being FWB. Shortly after all that went down our lease was going to come to and end, as was hers. She mentioned multiple times about moving in with us but I couldn’t handle that kind of drama in my home. John, my bf and I recently moved into our new place and Diane has a place of her own about 20 mins away. 


A month ago John and Diane started “talking” (they only knew each other through myself and John’s brother who is good friends with Diane as well) and a week later began dating. Ever since she hasn’t left our house for more than maybe 12 hours. John leaves and works from 9-5 and Diane will either stay at our house all day or go to her place until he comes home. If Diane works she will be here when she isn’t. It’s getting to the point that she’s in my house 90% of the time.  After only a week of officially dating John told her he loved her? They’ve only truly know each other barely three weeks at that point. They’re both incredibly clingy to each other. John’s other friends have expressed to me how he has changed things about himself to accommodate her and how he cancels plans with them to be with her. 

She has made multiple comments that annoy and upset me such as :”I haven’t even unpacked and moved all my stuff in at my place” - she’s been “living” there for two months but stays here so much all her stuff is still in boxes. “Yeah, I remember when we talked about living together last year and it didn’t work out (because I said no).  Now it’s like we live together” well, because you welcomed yourself into my house when you want. She uses our electricity, showers here, used my shower products, uses our streaming services etc. 

Here’s where I need advice: while they’re both my good friends I don’t like them together. It’s borderline obsessive and my boyfriend, myself and john’s friends don’t feel they’re going into a relationship in a healthy way. Mainly because neither of them are good with relationships. How do I approach either of them in a manner that won’t come off either jealous or bitchy? I don’t want them to think I’m being an asshole because I don’t want them together. They’re just causing my boyfriend and myself a lot of stress.  I didn’t want her living with us to begin with but I feel like she weaseled in to get her way because she feels insecure or left out because I initially told her she couldn’t live with us. 

I’m sorry this is long and maybe all over the place but I appreciate any input.",26Jul2019,1
484,"So some stuff went down at my work in the last few weeks that caused me to hand my notice in and apply for courses/apprenticeships to do with Welding and fabrication.

On monday a company? got back to me and called me out the blue for a interview like phone call. Asked me questions like what my reasons are for applying, Why I am persueing welding ect ect..

They said that a career advisor is in my area on tuesday and if i was okay with them booking me an appointment at my home for him to come and talk to me about the course.. I thought this was abit weird because i have been to two local colleges before and have never had anyone come to my house for a meeting.

The meeting very much felt like a relaxed job interview, He was asking about my background, Why i left my job, why i was perduing welding and then explained what the course was.

The course is a mostly online thing with 3 parts which broke down in to revision, vitrual exam and then a practical exam every 2 weeks where i would have to drive 60miles to there workshop and get hands on experiance. he also mentioned that the course would be around 40 pounds a week and will take 18months to comeplete and is designed around me working a full time job.

There was alot of talk about how much welders get paid and the starting salary for someone who had completed the course. There was also a small debate where he was adement that my level 2 NVQ in electrical installastion wasnt actually an NVQ and was something that i've never heard of.. we went back and forth on this for a little while cause i know for a fact i do have an NVQ.


TLDR: Why would i take an online course for welding and fabrication over a full time college course at the local college where i would get hands on experiance everyday and get help with the payments.",26Jul2019,1

488,"I've been in IT for 10 years. Jack of all trades, well-versed in infrastructure, and my passion is Networking.

&amp;#x200B;

January of 2018 I landed a job in one best-maintained companies that i know of. Health premiums are 100% taken care of, as well as vision and dental(its been this way for decades). Company has been around for 50+ years, and the owner passed away from old age just last year. Most employees have been here for 10-30+ years. This company is firmly established.

Pros: Relaxing, low stress, friendly people, potential to be here until I retire, superior health insurance

Cons: \*\*Worst traffic imaginable(1-1.5 hour commute one way)\*\*, boring job, no challenge, primadonna team-leader, no working from home, no competitive pay

&amp;#x200B;

I was not looking for a job, but a colleague of mine from years back is now a manager at a company I previously interviewed for back in 2016. The director remembered me and expressed then that he regrets not hiring me(granted, I was underqualified as a senior network engineer). I was shooting out of my league when I interviewed in 2016, but went for it anyway. My former colleague recommended I apply for a systems engineer position which I'm overqualified for. However, this company is a polar opposite of the one I'm currently employed at.

Pros: \*\*Walking distance from home\*\*, ability to work from home, pay increase by 20k, unlimited sick leave(within reason), would be mentally challenging, \*\*new technology to learn(exciting)\*\*, friendly and active staff

Cons: meh health insurance, hectic environment, and shaky job security, a subsidiary of a larger company

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure there is more I am leaving out, but the most attractive factors are traffic and pay. While I would be eliminating traffic from my daily stress routine, I might regain that level of stress by working in this hectic environment. Also, while the pay is competitive, I am unsure since job security as this particular company has a parent company frequently trying to change things.   


To take away from this all, I despise traffic to the core of my bones. I hate hate hate traffic. Coupling this with better pay, I am super torn since I can retire at this current position, but I am bored out of my mind.

Please help! Please ask me questions, or give me differing perspectives!

Some background we got together in 2017 and then we moved in together last year we have 2 dogs and a few bills together. This year when it came time to renew our lease she told me we should move in with my mom to save money so I agreed and didn’t renew. When the time comes closer she tells me she actually wants to take a break and she’s going to live with her female friend well move in together in 2 or so months. We are a month into the break and it really feels like she’s just stringing me along every time I talk to her she sends me single word replies as if I’m bothering her. I’ve asked her if she doesn’t want to be with me to just tell me she says that isn’t the case so I’ve been holding out hope but at this point I’ve realized i have to be the one who cuts the cord on this.

497,"Ever since I was a little kid, I've always been an outsider. I don't get along with people, I don't understand their motives, or why they do certain things. No matter how hard I've tried to learn the foreign language that is social interaction, I've never been able to grasp it.

I've never had a home. I've had places I've lived in, apartments after apartments. But never a home. I don't understand what it feels like to have a home. I have a place I spend a lot of time in, but it's not my home.

I feel like I don't belong anywhere. The emptiness inside me keeps growing; it gets bigger day after day. I have a loving family, few friends and a boyfriend - but still I feel like I'm missing something. Something that is just within my grasp, but not quite close enough.

So. I've been thinking of saving money and uprooting my life. I want to move to a different country, and if that doesn't work out, then hey, I've tried. There's nothing more I want than to just fucking jump into a plane and fly away. I want to drive across the States and visit every church, talk with people, try to understand them. I do believe in God, but I just feel so stupid praying for a sign and crying myself to sleep. Staying still is killing me slowly.

I'm a 25-year-old guy, I have nothing; no education, no job. Nothing is holding me here. But I keep hesitating. Even when I had a job I felt like it just wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth getting yelled at by customers and my stupid-ass manager, getting the minimum wage.

I've suffered from severe depression and anxiety for several years. But even before my mental health started to deteriorate, I've felt like this. All my fucking life I've felt empty, lost, without a purpose. I keep drifting through life, because nothing feels important enough to focus on. Except books and writing. Every day I manage to walk my dogs, shower, clean, eat etc.

So... I think the question here is; is it worth all the hassle to save money and uproot my life?  
Or should I just stay here and learn how to live with this emptiness? Even though I know it'll drive me to suicide.

And before you answer, yes, I've had medical help, I've been in therapy. Nothing works. It doesn't do shit to this emptiness I have inside me. Even when I'm happy and content, this emptiness keeps gnawing at me. It's a black hole inside of me, eating me away. I have no purpose. I've tried to find it in books, writing, or prayer. I'm not looking for a huge purpose, but just like... Why am I here? What am I meant to do? Surely I'm not meant to drift through life, suffering endlessly. Right?

501,"I’m 15 and I have eczema, psoriasis and ichthyosis vulgaris.

Ever since i was little, i’ve always noticed my legs being unusually scaly, I don’t really remember taking good care of my skin, really moisturizing enough and all that.

I started to shave around the age of 10, but that progressively made my skin itchier, I would scratch and scratch, refusing to have hair as i don’t feel comfortable having hair or prickles. I would also scratch my arms harshly as a stress response.

Eventually got bad eczema, on my inner elbows is where it began. Got a cream from my doctor, that and vaseline fixed it up and it went away, and i made the habit of moisturizing.

Year later, went to my eyelids, neck, bikini line, lower back, a ton of little spots. Doctor told me i have psoriasis... another cream was prescribed, i would have bad psoriasis break outs, fluctuating from everything, weather, showers, etc

Psoriasis generally is controlled when i use cream on it, especially now that i’ve been using Tea Tree Oil for acne, it’s also kept my psoriasis away since i started using it, so i’m very grateful for that.

Although i’m not diagnosed with Ichthyosis Vulgaris, i never got around to seeing my doctor again or a dermatologist. I have very obvious symptoms; the scaly legs i’ve always had are a bit giveaway. I always wondered how people have perfectly smooth legs, no markings (besides from scars or bruises), simply perfect skin, until i did research and realized a good amount of people suffer from the same scaly-ness. 

Either way, i still shave, since i don’t like having hair and it’s the cheapest and most painless method of hair removal, especially good for my hairy Pakistani/American genes...
It does dry out my skin, but i exfoliate with a scrubber before in the shower and use good cream and i always moisturize with a mix of thick lotion and vaseline.

But still, my skin is constantly itchy and prickles within hours of me shaving, it keeps me up at night for hours and leaves cuts and blood because i can’t stop myself from scratching my skin. 

On top of all the skin problems, I am constantly fatigued, possibly cause of psoriasis, a known reason for chronic fatigue; or some other underlying issue.
I’m constantly dizzy, I feel nauseous for months on end to the point where i struggle to eat and lose weight, OR have too much of an appetite and have to control myself so i don’t gain too much weight (I’m 15, 5’6, 135 lbs, pakistani/euro descent), i have incredibly irregular mensturation cycles- i get my period every couple of months and they’re very painful and heavy- but i still have pain every month

All these little issues are really getting to me, and having a brown family, it’s hard to speak about these things since i’m considered a hypochondriac by my 2 siblings and mom, but these things are legit and are constantly making my life a bit of a hell. 

I end up being super depressed and awake for hours, but seeing a doctor is hard, as i don’t want to waste time looking for the wrong things, and i can’t drive and am dependent on my busy, single mom... But these things really get to me and i’m not even sure at this point what i may have and may not have. But the anxiety and stress make me get painful charlie horses and muscle spasms... 

For clarification, i wanna point out that neither parents have any kind of serious health problems or skin problems, neither do my siblings (22 and 23- born in pakistan, while i was born in the US).

507,"Long story short, I have this friend who I haven’t seen in years. We weren’t that close, but she was there the night my boyfriend beat me up. She was the one who helped me get out of that situation. Even though we don’t hang out, I always refer to her as “the girl who saved my life”. 

Fast forward to today. Even though we don’t hang out, I still follow her on social media. Last night she posted a picture of herself after her girlfriend attacked her. I immediately messaged her asking if she was okay and what happened. She told me her girlfriend tried to kill her and that her whole life has gone to shit (including possibly losing her house). I told her to reach out to me if she ever needs someone to talk to. She said she would take me up on that offer if she doesn’t decide to “cop out” first. 

I keep telling her how great of a person she is and how she’s helped so many people in so many ways. But she keeps saying that she doesn’t want to be a burden to anyone, even though I told her she isn’t. I don’t know if this is just her being depressed and having suicidal thoughts or if she’s actually considering doing it. But I don’t want to sit here and watch my friend die.

509,"My husband and I bought a house back in April and shortly after we moved in, a cat started showing up in our backyard. He looked really pathetic and like he had been in a fight so we took pity on him and fed him. We kept feeding him to get him to keep coming back so we could TNR(trap neuter release) him which we have managed to do. We kept feeding him for a bit after the TNR so that he could heal properly but I don’t really want to keep feeding him. 

Reasons why I want to stop:  

-I don’t want a cat that can’t be handled dependent on me. When we go on vacation, our cat will be getting boarded as she has meds she needs to take everyday in the morning so no one would be at the house to feed him  

-my health has been rapidly declining to the point where I’m probably going to need dialysis soon. I’m on a ton of immunosuppressants and a bite or scratch would make me very ill so trying to tame this cat would be a big risk to my health  

-we weren’t planning on getting another cat. Our current cat was supposed to be our last cat (at least for awhile), we were going to switch over to dogs as both of us like dogs more and they are less likely to bite and scratch.

It was actually quite enjoyable and after some time it started to feel more like a game to me.

A really good way to let go of your feelings, while I also started to appreciate her as a friend.

After my exams I wanted to ask her for a date. I knew it would be a toss up between a yes and no, but it was time to move forward.

After writing this I sound like an asshole, which is kinda right. 
On the other hand this girl is like playing with fire, she loves her freedom and the attention she gets. 
C knew about my feelings and probably liked playing with them, at least a bit. 


I didn't know player 2 entered the game. FR, one of my best friends and also a co-worker, who naturally was almost always there in group settings. Conveniently he lives almost next to her, so FR and C often went home together after we were at work, partying, etc.

I started seeing him acting differently around her a few weeks ago. Knowing I would live together with FR, I asked him directly if he had feelings for her. Actually did that a few times, the last time 2 weeks ago. He always denied it. I decided to trust him.

Main story: 

At the start of the week we signed the lease for a flat and a few hours later he wrote me a massage how he developed feelings for her since a few weeks and he would go on a date with her the next day.

I was furious, I downed some alcohol to stop myself from destroying everything in my room and demanded to talk for him in person immediately.
Probably a mistake on my part.

I talked to him quite some time and offered him a few compromises for the situation. 
After we talked he wrote me the next day he will go on the date. I don't know how it ended and I will not ask, but he will have to tell me before I decide.

Problem: 

I could have lived with C and FR dating. 

The thing is I trusted him completely after asking him if he liked her and he lied to me for weeks, while he actively flirted with her behind my back.

He only came clear after we signed the contract, he had a date with her and I had no option to decide anything for myself. 
I couldn't ask her for a date first and get my no, I couldn't decide if I wanted to share a house with him, for at least the next 3 months.

I feel like he tried to force a win win situation for himself. He gets everything and I have to accept it. I feel manipulated, used and betrayed.
It is almost a rule that you don't go after the girl your friend likes. When you develop feelings just distance yourself. 
I would have expected that from a friend, or that at least he would talk to me about it.
After all I wasn't in a relationship with her. She is free to like whomever she wants. 
There would be hurt feelings on my side but the situation was solvable.

Now I don't know, he wants us to still be roommates. 
I feel completely betrayed and honestly also don't want him to get everything he wants. 

It is difficult for me to judge his character right now. Is he a manipulative bastard, or just a coward and idiot.

Still he was one of my best friends, so I really think about giving it a shot.",26Jul2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off.

516, If you were 25 years old and had to choose between moving out of your parents house or continuing to stay there what would you choose?

517,"I was hired as a production engineer intern at a local distillery in January. I needed an easy internship I could do alongside classes and to gain a professional recommendation, but I haven’t applied any of my engineering knowledge at work since I’ve begun. 

I’ve stuck with it because of money and ease, but I’m tired with it now. I was out of the country for two months and returned last weekend. Today is my second day back and I am thinking of just quitting before I leave today. 

Before leaving two months ago, I agreed to work seven more shifts between today and when I begin classes in two weeks. It’s a small business so they’re already short-staffed and that’s the only thing that makes me think before telling my boss I’m quitting. There’s nothing holding me here though, I don’t like my boss’s attitude most of the time either and he has a temper that has caused interns to just leave and never return.

520,"This may be a rant, but there's just so much to unpack here, as just this morning my gf and I have started connecting the dots much more seriously.

So I work for a solo contractor who does credit card payment processing for clients. The only people who work in this small, but relatively nice looking office are my boss, his father (who seems to bankroll everything and handle the money), the assistant, and a bookkeeper who is only here twice a week.

To make a long story short, they're shady to the core. One of their 'employees' was recently accused of raping a tenant of my boss', who also happens to be a real estate agent/landlord. Despite the accusation, they actually sent the SAME guy to follow her to her new home, because she had since vanished from the property without telling my boss. Upon hearing all of this, when we were alone, I told the assistant and bookkeeper some things that, if this employee were to hear it, would probably  make him angry in response. However, now that I reflect on how he acted around me in the days following, I noted how he seemed a little off with me, as if he knew I didn't like him. He also randomly told me I'm ""too nice"", which I thought was odd. Since that happened, though, he has seemed fine with me, and yesterday my boss tried to say this guy had a recording of this woman trying to rape HIM. Of course, he didn't possess this himself, but was happy to discuss in front of my doorway how it was all a hoax (he's a Trump supporter so this behavior goes hand-in-hand). It was just odd to me.

Further, at the beginning of the day yesterday, his attitude seemed somewhat sour for some reason. However, next week is his birthday, and the bookkeeper (who I don't believe knows the place is rigged) brought up buying the boss a surprise lunch. Upon coming back to the office is when he began having the aforementioned conversation with us, and just overall giving off much more of a friendlier vibe, as if he heard what we're doing. 

I guess the TL;DR of this would be... let's hypothetically say I'm onto something with being recorded or filmed. What can I possibly do to figure it out for sure or bait them into revealing it somehow? These people are involved in other shady shit as well, and there are other examples that support my suspicions of recording, but I wanted to keep it short for you.

Thanks in advance, I was shaking a little this morning when we were discussing it and I'm a big 23 yr old man",26Jul2019,3
522,"Okay so I'm going into my third year of uni and I have made quite a few mistakes in my first two years, one of the main ones being I have made a complete fool of myself in front of a fellow classmate. 

I was living with a girl in my first and second year, we became really close, we ended up going on holiday and to a festival together. During the first year she started hanging around with another friend group, some of them seemed okay but some were not very nice people. One of them was awful, he trashed our shared kitchen when he came round and the next day another of my flatmates (who was asleep when all this was happening) did a nice thing and cleaned everything up even though it wasn't his mess. The next time I saw the guy that made the mess I told him that it was unfair on my flatmate and since he'd thrown some of my food around to make the said mess I said it was unfair on me too (I was also asleep whilst he was trashing the place).

Now, he did NOT like someone standing up to him and he decided to hate me pretty much straight away. Time went on and he was worse to me, he ended up banging on my door at 4am whilst shouting that I was evil. My close friend said she didn't like him but that he was in her group of friends so she couldn't do anything. I'm not going to lie, the fact that she didn't stand up for me hurt me a bit.

Fast forward to a few months ago, me and her had a falling out (over him saying he wished I would die and her saying nothing) and we hadn't spoken for a while. I was doing work in our shared kitchen that needed to be in the next day so it was crucial (she knew I was working in the kitchen) and she comes home from a night out with three other people, one of them being someone from my class, his girlfriend and the guy that despises me. I was upset about this and asked them to leave the kitchen as I was given no notice this would be happening and I needed to work in silence (I couldn't work in my bedroom because I got too easily distracted in there). She was incredibly confrontational and said it was half her house too, I was upset because my very close friend of two years seemed to hateful towards me. 

I know that what I did next was over the top, I do know that. I stormed off to my room, called my mum and started screaming about how unfair all of this was, about how awful she was making me feel. I had a mental breakdown. At one point she went to her room with the guy that hates me and I confronted her, asked her again why she was doing this when she knew I was upset, and she was again rude. I lost it, I told her I hated her and I hope she has a shitty life. I embarrassed myself. It's worth mentioning at this time that my BPD was undiagnosed, I was not in control of my emotions and I acted like a tool.

The advice I need is to do with the guy in my class. He was there for the whole thing, he heard and saw everything, he heard me screaming. I need to know how I can deal with this when I next go back to class in September. How do I deal with this utter shame I feel because at the moment the only thing I can think of is dropping out. 

I know I'm an idiot but please can someone tell me how I can resolve all of this mess?",26Jul2019,1

Long story short they don’t know I’m gay, I’ve never told any of them, not of fear of being disowned, but I don’t want to hurt my parents anymore because my brother hurts them enough. 

This morning I woke up to my brother crying on the phone saying he was ready to end it all because my parents blew up at him. I didn’t know what to say. I decided to tell him I was hay, in hopes of him calming down and I don’t fucking know something like “damn bro that’s rough I love you man, you’re life is hard as fuck.” 

Instead I was told. “If you were here I would shoot you faggot. You better let mom and dad die without knowing” to which I agreed and he went back to crying about himself and throwing in an “I love you bro” here and there. 

Well now he’s asleep, had my dad check on him. I don’t know what the fuck to do, I can’t visit home anymore because this guy might kill me in the middle of the fucking night. I gave him too much credit.

529,"Hey guys, I’m posting about this because I feel pretty confused. I appreciate any advice I can get. For a little backstory, basically two years ago I met this girl and we continued talking for a year. We were both 16 at the time, today we are both 18. After a year I developed feelings for her and when I confessed my feelings to her we tried it for a couple weeks. But ultimately she still was dealing with her own personal issues before she could be in love with someone else, she needed to work on herself and she basically didn’t have feelings for me. She was still broken from a past relationship. Basically I was left broken just like she was before, it was my first real heartbreak and it’s been over a year and I’m still not fully over it, but I’m way better now. I cut off all contact and blocked her on Instagram. I told her it was something I had to do in order to heal and I couldn’t just be friends. She was very guilty for hurting me but she understood. I’ve pretty much moved on since then, it’s been over a year and a half, but I’m still not fully over her and I still find her to be the only girl I’ve ever fell that hard for, no one else has compared.

Well yesterday, after almost a year of no contact, she sent me something along the lines of this:


“Hey, i’m sorry for bothering you 
I just wanted to check up on you and ask how you’re doing, even though you may hate me or don’t want to talk to me or something. Anyways, i really hope you’re doing great and everything is good and life is treating you good, And i hope you’re happy❤
I wish you all the best, Andd...umm.. I miss you. 
Anyways, I’m sorry again for bothering you...
Goodbye”


I woke up to this message and I was kind of shocked to hear from her after a year of not talking. I replied telling her that I don’t hate her and that everything is fine with my life. She probably thinks I hate her because I cut off all contact, but it was just necessary for me to move on. She replied with:

“I just hate the idea that you may hate me or that i’m the one that hurt you or something, i reallyy hate it”

I told her she shouldn’t feel guilty about making a decision that she thought was best for her, whether it hurt me or not. Then she replied with

“No I’m not texting you because I feel guilty about it, honestly I’ve been wanting to talk to you for a while but I’ve been hesitating. And yeah about that decision I don’t know about that, I thought it was for the best but idk...”


Wtf is that supposed to mean? We continued talking about our lives for a bit after that and then I stopped replying.  But I’m really confused because it sounded like she regrets what happened between us and might want me back, but it also might be that she just misses me. I am just afraid that if she likes me now, that I will end up being hurt again, I’m afraid of feeling that pain again. But deep down I’ve always wanted to end up with her in the future. I feel that maybe, as time goes on we might reconnect with each other and it might end up working out between us in the future, because we both care a lot for each other. we both had such a special connection and we both miss each other, it was just not possible to be together at the time. But at the same time I have zero expectations and don’t expect anything to happen, and I’d be totally okay with it not happening, because then it’s just not meant to be. Right now we’re both in different countries at the moment, so I can’t meet up with her in person. Shes also starting her first year of college in the fall.

531,"This is a long story so I will try to make it as brief as possible. 

I belong to a culture that is incredibly family-oriented (Indian). Our society is collectivistic rather than individualistic: the goals and desires of the entire family are considered more important than any one individual (this is not actually the case due to patriarchy as you will see). 

In my family, you are expected to listen to the father and his decisions are set in stone. There is an incredible ego built into the father figure where he is essentially the supreme leader with practically unquestionable authority over household matters. In fact, there are times where my father exercises these powers by telling you to do something incredibly difficult and annoying to do, but he said to do it and that is it. Like lifting incredibly heavy objects to be placed on a top shelf, when they could easily and more effectively be placed somewhere lower. 

Questions are discouraged as is discussion. A discussion is disrespect and never ends well. The father will completely go off and blackmail you emotionally if he needs to once he realizes he is wrong. 

For example, If I told him a decision he made is incorrect and if he understands he is indeed incorrect, he won't say ""I was wrong"", he will say ""Okay so my own son thinks he is better than me, as if I haven't seen the world or anything?! Why don't you just pick up a stick and hit me with it too now!!""

As a result there is no conversation about anything!!

\--

**Finances are NEVER discussed openly, in fact my father tells me misleading things about what our financial situation truly is. Infact, I will be asked to help with finances with my money but I can never question where it will be spent and what it will be spent on.** 

**Conversations are not really an option, my father is incapable of deeper thought and empathy. He is Narcissistic and uneducated. He blindly follows traditions that have no logic or basis. Hinduism is of profound importance, and he follows traditions even to the detriment of finances or anything (blind faith that something good will happen later).** 

**Future goal is never discussed.** 

**Where we are heading is not discussed.**

**You are never asked about what you want to do or what your goals are in life. Decisions are made without any concerns about your life goals or what you are trying to do. My money is used for things I don't even know about or want.Imagine a house where your money is 'household' money.**

Now many of you are going to suggest that you should just move out. That is actually not possible anymore because I can't financial support it. I've been manipulated by parents into certain financial obligations that prevent me from doing so. 

I feel like I haven't had the financial freedom nor the ability to choose my own path that is deeply limiting my personal growth and my agency. I haven't been able grow career wise and have little to no friends. Most of my friends have bought their own homes at this point and done a lot with their life. And I still feel like I am a kid. 

**My soon to be wife also finds this incredibly unattractive. SHe is obviously scared of the family dynamics though she understands the culture as she is also indian. But as I get closer to marriage, I feel like I don't want to drag her into this power dynamic. She will be miserable.** 

I feel like I need to get out of my home asap, its suffocating and I am no longer growing but moving backwards in life!

534,"I'm 25 and I've been an emotional wreck ever since I graduated from college and moved back home. I received both my undergraduate and graduate degrees at the same university in Broadcasting Production and Sport Management. I had a GA position working with the football team and they wanted me to continue the same position but they could afford only a GA role so I would have to get another Master's degree (they were going to pay a majority of my tuition and give me a monthly stipend). I was on board with it originally but I became so conflicted with my parents demands to find a job to pay for my student loans, losing their insurance coverage after 26, and becoming so burned out with grad school. I had a couple of leads and I became so confident I would land a job. I thought majority of the people in my program were able to secure a position before graduation and I took a chance. I resigned my GA role and moved back home after graduation. 

Since then I could not find a job and I'm getting sick and tired of submitting so many applications without ever hearing from them. Worse I can't even secure a part time job. My relationship with my parents is on thin ice because I'm becoming so depressed. I can't speak to them about it because they're the type of people who would just tell me to ""knock it off"" and make things worse. I still speak to my coaching staff and even though we're on great terms I feel guilty I broke their promise and they had to go through that trouble of finding a new person a few months before the season and I may never see them again.

539,"Long story short, I’ve been friends with this guy I know from high school (we are both 25), and he has asperger’s syndrome. Despite the fact that I have wanted to distance myself from him for quite some time, he got hired at the same company I work at, and I’ve been remaining his friend out of politeness.

He knows that I put him on the backburner constantly, which, to anyone else, would be perceived as an indication to stop pursuing hangouts, but he is very determined to get closer to me, and to insert himself into my life since he doesn’t have any other friends.

He found out that I have been going walking at night since a new Harry Potter mobile game came out that tracks your distance, and unlocks special items based on how many steps you’ve taken. My friend (we’ll call him Arnold)  basically cornered me and insisted that he come along with me. 

I said “sure!” because in my mind, this will only be a one-time thing (or maybe a once a month). But as usual, I give an Arnold an inch, and he takes a mile. He kept telling me that he would be “fine with doing this with me every night” and kept entertaining the possibility that we would be permanent walking buddies.  Extremely needy behavior.

So while we are out walking, he pulls out a portable speaker and begins to play his music. Normally, I wouldn’t mind, but we are in a shared public space, and the music he plays is...interesting. Lots of heavy metal, screamo music, interspersed with Family Guy and South Park skits. 

Now this might sound funny to some of you, but know that hearing Chef from South Park yell “lick my chocolate salty balls” in a public space is absolutely mortifying. I went along with it, because I assumed that people will understand I’m with a special needs person who doesn’t have any social awareness. I looked on the bright side, and tried viewing it as practice for caring less about what other people think.

But oh God. The stares. The people hurriedly walking away from us. The mothers holding their child’s hands a little bit tighter, and avoiding us at all costs.

We ran into about 20 people, which doesn’t seem like much, but living in a small town,  everybody is just 2 or 3 people removed from knowing a friend of a friend who knows you personally. I really, really don’t want to be known as the weirdo at the park who makes everyone uncomfortable and blasts songs about human genitals within earshot of children. 

I asked Arnold to turn down his music. He did, but not nearly enough. People could still hear it. Teenagers were even pointing at us and laughing. I was visibly upset as we left the park, and he kept asking what was wrong. I said “it’s fine” with a fake smile plastered on my face, even though I was dying inside. 

I really want to just...cut off all ties with him after this. He obviously has zero social awareness, and I don’t want to have to be the person who babysits him and has to tell him right from wrong. I honestly don’t give a fuck that he has aspergers and that I should be understanding and spell these things out for him—I just want to get the hell away from him. I have enough trouble with social anxiety, but having a friend like him who dresses weird, blasts music in public, touches me inappropriately, says curse words in front of children...I’m just fucking done.

That said, I have no clue how to approach this. I still have to see him daily, and I don’t want things to get weird between us. Is there any way to casually bring up all of these issues without hurting his feelings or making him angry? I am trying to handle this as non-confrontationally as I can, but I realize that might not be a possibility.",26Jul2019,0
540,"This is a long story so I will try to make it as brief as possible.

I belong to a culture that is incredibly family-oriented (Indian). Our society is collectivistic rather than individualistic: the goals and desires of the entire family are considered more important than any one individual (this is not actually the case due to patriarchy as you will see).

In my family, you are expected to listen to the father and his decisions are set in stone. There is an incredible ego built into the father figure where he is essentially the supreme leader with practically unquestionable authority over household matters. In fact, there are times where my father exercises these powers by telling you to do something incredibly difficult and annoying to do, but he said to do it and that is it. Like lifting incredibly heavy objects to be placed on a top shelf, when they could easily and more effectively be placed somewhere lower.

Questions are discouraged as is discussion. A discussion is disrespect and never ends well. The father will completely go off and blackmail you emotionally if he needs to once he realizes he is wrong.

For example, If I told him a decision he made is incorrect and if he understands he is indeed incorrect, he won't say ""I was wrong"", he will say ""Okay so my own son thinks he is better than me, as if I haven't seen the world or anything?! Why don't you just pick up a stick and hit me with it too now!!""

As a result there is no conversation about anything!!

\--

**Finances are NEVER discussed openly, in fact my father tells me misleading things about what our financial situation truly is. Infact, I will be asked to help with finances with my money but I can never question where it will be spent and what it will be spent on. Its a bunch of smoke and mirrors.**

**Conversations are not really an option, my father is incapable of deeper thought and empathy. He is Narcissistic and uneducated. He blindly follows traditions that have no logic or basis. Hinduism is of profound importance, and he follows traditions even to the detriment of finances or anything (blind faith that something good will happen later).**

**Future goal is never discussed.**

**Where we are heading is not discussed.**

**You are never asked about what you want to do or what your goals are in life. Decisions are made without any concerns about your life goals or what you are trying to do. My money is used for things I don't even know about or want.Imagine a house where your money is 'household' money.**

Now many of you are going to suggest that you should just move out. That is actually not possible anymore because I can't financial support it. I've been manipulated by parents into certain financial obligations that prevent me from doing so.

I feel like I haven't had the financial freedom nor the ability to choose my own path that is deeply limiting my personal growth and my agency. I haven't been able grow career wise and have little to no friends. Most of my friends have bought their own homes at this point and done a lot with their life. And I still feel like I am a kid.

**My soon to be wife also finds this incredibly unattractive. SHe is obviously scared of the family dynamics though she understands the culture as she is also indian. But as I get closer to marriage, I feel like I don't want to drag her into this power dynamic. She will be miserable.**

I feel like I need to get out of my home asap, its suffocating and I am no longer growing but moving backwards in life!

I don't see a way out of this! but I need to just make a drastic change really soon. I feel like I am going to have a break down and it is not going to be a good one.",26Jul2019,1
541,"I'm 25 and I've been an emotional wreck ever since I graduated from college and moved back home three months ago. I received both my undergraduate and graduate degrees at the same university in Broadcasting Production and Sport Management. I had a GA position working with the football team and they wanted me to continue the same position but they could afford only a GA role so I would have to get another Master's degree (they were going to pay a majority of my tuition and give me a monthly stipend). I was on board with it originally but I became so conflicted with my parents demands to find a job to pay for my student loans, losing their insurance coverage after 26, and becoming so burned out with grad school. I had a couple of leads and I became so confident I would land a job. I thought majority of the people in my program were able to secure a position before graduation and I took a chance. I resigned my GA role and moved back home after graduation.

Since then I could not find a job and I'm getting sick and tired of submitting so many applications without ever hearing from them. Worse I can't even secure a part time job. My relationship with my parents is on thin ice because I'm becoming so depressed. I can't speak to them about it because they're the type of people who would just tell me to ""knock it off"" and the situation will only make things worse. I still speak to my coaching staff and even though we're on great terms I feel guilty I broke their promise and they had to go through that trouble of finding a new person a few months before the season and I may never see them again.

I don't think I can go through being unemployed and living with this guilt of betraying the people I loved and wasting all that time and money studying for degrees useless in the real world.",26Jul2019,2

545,"Throwaway for obvious reasons....

My brother is 30 years old and has been addicted to heroin for 8 years..he has managed to maintain a job, have his own house/car, and stay out of trouble....until now. My family thought he was doing well the past year, until he was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor for possession. At this point, we found out he is 50k+ in debt (due to maxing out his credit cards), behind on his house payments and on the verge of losing his house, and has been a daily user for the past year. Anyways, this is my dilemma as his brother, trying to put an end to this all and help my parents move on with their own lives.

He has had the same dealer ever since he started using. I know this persons name, where they live, phone number, where they went to school, etc... I had met with a detective way back when this all started and provided this info, but nothing ever happened. So my question is what should i do/what would you do in my situation?

550,"I ordered a package and on July 8 at 9:08a.m. it was scanned delivered to a package parcel outside my apartment, which means that the mail person had my package in hand and placed it in the parcel. The parcel is unlocked by a key which belongs to USPS and is supposed to be left in the mailbox of the person to whom the package belongs so that only they can access the key to retrieve the package. On July  8 at 5:00p.m. I got home from work and checked the mail. No key in my mailbox. I immediately called USPS and they assured me that the issue would be resolved the next day. Next day, no key. I called again. Same promise. Next day, no key. By this point I was obviously pretty irritated and the girl at the PO said the mail person checked all the parcels and they were all empty. Way I see it, one of three things happened: the delivery person scanned the package but did not put it in the parcel, the delivery person put the package in the parcel but gave the key to the wrong person, or the package was delivered, no one recurved a key, and some rando broke in and stole it. I guess I'm a beta cuck because I  decided to just let it go after being jerked around by USPS and my local police department for a couple weeks. However, today I just found out that my neighbor one apartment over also never received a key for a package which she says was scanned delivered on July 23rd.

553,"I'm a male in my mid 20s. So I've known my friend for probably around 15 years. We've always been good friends and have no romantic history or anything like that. She's basically like a sister to me. Now, she is attractive and she's  also really nice too (otherwise i probably wouldn't be her friend). We're both in our mid 20s and it's around that time where people start settling down with a partner. We've always been the 2 in the group who are always going on tinder dates and seem to get through a number of dififerent people every month. We always talk about this stuff together and give each other advice etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I've noticed that she's been reaching out to me a lot more, always asking to come round to mine to hang out, complimenting me etc etc. I could be wrong but I've always been pretty good at detecting signals and signs and it's definitely starting to feel as though she may like me or want to start something with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling quite conflicted about this because like I said, she is very attractive and a lovely person and I haven't got a bad thing to say about her. So part of me thinks maybe I should ask her out. HOWEVER, my main gut instinct is that I shouldn't, it would almost feel like dating a family member or something like that. I'd be worried that if we did see eachother and it ended down the line it would cause a bit of tension within our mutual friendship group. And it just generally feels like a weird concept to me as we've been such good friends for so long. It's almost like even though she is objectively very attractive I've almost desexualised her in my head, like you would do with a sister or your mother or something. But maybe if we did start something that would change and I'd get over it?

Anyways, I'm triggered living here atm, and Everytime I park my jeep after work (EMT=shift work) I always check to see if her car is there.... I find myself getting annoyed at it. I feel like I am doing things on purpose to be seen but at the same time I avoid her like the black plague. She is an amazing individual, but I am tired. Tired of feeling this way. We have been broken up for 7 months. I just want to stop feeling this way.

I come to this thread to ask for advice because I feel she's done with me and has moved (she also told me) on already. But, living here again has triggered that and prolonged it. Is she thinking about me as much as I am thinking about her ? I leave her alone, I don't bother her whatsoever and get on with my life. But, why am I having such a difficult time .... Again!?

573,"I asked this girl I've liked for a few months now to go to dinner and a movie almost 3 weeks ago. She just got past some not great relationship stuff so she said she wasn't looking for anything serious and wouldn't want it to affect our friendship so I kinda took that as a rejection. 

But then she said she would love to go and get to know me more. I accepted and we went on the ""date."" she said she had a lot of fun and we should definitely do it again when I texted afterwards thanking her for coming and saying the same thing. 

The problem is between then and now she never initiates text. She was gone for a week but the other two are what im talking about, I texted her a few times and she always responds and talks but never initiates stuff. 

I figured I had nothing to lose and asked her to do something again. She said she would love to because she had a ton of fun last time as well so we're gonna hang out again tonight. 

But at what point do I stop texting her and asking to go out? Do some people just not initiate anything? I'm fine with that if so I'm just worried that she's only doing stuff with me to be polite I guess?

574," I've been planning a multi-month international trip for a long time and have been nothing but excited about it until now, less than a month before I depart.

I timed it so that I would leave around the time my lease was up. I'm not necessarily leaving a job because I freelance, but I will stop working and am worried about losing connections. I was relatively flatlined when I planned this trip, but just in the last couple of months things started picking up. I feel like I have so much to do before I depart but no time since I will be working up until I leave. This excitement has turned into waking up with anxiety and doubts every day. I'm worried that once I get to my destination that these thoughts about potentially sabotaging my life and progress will still be there.

I'm in my twenties which is a confusing time because it's the time you're supposed to be building up your career but also one of the best times to travel and experience life. Traveling itself doesn't give me anxiety, I've done it before so I feel prepared in that sense. Money isn't an issue either as I've saved up more than enough for the trip plus a safety blanket for once I'm back. However, when I return I will have to find a new place to live (will be living with my parents in the meantime), might have taken a few steps backwards career-wise, etc.

I genuinely love to travel  and can't tell you how much I've wanted to go to these places but I'm seriously considering canceling my trip. I wish I had nothing to lose but I'm thinking that I do. Any advice?",26Jul2019,3
575,"A few months ago, I moved from the US to Europe and in with my SO of 3 years (who had been living here for over a year). This love also coincided with a change to my professional life: I defended my doctoral prospectus which means that I am now writing my dissertation full-time. Being far from my home institution also means I am no longer directly involved with teaching or hands-on collaborative research with my colleagues. 

Lately, I’m finding this huge transition difficult. I feel very untethered and unsure of myself in this new place and role. 

For the past few weeks, I have been traveling more than I have been home to conduct on-site research in other cities, so that has definitely made it more difficult to find a routine. I am looking into coworking spaces now that I won’t be traveling as often, but as of right now I mostly work from home which is difficult. I think if I can find a place outside of the house to go to everyday, it will help, but I’m working with a limited income and need to revisit how much of my grant is still available. 

I feel unmotivated, and I’m having a hard time getting much done. I have been making efforts to meet people outside of my SO’s social group, but that has been hard with all the travel, so I am a little isolated at the moment. Still, I’m hopefully going to make progress in building some new friendships here. 

I really do feel like I’m making efforts, and I don’t regret my choice to move, but this period is challenging. It seems like almost everything I do is hard, and I’m tired. The research I was doing involved talking with people a lot and this is not something that comes naturally to me, so I found that particularly draining. But even doing small things, like going to the grocery store, require extra thought and attention now. I am really fighting the desire to just spend the whole day in bed watching Netflix. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get out of this funk? Or even just sharing experiences to make me feel more normal? I just feel stretched so thin lately, and I’m not sure the best way to fix it.",26Jul2019,1
577,"First of all, I got permission from her for posting this.

My girlfriend is 17 years old and has a really bad phobia of the dark. She can't go to the bathroom alone or anything like that when it's getting dark. She will feel anxious after even thinking of little scary things when it's dark. She has delusions in the dark (monsters, her reflection in the mirror moving and things like that), but she knows that they aren't real when it isn't dark anymore.

The fear started around the age of 2/3 when her mother went to a mental hospital. Her mother wandered confused around the house at night and made a lot of noises that could be scary for someone that age when not knowing whats going on. Her mother is back in house for a while now (there are still some problems, but nothing to scare her).


I'm trying to let her do more things indipendent from me (letting her walk in front, let her turn of the lights by herself and things like that). But I was wondering if we can do anything more help her with this.

579,"**The necessary English isnt my first language and I'm on mobile- please excuse any typos/mistakes

Well, to get this out of the way, my main drawing style is very anime influenced.

Even before entering art school, I've heard of horror stories of teachers whom detested anime or downright banned it from their classes- I was very worried that I wouldn't be able to enter because- well, that was what I thought was my forte! So I decided that my portfolio wouldnt include as little anime drawings as possible

But as luck would have it, I got accepted automatically- no interview needed- and I was very, very happy. Even if my portfolio wasn't what I thought was my best work.

I decided to not enter immediately, due to a mental health issue- but at the beginning i was very, very excited. This was my dream after all- I wanted to live through my art.
Then when I entered I kind of felt-.. inferior.
You see, most of my classmates do what you'd call 'gallery grade' work. Basically meaning its usually pieces that include either a very complex concept, criticize issues, etc. Their pieces are also very, very political. Of course, they all had different styles: abstract, representative, etc.
But I was the only one in my class who well- did illustrations- manga and anime illustrations.
Out of 100 students 4 were focused on illustrating and only 1 or 2 did it on the same style as I did.

I could already feel a big drift.

In the past year and a half, I've refrained from using anime on any of my projects and illustrations out of fear that my note would be cut down, yet only one teacher has ever told me not to draw on that style- the main problem is, this style is what I feel the most comfortable and happy with.

I am also very fiercely protective of my personal sketchbooks- out of fear that my classmates or teachers will give me shit for what I draw- which is mostly characters and dumb little doodles. While usually my classmates' sketchbooks have these beautiful studies and even their sketches look like already finished pieces of art.

Even more recently, I've started to fear that maybe I didn't deserve being accepted in the first place- there is so much more talented people that maybe weren't accepted because of me. Everytime my personal or school work gets complimented I feel like i don't deserve it.

As I'm starting to advance, I'm also starting to feel that what I do for personal work may be too simple and lackluster- there's actually this big fight on one of my classes about 'commercial art' and i feel a bit like..  a sellout?

By the way, our classes required a fully developed piece of art as a final project. This semester we will be exposing it to the public outside teachers for the first time with other artists from the faculty, though.

I have other styles that I draw in- I do realism, cartoon and im learning how to do botanical and zoological illustrations, which is usually what I use for my 'serious' art projects. But I feel like I'm betraying myself a bit by just ignoring such a huge part of my drawing style/technique when I force myself to shut down all anime influences I may be tempted to add.


TL/DR: Because of my very anime-influenced art style I feel inferior to my peers and im afraid to give it my all when it comes to any graphic arts. I'm also afraid I'll be chastized for it by my teachers/classmates.

I know many of these fears are irrational, but I can't seem to get it out of my head. Do you know any ways how I may better my confidence on my art?",26Jul2019,2

I'm not a natural leader nor am I a natural authoritative figure, if given opportunity and if I'm working with people I'm comfortable with then I reckon I'm a competent leader. For example, in school if I'm the best student in a group project i'm doing with my mates I am able to lead from there. though it's been a while since highschool and working in a group, and I've not done anything group related over the past couple of years (train mma, not really a group sport).

I had an amazing job which I loved, with good results (95 to 100% customer satisfaction nearly every month), financially stability and everything was just great. Sadly I had to leave due to illness and wasn't able to get back in. Fast forward to today, I've managed to move to the UK like I've always wanted and worked a few months in a factory, but left as the conditions were absolutely terrible and it had a very racist environment, which sickens me.   


From that day until now I've been in a really shitty situation. Unemployed and bills to pay in a foreign country, might have to go back to my country if I stay unemployed for too long and I don't want to have to do that. I'm stressed, my partner's stressed and I hate seeing her that way.

Not long after that I heard her talking to my older brother about it and I started seeing more baby stuff around the house. So by this point it’s very obvious that she’s pregnant so I kinda assumed she’d tell me in her own time. Well I was wrong, she told everyone but me including my little sister (9) who is the only one who has told me. She is now very visibly pregnant, still hasn’t told me and hasn’t invited me to do things, which my other sibling are doing that involves the baby. This includes a heart rate monitor that everyone except me was invited too.

She confessed her feelings and I did too but was very hesitant and told that I didn't know if it was the best to date. Since she got out of a breakup and had been hooking up with an fwb (who she somewhat cheated on her last bf with) 

She assured me there was no guy but still. I then found out she was still talking to the fwb. We had a huge fight and didn't talk for months. 

We then came back to eachother and dated. But this time her ex came into the pic. He was sending her flowers, she had a convo with him and she even cried cause I told her how she is close with his family and I don't want that. She became a bit controlling by screening my calls, having dreams of me cheating, and by making me block an old female friend. 

Anyways one day all this just popped and we had a huge fight and I called her some mean words and made fun of her sexual skills. She left me. I apologized for a week straight. Begging her back and telling her how I hadn't been feeling myself lately (it was a rough year for me)

Also I didn't want to engage in intercourse with her as well cause I wanted to save till marriage so anytime we did something sexual I would get this anxiety rush. So to cover up I told her that I had a bad sexual experience once and almost assaulted. 

Anyways while I apologized she rubbed it in my face how she is sleeping with her co worker. This was the guy she snapped so much and texted so much. Yet I never said anything. 

I couldn't believe it till a month later I saw them kissing at a wedding together. 

2 months after that she liked posts of my family she never knew and they blocked her.  She still follows some that she never knew but they don't know her so they don't follow her.

They know about the effects of alcohol and alcoholism and are pretty upset at her SO for acting the way he is.

I like to enjoy a good beer every once in a while but I still wake up every day and get my responsibilities done.

However, I hate the course and didn't do very well at the end of first year. It is also a very small place  with not a lot going on.
I'm quite sporty but the sport is a let down, as well as the social side of the sport. Furthermore, all my good friends are going on placement and I'm not so I essentially have to make best mates all over again. 

Basically I don't know whether to transfer into second year on a different course at the same place or move to another uni where I have seen an interesting course and have friends from home there who have vouched for it being enjoyable and good. It it not ranked as high in league tables though but has a good business school and is in a city and is social.

If I stay at my current uni I have to find a placement as part of the course but with a 2-2 in first year I don't know if I would find a good one.

So to start, the relationship I (21, F) have with my boyfriend (22,M)  is something that I cherish greatly. He is my rock, someone who  is and has been there for me through everything. We've been dating for about three years already, and I am so happy to have him in my life.

That being said, I can see how it affects him that I don't have control over my decisions and freedom. I currently live at home with my parents. I have been living with them through all my years of college. I am in my fourth year right now.

I love my parents a lot, and I recognize that they're overprotective because I am an only child, on top of that I am a FEMALE only child. They are also religious, and without going into too much detail, I have been living at home and putting up a farce of being religious. It seems like the easiest option right now, since if I tell them I want to break away from religion they will likely crack down harder and become even more overbearing. 

I don't currently have a curfew. That is, one day they tell me to be home by 8pm. And then I'll ask for 9 pm. So I get 9:00. And the next day, because I stayed out late the day before, will revert back to 8pm. If I'm staying late on campus to study, my parens have no problem and I have however long I need. If they know I'm done with classes and simply staying late to hang out with friends, or be with my SO, its a crackdown to 9 pm max. So I can conclude they are just not comfortable with the concept of my spending time with my SO on my own.

I have to ask to go anywhere, whether it be to the mall a friends house, or trips. I have been doing this all my life, and it feels normal. But already being in my 20's, I'm beginning to wonder if it is. I've recently been talking with my mother (the more reasonable of the two parents) about sleeping over at my boyfriends apartment. The very immediate response is a hard no, and I don't know how to feel about it. She and my father are not comfortable with the idea of my sleeping over with my boyfriend. Should I be upset? I feel like it's somewhat reasonable, since I am financially dependent on my parents, and I understand they feel more reassured if I sleep in my own bed. 

My boyfriend is in another boat. He has been quite independent since he was younger, and of the two of us, has a stronger personality. He often gets his way through brute force of will. For him to have to abide by my parents rules is taking its toll on him, I can see that. He has to, because he does not really have a choice. And I respect how difficult it can be for him, given that he cannot change the situation without aggravating it further. The balance I have with my parents is a tentative construct. I recognize that my boyfriend just wants to spend more time with me, but every time I have to leave home early, every time we have to change plans because my curfew got changed to an earlier hour, every time I have to let him down easy on a trip he is planning on his head etc. he withdraws into himself and becomes so upset about it. Never **at** me, but I can see how hard it is on him. 

I want more freedom, but I have more reservations on speaking to my parents about it. It's not that I do not want to fight for more, but learned helplessness has taken its toll on me. I feel like I have no real arguments for what I want, other than ""I feel like I deserve this."" I suppose I am asking for advice, whether anybody has gone through similar circumstances with their family, or with their SO, where not having freedom is ultimately hurting them. Everything has been hitting me really hard recently. I would really appreciate some advice, or other outlook.",26Jul2019,1

608,"TLDR - best friend is a lil kooky! (sorry! not sure how to condense this story any more than i already have)

About 3 months ago, my best friend (E) was living with her boyfriend (C) and his friend (J). After solid months of spending every day together, C tells E that they need to have some time away from eachother and hang out with different people. Fair enough. 

E and J start hanging out more frequently and eventually come to the conclusion that they have developed feelings for eachother. I think that for a while they didn't want to acknowledge it, but hanging around them, it was easy to see.

E was always the person to wake up first and then wake up everyone else if they needed be. That being said, one morning, she went to wake up J so he could go to work. When she got into his room, she noticed him panicking so she comforted him and somehow they ended up kissing. Later on that night she decides that she needs to tell and break up with C. She says that cheating is not something she is ever down for, and she wasn't happy in her relationship anyways.

The breakup was messy. After multiple failed attempts of C trying to get back together with E,  C decides that there is no reason for him to be in her life at all. This sends E in a downwards spiral.

In attempt to raise Es spirits, J and her get an apartment together. They both thought that it would help because they would be getting away from her hostile home environment, but with all other factors still being active, it didn't get better.

E was at work one day and asked J to put glow in the dark stars on her cieling while she was gone. He agreed to do so. While he was putting the stars up, a couple fell under her bed. He went to grab them but found a noose and a journal instead. In her journal were multiple suicide notes.

J took her noose and hid it. When she came home and saw that is was gone, she threw a fit which led to J calling police to get her into the psych ward. Due to past traumatic experiences there, E felt betrayed that J would send her back.

After only just 3 days of being there, they let her go with a plan of things to do with J to keep her occupied and ""happy"".  People who are brought into the psych ward are ALWAYS there for a minimum of two weeks. E got out because she told her psychiatrist what he wanted to hear instead of how she was really feeling. Not good.

The day she was released with a day plan for her and J, J left town. He wasn't expecting her to be let go before the 2 weeks was up, and he also was never even told about this day plan until after the fact. This resulted in E once again going into a downward spiral.

Ever since then, things between them have not been great. E says things are good, but if they were, J would tag along when we are all hanging out. I guess I just wanted to believe E and never asked J what was going on; that is until yesterday, but I'm getting a bit ahead of myself.

Two nights ago, E comes to my boyfriends (G) place for the night. She is very mentally unwell and tries to explain everything that has been going on with J to us. Eventually she tells us that the night before, he had taken advantage of her while she was having a panic attack, and that he had raped her. Her words were ""I was just laying there panicking, and J was rubbing my back because C used to do that and it helped. One thing led to another and he just fucked me. After it was done I was devastated and asked why he didn't ask me first. He said he was sorry and didn't mean to hurt me."" My heart dropped. They are both such good friends to me and I just couldn't believe that J could do such a thing. My plan was to just not really talk to J. I didn't know what else to do anyways.

Then comes yesterday. I was meeting up with G and his dad at the mall, and as we were sitting down, we see J. J comes over and sits with us and is obviously not doing well. You could see how hurt he was just by looking at him. Since Gs dad was with us, J told us just to call him later because he wants to talk. 

We leave the mall and G doesn't know if he even wants to hear what J has to say, but I think it's important to hear both sides of every story, so we call him once we get home.

J tells us that E has been in very frequent contact with a long-gone VERY TOXIC AND MANIPULATIVE ex. E said she only talked to him every once in a while but I heard her on the phone with him when we went to bed and she was over. J says that he has been distancing himself from E because he just can't take it anymore. He says that he has been trying so hard and things have only been getting worse so he has decided that maybe it would be better to stay away. He also tells us that he sleeps in her bed every night because E has night terrors and has trouble sleeping alone, which I believe because she has talked to me about them before. She has also talked to me about wanting to kill people and just some other stuff like that.

J must've heard what E has been telling people because he recounted that specific night in great detail to G and I. He told us that he knew she wasn't doing her best mentally, so he made sure to ask ""Do you want to just go to sleep? Are you doing ok? Are you sure you are good?"" and she said she didn't want to sleep and was doing just fine. He never said that he asked her if he could have sex with her, but that he asked if she was good in other ways. He told us that she was very obviously having a good time, but that once it was done she had the most devastated look on her face. He told us that she asked him why he didn't ask first, and that he apologized profusely. He then explained to us how he felt remorseful for even just sleeping in the same bed as her to begin with because he knew she wasn't in a great mindset, but he just wanted to help.

J explained to G and I that in Es suicide note, she talks about an entity taking over her and sabotaging her life. She thinks that she has an evil spirit inside of her and the only way to get rid of it is to kill herself. She wrote in her note ""The entity took over me and kissed J. It then broke up with C. I can't live without him but he will never come back, so I hope you can understand why I am doing this.""

E and I both feel like we turn into different people when we are not doing mentally well. It is something that we bonded over because it's hard to meet people who deal with things in a similar way to your own. It's because of this that I believe her suicide note. I believe that she thinks it is something else, and she needs serious help. J thinks that maybe who she is right now is this ""entity"" and that it is trying to drive him away so she can finally kill herself. He was the only thing that stopped her last time.

E is a master manipulator but such an amazing person and friend when she is doing well. I don't know who to believe completely and I don't know what the right thing to do is. I live a very peaceful life and this is the craziest thing that I've had to experience in a good while. I'm so sorry if this is all over the place, it is hard to think straight right now.

611,"I posted a little while back about just resigning (so I wouldn’t get fired) from my job of 3 years.  I was a public school administrator and I worked for an incredibly toxic school district and I am thinking of changing careers.  I’ve been on 5 interviews and it’s almost like an out of body experience...I hear myself spouting all this educational theory and think...wow, this is all such complete horseshit and everyone in this room secretly knows it.  Every district talks about how they are a true “team” and my last district said that too...and there was absolutely no team.

So that being said I was granted unemployment which isn’t a lot, but enough to pay the bills.  I also found out that through unemployment I ca go back to school for a year to earn a vocational certificate and they will keep paying my unemployment and pay for school.  The deal is you have to go full time.  I feel like I would be stupid to turn the opportunity down since we all know how expensive education is.  I started to look into some programs but I’m kinda lost as to what direction to go in.  Here are some of my skills and weaknesses...maybe you guys can throw out some ideas I haven’t thought of yet.

Skills - very artistic, creative, I make costumes and have been sewing since I was 8, friendly, positive and a people person.  I love planning events, being really organized and producing advertising materials.  I thrive in a fast paced environment and I love the idea of working up to a big project, then starting the planning cycle again.  I have a lot of experience in the theater world, and have been in education for 12 years and I loved teaching and training people.  I also love health and wellness and lost about 60lbs 3 years ago so I got very into nutrition, working out and mindfulness.  I was also told many times that was a very strong writer, in my past job I wrote evaluations and coached teachers which I loved and also wrote many grant applications and was awarded around 100k in grant funds to my programs over 3 years.

Weaknesses - I am not a very persuasive talker which makes me kinda sucky at the political side of education, and I don’t want to do anything in a sales position.  I have no tolerance for working around a bunch of people with egos which is where I think I failed in a leadership capacity.  I also struggle with the “hard talks” like when giving critical feedback and calling people out on their shit.  I had to fire 3 people in my last job and I really hated that part.

I feel like there is a new path for me that combines my skills in education, organization and artistry but I just haven’t discovered it yet.  Things that lit me up a bit were going back for graphic design (I have a cousin who designs toy packaging) or event planning, but I am worried about the pay.  I was making just over 100k in my past job with a pension, benefits, and a lot of vacay time but I know the time off may be a sacrifice of this career change.

Any way we became friends and that was okay for a while but then she started having these issues. She would grab toys from my arms and smash them off the ground. She would push, pull hair, kick, the lot. When I stayed the night at hers I would often wake up with her staring at me. Sometimes I could feel her rubbing me arms but I would just pretend to be asleep. It was really creepy. She hugs me a lot and holds my hand all the time. Even though I tell her it makes me uncomfortable. She would stroke my hair and smell it too. It creeps me out. She has also come into school one day with a big knife. “For her protection”. She has groped me on so many occasions including this year, but she sees it as normal. She talks to me as if I’m a baby 

Anyway I feel that I need to end this relationship because I can’t deal with it anymore and to be honest I’m afraid to be alone with her. I’ve told my family and friends and my therapist and they all have the same reaction. Some of them go as far to say “you wanna hope she doesn’t get you in an alley and *assault you” (* didn’t like their choice of words)

I don’t know how to end the relationship without hurting her feelings. I’ve already tried to make it seem as we have just grown apart but she hasn’t gotten the message. It’s really frustrating 

So I just need help on how to cut ties with her. Which sounds bad but I just can’t deal with her anymore. I’m sorry but I feel like I’ve been through enough pain with this. It’s quite abusive.",26Jul2019,3

W has a history of trying to exclude people from our group but usually has a logical reason (the people are most of the time assholes themselves), lately though he has been increasingly rude to me, but hasnt given me a reason and hasnt confronted me. I only know that W could be mad at me from a third friend who told me about it.

Yesterday everyone hung out and W and L didnt invite me. I decided to quit beating around the bush and actually texted W (he didnt want to talk on the phone) to figure out what his deal was. I tried my best not to pressure him or act like an ass because i know him to be very insecure and defensive (W is the type of person who refuses to let himself be wrong).

Here are some screenshots of the texts for reference

618," 

Recently my roommate whom I also consider a very good friend of mine brought to light that she doesn’t want to live with me for another year. I did expect this because she is in a pretty serious and committed relationship with her boyfriend who also happens to be a very good friend of mine. She had previously told me they were discussing getting a place together when our lease is up in March and they would possibly move out of state and find new careers. 

Great! Happy for them and fine with me I will just have to start looking for a new roommate eventually. 

WELL. Yesterday my roommate decided out of nowhere to imply that she would be staying when our lease is up, I will be moving out and her boyfriend will be moving in. This got brought up in a very passive aggressive way. We were just discussing the bills (mind you this is at 9AM and I had only been awake for about 10 minutes) and switching internet companies. I said since I'll be staying I would like to switch to something more affordable and faster. She looks at me and laughs and says ""I don’t know why you think you'll be staying here next year."" and proceeds to walk into her bedroom. I am standing outside her doorway and we continue this conversation. I ask her what she means by this. She says that she might want to stay and that she doesn’t want to live with me for another year. I reply reminding her of the conversation we had a couple weeks ago about her moving somewhere with her bf. She proceeds to TELL ME that she might want to stay here and she would want her boyfriend to move in! AND ME TO MOVE OUT! WHAT THE FUCK. I'm at a bit of a loss for words at this point but I am becoming pretty upset. She then goes on to say that she's the one that pays rent on time implying that I must always pay my rent late. Not the case. I have been late a few times but I have always given our landlord notice, never been more than a week late, and always paid the late fees. The landlord and I have no issues.

She replies with ""You're always having financial issues!"" Again, not the case. I have been switching to a new job over the summer (which happens to be the slowest season for service industry workers) and have been trying to get caught up. Temporary thing. All the bills are still paid, just a little behind. She has had financial burdens in the past but we never made it an issue. I have offered to loan her money in the past. So I don’t see how that is even a valid point.

She then goes on to say that I don't take care of my dog. LIKE EXCUSE ME. I adopted this dog 3 months ago and she is only 1 year and 3 months old. She is a hyper breed but she also is a puppy and is going to be a very high energy dog. The dog is house trained, I take her on daily walks, she knows commands. Again, I don’t see the issue. She then proceeds to say to me, ""You don't own up to anything"". I find all of this very insulting. I walk away saying this is bullshit, we can talk about this all another time. End of conversation.

I know that has no legal right to force me out of signing a new lease on this house. I want to stay. I will not let her gaslight me and I will not let her bully me out of this home. This home that we have both enjoyed together for the past year and a half. She has no seniority over the house. We both moved in at the same time. I have a 2-3 year plan to stay in this town and finish out a degree. I am gaining stable income at a job I'm growing to love even more every day. She hates her job, has a boyfriend she wants to move somewhere with. Why would I be the one to move out? First of all, its not legal, second of all its straight up rude and inconsiderate to me. If she was considering wanting to stay we would stay living here together. Whoever doesn’t want to live with the other person any longer should be the one to move out. Not me. Right? It's not my issue, the issue is hers. It really sucks, I feel like I'm losing not only a roommate but also a friend. 

What do I do? I how do I approach this? With her, her bf (my long time friend), and eventually our landlord.

So I have this job I truly love with coworkers I enjoy working with. I’m never overly stressed at work and I feel valued and challenged which is amazing. I work 40 hours a week split into four 10 hour days. This is just enough time off every week to feel like I’m not overworking myself. And at full time hours, I’m finally to a place in my life where I’m making enough money to survive. 

I’ve done cashier, warehouse and call center work in the past and those environments have been miserable for me. I would frequently have panic attacks or depression spikes that would take me out of work at least once a month if not once every few weeks. I’d have to call off a day or go home early because I was having a panic attack. It was awful. 

But now that I’m at my new job I’m happy. I’m also at a much better place in my life than I have been in the past. I’m on meds. I’m in therapy. I wake up early. All the things you’re supposed to do. But I still have bad days. 

I’ve been at this job for six months and I’ve had to call out or go home early 5 times due to panic attacks and/or overwhelming depression. 

It’s much better now but it’s obviously still not acceptable. 

My boss just had a conversation with me about it. He offered to let me drop to part time if I needed to or to give him some idea of what would help me so my absences will be less frequent. But I honestly have no idea what to tell him. 

Dropping to part time might help but I’d be losing out on money more consistently than I already am and I don’t want to do that.

My family is divided between two cities and my grandmother came to our city to visit us for the week. The part of my family who lives in this city planned a little vacation for my grandmother and them and deliberately left me out of it so I can take care of their restaurant for them while they are gone on this vacation. I am the one of the youngest in my family and I realize that I am not the one paying for the vacation so technically they get to say who is included. And I understand that they needed someone to take care of the restaurant here, or else they would not be able to go on the vacation. I also understand that I am the younger, which means I have less responsibility, which is why I don’t mind helping them with their restaurant on the days that im off from my own job.
But I cant help but feel a little sad. it would have been nice to be atleast considered or asked if it was okay if they left me to take care of the restaurant. This happens a lot and I usually just shrug it off but this time I cant help but feel very dissapointed. I don’t care about a vacation. But i feel less and less like im part of the family. I do plan my own vacation with my friends from work sometimes (like once or twice a year) which they obviously don’t join me in bc its just me and my friends.

Now I’m leaving home for the first time, and I know I need to start eating healthy and monitoring how much I eat. (It varies from one to five meals a day sometimes.)

Has anyone else dealt with this? How can you monitor your eating without triggering bad eating habits?

TLDR: I used to not eat because I was obsessed with calorie counting. Now I need to monitor my eating and calories and don’t know how to safely.",26Jul2019,1

My dad is 45, I'm 16. I don't have a girlfriend. My parents are divorced since 2006. My dad recently got out of a relationship with a woman 10 years older than him that he really loved but she was like a gold digger (she vanished and doesn't respond to his calls/texts). He fucks women for money as far as I'm concerned (not sure tho).
That's all, I just find it extremely cringy when he ask me those questions in order: do you have a girlfriend, why don't you have a girlfriend, isn't there girls in your school and so on till he decides to stop (about 5-10 min but it's fucking annoying and cringy).",26Jul2019,2

632,"hello, so mid-june my boyfriend and i broke up. he said he wasnt in a place to be in a relationship at the moment, but insisted we stay friends because of how much he cared about me. i helped him out of a rut he was in, invited him into my friend circle, and got him excited about life again. we met each others families and everything was going great. we had also been doing long distance for about a month because i came home for the summer and dont go back to where he lives until mid august. he promised me he would be here when i got back, which i guess wasnt true because he ended up breaking up with me mis summer when i visited him. anyway, we spoke recently and he wants to meet up once im back. the thing is though, i want to be back with him, even after all of the hurt that ive been through. we had a connection that was like nothing ive ever felt and we often made plans together for the fall that he and i both seemed really excited about. weve definitely kept our distance after the breakup which i do think is for the best. i have suspicions hes talking to this new random girl, but i could also just be tripping. i dont know. should i just move on, or am i delusional for still carrying a torch for him until i see him again??",26Jul2019,1

634,"I was mostly raised by my mom who was a very good woman. She always treated me well. I grew to believe women were actually better overall than men - kinder, more accepting, less racist, less superficial, etc.. I used to genuinely believe: ""If women ran the world, the world would be a better place.""

But when I got to dating age that never really manifested. Through my university years I mostly got sneered at, mocked, disinterested replies, instant ""I have a boyfriend"", and negativity when I'd even just try to talk politely to a girl. Meanwhile I saw other men chased and treated like gods no matter how cruel or awful they were. I'm a very social person and people have always told me I have a good nature, so this was jarring to me. I always treat everyone well.

Even still up to recently, I have ""taken it all in stride."" I managed to get a few girls to date me over the years and they treated me well in return, so I said ""okay, so be it."" But I am finding that harder and harder to do. I spent the last week reading the scientific studies here:

https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill

For the record I am not an incel, and I hope before you disregard that link you actually look at it. I have now reviewed almost all the studies and clicked through to read the actual studies they are summarizing there and every single one has been accurately represented. I cannot find any studies that counter these either.

How am I supposed to read all that and not feel negative emotions towards women? Everything there matches my life experience as well.

It doesn't paint a pretty picture of female nature at all. Men get hammered 24/7 about ""toxic masculinity."" Feminists talk about how they hate men and men should be castrated, etc.. Well what about the opposite? Should we call this ""toxic femininity""?

The more I read and the more I reflect, the darker my mind gets. Why is all of this considered ""socially acceptable""? Why do we treat this as normal? Or okay? Isn't this the exact opposite of how we're supposed to raise our children?

I have never hated any race or gender or group of anyone before. But now this is where I find myself. And the thing that created that wasn't a lie or misrepresentation - it was just honest true science and a lifetime of experience to match. I can't put my head back in the sand. I can't unread or unlive it. So where does that leave me now? 

Do you think female nature will ever change? Or is this what we're all stuck with? If it can change, how can we make it change to be better, eg. to start - on racism or heightism? If it's what we're stuck with, how do I accept it without feeling negatively about it? Why do we pretend the world or women are not what they actually are? Is it all just a giant fraudulent act of virtue signalling? Is that admirable?

My mind feels broken because the illusion has been broken, and the truth is very, very ugly to behold. I still recognize that everyone is an individual and deserves to be judged on their own merit. But looking at the whole picture like an anthropologist or biologist would - it is not pretty at all.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that. If I could hope for anything it would be that female nature could change and better represent the ideals I thought women embodied as a child, but I don't see how that can be possible or what I or anyone else can do to make it possible.",26Jul2019,0

637," 

So this is extremely hard to write considering we haven’t told anyone about this besides family. I assume it may also be hard to understand since I’ve never quite heard of something like this so any questions feel free to ask.  

This is not a troll post. I’m posting from a throw away account just because it’s a sensitive situation for my family that I don’t want getting back to people in real life. 

I am a 22 year old mother of a 2 year old boy. I have an 18 year old brother and a 16 year old sister, both still live at home with our parents. I live across the street along with my son and fiancé. My mom and dad adore my son, my brother is fine with him too but my sister basically refuses to acknowledge he exists. 

Now when I say that I don’t mean that she just isn’t into kids very much. No, she literally will tear up at the mention of his name and does not want anything to do with him. If my son will be at a family event, she will not attend. She doesn’t hate me and will still invite me to hang out with her but she will pretend my son doesn’t exist and we do not talk about him in conversation ever. 

This has been going on for over 3 years now (while I was pregnant too), and NOBODY knows what to do. Since I live across the street sometimes my sister will be outside when I’m walking outside with my son. If she notices, she will immediately look away and walk inside. As my son gets old this gets harder to deal with and my family and I really need guidance. 

A little background on my sister: She has been homeschooled all her life along with my brother. She doesn’t have very many friends in real life and I feel like that affects her. I also have a suspicion that she is clinically depressed but my mom doesn’t believe in mental illness so it’s not really addressed. She’s such a sweet girl and I love her to death but this situation is killing our relationship. She avoids conflict like the plague and usually just wants everyone to be happy. That’s why this behavior is so out of character for her. 

We’ve tried talking to her but it’s like talking to a brick wall. She won’t give us any answers. Therapy has been offered, but she strongly declines. Like I said before, my mom doesn’t believe in mental illness so my sister has kind of grown up around that mentality. She may believe in it more than my mom but is just too scared to tell her, I don't know 100%. I guess bringing up seeing a therapist again isn’t completely out of question, but I would need to try hard to convince my mom and sister it’s worth it (Like VERY hard). We’ve tried slowly introducing my son to her but she will not give an inch. I’ve tried to do things with her without my son being involved so she doesn’t think I’ve abandoned her but so far it’s has been to no avail. We have also been firm about it, as in leaving her at home when we have a family event that includes my son but it doesn’t even phase her. 

My sister and I used to be very close especially when I lived at home and I’d give anything to have that relationship back. During holidays my family now usually has to coordinate two different get togethers and it’s becoming exhausting. ANY questions you feel would help you understand better feel free to ask. I will reply when I can. There’s so much I feel like I’m leaving out but this is already long as it is. I’m just praying someone may have a solution so my family can be a family again.",26Jul2019,2
638,"I created this throw-away account for obvious reasons.  Basically the story is my sister has, again, been abusing these drugs on a daily basis for months after previously getting off them.

She has been seeing the same psychiatrist for awhile now (since her first time abusing) and this Dr. has prescribed her amphetamine salts (daily morning use), two other personality disorder drugs (not sure she is even taking them), and two different types of barbiturates (daily evening use). Thing about it is she has a good job and is educated and isn't a total POS. Im incredibly worried, and Im not looking forward to the verbal beating she will give me later or for the possibility of her just ignoring me and walking away- but I know it must be done.

646,"I'm a male, 24 years old. 

Okay, so the past few years have definitely not been kind to me. I've experienced so much pain, disappointment, extreme boredom, sadness, betrayal, etc. I've reached a point in my life to where, I feel like if I don't take drastic measures, that I might lose all hope and optimism. I feel like my soul might become broken, to the point of no return. And I seriously don't want that to happen. 

Instead of taking medication or going to therapy, I'm a seeking a more natural, independent, alternative path. I've come to believe that I'm depressed, and this depression is mainly due to the fact of how dull, unadventurous, and painfully predictable my life has become. Every single day, I go through the same relentless routine. I see the same surroundings, I live in the same area, and see the same people. There's no sense of variety or change. Just a dull never ending routine. Now, normally, I'm a creature of habit. I usually thrive on a sense of routine. But I've now come to believe that my sense of routine is what's causing all my problems to begin with. 

A little over a month ago, I was involved in a car accident. My car was totaled. I'm currently going through the process of getting a settlement. According to my lawyer, this settlement could possibly pay off in a big way. Using money from the settlement, first and foremost, getting a new car in my top priority. But I recently came up with the idea, of using some of that settlement money to go on a road trip; to see new places and experience new things. In my opinion, that would definitely be money well spent. 

Coming from the northeastern part of the United States, my plan was to travel south, down to Texas. I have family members who live in Texas who I wanted to visit. Then from that point on, I wanted to see places like New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado. And then, lastly, my final destination would be California. I have a cousin who lives out in California. So basically, this road trip would involve me visiting family members. So it wouldn't be completely meaningless. I would actually have destinations. And then after that, once I feel like I've seen enough, I would simply turn around and come back to my home state. 

Now first off, I've never traveled across the country before. I've never been on an official road trip. I talked to my dad about this, and although he has somewhat encouraged me to take this trip, he still has pointed out some factors and things to take into consideration. First off, the fact that I've never done anything like this before, raises a lot of uncertainty. I'm not exactly the most outgoing person in the world. Secondly, my vehicle would have to be super reliable. Thirdly, my funds would have to be suffice. There are a ton of unknown factors that come into play. I would have to have a real game plan. I haven't even mentioned this to my mom, because I'm most certain that she would tell me it's a horrible idea, and cancel my road trip plans altogether. 

The thing is, right now, I only have a side job. It's not a job that I have to attend every single day. This road trip only seems possible at the moment because of that...that, along with the settlement money. If I had a full time job (which, eventually I'll have to get) than this road trip wouldn't be possible. So what I'm saying is, the moment seems ideal. I want to seize this opportunity. Years from now, when I look back on my life, I don't to say that I spent my days working at a job I hate, staying at home, and doing the same old daily routine. I want to be able to look back at my life and say that I accomplished something. That I went places and seen things. And plus, it's always been a dream of mine to travel, particularly to the western part of the United States. I've specifically always wanted to see Nevada and California. 

Another factor is, I definitely have anyone who could go with me on this road trip. This would be a solo independent experience. I would be all on my own. As scary as that may sound to some people...that notion actually excites me. I think it would be an incredible learning experience. I can't ask anyone to go with me, because first off, I don't have that many friends (if any, in a realistic sense). And the friends I do know, have full time jobs, obligations, financial problems, and responsibilities; things that would prevent them from going on a road trip. So going alone seems to be my only option. 

I'm doing this as a last-ditch effort to pull me out of my depression. Hopefully, this road trip would help me gain a new perspective on life. In many ways, this road trip idea is my last resort. 

Any advice?",26Jul2019,1
647,"  

TW: sexual assault, institutional abuse, abuse.

So, coming up, I had a very heartbreaking “start” in life. I won’t claw for pity from any of you, but the individuals I grew up with were narcisscistic, alcoholics, evangelicals and extremely abusive (Ever watch Mommy Dearest?). There was also sexual assault from a neighbor and decades of gaslighting from various family members, as well as physical abuse. I don’t care about it, or care to talk about it. This is just the set-up that will explain the brief extremes of behavior I experienced.

At 17, I left the house, When I had failed in my goal of joining the military, I faced a falling out with my partner, which kicked me back into “their” house. I was up for 3 days, sick with worry. My parents were having over-the-top meltdowns, breaking things, threatening divorce, etc. I lost my privilege to drive, work, and go to school. At this time I attempted multiple excruciating suicide attempts at once, and was hospitalized. It is on my “adult” record.

Being admitted into the hospital with no sleep, rapid speech and constantly panicked behavior, I was erroneously diagnosed with bi-polar I disorder and placed on debilitating, heavy medication (maximum dose of lithium, maximum dose of respridol, moderate dose of abilify, moderate dose of Lamictal(?) minimum dose of wellbutrin). From there, I was placed into a shelter system and medicated further (Cycling drugs. Swapped respridol for Haldol, added Seroquel, swapped lithium for max dose of depacote, etc.)  Under no circumstances were either psychiatrists “good” ones, and under no circumstances was I coming off those medications and getting out of the shelter unless I took matters into my own hands.

For the subsequent years, I had been through a maelstrom of meds, and coming OFF of anti-psychotics (of that cripplingly strong magnitude) can very much make you show psychotic symptoms. There are plenty of hallucinations and delusions on record, mostly when the medication cessation happened abruptly. In the shelter system, I had been hospitalized 7 or 8 times, with diagnoses ranging from “Schizophrenia” to “Borderline Personality Disorder”, based on 2-3 days of “behavioral analysis” (lol). 

I continued to force myself to get off of the anti-psychotics, and I also “rebelled” against the shelter system. After a few months of stabilization, I took up a job, got back into retail management, where I left off. I would take the 4:30 AM bus to open up the store at 6 AM and wait outside for an hour in freezing temps. I was just that dedicated to get out of there. That, and a lot of coffee, held me together. 

Things were smooth and peaceful for a while, and I worked part-time for 6 months. 

Once I was ordered an emergency court eval because my shelter-mate (who actually had schizophrenia) reported me to be out doing “illegal activities” when leaving on one of my AM bus rides. When waiting at the store, I was seized by police, and I lost that job. My parents actually had defended me in the ER, appearing and telling them that there was nothing wrong with me and this had gone on long enough, and I never had to appear before a court. I was seen by a psychiatrist and released the next day. 

This made me work harder to purge the medicine from my system and just get another fucking job. 

After the “detox”, I’ll say, I have never had any psychosis or excitability or mania. It has been 7 years since. My standing diagnoses are “just” depression and PTSD. The only time I have “triggers” for PTSD is when immediate family is around, or being in the company of dangerously mentally ill people. 

Also; I worked my way back up and into independence single-handedly. I’m aspiring for a Master's in neuro/psych or perhaps even physics. These are things I have ample passions for, and I’m simply apt with the “hard” sciences and the “hard” maths. Am working as a therapist in a behavioral health setting, aspiring for med school and if not, wanting to pursue some kind of federal work in the field of science. Why federal work? Its institutes like NASA and DARPA that possess the kind of projects I aspire to do. Even in non-federal work, some background checks require med record disclosure. 

I’ve a 4.0 from a ""Tier 2"" university, have done a multitude of extra-curricular activities and been on the executive board for some of the student organizations. Was almost a trustee (Didn’t know that was a thing until I was invited). I have exemplary character and charisma. Simply put, I’m mature and motivated. Also have worked 30+ hours the majority of my college career, in addition to volunteerism, activities and keeping up with my grades and active courseload. The rigors of higher education is nothing compared to the abyss I was in 10 years prior.

The big deal here, is that I've been issued a recent job opp with a government contractor in bio research. Honestly its quite a big deal. This could lead to scholarships, travel oppurtunities and just be a stunning lead on my resume. Although temporary, its pretty much 100% of what I'm interested in. However, there will come a time to hand off my med records, as this prospective employment requires a clearance. This is one of those ""fell into my lap"" jobs, and I knew someone who works for the organization. 

What bothers me is if I get into a field that seeks to make a good living, federal or not, there is a chance I can get “checked” for medical records. And I cannot have them expunged. And the advice remains the same, “Shame on you for trying to lie.” “Just be honest.” “Better to tell the truth if you’re going to put things behind you!”. 

Why is it that, people who have criminal records are able to have theirs expunged for the bad decisions that THEY made? Why do I have to suffer for the bad decisions that OTHERS have made that caused me to do one “mistake” (trying to end my life), and anguish beneath the hands of others in a broken system? Why am I held to accountability from who I was in the grip of intense abuse, then someone is for breaking and entering? If any prospective employer were to see the record of age 17-22, I would be fundamentally, absolutely, unemployable. Even in a retail context.

I’m 28 now and I have erected my life in a way that I’ve seen few be able to. In terms of my mental health… sometimes I have stressful, vivid dreams about the shelters or my childhood. Keeping up with exercise, eating right and nourishing social relationships helps to mend the depressive symptoms. I take a light dose of Wellbutrin, but that's about it. 

My questions are: Can I have medical records expunged? In this circumstance, that may threaten legal terms of employment, do you think exceptions can be made?

Can I ""navigate"" the disclosure in a crafty way? Can I not list the institutions or addresses involved with hospitalization?

Is it too late to sue anyone for malpractice?

I don’t see things that aren’t there, hear things that aren’t real or believe things that aren’t true, and I never fucking have. The only extreme paranoia I have, is about my fucking medical records.

650,"I was adopted at the age of 3 from China by a white family, found on a park bench in a large city. There is next to impossible chance of me finding my birth family. Whenever people find out I’m adopted, they always ask if I know my birth parents or want to find them. Truthfully, I’d love to meet them or at least see what they look like, but I’m realistic enough to know my rudimentary Chinese is nowhere good enough and I don’t have the funds to plan a soul searching excursion to try to find them. So I’m realistic about it, but it still feels kind of tender when people ask probing questions. I also feel like I then have to give them a history of  Chinese female adoption and gender based discrimination. 

What are some things I can say to politely end the conversation or tell them to do some basic google searches to enlighten themselves if they’re so curious? I don’t want to be hostile but it makes me flustered because of all the insinuation I feel that I’m in the wrong for NOT wanting to search for them.

Shortly after (about two weeks) I tried to go back to him and continue our relationship... he denied.

Till this day (I'm 22 now) I continuously think about him .. I even had a dream with him last night!

It really sucks because our families spent lots of time together and I loved his family and how they were with me... we had just thought that we were going to get married etc and I love what we had going on from the outside.

A fellow redditor is concerned because she may think I have genital herpes on my thigh. I broke out 4 days ago. I got tested on July 6th at a clinic. Came back clean for HIV, Syphilis, but not tested for Herpes because that’s not part of the free testing. Haven’t messed with anyone else after we messed around 3 weeks ago. My doctor thinks it’s a spider bite that got infected that crawled up my inner thigh and left its mark. The second picture with all of the dots I’m very concerned about as well. I got blood work done today at hospital for HIV, Herpes and other things so and it’s gonna take a week or so for the results. Anyone fellow medical redditors on here have a good assumption that the second picture isn’t herpes? I don’t shave my thighs so it can’t be ingrown pimples.

662,"We adopted our puppy at 10 weeks old from a rescue centre. He has only 3 legs after having one of his hind legs amputated at only a few weeks old after being bought from a puppy farm at 4 weeks old and then 'falling' down some stairs, where his leg was badly broken. His injury was not treated correctly and his leg sadly fused backwards, leading to complete muscle wastage. Eventually he was handed in to the rescue centre where his leg was amputated and we adopted him a few weeks later.
We were lead to believe that he would live a healthy life but unfortunately it soon became apparent that this would not be possible as he was unable to walk at all. We took him to multiple vets who told us to euthanize him and were even let down by the company we insured him with after they decided to put an exclusion on his legs after finding out he could no longer walk. After searching around we finally got him seen by a new vet who sadly told us that he has a damaged hip joint and socket, with a hole through his pelvis and a damaged knee. We need to raise the remaining funds to help us pay for his surgery after using all of our savings and receiving a donation from the rescue centre we adopted him from. The remaining fees could go up if he needs extra medication, minor surgeries during his stay etc. Any extra donations will help pay for this and hydrotherapy which he will need for life. We have been taking him to hydrotherapy for the last 2 months and have seen a huge improvement as he now has muscle mass and the ability to weight bare, but this is very expensive.

671,"This literally happened a few minutes ago. And I’m afraid it might happen again in the future. 

I live on the 50th floor of a condominium.

I was just chilling in the room when all of a sudden I heard meowing noises. I thought at first it might have come from the video I was watching but when I paused it, I can still hear the meows. Looked over to my window and I see a tabby cat on my balcony.

I panicked, opened my balcony door and let him in. He seemed friendly enough to allow me to touch him, so I left him alone in the room first to knock on doors to see whose cat it is. 

The cat belonged to the one next to me, who seemed genuinely shocked and worried that his cat was with me. Thanked me as I gave him back his cat and I thought that was that.

Not even 30 minutes after giving the cat back, the cat was meowing on my balcony again.

Gave it back to him a second time.

1. What can I do on my end? I don’t have anything big enough to block my side of the balcony to prevent him from climbing back.

2. Should I tell the owner to be more careful leaving his door open? I’ll be gone over the weekend and I fear his cat might go back over while I’m away. Last time I gave the cat back, the owner was quick to close his door after a quick thanks.

3. If anything should happen to the cat, would he have reason to put blame on me?

4. What should I do next time this happens?

To answer questions some of you may ask:
1. This is the first time it has happened
2. Our condominium does allow pets, just not sure if this one is registered with the building—as they require it
3. He’s American (I think? Not sure, can’t tell exactly but he is caucasian) but we’re in the Philippines

I’m a big animal lover. I may not have pets now but I would definitely make measures if something like this happened with any of my fur buddies.

674," **Background:** I (24F) am currently working as a 6 month seasonal. Me and some others were provided housing in a 4 bedroom home. One of my roommates and co-worker/team-lead (29M), who I will call Drew, lives with me as well as another coworker (19M) and another in a building outside (29M), I will call him Steven. I am the only woman.

Now, me and my co- worker are required to stay close pretty much 40 hours a week since it is a field job. Resulting from that, our living situation and similarities I had begun getting very close to him. We shared many personal stories, thoughts, etc...and I could never see him as more than a friend. I thought we would be one of those life long friends.

Everything was great we were all cool w/ each other. But, eventually me and the co-worker outside began to develop a flirtatious relationship. We never acted on anything, mainly b/c he is kind of a jerk. He gave me mixed signals and it was just one of those annoying situations I would tell my co-worker about. I told him I could talk to him like a gf and he promised he would never ever share my thoughts w/ anyone.

Eventually it was obvious the other two guys did not like my co-worker. They wouldn't invite him anywhere and gave mild criticism. As I would complain about the confusing push/pull nature of my relationship w/ Steven (I tried to cut off the flirting but eventually gave in again) he would complain about the 2 guys (who I had no problem with but recognized they were being jerks to Drew).

**The problem:** Last Monday at work I was called in to a meeting with Drew &amp; the 2nd most important boss in that office. I was shocked and in a panic b/c it felt serious. She explained that *Drew said he did not want Steven or the other roommate there anymore, and that something ""bad"" (?!) could potentially happen to me if he didn't say anything. In private he told me he knew i would be upset but he did it b/c he is team leader and knows best. Although work life has been kept very professional. My problem is, I never said i felt threatened and it felt like slander to me. He did not ask for my final opinion on how I felt about Steven. I thought he knew i liked him. I have a problem w/ being attracted to assholes. I never thought he would break his promise of not telling anyone my thoughts and relationship w/ Steven! I felt my trust broken, and if i thought there was a problem he should know i am more than capable of taking care of it. It felt like he didn't like them so he used my situation to meet his agenda. But I want to be wrong!*

I ended up talking to 2 supervisors to let them know I had no problem w/ Steven or the other roommate, that I felt safe to avoid getting someone fired. The whole thing felt unprofessional and has me distressed, since I have never had a problem like this. I know I made a huge mistake probably in over-sharing, and I am trying to figure out what I did to cause this.

I am really just looking for some advice or comments that could help me adjust, think about this in a healthier way, etc. Mostly I am so upset that it is getting in the way of my functioning at work. It's very hard to be around Drew now that i feel somewhat betrayed.",26Jul2019,2

My kid's parents aren't getting K back. Likely I will keep K until 18 years of age. If I get guardianship I can travel with K which would be nice and raise K as I see fit.  However I am worried that I won't have the social worker as a barrier between me and the crazy parents. They already lie about me and threaten to sue me constantly. They lie to K about me as well, it's very stressful. 

Also, I am worried about losing benefits. I can afford to be a foster parent because the state contributes money every month and a clothing voucher once a year and pays for K's extra curricular activities. I'm worried that K may miss out on some activities and benefits if I become guardian. I hope K will go to college one day but I can't tell if having guardianship will prevent the state from paying for it. I have looked online and it says I can still be financial support but if the state just decides to stop paying then I have no recourse. I can't complain to the social worker because K won't be in foster care any more.

Yesterday, he decided to walk to work, which takes him about 20 minutes, just for the hell of it. It looked like it was gonna rain, and I knew he had a meeting after he clocked out, so I suggested it’d be smart to take the car. Him and I were supposed to go to a movie right after his meeting so if he was walking and it was raining, it’d be near impossible for him to make it on time. I asked him why he wanted to walk so badly, especially if he wanted to go somewhere with me right after? It’s not really efficient or thoughtful. I told him this, and he told me that he’s never walked to work before and he wanted to try it.

Fast forward after the meeting, it was pouring rain, he had no car, no form of transportation, he decided to walk home. When he got home, he was soaked and incredibly angry. His phone got wet so it doesn’t work, now he has to pay $90 dollars to repair it. I asked him why he didn’t call me to pick him up, and he got angry and said “what do you want, do you want me to say I’m sorry? I’m tired and soaking wet, just leave me alone.” He hid in the room for the rest of the night.

Today, he woke up early and took the car to work. Before that, he apologized for having reacted the way he did and that he won’t do it again. The thing is, I know he’s going to continue to not take my advice. I’ve told him that I just want to help him out so he doesn’t get into situations like yesterday’s, but he just seems to ignore what I’m saying.

We are paying rent 50/50, but my parents pay for my rent while I am in university. My parents live in Europe and I get to see them once or twice a year, and since I cannot go to see them in Europe this summer, they want to come here instead (they are both Canadian but are working abroad), and they have a house, but about an hour and a half away from where I live. The problem is that my parents want to come stay at our place for about a week, because my mom says she wants to see me (which means she wants to spend every minute of each day they’re here with me) and doesn’t want to be at the family house because it’s far and I don’t have a car or license to go, plus I work. However, I know this would bother my girlfriend, because one of my best friends is coming for a week next month and staying at our place and she wasn’t too enthusiastic about it. I understand her point of view because she has to work 6 days a week at a stressful job and wants to be able to just relax and do her thing when she comes home, and having your boyfriend’s parents over for that long is a bit stressful too on top of that.

690,"He's not \*technically\* my cousin, but family friend's son so we consider each other cousins. He's 19, gonna be a sophomore in college, and he's steadily getting worse. I'm a girl one year younger than him (18). He also has a younger sister (16).

He has autism/aspergers, mid functioning I guess, but I don't know how much this affects his actions.

He was a weird kid when he was younger, shy but not too bad. He had a few episodes, such as pooping and peeing in the sink and leaving it there.

It wasn't until later that he started going downhill, or maybe I just heard about it later. I'll list some of the things he's done.

He's definitely gotten meaner over the years. He doesn't keep friends that long at all. It seemed like he just had bad friends but he's become more obnoxious and goings out of his way to annoy and upset others in little and big ways. If you tell him you don't like it when he does something, he'll keep doing it, usually doing it more. After a friend group dropped him, he showed up at their vacation house because they \*technically\* didn't rescind his invite and spent the whole time making them uncomfortable. 

He's also gotten violent. He's hit his mother, father, and younger sister. Not slaps, full on punches to the face when he gets mad. This has been recent, but he has quite a temper. His parents scramble to keep him happy and the more he acts out, the more they cater to him. He deliberately makes life harder for them and his sister and it's taken a huge toll on his parents. 

He even threatened to shoot up his school. I believe legal action was taken but he threatened it. I don't think their family even owns a gun but he was willing to murder his classmates.

I was completely unaware of this, though. He's always been extremely nice to me because I've been his only consistent friend throughout his life. He's a pushover to keep me happy, and never displays any of these actions to me. I've never felt unsafe around him. 

However, I recently saw this side of him directed at my mother. Being nasty and going out of his way to ruin her vacation (we went on a trip together, both our families, to celebrate his sister's 16th).

As we said we were going to walk instead of drive, both girls said that we should just get in the car and go with them, but we didn't. Keep in mind we had all been drinking, except the driver of course. On the walk back I started thinking of why I didn't ask her for her number, so I texted my friend who was the driver if I could get it from him, since he knew them. He gave it to me and said that she texted it in on his phone. I ended up texted her two days later in the afternoon after I finally got some free time at work. I just told her who I was and asked if this was her. She did not reply until early the next day (today). She didn't really acknowledge what I said, she just said ""Hi MyName! How are you? ""

Around 5 years ago, my dad had an affair - it obviously caused a lot of friction in the family. My mum has suffered from depression for a while, so she took it pretty bad. But cutting a long story short, things seemed to sort itself out within a few months and it was brushed under the carpet.

Fast forward to the present day and I live around 40 miles away from where my parents live, and my sister and her boyfriend live in the same village, around 2 or 3 miles from them.

I get wind from my sister's boyfriend that there's been a huge row at home. My mum suspects my dad is having an affair again and she's been drinking all day. After speaking with my sister, my mum has suspected this for a while now and checks when he was last on WhatsApp, has planted certain things and is she he's up to no good. She's drunk and tells my sister she wants to kill herself because she's too scared to leave my dad. Then out of nowhere turns on my sister in a drunk tirade, which in turn really upsets my sister, who is now really upset and tells me she wants to kill herself.

Throughout all this, my dad is just saying to ""stop putting fuel on the fire"" and being extremely passive about it all. 

This is the first I've heard of this for a while. I check in every other day with them all and everything seemed fine.

I'm going back home tomorrow to confront my parents on this (confront is maybe the wrong word, I'm definitely going for a more gentle approach). 

It kinda scares me the thought of having to do this, but as the eldest child and the one most removed from it all, I feel it's my responsibility. It feels awful being a bystander to it all, but this is the first I've heard of just how truly bad it is.

-I have a shit job, it is customer service and I deal with a LOT of bullshit.  
-After the break-up I am needing to move out of our place together,  but I can’t afford to support myself in our city, so I will need to move SOMEWHERE regardless.   
-I only have one friend here, who lives in another state and I only see her twice per year max. I have more friends and family in my home country.  
  
Cons:  
  
- I have a nice car I recently purchased and I have a drivers license here, I would have to re-take my test if I moved back.  I may need 6-8 weeks of driving lessons. (They drive manuals.)
- I have two cats that I would need to bring with me which would be traumatic for them.  
- I would need to start all over again at 27, and I would need to live with my parents or my sister while I rebuilt my life.  
- I make ok money here for my age, whereas I would not earn this much in my home country (but cost of living is cheaper). 
  
What do you guys think? Should I move or should stay?",26Jul2019,1
696,"This is the first time I post anything in here, in fact, it is the first time I seek help from someone. I have always tried to solve things by myself but ... this seems like the first challenge that is truly overwhelming for me.   
I am a student yet, just got accepted in the university I have always hoped for, but have had many, many difficulties throughout my life because I suffer from mental illness too... I have always tried to work things out and be cool with it... just to keep my composure and be able to manage nauseating, suffocating feelings, thoughts, and pressures from the inside more efficiently. It is excruciating how you have to deal with problems from both inside and outside. But I have managed to do so up to now and do not strike as a person with any maladies to anyone. I am the calm, cool guy who stays out of trouble; now I realize I cannot stay this way forever.  
 Anyway, I think I had to address my mental instability.  
 This ""relative"" of ours asked us nicely if they could stay in one floor of our apartment for **only one year**; we had already had tenants there and because of their being our ""relatives"", we asked our tenants nicely and since they were very amiable people, they agreed and we did not renew the contract for their lease last year. We did not sign anything with our relatives either since, you know, we were supposed to trust one another. They said they'd pay a sum regularly each month and we shook hands on it. 

Now it's 2 months over the first year.  Not only did they not pay anything, but they also behaved very rudely as if it was their own home... We cannot take this to court because of specific reasons... I and my mother and 2 brothers agree to do so, but my father doesn't. He says ""he's my blood after all, and we should endure his son's insolence"". But why? it is unfair... He brings whores into an apartment where little children live and has no regard for anything. Talking did not work. He has threatened me before. Should I go to the court secretly myself? I have so much respect for my father and his word, mentally ill as he is himself... But this cannot stand. I cannot keep living with this. I am really cornered and terrified of seeking help from people in the real world, so, I hope you people can help me. 

&amp;#x200B;

(P.S. Where I am from, there is so much unnecessary formalities and people fake ""niceness"" all the time... I am not like this, maybe it's because I have avoided any form of social interaction up to now, but I have always been sincere and it hurts to see almost all people around me dissembling their true motives.)",26Jul2019,1

698,"So I'm currently living with my girlfriend in her grandparents' house due to certain circumstances. They have an Arris TM822 modem and are using Goggle Wifi for their internet. The people next door are my girlfriend's aunt and uncle, and they are on the same wifi, having both a wireless Google (router? adapter?) in their home and in the grandparents' house.  


The problem I'm experiencing is that my PC is pressed up against one of the external walls of the house, and my connection will randomly switch between the Google device in our house and the aunt and uncle's house, which obviously disrupts my connection frequently.  


Would getting a wifi extender solve this issue? I wanted to just wire the connection, but the Google device doesn't have any ports on it, so I assumed extending the range of the wifi might help my connection stay consistent instead of switching between two sources.",26Jul2019,1

700,"My last day was yesterday. Words cannot describe how bad my last job was. I was trapped there for 6 years. I feel like I'm leaving an abusive relationship. Basically if I ever wanted a day off my  job they needed 2 months notice, but the schedule (which was random) never came out until 2-3 days before the 2 week period. These were for unpaid days, we didn't have paid time off. It's emergency medicine. So 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. I worked the late shift usually (till 9, 10, or 11 pm) and almost every weekend, unless I was able to request it off in time. Sometimes they would throw in an overnight. On my days off, I was on call a lot. Meaning I could get called in any time during the day or night. The job paid pretty well, and they gave me a raise every time I complained or seemed unhappy. Hence staying there for 6 years. The straw that broke the camel's back was when they took away the time and a half for holidays. 

During the last 6 years, I've lost touch with countless people. My mental health crumbled (and then rebuilt with ongoing treatment.) My hobbies are non existent because any free time was spent recovering. I put on 70 lb in 6 years, which is very pronouncee on my 5' frame. The good thing is about 3 and a half years ago (1 year after I got help for a suicide attempt) I got with my fiancee, who encouraged me to find a new job, and has been very supportive. 

I start my new job on Monday. It's Monday through Friday. The pay is about what I was making at my last job, and has way better benefits. Im so happy I could cry.

Heres the thing. I'm not sure what to do with myself. Like, I don't know how to make friends. I don't know how to reconnect with people. I've become super awkward. My fiancee has either Saturday or Sunday off each week. Part of my awkwardness is my weight gain. Part of it has just been so long. I stopped getting invited to things ages ago. I don't know how to make friends if I'm just going somewhere by myself. Beyond the socialization, I want to find a hobby. I used to play in a band. I used to do art. But it's just been so LONG. It makes me depressed to think of all the years I've lost. Thankfully I don't think the weight loss will be a problem,  my sugar cravings are already gone knowing I never have to go back to that place. 


Any advice?",26Jul2019,1
701,"So, I got a message from a number I didn't recognize saying that they didn't know me, but I called them, and they called back but I didn't pick up. I didn't think much of it and replied ""sorry it must've been my bad and i called the wrong # or something"". (I know it was stupid to respond) 

I thought it was a bit weird, because I rarely call people, so I checked my recent calls, and there's no record of me calling this number, or them calling me. They immediately texted back and said something along the lines of: ""you had a very lovely voice and I think you said your name was \[my name\]"". I do say my name in my voicemail, but how the fuck did this person hear my voicemail if they never even called me in the first place??? 

Then they said ""My name is Charles, not that it matters."" The way they were typing was so quick and the phrasing made it seem 100% scripted, almost like one of those weird apps with the texting stories.

Obviously, as a 15 year old girl, I got really freaked out and deleted the conversation, but now I feel stupid as fuck because I didn't take a screenshot of what this person said, and I can't remember the phone number.

707,"I moved in to London, living with my ex GF and her family when I was 19. I've been here for a year now and we've since split up, as a result I've had to move out. I'm fortunate enough to have found a lovely, modern 2 bed flat within my price range and I've moved in. I live with one other guy, but he works on a Yacht for about 6 months of the year.

I've grown up with an family of 4, lived with my ex GF's family of 5 and 4 cats. I'm a massive fucking extrovert, if it wasn't for socialising I would have committed suicide by now. It's the only thing I enjoy in this life.

&amp;#x200B;

I work Monday - Friday, but I'm a software developer so there's not too much human contact during that time, though I still enjoy being out of the house. 

I have pretty much no friends, other than colleagues, in London. My friends from my hometown, which isn't too far, I no longer speak too. We've all gone our own ways, grew out of each other, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I'm not the easiest to get along with and I am fully aware of that. I'm arrogant, financially-oriented, etc and a lot of 'Normal' people don't like that, I tend do get on better with older people.

709,"Long story short, OUR dog (let's call him Bruno) was my brotherss dog.  For the last 2 to 3 years, he'd drop the dog off during the holidays and pick him.   Well, in the last year and a half, the dog has been with us 90% of the time.  The last time he picked the dog up was last November.

We have other dogs that Bruno loves and he and our only other male dog are inseperable.    My brother lives in another state, never checks on the dog, never asks about him.  So for 8 months straight, (prior to that we had him another 6 - 7 months) we've pretty much considered Bruno part of our family.   

So yesterday my brother calls and says his son ""misses"" the dog and they're picking him up in a few days.   Mind you, when his is here,  he doesn't even act like he enjoys being around Bruno.   He even made the comment, that ""when Bruno dies they're getting a puppy.""   DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A KID THAT CARES ABOUT A DOG?   

I'd also like to point out, prior to this, my brother had two other dogs-  One he gave to us because he was doing the same with that dog- dropping him and picking him up twice a year.  The other dog they had to euthanize because he was so wild from their emotional neglect that he bit a neighbor.  


I'm in North Carolina, the property laws here say I have to be in possession of that dog for a year.   It's been 8 months, but longer if you include the half year before that.  I'm at the point that I am going to physically stop him from taking the Bruno.   He loves us and when he is at my brother's house, he's usually alone because they work so much.    I NEED ADVICE...WILL A LAWYER HELP THIS SITUATION?  This issue had actually caused a divide in the family.

Things have kind of been crappy with this vacation for a few weeks. It all started around the beginning of July. I realized that we were supposed to leave for vacation on the 26th, and I committed to working that day for a very important. I told my friends, and they seemed ok with it. I texted one of my good friends separately about it and he was upset I ""didn't request off months in advance"" and ""I should have paid attention to the conversations"". I didn't think it was a huge deal, I would fly out later that night while they all drive (which was also a stupid idea). My friend (25M) was always bad about keeping me in the loop. He continued to say ""It makes it harder for us to schedule what we're doing when we originally planned on you driving down with us"" when no plans were even made. It was ""implied"" we would be leaving early that morning.

Anyway, we got past it. I told my friends that I was flying down with my SO (25F). One of the friends said OK, and they would wait for us and pick us up from the airport. How nice, right?

Fast forward to today, and we get a text from the same girl that was gonna pick us up (25F). She asked what time we land and what time we could meet at the restaurant. My SO asked if she was still picking us up. The friend from above (25M) who game me a hard time before feels the need to chime in and say ""Oh you're not ubering from the airport?"". I responded with ""Yeah she offered"". Then female friend got all weird about it and said ""Well let me me see if anyone has plans, we only have one car now"". It was always one car. I guess it was in another friends name and she needed to check and see if they weren't gonna use it at that time?

Let me be clear...I said explicitly and multiple times we didn't want to inconvenience anyone, that I was ok with ubering. I also apologize for fudging the plans and messing up the trip, insisting I uber. They still want to pick us up. 

Anyway my SO is all upset with me in private because it's just common courtesy to pick people up from the airport, but I don't know if it was that big of a deal. Then later that night I was talking to one of my other buddies who is also going. I told him not to wait up if they had things going on, and we can uber from the airport. He stated a hard deadline would be 8pm to leave the airport to make the reservation, otherwise we might have to uber. I guess hes worried about making it across to the restraunt in a half hour.

718,"I live in a pretty rough area in the UK and one family in particular don't pay much attention to any of their kids and let them roam free, say and do what they want. The house is so overcrowded with adults, young adults, children, grandchildren, dogs etc. They don't seem to care. 


There is a 7 year old boy who lives there and is so rude and bad mannered, I would hate it if he were my son but sometimes I do find myself humoured by him. 


Now that the weather is hot, there have been a lot more people hanging around the area. People are always pulling up in cars for drugs and hanging out with other people who live here. 


The kid was out today being nosey, there were some lads who were near their cars all smoking weed and one was fixing a bike or something, the kid was just being annoying showing off and asking what they were doing. 


I saw them teasing the kid, the kid trying to look tough infront of them and then literally watched as they made the kid take the joint and take a drag from it... The kid coughed loads and they all burst out laughing and the look the kid got in his eyes was like he had won the lottery, he tried to smoke a few more puffs before one of them took it off him in between laughing.

724,"Context: 

For 8 years I worked for a very large retail company  (global)  and to say the culture was relaxed is an understatement. Our Vice President would often visit the retail locations and take everyone out to get drunk. There were senior leaders and executives smoking pot in the fitting rooms with employees, doing body shots off people at company events, and generally contributing to a fairly irreverent and wild atmosphere. 

This was a company started and run by surfers, and it was a lot of fun, but it was fairly wild. Jokes, pranks, and roasting people was a big part of the culture, and everyone, executives to entry level staff made racist jokes, used slurs, etc to roast each other. I can't speak for everyone involved obviously, but the general sense was this was in ""good fun"", it wasn't mean spirited, and just was the culture of the company.  I get that it wasn't professional and potentially made some people uncomfortable or hurt. I'm not making excuses for it and I did actively participate in the roasting and used language I wouldn't use now. 

4.5 years ago, I take a new job. Again, very large retail company, but entirely different culture. Very, very PC and highly sensitive around issues of race, inclusion, etc. Me being the new guy, I try to make a joke to get to know everyone at a company event. I'm in a small group of 3-4 chatting at this large event, and somehow I make a stupid racist joke. I don't even remember what it was, but something about Asian eye shape and squinting or something like that. The point was to be offensive, as in my previous job, we were always trying to out-offend the next person. I say something offensive, you say something more offensive, and we keep going until we can't anymore. Like a game of offensive comment chicken. I can't even really remember what I said. Yes, it was very, very stupid. I'm embarrassed. 

One of the people in the group, doesn't say anything but just gets up from the group and walks away. This person has dark skin and Asian features, so not only were they likely offend by my tasteless joke, but they may have felt personally attacked. I immediately realize my mistake and I'm mortified. I give them space and then when the moment presents itself, I grab them one-on-one and apologize. 

They are polite and professional, they recognize my apology, but they clearly want nothing to do with me. Fine, I don't blame them. They've had one interaction with me and I acted like an asshole. This person gets promoted a few weeks later and I never see them again. I think about that moment though, learn from it, and try to be more aware and thank God I didn't get fired in my first week of my new job. 

Flash forward 4.5 years, I've been promoted several times in my new company, and now I work DIRECTLY NEXT TO THIS PERSON I OFFENDED YEARS AGO. Our cubicles are literally adjacent to each other. I don't know if they remember the incident. It was a long time ago, and I don't think I'm important enough to remember, but seeing as how it was our only interaction, and it was pretty shitty, there is a chance they do. Plus, even though we work right next to each other, this person never speaks to me. We have different teams, so we don't really have to collaborate, so it's not totally unusual, but because of my embarrassment, it feels personal. 

I'm curious, what should I do? Should I bring it up and apologize again? Perhaps those two people (that asshole at the company event and the new guy working next to him for 2 months) are two different people and he hasn't even made the connection. I literally think about it every single day I'm at work and want to make it better, but I'm at a loss for what to do. If he hasn't made the connection, I don't want him to. 

Please advise.",26Jul2019,0

My sister got kicked out of the place she's staying (not at all her fault) and in a gesture of goodwill, I offered to be her roommate. Now my brother is also coming onboard but he's broke and has no job and he hasn't even moved out of his dorm yet! It's almost August and we still haven't found a 3 bed 3 bath in Dallas. I really just wanted one roommate or (ideally, my own apartment) but I don't want to hurt my siblings' feelings. I know, I've put myself in this situation but does anyone know a way out?

728,"Some stuff about me:

&amp;#x200B;

I  have a 3.5/10 face. I have a defined but weak jaw, my eyes are too big, and I'm bald. The only things keeping me above a 2 are high cheekbones.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm decently muscular. I have some vascularity, a v-taper, and slight ab definition but nothing amazing. My height is average.

&amp;#x200B;

So overall I'm a 4/10 in looks.

&amp;#x200B;

I  understand this means my options are almost nonexistent, and the women I  would realistically have a chance with are in the 1-3/10 looks range.  But I hardly ever see any below a 4 in public. My guess is 1-3/10 women  never leave the house, and the ones who use dating apps get bombarded  with messages from men who are better-looking than me, hence my complete  lack of success on them.

730,"I’m (20f) about to finish a 6 week business internship with a small business. I shouldn’t even call it an internship though because I basically became the manager. 

My boss, the CEO, is under the impression that his business runs itself. Let me tell you, it does not. My parents both own their own businesses so I‘m very used to the DIY mentality. I knew exactly how to pick up the slack and fix everything he was doing wrong, so I did. His employees love me for it and are really nervous about what’s going to happen when I leave. 

Well, my boss offered me a job. After making some adjustments to my responsibilities (I’m still in college so I won’t be able to do everything I was doing before) and posting some listings for more team members, we’re finally on the same page. 

Tomorrow I’m negotiating my salary and my boss has brought up to me the fact that I will need to have some ownership of the business by having shares. My first thought was, “After everything I’ve done for him, does he really think I’m that dumb???” This is not a publicly traded company and right now he’s a single shareholder. It will never be publicly traded so even though I’m making all the money, he will always get to decide what to do with it. He doesn’t have to ask me for anything.

Also, not to undermine my own abilities, but I’m 20 and have worked here for 6 weeks. I’m just wondering what could be going through his head other than trying to scam me. 

This is my first real work experience so maybe I’m missing something but I’m just very suspicious of this whole thing. I asked my parents, who have been small business owners for 20 years, what they thought, and they also offered a resounding hell no.

So I need advice on whether or not I should own shares in the company I work for. I honestly thought it was common sense not to but maybe I’m wrong.",26Jul2019,2

I told him he can keep painting while I commit suicide because that's how depressed I am. Then I hung up on him.

**I felt bad and decided to go to his house. I went and he was drinking milkshake with his cousin and they were laughing. I just felt bad. I went out and he came after me, he was like hey and he hugged me. He was ignoring everything.**

**He said that he was about to come to my house, like really? I told him to fuck off of my life forever, i was mad and tbh idk how to describe how i was feeling, i just kept shouting at him and ran away, he ran after me and was apologizing but he got tired and went back home. I told him its over FOREVER AND EVER.**

734,"Let me start by saying that every financial debt that I've ever owed to someone, I've paid off.

In December of 2018, right before Christmas, a group of me and some old highschool buddies decided to rent out an Air B&amp;B in the mountains for three days.

Right off the bat, it wasn't going exactly as planned. Some of our friends flaked off at the last minute, and I believe that left four of us total on our trip (there were supposed to be atleast 6 of us total I believe). That led us to do the math and figure that it was going to cost around $160 per person for the three nights. In all honestly, that was fine with me initially.

We are all around the age of 21. Me, and one other friend (out of a total of three present) are in college -- doing okay for ourselves. In all honesty, I think I was most financially independent one there. Although it may be beside the point, the other two live at home, I really don't think they even have jobs...

On the last night during our stay, it was a dark, cold and rainy night. I believe we wanted to go to the store to get more beer. Long story short, I lost track and traction with the road and ended up colliding with a guard rail that ultimately prevented us from getting seriously injured. To this day, we were travelling on some of the most dangerous roads I have ever seen. Absolutely no light on curvy and narrow roads. Everyone was thankfully okay, as we were not travelling at a high rate of speed. Two kids who lived nearby heard the collision, and came to check it out. At this point, one of my tires had actually gone over the guard rail -- it was esentially a head on collision with the guard rail. We jerry-rigged a tow strap set up to the back of my car and towed my car off the guard rail with their truck.

Surprisingly, we were able to drive back to the rental in my car and kind of laughed it off for the night. I knew the fallout would be catastrophic, to say the least. Collecting our belongings and leaving the next day -- they started to head back towards the city, and I started to head back to my university. Long story short, I ended up getting stranded on the way back. From about noon to 10 pm, I was trying everything I could to get my car working. I saw that the entire engine bay had been displaced by about half a foot. The antifreeze and coolant lines had become disconfigured, my bumper was torn off, and overall my car was in rough shape.

Eventually, I had it towed to a nearby autoshop, then eventually to another one when I figured the first one wasn't going to be much help. Keep in mind that at this point, I am in the middle of nowhere -- hours from my hometown or university. I called my friends, but they said they were too far to help. I was a bit disappointed, but I really did understand. Thankfully, a girlfriend of mine came and picked me up around midnight.

Needless to say, the repair of my car was 50x higher (literally) than the initial cost of the trip. The entire engine was rebuilt from scratch. $7,000 for labor and parts... yep. Most people would say just to get a new car at this point, but this car was given to me by my father years before he passed. The car meant something to me. (Runs amazing right now by the way)

So fast forward to today, and my friend, who set up the entire trip and paid for the initial cost of everybody's share -- is still asking me to pay up my portion of the 3 days rent. The thing is, I am almost certain that his parents paid for the 3 days rent, and said to him that he could keep what we gave back to him. If it was me in his situation, I would honestly say just forget about the rent -- because that is what friends are for. The repair of my car nearly broke me financially, and now he still wants me to pay up for the Air B&amp;B.

So, Reddit, is this wrong? Am I in the wrong for not paying him? Please let me know your honest opinions.",26Jul2019,1
736,"I (20M) moved into my first apartment, and one of my neighbors is an older guy in his 40's. He came out to meet me and we had a good chat about the neighborhood, where we work, and other miniscule things. 

A couple of hours pass, and he invites me into his apartment. I accept, and we both sit down on his couch with Dr. Phil running on the TV. He then proceeds very nervously to tell me that he's bisexual, and tells me if I ever want to do anything sexually, he won't tell anyone and that he finds me attractive. He then asked me how big I was, which made me unsettled. We haven't even known eachother for a week yet, and have only talked twice.

I told him I'm straight, and I respect him coming out to me and I'm not interested. He wasn't pushy or anything, and respectful of my decision.

737,"My roommate works for a company that is currently hiring for a ton of positions. I have applied for a couple of positions relevant to my degree field (HR) there in the past and been rejected. There are (according to LinkedIn) about 250 people who apply for every HR job where I live. My roommate talked to the recruiter at her company, and they told her that normally, all of their HR positions are filled internally. I have a master's degree, and have been trying to get an HR job since I graduated last September. Obviously, it's a pretty competitive field.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my roommate talked to this recruiter and they told her that my best chance of getting an HR job with them is to get a different job at the company (secretarial or something of that nature) and apply when there are openings. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a couple of major drawbacks that present themselves pretty quickly: it's a $2/hr pay cut and you aren't allowed to apply for internal openings for a year.

There are some benefits though: it's a hospital and the insurance is good and the monthly cost is lower than I pay now, they pay for all generic medications (which would save me about $200 a month) and they give raises every year, which my current company does not. 

I have been working in my current position (project coordinator for an IT company) for over 3 years. They do not give raises, there is no room for advancement here and they treat us pretty badly so morale is pretty low. There's a lot of issues with people throwing each other under the bus and infighting like they think it's going to help them. It's a pretty toxic and crappy place to work and I obviously need to get out of here. I don't want to work in IT anyway, since my masters is in a totally different field. 

However, I don't want to just rush out of here since money is already tight. My husband and I both need monthly medications, he doesn't work (but hasn't been approved for disability yet), I have a cat that needs prescription food and a cat that was just diagnosed with allergies that will need to be treated regularly on top of other bills. 

The other thing that worries me is that my roommate keeps mentioning taking a mediocre job to ""get your foot in the door"" and a lot of people have given me advice basically amounting to ""it isn't 1950, you don't get a better job at a company by taking an entry level job"". 

I'm really nervous about adding a lot of entry level experience to my resume, since I already have a ton of entry level IT stuff on there, because that was basically all that was available when I was in college and the job market was bad. I did a lot of crap contract work and I'm afraid of people overlooking my degree and saying that all I will ever be able to do is entry-level stuff because that's all I've ever done.

I do have 5 years of HR experience as well as experience in training, management and a lot of other stuff in that area.

&amp;#x200B;

So, do I apply for this job, take a $2/hr pay cut and hope that it will actually help me get the kind of job I want and amount of money I need (I have a ton of student loans) or do I keep looking for something that is actually what I am looking for?",26Jul2019,1
738,"I met the guy about a week ago, we did some FaceTime calls and flirty texting, not much else. he told me on our first call that he loves role playing, so when he later brought up that he’s married, I played along and assumed he was just role playing over text.

Me and a girl dated for around 1.5 years. About a year ago, she broke up with me saying that she needed a break. I understood and took it well. Two days later, she tried to get back with me saying that she made a mistake, but I wouldn't because I was convinced we would circle right back around the to spot we were at. I'm realizing now, I made a mistake not getting back with her.

After trying to put myself back out there, getting ghosted by more than a few girls and one short relationship that I ended because of no sex and too much drama/bs, I've lost faith and confidence in myself.

My brain has decided to start replaying all the memories of me and my ex that broke up with me almost a year ago. I'll wake up at 3am and can't sleep because of it. I can't stop thinking about her and the good memories. I try to combat it by thinking of reasons I was glad we broke up, but the good memories outweigh the bad reasons. 

I've thought about contacting her, because we were really good together. But I've never gotten back with an ex and heard nothing but bad things about getting back with an ex. 

So here I am, torturing myself and it's all I do. I don't know how to talk to girls anymore. I guess it's the connections you gotta have; a reason to talk to her that pumps some confidence in me. For example, an issue at work that a girl asks me to resolve, I can talk to them and guide them through it no problem but if I wanted to talk to them just to talk to them, no way. I freeze up.

743,"Throwaway account as people know my main.

Context: I am 14

I've always been an overachiever academically. So much so that my family were able to move countries and I was able to get admission in a new, better school overseas. I realise that a lot of what I can do is pure luck at birth, as I naturally have been 'gifted', for lack of a better word. I also realise I am extremely lucky my parents are able to pay for my better but more expensive education.

When we moved, I was essentially mentally prepped by my parents that I would no longer be top of the class, easily come first academically etc. I would have to work even harder than I had before, and would still likely not be first (not directly said to me, but implied). They told me they did not care about results and just wanted my hard work.

The problem was that I didn't have to work hard. For the first two years in my new school, I still fairly easily cruised through. At the end of these two years, the school doubles in size and scholarships are awarded. I did work hard and was able to get the scholarship.

However, I have now completed one year with the expanded class. I am no longer quite at the top, while am still very close (for context, from 60 students I was probably top 2 for most subjects, and am now 4th from 120). My parents have made the valid point that I have not worked as hard this year, and that, after the scholarship exams, they let me be less serious academically.

As a consequence, I have had several 'failures' this year. Importantly, in absolute terms these are still very good; if my brother, who is one year younger and less academically talented then me, did what I did my parents and I would be delighted. 

Every time I experienced these failures, I try to get back to studying ahead of the curve and looking ahead, which I used to do much more. I rationally understand it is better for me, and I do genuinely enjoy the subject matter. However, every time, I accelerate for a week maximum, and then fall back into procrastinating and bad habits.

I guess I need advice on how to continue being ahead of the curve, and how to do the rational thing and stop procrastinating, when, even in the worst case scenario, my GCSEs and probably even a levels would not be affected.",26Jul2019,2

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.iv seen dudes sit there and she seems different and happy and then she’s all bubbly then as opposed to her usually being snotty af


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

And I know plenty of people will see that and say ""what more do confirmation do you need?"" And yes, I'm very grateful for everything he has done. But when I say he doesn't show his love, I mean it. 

He is cold, angry and seemingly always disappointed in us. He seems to have a deep rooted hatred for the world that he refuses to admit. He is, of all people I have ever met, the most stubborn and irrational person I have ever met. Time and time again I've seen him lash out on strangers in public and time and time again I've had to sneak back to said stranger to apologize for my fathers actions. I've grown tired of it. 

He recently decided to accuse me and a guest who I had over at my house of something we didn't do. Incredibly rude and unwarranted. I found this unacceptable.

He became angry, yelled, denied any wrongdoing (even after being blatantly proved wrong in front of my entire family) and ultimately decided to get in my face, demanding that I hit him. As in, demanding that I full on punch him in the face. Now, I'm not like him. I don't act like a child and i can contain my anger so I didn't do that. I did however have to leave the house to stop any further escalation.  

Now I'm stumped. I don't think me and my father will ever see eye to eye. I want him to be a part of my life but all he ever does is ruin what little happiness that comes into my life. Conveninetly, I left home the night that I had a flight out to Denver (I live in FL) and I won't be back for a few days) but I'm lost. What do you guys think I shljld do?

753,"I have no one to ask for advice on college because no one in my close family has ever been and my teachers don't really care. So basically I'm dual enrolled full-time next year, all that means is I will attend a local university like any other college student, but I'm still enrolled in my highschool. 

My schedule is weird though. Maybe it's just because I've never experienced college but basically I only have to go to class on Mondays and Wednesdays and I only have 4 classes. 2 of them (college algebra and american government) are about and hour and 15 minutes which is understandable, but the other two are only 45-50 minutes?? 

Coming from a school that had 6 year long classes that were 60 minutes every day for 5 days a week, I don't understand how the course material is supposed to be taught when the class is so short and only meets two days a week. Not to mention they aren't even year long classes, they just go from August-December. They aren't half-online classes either because I checked. 

Is this normal? Does this mean that I'm going to have a shit ton of homework? I looked up reviews for the professors and chose the best ones which led to my weird schedule. (But on the upside, I get to work more since I'm only at school for two days.) Should I try to change my schedule to get longer, more regular, classes or is this okay?

He recently decided to move out of the house to go stay with his family which moved back to the city we're currently in (his dad has a transferable job so he was posted in some random city).

But now that he's moved out, I have this weird annoyance towards him and I get quite pissed at everything he does. It's been a couple of months since I spoke to him properly and whenever we hang out, I'm just silent and don't talk much. It really gets awkward at times.

759,"Recently went through a financial layoff, and another coworker who was also laid off has slowly been sending me more and more suggestive texts. The twist is *I need this guy as a future job reference* \- his role was technically senior to me, and the work I did in marketing directly funneled into his consulting business development role. We got on together as coworkers (though as a consultant, I didn't see him much) and he's been very complimentary to my work, especially my writing ability, getting presentations in by deadlines, etc. He's been helpful, sending me marketing job opportunities. 

However, he's asked me to join him for drinks, baseball, basketball games various times over knowing him about 3 years, and I always politely declined. He's about 8-10 years older than me, and has supposedly been dating a woman who he's invited to holiday parties in the last 2 years. On the flipside, I always showed up solo, so I guess I've been conspicuously single. In the last year, it took an odd turn. I'm an artist, so we'd talk art, but then he mentioned he was at an erotic art show. He sent me a photo of painting that didn't even show anything - like shoulders up of presumably a nude woman - but I didn't quite no how to take it, and cooled responding. He later apologized if he made me uncomfortable. I figured it was a one time slip, and said art is art, wasn't really offended. Which is mostly true, but of course... post layoff, we'd been chatting more, about jobs, and he upped the invites out. He started talking art again and told me he decided to be nude model himself, and joked at how detailed they were in drawing the 'male anatomy'. I made some lame response like ""Gotta get the whole figure in"" and it's been silent for about a month.  Until this morning, he sent me a text that said, ""The weekend is here...time to get naked!"" This is the most blatant one, and now I now I need to say something. 

I'm thinking of saying ""I really appreciate your friendship, but I want our relationship to remain professional as well. This is making me a bit uncomfortable.""

Before I took it I was also considering pursuing more education and had a course in mind I wanted to go into.

764,"The title probably raises some questions, so I’ll give an explanation. Feel free to skip to the TLDR at the end if you don’t want the details.

I grew up with very conservative helicopter parents. I seldom talked to people inside or out of school, and I’ve had only a couple groups of close friends all my life. I’m a hermit, and haven’t really been encouraged to be anything else.

By the end of my first semester of college, I had to give up my scholarship for some complicated personal reasons. I came home until I could find another option, but that didn’t work out so well. I wound up taking a full gap year, during which I only held a job for a month, as I was depressed and suicidal to the point of being unable to work. 

I didn’t do much more than sleep, hide away in my room, and play video games. I didn’t eat or drink much either, and was overall physically and mentally unhealthy. It was a bad time in my life, and I don’t like to look back on it.

But that isn’t the point of this post. Things have started to really look up for me, and I really feel like I’ve been making my loved ones proud. I finally earned my license and got a car last October, and as of this last January, I enrolled in my local community college to study nursing. I even started a job this summer at an assisted living facility. I’m doing what I’ve wanted to do all along, which is helping people.

There’s just one problem. My habits of isolation, escapism, and ultimately dissassociation that I developed throughout my life haven’t gone away. I want to be as connected as possible, but I don’t know where to start. 

TLDR/Questions

I. I need some help connecting to the world around me. What are the first steps to clearing the “fog” in my head? How can I be more social without forcing myself on people?

II. I’d like to involve myself more. What are some reliable news sources? How can I help my community outside of school/work, and what are some options if I don’t have a lot of time? 

III. I haven’t learned a lot of life skills either, so I’d like to work on them. What can I do to learn to cook for myself? What are some tips for managing finances?

I know that this was a long post with a lot of information and questions. Even answering just one topic would be greatly appreciated. I have a long way to go, but I’ve wasted enough time in my life and I want to do everything I can to make up for it.",26Jul2019,1

767,"I feel conflicted about this. I had long, beautiful, thick hair that was in a blunt cut that reached my butt. I had been looking for a stylist that knows how to work with my hair type because it seemed like most stylists were used to finer, thinner hair types. Someone suggested this stylist that lived in my town as someone who knows how to work with my hair type. She owns her own salon. 

I showed her a picture of layered hair and said I wanted this general shape but with very blended, soft layers. She spent probably ten minutes or less on the actual cut, and proceeded to dry it and asked if I wanted it curled or straightened. I said no because I don’t like to use heat on my hair and I like my natural texture which is pretty straight anyway. I had a bad feeling about my cut because of how little time she spent on it. It was like snip, snip, snip, done. 

When I got home I saw that she didn’t blend the layers at all. They look really chunky and stand out. My shortest layers start and my shoulders and the longest is down to my butt. It looks terrible and not what I asked for at all. Now I have to wait for the chunky layers to grow out so I can get them blended by a good stylist. 

After the cut was done and I paid her she was really curt and kind of rushed the transaction like she wanted me to go away. I’m really disappointed because her reviews online were good. Should I leave a negative review so others don’t experience what I did?",26Jul2019,1

771,"We're 25 and 27, and finally after 2 years, we can afford to move in together. I was excited at first but the more I think about it the more afraid and doubtful I get.

We've always been quite different people and that's obviously difficult in a relationship. We've managed to make it work so far and are mostly fine at the moment. I'm worried because once we live in the same house, I feel all these differences in how we relate to our relationship and each other will only become more apparent. I know this is a necessary stepping stone and it will either make or break us, and that's scary. Like, this is it, the point we really get to find out if we're a good fit for each other.

**To give an example of what set off this current train of thought** - he's a much more social person than I am, and he wants to hang out with his friends (or ours, sort of) a lot more than I feel the need to - he would go out 5 days a week if he could. 

I told him that I hope he understands, but I would not be okay with our house becoming a main hangout spot, and if he wants to hang out with friends I'd rather he did that outside or at one of their houses (which they wouldn't mind). I'm not against having someone over on occasion (like 3 times in a month), but I'm moving out of my parents'  home seeking peace and quiet and a place to feel comfortable - not to come home 4 days a week to a group of tiring people drinking beer till 11pm.

He was visibly unhappy with this and the conversation didn't really go much further. He thinks I'm weird/antisocial because I think having to be around people so much is tiring, and it's impossible to shake him of this idea. I've tried.

So yeah that's one thing. We currently pretty much just spend the night together on Friday and the weekends and dont often hang out during the week (he wants to see his friends, our houses are far apart, etc). I'm kinda worried we'll move in together and... That just won't change. Or it'll get worse because he won't be far away from the city anymore so he'll want us to be out with his friends on the weekends too.

I know I'm rambling right now but I guess I kinda needed to write this stuff down. So yeah, I don't know what advice I'm really asking for here. How to stop being so negative about everything? Ways to make sure both our needs are met? How to deal if it all comes crashing down.... I don't know.",26Jul2019,1

Since I’m leaving the country in a week, I just wanted to let you know that I have forgiven you. Through trauma therapy I have come to realize that you abused me emotionally and sexually (pressured me into sending nudes and shared them without my consent). I have a PTSD diagnosis now, by the way. It was the worst period of my life and I don’t say that lightly. When you held a knife to my throat you may have thought it was erotic, but I have flashbacks and nightmares about that moment because you never asked me for consent and I was so terrified that I felt like I couldn’t say no. None of what you did was okay in anyway, but in a sense I am grateful for it because it has turned me into a stronger person. 
My therapist, family, friends, the school, my dad’s coworkers, my neighbors and I all have come to understand that you and especially your parents do not have a very firm grasp on reality. They also seem neglectful to you and I’m sorry you’ve been hurt by them. Their alcoholism seems to be getting very serious. I hope they can get the help they need :( 
And I hope you can as well. Please don’t hurt  anyone or yourself! Really listen to what your therapist has to say. Stop watching films on the deep web of real people being killed. And just remember that being a school shooter isn’t “cool” and it scares me every day to think that you might actually do something, so I’m begging you, please, please do not. 
And take care of yourself. You’re a very troubled person. I used to think you were “cool” or “edgy” but now I see that you are deeply mentally ill and I truly, from the bottom of my heart hope you get help :( 
Thanks for making me a stronger person. 
I write this simply to say that I have forgiven you for the abuse. Please seek professional help, and you should encourage your parents to as well!
Peace!",26Jul2019,2

However, now that I quit track, my sex drive has been so high I feel like I can't function normally because all i'm thinking about is freaking sex. It's kind of becoming debilitating because I don't want to masturbate, but I can't stop thinking about it. Exercising doesn't really help too much because my exercises will never be as draining as my track workouts. In matter of fact, after I hit the gym and take a shower I feel so good that I want to have sex even more... It's so frustrating because in my head I know i need to get shit done and study or whatever but here I am writing this reddit post on a throw away account because all i can think about is sex and i don't want to do anything. I use to be very motivated when it came to school because I knew I had to get my work done so I can sleep. I feel like even if i went out to study right now it would be unproductive and in the end all i can think about is having sex. 

I am also a virgin so i feel like the mystery of it all adds onto it. I want to save myself until marriage, coming from a religious background but i don't know if that's even possible at this point anymore. I really hate it. Has anyone struggled with this and how did they approach/ solve their problem?",26Jul2019,4

789,"Hey guys, I’m posting about this because I feel pretty confused. I appreciate any advice I can get. For a little backstory, basically 2 years ago I met this girl and we continued talking for a year. We were both 16 at the time, today we are both 18. After a year I developed feelings for her and when I confessed my feelings to her we tried it for a couple weeks. But ultimately she still was dealing with her own personal issues before she could be in love with someone else, she needed to work on herself and she basically didn’t have feelings for me. She was still broken from a past relationship. Basically I was left broken just like she was before, it was my first real heartbreak and it’s been over a year and I’m still not fully over it, but I’m way better now. I cut off all contact and blocked her on Instagram. I told her it was something I had to do in order to heal and I couldn’t just be friends. She was very guilty for hurting me but she understood. I’ve pretty much moved on since then, it’s been about a year and a half, but I’m still not fully over her and I still find her to be the only girl I’ve ever fell that hard for, no one else has compared.

Well yesterday, after almost a year of no contact, she sent me something along the lines of this:


“Hey, i’m sorry for bothering you 
I just wanted to check up on you and ask how you’re doing, even though you may hate me or don’t want to talk to me or something. Anyways, i really hope you’re doing great and everything is good and life is treating you good, And i hope you’re happy❤
I wish you all the best, Andd...umm.. I miss you. 
Anyways, I’m sorry again for bothering you...
Goodbye”


I woke up to this message and I was kind of shocked to hear from her after a year of not talking. I replied telling her that I don’t hate her and that everything is fine with my life. She probably thinks I hate her because I cut off all contact, but it was just necessary for me to move on. She replied with:

“I’m glad you’re doing well❤️ I just hate the idea that you may hate me or that i’m the one that hurt you or something, i reallyy hate it”

I told her she shouldn’t feel guilty about making a decision that she thought was best for her, whether it hurt me or not. Then she replied with

“No I’m not texting you because I feel guilty about it, honestly I’ve been wanting to talk to you for a while but I’ve been hesitating. And yeah about that decision I don’t know about that, I thought it was for the best but idk...”


Wtf is that supposed to mean? We continued talking about our lives for a bit after that and then I stopped replying.  But I’m really confused because it sounded like she regrets what happened between us and might want me back, but it also might be that she just misses me. I am just afraid that if she likes me now, that I will end up being hurt again, I’m afraid of feeling that pain again. But deep down I’ve always wanted to end up with her in the future. I feel that maybe, as time goes on we might reconnect with each other and it might end up working out between us in the future, because we both care a lot for each other. we both had such a special connection and we both miss each other, it was just not possible to be together at the time. But at the same time I have zero expectations and don’t expect anything to happen, and I’d be totally okay with it not happening, because then it’s just not meant to be. Right now we’re both in different countries at the moment, so I can’t meet up with her in person. Shes also starting her first year of college in the fall. What should I do from here, should I talk to her again or just forget it ever happened and do nothing?

I’m not going to lie, since I know that she will never cross the infidelity line, I flirt back with her while we’re at work. B will never text me outside of work unless it is for something work related, she is really anti-cheating.

792,"So basically, my mom has this female client who happens to be my age and very cute. Yesterday, this girl told my mom that I “should dm her sometime.” (Her family has known my mom for a long time and she has seen pictures of me and I guess she thinks I’m cute)  We’ve been following each other on Instagram for like a year, but we’ve never spoken directly before. How should I message her in a way that’s not creepy?",26Jul2019,1
794,"So this is very complicated and very long. I'll leave a TL;DR at the end if you cannot be bothered reading it.

So let me get this off of the bat. I'm 14 and me and my mother have a very close relationship. Not the type where she knows absolutely everything about me but if something bad happens we tell each other that. Since we left my father not long after I was born because of personal reasons, she's never been in a relationship since, she's talked to people online but not in real life. 

Anyway, my mother has a fairly large twitter account and she is very active on it. There are a lot of creeps on there and she blocks all of them and doesn't talk to them however this one guy she talked to a lot. they talked everyday and night for a while however she got annoyed with him over somethings and they stopped talking. So recently they got back into contact and I can overhear her calling him ""babe"" and they talk not only about me and somethings I consider personal but they talk every night and day over texts. So my mum recently asked me how I would feel if she eventually met him and I didn't know how to feel. I've never, Never really liked him but I don't know why. anyway, my mother wanted to talk about it and when it comes up I dismiss it because I honestly don't know what to say. I don't really want them to meet and be in a relationship but again, I don't know why. 

for a long time I had anxiety about my mother, still sorta do, where if she left the house I would panic. If she didn't call me when she arrived at work I'd panic. I guess I worried something bad would happen since we don't really live in the best of areas and I have a fear of being alone, I know it's babyish, anyway I've asked her if she wanted to meet him, since we live in the same-ish area that I would like her to meet him in a public place and I'd like to be close. I have a fear that something could happen since she's literally doing what people tell you not to do which is meeting someone online. 

Anyway I guess I want advice on what to do. She agreed to meet him online but how do I talk to her about my feelings towards him, I don't even know what i feel about him. i worry that he's going to hurt her and since she's been in an abusive relationship in the past I don't want her to get hurt. Please give me advice on what to tell her and am I in the wrong for not liking him?

802,"Alright so, obligatory this is an alt, because the person I’ll be writing knows my Reddit username, I’m gonna try to keep this as anonymous as I can, just in case he finds this post. I’ll try and keep this post as short as I can. 

Early this year, I met this guy (on a discord server), I knew he was a good guy from the moment I met him. We didn’t become close until about 3 or 4 months ago, now we talk everyday in DMs, even though he’s left the discord where we met. At first he was just my friend, but, I’ve developed feelings for him over these past months, they continue grow, and become much stronger. The thing is, he’s older then me (I don’t want to be too specific so that I can’t be identified, but he’s over 18 and I’m more then 2 years under 18). He feels alone a lot, like he’ll never find someone who loves him. The other day he made a comment that made me realize, he likes me as more then a friend too. It wasn’t specifically about me, just about the people he likes, and one comment about age which can only lead me to believe that he feels the same way I do. I also have to add that before I get people saying he’s a creep, he’s not, I’ve dealt with many pervs in my adventures on the internet, and he’s not one of them. If he does in fact feel the way I think he does, I know he’d never act on it because of our difference in age. Ever since he said hinted at him liking me, I can’t stop thinking about him. I’ve been up late af every night because my mind won’t stop racing, about what could be, about what I can’t have. I’ve had plenty of crushes before but nothing like this. I’ve never felt this way, we are so much alike. He’s awakened a part of me that I thought had died a long time ago. My home life is extremely difficult, and he’s helped me through so damn much. When I think about him my heart races and I feel things I’ve never felt before. Thoughts of him keep me up at night, and during the day I can hardly think of anything but him. I really need some advice on what to do, has anyone else ever been in a situation like this? Or is currently in a situation like this? If so please comment or DM me, anything you have to say is welcome. 

Now time to pray that I get some decent advice and that he never stumbles across this post, because no matter how much I edit it or reword it, pretty sure he’ll be able to tell it’s me.

808,"A little backstory on my history with tinder. I was pretty active on tinder last year. After my first boyfriend and I broke up, I downloaded the app because I was so lonely and didn't have any friends whatsoever. It was pretty fun but I ended up meeting a guy on there, we liked each other a lot and it wasn't until I was attached to him that I found out he was basically a manipulative manchild. He and I eventually broke up and I downloaded the app again, not only because I was lonely but also because I wanted to use the app for what everyone else seems to use it for and find easy hookups. And I did find some, but all except 2 were disrespectful, manipulative, and all about that ghosting shit. One of the guys I had a one-night stand with and didn't talk to again, the other I quite literally fell in love with (mutually) and we started a relationship, but I guess one day he woke up and decided he didn't want to be with me anymore and broke my heart. I promised myself I wouldn't download tinder again because of these bad examples of people I've met through the app.


Now on to why I have the urge to download tinder again after these bad experiences. I mentioned the guy I had a one-night with and decided not to talk to again. Well, I contacted him a few months ago and we reconnected and started a FWB relationship. It was going well until I started to catch feelings for him, but the reason we recently stopped talking is because he started that ghosting shit, which I find extremely immature, and I cut him off the next time he tried to contact me. Unfortunately, he was the only person I talked to. I don't have any friends and I can't make friends because my anxiety is so bad that it not only makes me scared but also makes me act kinda weird around people. I am also extremely insecure about myself physically and it's completely justified, I'm not just saying ""oh I'm so chubby and ugly no one will like me"" but it's my teeth, literally rotting out of my skull and I don't have the money to fix even one, that I'm most insecure about. That's something that's super noticable and will make people not want to be around you, I speak from experience.


The loneliness is biting so hard that I want to download tinder so I can have people to talk to, but I don't want to get hurt again and I don't want to advertise myself just to be the less-desirable option to hundreds of people. Tinder is the only way I've connected with people for both physical and emotional needs, but it's also where I've met a bunch of fake and temporary people and how I ended up getting hurt multiple times. Also, I don't want to meet someone and ""find love"" but end up just being an option to that person like before. Idk what I should do, I am so lonely but don't know how to interact with people irl so I feel like tinder is my only option (I've tried Facebook groups, I've met a couple people on video games but they live so far away, and like I said my anxiety causes me to act weird irl so befriending coworkers is out of the question). My 21st birthday is coming up this month and I really don't want to spend the day isolating myself as I usually do but I also don't want to spend it with people I'm ""friends"" with that I stopped talking to because they were snakes in the first place.

The seller clearly stated in his ad that the phone was unlocked, so I thought I was getting a great deal.   When I first opened the phone, I put my Fido sim into it and it worked fine. A day later, when I put my sim in, I got an error message saying that the sim is not supported. I went to the Apple store to investigate why. I found out that the iPhone is not unlocked, but is in fact locked with Bell. Ok, not a problem since legally phones can be unlocked for free I thought. Nope. Bell requires a proof of purchase (such as a receipt) to unlock the phone which I don’t have since I paid cash to the seller. I sent a message to Bell support on twitter to try and unlock it from there, and they didn’t require a proof of purchase, only an IMEI number. I gave them the number, only to find out that the IMEI number is linked to an active Bell account and I can’t unlock it unless the original buyer requests it. Unfortunately, this is impossible for me to do since the seller is not responding to my calls or texts. I don’t know how to proceed with this situation. Should I contact Kijiji support to report him as a scammer? try my luck with Bell support again? Try unlocking my sim with a website? Involve the authorities?

I'm a lot more positive than I was before and refuse to encourage negativity. So when he says depressing things to me I try and be as supportive as possible and offer suggestions but he recently told me that he doesn't like that which has left me feeling helpless and lost when he does say anything to do with how he is feeling.

828,"I had a May-July job as a swim coach on my neighborhood team. I'm 15 (M) and had some friends coaching with me. Look I don't know if this sounds weird, I hope it doesn't but I miss those kids I coached. My friend and I both shared the same feelings, and we said that before the season started, we didn't think we'd get as attached to the kids as we did. I signed up for the job just for the paycheck, but I got so much out of it from those kids.

It was from ages 6 and under to open (15-18), so I competed in the open men's races. I'm sure most of you can't relate, but there's a certain feeling you get when you take your mark before an important race and hear kids you coach say ""Go Coach Evan"" (my name). That just fueled my adrenaline and helped me get first in many races because truly for the first time in my life I felt like many looked up to me.

Some of the kids go to my school so I can see them then, but I'm just super depressed because I had so much fun for those two months, and the next time I'll experience it is in a year. I need some advice.",26Jul2019,8
829,"I haven't talked to my father in a few years. Back when I cut ties with him I didn't know he was schizophrenic. Over the past two years, I have talked with my mother and grandma which have both provided proof that he has been diagnosed (He was diagnosed in the early 90s when the symptoms began to show, and ten years ago when he was with his second wife). I am saying all of this because I don't want anyone to think that I am 'diagnosing' him.

My younger sister who still talks with him on a daily basis said he is going through a particularly bad episode and doing what he has normally done in the past such as quit his job, living homeless, walking around our hometown aimlessly. I have wanted to reach out to him for a while because I feel as though he needs someone to tell him that having schizophrenia doesn't make him crazy or bad and getting medication and therapy, especially for someone below the poverty line, is easy and doable. What I'm afraid of is telling him I know he is schizophrenic and him lashing out. He has always made jokes about being schizophrenic growing up, but we just thought it was him joking. I think he knows its a problem but doesn't really want other, especially his children, knowing its real. I would like to think that if he was medicated his life would be better since he wouldn't have long episodes of thinking everyone is out to get him or ruin his life. He has more or less refused to believe that he has schizophrenia, even with a diagnosis from a doctor. Has anyone else had to approach a family member about an issue like this? My sister doesn't want to have a talk with him because she is afraid he will push her away and if that happens he won't have any family (none of my family will associate with him due to his many nearly violent episodes from the past). I am very afraid he will die homeless and alone. It makes me sad to think that if he would have tried to manage his illness he could have been a better father, but one thing I noticed as his son is that he refuses to accept that no one is out to get him. I don't know if this is a common trait among those that don't seek help for long portions of time.

Thank you for reading if, if you have any questions for clarification please let me know. I really want to be able to help him, but this seems like a such a delicate issue and my sister and I don't want him to run away and cut contact with her.

The problem is that I am dating a guy who is 28 and he 90% of the time doesn’t want kids and 10% of the time he does...

So I told him he really needs to think weather he wants children or not so that we can both move on...
There is nothing wrong with him... he is the best partner I have ever had.. he trusts me... cares for me... makes sure I’m okay all the time... of course he’s not perfect but he makes me a better person

He proposed the idea of us going to Norway together next year. He said he’d pay for everything. I’ve never travelled outside the US so this is super exciting for me.

The problem is my parents don’t know about him and they are pretty strict.

When I’m away at school, they call or facetime about every day or every other day. My sister is in her 20s and lives at home, and even if she wants to just hang out with a guy friend they have to meet him and basically interview him first. 

So I’m not sure if I can get away with it. My parents are very paranoid about everything. Even though I’m pretty sure Norway is safer than the US, and I am an adult, they’d still freak about me going there with a guy they’ve never met. How do I hide the trip from them?

2)either a major in Catalan(which I already can understand 60% cant speak much though) or a major in just plain linguistics.
3)neuroscience(may need a backup bc this ones gonna be a hard one to pedal through) 

Questions I have about my current selection: 

•will i be able to get all of them in less than 10 years?

•what will my classes be like if i choose economics and neuroscience first?

•which one is better to aim for first?

•which one is worth pursuing a masters in?

•what should i change one to if i cant persist and complete the major? 

•how much would i be making after majoring in either three? Would it be more than the cost of schooling?

Except my dad, who says I have too much here to leave.  
  
Reasons to leave:   
  
- I have a shit job, it is customer service and I deal with a LOT of bullshit.  
- After the break-up I am needing to move out of our place together,  but I can’t afford to support myself in our city, so I will need to move SOMEWHERE regardless.   
- I only have one friend here, who lives in another state and I only see her twice per year max. I have more friends and family in my home country.  
  
Reasons to stay:  
  
- I have a nice car I recently purchased and I have a drivers license here, I would have to re-take my test if I moved back.  I may need 6-8 weeks of driving lessons. (They drive manuals.)
- I have two cats that I would need to bring with me which would be traumatic for them.  
- I would need to start all over again at 27, and I would need to live with my parents or my sister while I rebuilt my life.

854,"So, when my grandma died my aunt my cousin and a friend of my aunt used a homemade Ouija board to call her ghost (my grandma's ghosts), I was there watching and it didn't work out. Then my aunt and cousin (we three are really close) told me that when they three (my aunt, cousin and the friend) tried it alone it worked. My aunt's friend used to call her mother and father ofter (that's what she told us) and we wanted to test her if she was moving the cup, so we (me, my cousin and my aunt) thought of a question that only our grandma can answer but my aunt's friend won't be able to. And they told me that the ""ghost"" answered it. So this proves that it wasn't my aunt's friend who was moving the cup. Also my aunt called her by herself with another method that I think is only used in our county. The other method uses one person, a sewing needle and a list with all letters and numbers, yes and no, and goodbye. My aunt's friend told us that it's dangerous to call ghosts because it can be another ghost that might be bad, also other stuff that I don't really remember but she knows a ton of stuff on that topic. My aunt died recently and I'm thinking if its a good idea to try to call her ghost, either alone or with my cousin (her daughter). 
So my question is are those ghost calling methods really working? Could it just be our mind making us move the cup (needle)? Is there any risks in trying (I'm not easily scared)?

859,"Throwaway account because fuck that.

So I (M15) recently got out of a relationship of 8 months. It was toxic, yada yada, against the point. Anywho, I was pretty bummed about it so I hung out with my friends quite often to avoid my sadness.

During this relationship, my friend (f16) was currently in a paedophilic and illegal relationship with a guy. I kept openly voicing my concerns for her, but I always made sure to do it in a friendly manner that didn't focus on breaking up, just for her to be cautious. (Note, I only wanted them to break up because their relationship always felt like her boyfriend was just using her for sex. No jealousy or feelings involved.)

Cut to a few days after my break-up, my friend broke up with her boyfriend as well due to their parents not thinking it was healthy. She was heartbroken and asked to hang out the day after her break-up, and I said yes because I was also super sad and hanging with her is usually super fun.

That day, to put it short, was eventful. Lots of stuff happened. We didn't go all the way, but she got pretty handsy with me, and I returned the favor because I didn't know what to do and if saying no would make her sad. I kept us from going all the way, though.

Flash forward to today, about 2 or 3 weeks after that first incident. Each time me and my friend hang out, things always escalate to romance or sexual activity. We haven't gone all the way yet, and I don't really plan to, either.

The point is - am I being used as a rebound boyfriend? I can't tell if I am or not.

If I am, how do I tell her my concerns about the situation without being too harsh? I really don't want to be mean. Not to toot my own horn, but I'm a nice person and don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

Note that I never really felt too strongly towards this friend, maybe a few thoughts here and there, but not full on romance. And I get over break-ups quickly due to my ""suck it up"" nature, so she isn't really a rebound for me.",26Jul2019,1
860,"So I registered for the Sapphire Reserve travel credit card with Chase (USA). There's a 50k signup bonus if you spend $4000 within the first 3 months. In the third month, I called to double check how much I needed to spend and when it was due.

Representative 1: You have until the 26th and need to spend $1000. Pending amounts count towards the minimum spend.

So I spend $1000 on the 25th, and call to make sure everything is correct.

Representative 2: You actually have to spend $200 more, but don't worry you have a month left because it goes by statements. Your previous statement was the third one BUT it was before your 90 day period, therefore you have until your next statement to achieve the minimum spend.

Okay this is weird.... I'm hearing different things so let me call someone else.

Representative 3: that $1000 you spent doesn't count towards the minimum spend because it is still pending and it is past your due date (it is the 26th now). You also missed the minimum by $100. 

I asked to speak to the supervisor. She agrees with what Representative 3 said. She says that the only thing we can do now is request an extension and that I should spend $100-200 more to make sure I hit the minimum spend. The request may be declined and i'll find out in 7-10 days.

So now I feel like I've been scammed. They keep making me spend more money, they all say different things, and I might just get screwed over in the end anyway. Is there anything I can do? Can I call some higher up and say something to make sure I get what was promised? Do I  threaten to sue or leave negative reviews or cancel?

Some really bad stuff happened between my brother and I (the reason I now live in a different state) a decade ago and we no longer speak. I have no interest in ever speaking to him again and would never do anything to help him out - so I’m off the hook for assuming responsibility for him. However, my parents just asked me if I would be willing to be my sister’s guardian once they are gone. As I’ve said, I always assumed I would have to take responsibility for her. I’ve known it since a very young age. I also wouldn’t want so random stranger or distant cousin making decisions for my sister.
But now that my parents have actually asked me to be her guardian, I find myself balling at the idea. It means I can never move very far away from the house she lives in. It means I am absolutely tied down for the rest of my life. It means that if my boyfriend and I get married he will be tied down too. It just seems like so much responsibility, and I know I will ultimately take it on, but at the same time...",26Jul2019,1
865,"I have been producing music for a little over 4 years now. Not consecutively but on and off. I had a club in HS for music production where I was the leader and have even played a couple of gigs here and there. 

I have a couple of hardware items that I bought for music production, but none of them are very expensive to the point that I need to get my worth out of them. 

I put my music production on hold for my final year of HS, now it's been 3 months since that got over and I just haven't had the motivation to go back to it. I have forgotten most of what I knew, I cant even bring myself to start a new project, let alone finish it.

You know how some people are gifted with musical sense and whatnot? I'm the complete opposite. I rely on my technical skills to make up for that. All this time, it feels like I'm forcing myself into something that doesn't love me back. 

I thought that was how stuff was supposed to go but I got into tekken recently, and I have been having a blast playing it.

Music has always been a hobby, but now that I just dont enjoy it anymore, I feel I should replace it with something that I do enjoy and that something does love me back.

She got out to look at the car and tackles her and beats her head off the road. Cops show up and charge him with the accident - but say they don’t have enough to charge him with assault (a magistrate might though) and that they can’t prove he did it on purpose (even though he stalked her all last night and has been threatening us on Facebook for the past two day).

871,"So since the beginning this leasing agent at an apartment I was very interested in renting has been my main point of contact to the leasing office. After I applied it took almost 2 weeks for them to respond. I called them after a week inquiring about the status of my application and didn’t get a response or call back. After the second week they approved me and told me an amount to hold the apartment, which I forgot. I called the number back 10 mins after they called me to ask the number again and got an answering machine. I called 3 more times over the next week trying to get ahold of someone in the office and got no response. I drove there and they said they thought I’d said I wasn’t interested when they called. So I corrected them and got them the money to hold the room in the same day I went to see them. Now it’s been two weeks since then and my move in day is less than a week away. As of this morning I hadn’t seen or signed a lease or seen a move in statement. When I repeatedly emailed my leasing agent about it he told me he forgot to send the move in information and the lease. Every interaction I’ve had has been unprofessional and somewhat sketchy but I need to have an apartment before school starts mid August. My move in day is August 1st. Should I run from this place?

874,"I'm turning thirty next month and I feel like I'm having a crisis over it. Everything went so fast. I remember when I was 18-19 and in college. I'd spend the day just joy riding with my friends and day drinking when I wasn't in class. We went to parties at night and basically just had the time of our lives. Then, in my early 20's I went to grad school and things got a bit more serious. At 25 I entered into my current career. I was lucky to get my position. It pays well and it afforded me stability. At 26 I got married and at 27 I purchased my first house.   


Now I'm 29 with a mortgage, a spouse, a career, and a few cats. We aren't planning on having children. I feel 30 looming over the horizon. I never really thought about it before but now that it's so close I feel like it's the end of my youth. I feel like I wasted this last summer of my 20's working on research and publications versus enjoying the remnants of my youth. I feel like 30 looks different for a woman than it does a man. I feel like I can no longer wear cute clothes and that I no longer have the right to feel sexy, try new daring hairstyles, or go to music festivals. Can I still go out dancing at 30 or is that weird? Am I going to be that weird old woman who is at a club? It sounds stupid but it has impacted my sex life a little. I used to FEEL sexy. This has nothing to do with my spouse who still is super attracted to me but I don't feel attractive. I feel old and like I shouldn't be wearing lingerie. I've always been very petite but lately, I'm noticed more curves in my hips and thighs and my old shorts don't fit as well as they used to.   


How do I get over this feeling of a loss of youth and freedom? How can I convince myself that I'm still sexy and vibrant? I haven't gone out dancing with my wife in ages. We went to a music festival this summer and I'm sure nobody notice my age but I noticed it, you know? I couldn't have fun because I felt like I shouldn't let loose and that I was being immature just by being there. It's not that I'm not interested in these types of outings anymore because I am. It's that I feel like I shouldn't be interested in them anymore.",26Jul2019,1

I drove to his house. He admitted it and said he has no idea why he did it, just that he could and he now regrets it as the biggest fuck up of his life.

881,"I'm a college student. Throughout my degree I have had to take part in numerous work assignments (e.g. field courses, practical projects, lab assessments etc.) with a partner.

However, after the most recent example of this, I have realised that I am the common denominator. I have always been impatient, consistently fixated on doing well/not failing, and ultimately developing the perception that my partner has been unreliable resulting in my overall refusal to acknowledge/listen to their attempts to contribute.

882,"Hey there, 
This might end up being a long post but I need some advice and I don’t know where else to go. 
Just some background to start: I’m a 24 year old female. My brother is 22 and lives at home with my mom. I live an hour away with my partner. My mom raised us completely on her own- on a teacher’s salary no less-  and we have all always been very close. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life, but have taken a number of steps to get help and have been doing really well as of late. 
Within the past year, my brother has also begun to struggle with mental health issues. It started with just moderate depression symptoms but quickly became something much more severe. There have been times when he has threatened to hurt me, has attacked my boyfriend, and threatened suicide. He has spent several sessions in the hospital on suicide watch. 
What concerns me is his tendency to manipulate our family members. He has successfully divided my mom and my cousin, and seems to be focusing now on dividing my mom and my grandma. It is so difficult to watch this happen as neither one is trying to hurt the other, but they’re just both falling victim to the tactics he uses. 
Today, after being out at the store with my mom and I, he refused to get in the car to go home and insisted on walking the 20 miles home. He made it about 2 miles before we were able to convince him to get into the car. 
At this point, I don’t know what to do to help- if anything. He is currently seeing a therapist but claims she tells him that everything he is dealing with is my mom’s fault. He refuses to go to the doctor to try medicines. 
Do you have any advice for what any of us can do? We all care about him so much and are truly worried out of our minds.",26Jul2019,1

884,"I have never had a dispute with a neighbor before. I'm 22 years old and grew up living in the middle of nowhere, so I haven't personally seen any disputes of this type happen either, and I'm really at a loss for what to do.

My mom and I live together, each paying half the rent and splitting all other living costs. We've lived in this duplex for almost four years now, paying $1'150/month for the main and second floor of a two-story house. The other apartment is about two thirds of the basement ($675/month), with us all sharing the washer/dryer. I have personally shoveled the snow and mowed the lawn just about every single time since we moved in, across all three neighbors we've shared this house with.

The gravel driveway, which is behind the house, is pretty long and comfortably fits two cars wide.  Ever since my mother and I moved in, we've had a thirty-foot or so '70's camping trailer parked deep into the driveway, tight against the fence and as far back as it can be. We use it for storage, and it's obviously weathered, but not an eyesore. Across the back alley behind the house is a commercial zone with parking in the alley for customers and staff. Large trucks also frequently drive through to drop off goods. From the entrance to the driveway to the end of the parking zone barriers near the buildings, there's enough space to fit a four-door pickup truck and a medium-sized trailer nose to tail.

Our current neighbor moved in about a year ago, I don't recall exactly when. I can count on one hand how many times he has shoveled or mowed. He occasionally has friends over who park their vehicle in the driveway every so often, and is employed by our landlord. The only mode of transportation he owns to my knowledge is a bicycle which he chains up to the back of our trailer. I gave him a key to the shed where I park my bicycle, but he still parks it outside. Getting to and from work, he always carpools with others.

January this year, I got my first car. Not a month later, my neighbor's friend nicks the front bumper of my silver '00 Civic. Guy knocks on my door, I answer, and he shows me the spot where there's now a small white streak on my silver bumper and a white streak on the rear fender of his black SUV. I tell him I didn't care in the slightest, and point out the speckling of dents all around my two-door Civic. He gets salty, and tells me to park my car further back in the lot, complaining about lack of space to maneuver. Being nice, I tell him I will, and generally follow up on that. Weeks later, this same guy mentions to my mom that she should get rid of her camper to free up space in the lot.

This spring I killed my car's engine, and in the past month I acquired a second Civic as a parts car. For a two week period, both my Civic's were at a friend's house. For a week after that, my once-again-working Civic was in the lot. However, I changed to parking it beside the trailer because I decided I was sick of cleaning sticks, leaves and bird poop off my car. Basement neighbor tells me he likes where I currently have my parked and that it's perfect. I inform him about the incoming second Civic, and pretty much shrugged off his opinion. I don't remember at all what he said. I'm beginning to get fed up with him at this point.

I also acquired a third car (a 1990 Buick LeSabre) because the same friend was moving and needed it gone ASAP. It was in very good condition and he was going to crush it as he couldn't find any buyers, so I bought it from him for very cheap. Before the cars arrived, I trimmed up the tree that overhung the driveway so all of us wouldn't be going through a jungle getting by the cars that were going to be there soon.

The very day the three cars showed up in our driveway, I was messing around inside the Buick when someone exited the house and I heard my neighbor say in an irritated voice ""Oh, that's f\*\*\*\*\*\* lovely"" before he realized I was there. Immediately upon noticing my presence with me looking right at him with slightly narrowed eyes, he got very cheery and started asking about the old Buick. I went about showing it to him and explained its presence (he already knew about the second Civic) before we went on about our days.

Today I was informed by my mom that basement neighbor wants to talk to me about my cars parked in the lot yet again, and I'm fed up with his demands. He doesn't even have a car himself, and his friends can park out front just fine, or in the empty space in the back lot. There's ample space in the alley to maneuver a vehicle into said slot, and I'm not going to be bullied into playing \[Rush Hour\]([https://i.imgur.com/DoUGFZF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DoUGFZF.jpg)) with two dead cars from the '90s.

886,"I've had depression and anxiety problems for years, but throughout high school and college I had access to therapy. Not anymore. I know I need therapy but until my 90 days arrive and I can switch over to my employers health care, I can only use the state health care I had when I struggled for months working jobs that didn't pay well. I've called every place on that list. None of them answer or they all have 6 to 8 weeks of a wait list.  But I've been trying for two weeks to see a therapist and every day I cant has only worsened my depression. Now it's at dangerous levels. Im starting to get physically sick and part of me just wants to run away and quit everything even though I'm in a loving relationship with good friends and a nice home. 

I've always been an entrepreneur who has only worked jobs where there was no micromanaging and there was flexibility with your schedule and where you work. About two years ago, I unexpectedly got into a serious relationship with a man I love very much that changed my responsibilities a lot. Back then I was okay with traveling and having little to no money while working freelance gigs and writing. Now I have a home and a car and lots of bills, and I need to work this job for at least three years to save up enough funds to leave with at least 6 months of livable money so I can go full time as an entrepreneur. I worked so hard to get this job. I had three mentors and on paper, my life is a dream...but I'm so miserable at the office. No one is mistreating me. I just feel stifled and heavily unsatisfied and like I dont have time for anything but work, and while I know I should just be able to suck it up for the greater good, I feel like I'm being insincere to myself and hate every minute of it. 

So I guess, how do you deal with a full time office job you hate emotionally but need? Is there anything you do at work to make it more bearable? And since I'm having such a hard time seeing therapists and need to call a hotline now, who do you suggest I talk to for emotional help since I'm being waitlisted when I'm already more beat down and depressed than I've been in years and need help now?",26Jul2019,1

888,"Hey everyone, 

I'm looking for advice on what to do about this friend who I've been friends with for several years now. The following will make it seem like she's a terrible person, but that's not entirely the case because I also recognize that I can be overly critical at times. 

For context, we are both teenagers in high school. Today, I waited for the bus with this friend (let's call her Sara), and delayed a bus that came earlier so that I could wait with her, just to keep her company. However, as that bus pulled up, her dad drove by, and Sara hopped in the car and left. I was left standing there, a bit annoyed that I waited with her for her bus, and she just left without even saying much to me. Also, every single time my dad has picked me up, I've always offered her a ride. She's never asked for one, of course, but I've always offered (and if I don't, my parents will indicate that I must), because that's just the type of people we are. We've driven her multiple times- maybe around 10 or so, and she's only ever driven me once when I asked for a ride, never her offering one. In addition to being annoyed that I had to wait for HER bus, I was also a bit annoyed that she didn't even bother asking if I wanted a ride, and neither did her dad. 

She's also self-centered and always complains about how hard her life is or how bad something is in her life. Whenever she wants to post something on Instagram, she sends me five different variations of the exact same caption and asks me which one I like more. When I give her my opinion and my reasons why, she nitpicks my reason and NEVER takes my suggestions. This doesn't just happen with Instagram though, it happens with life advice. It's become annoying and frustrating that a few days ago I told her to just go talk to someone else if she didn't want my advice. It feels like she only wants me to tell her what she wants to hear and (since she's stubborn, yet as stubborn people do, when you tell them they're stubborn they deflect) never fully listens to me, so why do I even bother? As for how she's self-centered, it seems like she doesn't have a life outside of Instagram and school. Whenever we meet up, she'll talk about how hard an assignment is, or why she's not qualified enough for a position, etc. etc. She doesn't have any hobbies, which makes her generally not a very interesting person to talk to. Not to mention she doesn't exactly have any friends other than me.

The last thing that I'll mention is that she's selfish and greedy. She absolutely hates spending money, and consistently reminds me of why she can't spend money (despite her coming from a wealthier family than mine). Yet every time I buy something, she always asks if she can have some of it, and since I'm not selfish, I'll let her have some of it. She also, until recently, was not aware of the fact that people have to bring something other than a paper card to birthday parties. When I asked her where her gift for a friend was, she went, ""I made her a card. I spent hours on this!"" and I left it at that. I'm not the only one who is bothered by this, as another friend mentioned this in front of her. I understand if you don't have enough money to buy lavish gifts for friends, but even something simple would've sufficed. Each year I receive a paper card from her, while all my other friends get me paper cards and gifts. Now I know this may be a reflection of my own materialistic views, but I do find it interesting how she refuses to spend money on others but spends exorbitant amounts of money on makeup each year. 

Anyways, I guess I just don't know what to do because we are going to be roommates next year in college, and I can't exactly just let her go (regardless if she was my roommate or not, I feel like I would at least owe her an explanation). 

And feel free to let me know if I'm being overly critical/expectations are too high. I was raised in a household where we were all raised with a proper upbringing (and manners, moral values, etc.) so this is what I expect of others. I'm open to all thoughts.",26Jul2019,1
