0,"So, my life has been a bit of a whirlwind, and I'm okay with that. I moved across the country a few years ago with my boyfriend. I finished my first degree (psychology) and decided that it wasn't what I wanted a career in, and decided I'd like to pursue a career in Engineering. However, my location made school difficult (we lived in the middle of nowhere), and I also needed to work full-time to pay bills. So, my classes and grades kind of meandered. I spent a year with an online school and then a year at a local school. I feel like I really haven't made any progress. Meanwhile, my relationship has slowly fallen apart, and it's time for it to end. We're breaking up, and I'm moving back home. I still want the second Bachelor's in engineering. However, the school back home won't readmit me as an in-state student until I've been back there for at least a year. So, I'm considering taking a year off. I've never lived alone, and I've also struggled with some mental health trouble over the last couple of years (Bipolar disorder and anxiety). I'm thinking it might be good to take a year, recoup, work a bit, and just spend time with myself before diving back into my education. The only reason I'm unsure is that A) I'm going to have to start to pay back student loans, which I'm nervous about, and B) I'm worried about what this will look like later.

1,"I had met someone on Reddit with no intentions of having a relationship. We live extremely far apart. There is an age gap of about 10 years. We have been talking constantly for the past week and a half. I was really vulnerable to this person and kind of let my guard down (now regretting) emotionally. He was very persistent with figuring out when we can meet. However I was not there yet we’re feeling ready to take that step. I felt like it was all moving very fast but we continue to talk constantly on a daily basis. He would bring up being intimate and we had discussion about it but i always reverted the discussion to wanting to get to know each other better first. I know it was a short period of time but we have a very great connection and he really makes me feel happy. He even asked me to be his girlfriend and I told him it was way too soon. He seemingly understood. Now, he is bringing up second thoughts and is acting really distant. Should I have been ready to move more quickly? Or was he being too persistent? I’m feeling really emotional about it too which is weird since I’ve never even met this person. ",05Apr2019,1
2,"So our prom is tomorrow night, and I joined up with a group of friends last weekend. From the very beginning I was questionable able going to prom since I’m broke at the moment, and my parents won’t lend me any money. I, along with about 5 other people were on the “questionable list” meaning they weren’t sure if they were going to go or not. Despite the fact that half of us were on the “questionable list”, the group leader divided the money up so we all had to pay even though we were unsure if we were going. The other 4 people left, and everyone else is looking to me to pay my share and most likely theirs too. I think it was bad planning on both my side and everyone else’s, but I think it’s unfair for me to pay nearly $50 for a party bus that I won’t be on. What should I do, and how should I respond?

So It is my 30th Birthday this Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Things about me:

I’m an introvert

I put others first

I don’t like asking for things for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks go my husband asked what I wanted to do for my birthday and that all of our friends were keen to do something.

My husband’s idea was a BBQ at our house, but I told him I would think about it, because I did not really wanted to have a BBQ, I wanted a reason to dress up for my birthday.

Today I told him that. I wanted to go somewhere, where I could where my red dress.

He let me know all of my friends had bailed on my birthday or they were trapped for cash. So that was out and even a BBQ would only be like 2 friends over.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not mad at my husband (he is amazing and my best friend), I am just sad.  I put in a lot of effort for everyone else’s birthday and just thought my closest friends would put in more of an effort.

Any ideas on what I should do for my birthday?",05Apr2019,1

10,"Title pretty much says it all. My great grandmother passed recently. Up until right before she passed, I had no clue we had land at all. She lived in a tiny little house, was very frugal, and never said a peep about it. My uncle is the current owner of the land and it was in my great grandmothers will that half is mine, which means 400 acres in total. All one piece. I am on fantastic terms with my uncle and he is keeping me up to date regularly on the developments as we decide what to do with it all. So no this is not a thread about debating family greed or any potential betrayal. He wants to sell it and just cut me a check. A few big name companies are interested in it but I realize what an opportunity this could be. Not every day do you just find out you have a massive patch of land with your name on it. I keep coming back to the idea of setting up something to create recurring income. The land is in rural NC in the U.S. and it is fertile and will perk. We have about 70-80 worth of timber. Do I start a small pot farm? Do I get in contact with a solar panel company? Do I take the check from the sale and put the money into something else? I just have no clue. My uncle has lawyers overseeing any potential purchase but I want to think beyond that. He is apprehensive to the idea of trying to make the land create recurring income, only because a portion of the money will be going to help my grandmother who lives alone to cover her living expenses. He is risk averse and would just like to be sure that she would be taken care of, and I see his point. This could be a huge jumping off point for true financial freedom and I just wanted to see if I could get some different perspectives on how to move forward when the time comes. ",05Apr2019,2

13,"BTW: I'm in high school

Ok so yesterday I was at this dinner thing for an award ceremony. My best friend and I went and saw a (guy) friend talking to a cute guy. He introduced us but we weren't able to talk much then because the event was starting and we needed to find our seats.

My best friend and I found two seats together, but there wasn't any empty seat beside us. This cute guy for whatever reason (couldn't find another empty seat, didn't know anyone at the event...etc) found an extra seat and put it next to me (the only open spot at our table) , so we were sitting next to each other for the whole event.

My friend and I were being very giggly throughout the whole event. But the cute guy and my best friend and I talked through the whole event. Throughout the night, he would tap me on the arm occasionally to show me something on his phone and when he was reaching over to show my best friend, he was touching me (my arm and leg) but didn't move his arm. The whole night, he seemed very touchy, but I don't know if that's his personality. My best friend and I agreed he was being very flirty through the whole night.

So the night ended and my friend and I ended up searching up this guy on instagram and we followed him. He seemed really familiar so I DMed him and told him that and it turns out that we used to play tennis together. We had a short convo via DMs and that was it.

Soo........ was he flirting with me? Or was I reading too much into it (per usual)? He seemed flirty at dinner, but I felt like if he liked me, he would have kept the convo going through DMs but he didn't...

17,"**TL;DR at the bottom of the post.**

For some added background my wife and I live with my mother in law while we save up for our own place and pay off some debt. I feel slightly guilty posting this because my mother in law is a sweet lady and my wife and I are living with her in part due to our own financial problems, however we have taken budgeting classes and classes that have taught us how to get rid of debt (and are on track to becoming debt free soon). When we told her about these free classes she could be taking as well she turned them down and so we're dealing with these problems on a daily basis.

**The issue:**

I came home a few days ago to the water turned off because my mother in law did not pay the bill on time, claiming she did not have enough money to keep up on the water bill.

**The solution:**

I really felt for her because I knew what that was like and was concerned that maybe we weren't paying enough rent so we increased the rent we were paying- which means I am now paying almost $300 a month ($80 for internet and $200 to my mother in law to help out with utilities and mortgage) additionally we pitch in 200 a month for groceries, but this is mainly for my family though she frequently benefits from this becase we are the ones who usually end up buying the milk, eggs, and bread. This was done under the agreement that she would make sure that she had enough to pay utilities each month and I also asked that she say if this was not enough.

**My concern:**

I am concerned that my mother in law is not spending her money wisely. Yesterday she went shopping for ""groceries"" and came home with about 10 bags containing Oreos, various chips, fruit cups (which we already had), a jug of orange juice, some cheese (we already had cheese too), and some eggs (which we already had as well). Everything she bought wasn't needed but things she just wanted. Again, I love my mother in law, but she is very impulsive (which I understand because I'm a little bit like that too, but I'm learning restraint). I don't know what to do. The only thing I can think to do is to wait and see if in a couple of months she needs help again- if utilities start getting shut off again and we're paying for them, that's a real problem.

**TL;DR:**

My wife and I live with my mother in law. She doesn't manage her finances very well and it is starting to become a problem that is affecting my family. I've opted to increase our monthly rent by $100 to see if this helps but am concerned that it will just get wasted.

What can I do?",05Apr2019,1
19,"Hi all. First time poster here. I'm on mobile, so sorry for any format issues there.  

So I've (21M) been with my girlfriend (20F) for about a year now, and we're great. Saving the paragraph about how great we are as its not relevant, some quick backstory. 
1.) We hang out only at my house and other places, never at her's. 
2.) Because of 1, she's met my parents/some family at holidays and birthdays, but I haven't met anyone from her side. Basically I pick her up/drop her off and thats as close to her house as I get. 
3.) Her brother (upper 20s/early 30s?) got married last year not too late after we started dating.  I'm not sure about before but since the wedding he's lived like 5 minutes from her house.  I've dropped her off there a few times and its literally just turning left instead of right at the last turn. 
4.) She and her brother were pretty close growing up from what I've been told. As you can tell there's an age gap so after he moved out eventually that changed a little but they kept in contact via phone and the fact that he lived 5 minutes away, seeing him at church, etc. 
5.) Her parents went out of town for a bit towards November I believe and she didn't to be alone in the house that long so she and her uncle (who had a pickup truck) moved her bed to her brother's house for the time being. She ended up sleeping there here and there for reasons that aren't relevant up until a little before Christmas or so, and then she stopped for another not relevant reason.

Now that all the backstory is out if the way, I can get into the part I need help with.  So when she would go to her brother's to spend the night(s), she'd bring clothes and other stuff in a suitcase.  Obviously she left one day for whatever reason, and left her bed, her suitcase, and her laptop at her brother's.  Around Christmas, she needed a few things and she realized that they were in the suitcase, so she texted him and tried to pick it up/have him drop it off at her house at some point.  

After no response for a few days, she tried again to schedule what should be a really easy ""yea come over I get home from work at 8"" or ""i dropped it off at the house mom has it"" situation.    Again, no response.  She tried contacting his wife to also no response. 

We're into the middle/back end of January now.  She's been texting/calling both of them here and there to get her stuff back (she needed more from the suitcase and after sleeping on a couch for 2 months she was really missing her bed).  Still, no response.  

We hit February now, and she's continuing to contact both of them as well as asking her family if they know what's going on.  Someone tells her that they have been out in Washington D.C. for the last few weeks and that they're going to the Super Bowl now.  I went out of town with my family over break, and while it was fun and all that, I didn't ignore everyone in the world because of it.  I understand wanting to live in the moment and all that, but at this point it had been ~2 months since she'd heard from him last. 

Anyway, he comes home at some point in later February/early March because he came over while she was at work to hang out with the family for a little bit.  While there he dropped off her laptop. Great, now we just need the bed and the suitcase and for him/his wife to respond to literally anything. 

2 weeks ago or so, my girlfriend and her brother hung out for a few hours on day.  I know they drove around but I'm not sure what else.  I asked her if she mentioned all this and she asked/told him that she needs her stuff back several times and he kept saying stuff like ""yea I know"" or ""we'll figure it out later"" and other blowoff garbage.

So for the last few months she has been calling/texting him here and there and more frequently as time goes on.  Recently she has borrowed her parents phones to see if he'd respond to them and nothing so far.  I suggested she do the *67 or  whatever it is that blocks your number (maybe he'd answer if he didn't see it was her?) and she got the voicemail.  I told her she can borrow my phone if she wants to but she doesn't want to, at least not yet.  

While I'm glad that she at least got her computer back, there's some stuff that's decently important in that suitcase that I can't just run to Walgreen's for.  And she definitely needs her bed back as its still messing with her neck/back. Like I mentioned above, the suitcase should be a 5 minute anytime exchange that should have happened months ago.  I understand that wouldn't have worked while they were out of town so obviously they get a pass for that.  But what makes me upset is the fact that both him and his wife have ignored my girlfriend for going on 4 months now.  The bed exchange I can understand taking longer, as it involves a 3rd person (her uncle and his pickup truck) to schedule around. 

In theory, the next time she's seeing him in person is Easter.   Ideally he gives her at least the suitcase before then, but based on his track record I doubt it.  So the next best option is that he brings at least the suitcase on Easter.  She's still trying to get a hold of both of them via her phone at the moment, and I think she said she'll try and borrow her parents phones a few more times too.  

So basically, now what?  This clearly isn't working after 4 months.  As far as she knows she didn't do anything to piss him off into ignoring her like this.   I'm also aware of the old thing where married people are busy and such, but sending a few texts in 4 months isn't hard.

I'm as removed from the situation as you can get, nor am I about to go over to his house and start picking locks(although I have joked about it). Has anyone had anything similar happen like this before?  If so, how did you get everything figured out?  Is there anything I/my girlfriend/her parents should do?  I just want her to be happy.  And this whole thing is causing her so much stress between not getting her stuff back and how shitty he's being to her.

TL;DR - My girlfriend left some stuff at her brother's house back in December.  He's been ghosting her ever since, and when she saw him in person a few weeks ago he kept dodging the questions about when she can get it back.",05Apr2019,1
20,"My teacher has a system of combining two assignments as one grade. Essentially, she often combines sometimes even tests and minor classwork assignments, taking both grades, cutting them in half, and putting them together. 

This means, I could get an A+ on the most major test of the year in her class, forget to turn in some minor classwork, and together it would be a 50%, a test I got an A+ on, would now be an F. Her teaching is awful enough, we’re learning Spanish and she speaks less of of it than half the students in the class, yelling at students, making students sit outside her class the entire time and stare at a wall, etc. but this could legitimately but my chances of getting into a good school into Jeopardy.

I would do 4mph on treadmill for 45 minutes or intervals for 45 minutes and that was the entirety of my gym visit.

I enjoy hiking a lot but can't find anyone to go with me and I'm not comfortable going to the nature park  by myself. 

I also don't feel safe just walking around my neighborhood by myself.

Through my employment history, I mainly worked in the public sector, with a few exceptions when I came out of High School and a co-op work term.

That co-op work term is the one that has turned me off from the private sector. I experienced and witnessed workplace harassment:

* I witnessed the supervisor and other co-workers openly making fun of another worker, saying things like ""she has no friends"", and making fun of her accent and the things she said. There was nothing wrong with what she said, and had it been said by someone else, they wouldn't have been made fun of.
* I experienced workplace harassment by this employer by working in unlawful conditions with verbal harassment and threats of harm by a co-worker.
   * The working conditions were working in excess of 14 hours per day, with a co-worker who would not stop for meal breaks, and by the time we would stop for the night, pretty much all restaurants would be closed. One night I resorted to eating a box of blueberries because the only place still open was a grocery store. We were at a different hotel every night, so there was never any cooking facilities.

29,"Alright so bear with me here, its going to be a long one, but to all you lawyers out there, which should be all of us redditors, I need help.

Backstory: My Dog broke her Paw and I took her to the vet which costed a good $550 because of the emergency fee and putting a splint, even though it was suppose to be a cast. This was a week before i had to move.

So I moved back to Washington about 3 weeks ago with my wife, daughter, and puppers, however the place we were staying at (Aunts), won't let us keep My Dog, about 6 months, well trained by mwah. So i contacted my friend, we'll call her B (because of how she's acting). Anyways the first week with her was fine, no problems at all, up until the 2nd week. She was worried about a lump that developed because of the first vet's splint, which was too tight and long. So my friend B was worried and took her to the Vet. I was touched with how caring she was but I was not informed of this decision nor was asked. To continue, the lump ended up being this gash, and there was a lot of moisture build up near the paw with the splint so it started rotting. They cleaned her up and made a shorter cast to put on her paw. Anyways before they did that they asked her if they wanted an xray to see if it was healing properly. This was when I got word of the vet visit, and her telling me to pay for the X-ray. P.s: cost for thhe visit was $245.

Now for this section, I know i may sound like a terrible owner and Im sorry, however this is a tough situation. 

I told her that to get a new cast for my dog, because I just moved to back to washington, the money i saved up for is to last me until i get a job again, and for supplies for my new born baby daughter. I could not afford an X-ray, and we ended the call and that was that, or so I thought. She called me not too long after, saying she has an appointment next week for the X-Ray I told her not to get. She said it was going to cost around $230. Me and my wife talked and we were like, fine whatever, Shes part of our family, we'll pay you back for the X-Ray. 

Time of the X-Ray rolls around. I call her, she told me it wasn't healing properly and we have 1 out of 3 options.
1. Let it heal how it is, however theres a chance of it becoming problem later.
2. Rebrake her bones and realign them ($3k)
3. Cut of the leg ($1k)

At this point , me and my wife are still sad to here this news because We spent $500 on a decently review vet hospital in our past state before we moved. We were hoping it would turn out ok. Anyways that visit ended up costing $300. As soon as she said that, these were exact words, ""I'm not trying to be a bitch here but we invest so much into this dog already that we are not giving her back to you until you pay as back, it dont matter if it takes months to years, but we want our money back."". This point my wife started crying because this was her first dog, it was her emotional support animal during pregnancy and onwards. At this point I just said me and my wife needs to talk, ill call you later. 

Here are some notes that are important:
1. Yes she has paid for the last 2 visits, and she said she has another one in 2 weeks which most likely will cost another $200-$300

2. She has mentioned prior to the first vet visit, she wanted to keep my dog, give us money, and get us a new dog because I assume of how well I trained her.

3. We were already decided on slowly paying her back for the X-Ray but she tacked on the first visit as well. Total cost = $545 + however much the next visit will be.

4.

30,"My father decided he didn't like our family anymore and without any warning, he left one day, during the day, while my mother was at work (primary/sole income) , my brother was at his first few days of college (never lasted ) and I was in middle school.. 7th grade and very naive and young for the time.. we, as a family had reservations for Benihana (hibachi chef cooks infront of you,rather high end and pricey.. that's what my father loved but never financed his luxurious lifestyle himself, it was always of the back of my mother) ... he made the reservations for us as a family and then while we were gone, he had packed up all his clothes and tore our home apart.. he took paintings off the wall.. lamps he wanted.. valuables, jewelry he had given to my mom, he had apparently secretly cleaned out their saved safety deposits box (if you're saying how.. my parents were married for 25+ years and my mom had been saving money since she was 16, met him when she was 18, and they saved together from there on out..he never indicated anything was wrong.. hence the dinner planning and acting as if everything was normal..) he had already purchased plane tickets secretly and .. of course was having an affair for a couple months apparently and had taken what he wanted, all the money he could .. he left my mother and is high and dry and went to another country with a prostitute he had met ... after we had realized our ransacked house and the fact he left his car and one text message to my brother saying ""I'm gone"" and putting his phone out of service... later on a week later of being in total shock.. a process server showed up and served my mom with divorce papers. My father has no balls whats so ever and is a total narcissist.. throughout the divorce , due to state laws. He stole even more from my mom , I.e. Her pension, and my mother also had my grandmas house in her name because my mom did her paperwork for her (my grandma is illiterate)  .. the reason he was so easily in access to get this property from my mom and grandma is because he was so trusted that he went , on his own to my grandmother and had her sign a quick claim deed and my grandmother is completely illiterate.. she trusted her son in law of 25+ years and he took advantage of that.  My mom was going crazy with all the stress because she already carried the entire household but on top of that, she started feeling sick and her lymph glands were very swollen, she went to the doctors, who ran a plethora of test, all while she was still working everyday , waking up, taking care of my brother and I and our emotional needs, everything we needed and also dealing with attorneys and the fact that she suddenly is working of a savings account with only 5,000$ in it, with utilities and bills being due, thank god her boss kindly gave her a loan she is still working off to this day.. but regardless she went to the doctors only to find she had uterine polyps ... she had to get them removed and she suffered tremendously from it... she still has terrible pain and is on medication to this day because she contracted a sexually transmitted disease... my father gave my mother.. a std.. that he got from a prostitute.. that he ran off and married overseas and got scammed by. 
He is now scamming some new woman because he blew through over 2M (including bank loans he takes out for false businesses and doesn't pay back; we get phone calls every day of creditors and debt collectors looking for him..) my grandparents (my father's parents ) love my mother and continue to keep a relationship with her but they still keep a relationship with their son (my father) and they keep urging me to accept my father's apologies (never got a correspondence relaying any apologies but ok....) and to talk to him and have a relationship.. I refuse to because my father put no value on us and abandoned us.. my self worth and self value has been severely damaged and partially defined by this experience and I carry throughout life.

33,"A little background context, I'm 16 and am currently working part time at a small Indian restaurant, the place is a little sketchy but the people who I work with are nice enough and I am only planning to work there for a little longer as it is just a temporary job. I work on Fridays and Sundays with three other people; the delivery driver, a waitress and the manager. The boss is the managers son and he is around 30-ish (I'm not really sure, I've only talked to him over the phone two times when I first started) and I have never met him before. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago my manager tells me I get 3 weeks off because she is going back to India and will come back on the 10th of April. Today is Friday and the last weekend I get before I go back to work, and this morning I get a text from the boss.

This is already a little weird as the boss never texts me, it is always my manager who texts to tell me when I'm working. So the text asks if I can come into work on the 8th of April. This confuses me as the shop is not open on Mondays (the 8th is a Monday) and the shop shouldn't be open as my manager says she's coming back on the 10th. 

I tell him I'm not sure because I don't work on Mondays and have to look after my little sister (which I do have to do) and that I'll let him know if I can work or not. He then replies that the 8th is a Tuesday, I just believe he has the dates mucked up so I just text back that I'll let him know if I can work or not ASAP. Then he texts me ""plz try to come on Tuesday and we will talk and I will be there so it will be nice to see u"", normally if I get a text like that I would be happy and would love to meet the person but because of the sketchy information he's given me I start to feel a little suspicious and even a little scared. I ask him again if it is the 8th of April that we will be meeting on and he says yes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking for advice on if I should go or not and if this is sketchy in other peoples eyes. I do realize that it's my job and he is my boss so I probably should and I also do tend to overreact a lot when I get a bit scared. 

But at the same time, I've never met this guy, the shop isn't open and my manger isn't even back from India.

I don't paint much but I am decent at drawing. I also have a huge interest in writing. Mostly fiction. I like mythology, sci-fi, fantasy, horror ect.

I have no computer, and it would take me a long time to learn something like photoshop for art or pro tools for music.

52,"(I might post this in a few different subs because I feel like I need as much input as I can get.)

I need your advice. I’m a 17 year old girl in high school, and I’m taking a street law class. My dad is an immigrant from Iran, which I mentioned during class earlier in the grading period. (Trimesters. We’re about 4 weeks in.) I would not have mentioned this at all if I had not trusted this teacher. I’m sure this teacher does have my best interest at heart. He’s a kind person. But he recently talked about racial profiling in airports (while using my dad as an example, since he’s middle eastern.) He said it was a “necessary sacrifice for the safety of our people.” This really hasn’t sat with me well. I am absolutely heartbroken. I feel singled out and discriminated against. But I know he didn’t mean anything bad. He has his heart in the right place. But I honestly don’t feel like this is okay. 

I have a panic disorder, but I feel like I really have to bring this up to my teacher. Am I right that he needs to know how this behavior hurt me? 

Another thing is that he doesn’t do anything about the kids in my class who basically heckle anyone who has a different opinion than them. A girl was talking about a ~hot topic~ in politics today, and she was laughed at and talked over by kids who disagreed with her conventionally liberal views. They also make side comments about how people are stupid because they’re liberal, or call them “libtards.” (Yes, really.) I don’t think he hears THOSE comments, but he does allow them to talk over anyone who they happen to disagree with. They also “joke” about hurting democrats. (They pretend they’re shooting a machine gun.) My teacher has never seen this, and I can’t report it because it’s their word against mine. I don’t want to be seen as a target. And it’s “just a joke.” 

Anyways, how can I approach this with my teacher? I don’t want to make it seem like I’m criticizing his teaching style, but I really don’t think I can just ignore it. Sorry if this didn’t make sense, my anxiety is really off the charts because of this experience .",05Apr2019,2
53,"This completely shook me today in full honesty because I am a huge animal lover like many people are. Ive grown up with dogs my whole life and have a good understanding of their general behaviors. 

I started working at this particular daycare recently and it was the first time I’ve worked at one. The job listing and the application/contract had set off several red flags for me when I had read through them but I ignored them because I simply thought that the owner was just passionate about dogs. They were very weird and quirky when I initially met them but, wrote it off due to the environment being more oriented to dog care and thus being more lax then most jobs would be.

Then today happened. We’ve had a particular dog boarding at our facility who everyone that’s worked the floor knew was aggressive towards other dogs and the owner should’ve known that they wouldn’t do good in a crammed environment of about 30 dogs. We’ve been careful about when to let him out all week to avoid this issue in particular until the owner strolled in this morning. They immediately got upset and demanded the dog to be let out and allowed to roam. I was already shocked by her demand but since I was in charge of the smaller dogs, I didn’t really have a say but I tried to explain that this particular dog was known to be aggressive as my coworker simply looked at our boss nervously. We let them out and since we only had one other dog at the time keeping the two quiet and separate didn’t take much for my coworker. As more and more dogs started to trickle in, this dog started getting more and more agitated until they finally snapped.

I was in the middle of managing and calming my dogs down when I heard the commotion. I looked over and saw this dog attacking one of the more aggressive boxers and my coworker attempting to break them up. The owner rushes in and starts yelling at the dogs to get them under control and ordering my coworker to use the spray bottle we had to break them up. As the noise continued the fight got progressively worse. I couldn’t do much as I couldn’t leave my floor, but I threw a can we generally keep to help quiet the dogs or threw it at their feet to disperse the fighting temporarily so that we could get them under control. It worked for a moment it seemed until they got more violent and several dogs got involved. At this point I recalled a bucket of water that we kept to break up severe fights between the dogs and as I moved to grab it (deciding to abandon my dogs at this point to step in) the owner bum rushes through the gate and onto the floor, shoving dogs out the way and kicking the dog we warned her about several times in the stomach towards a crate. I stared in complete horror as they worked to lock up the main combatants and couldn’t believe that of all things she chose, it was to attack a dog. Not the emergency bucket of water for this scenario. Physical violence. The rest of the shift went by with me shaken and debating if the environment was for me.

Td;lr

Warned boss about aggressive dog; warning is ignored and a fight breaks out resulting in the owner physically attacking the dog instead of using the clearly labeled bucket for the situation.

I really don’t know if I want to stay in this place for longer because I care about these animals but my mental health is taking a toll between the environment itself and managing the dogs with very limited equipment.",05Apr2019,1

59," The backstory:

Through my employment history, I mainly worked in the public sector, with a few exceptions when I came out of High School and a co-op work term.

That co-op work term (\~10 years ago) is the one that has turned me off from the private sector. I experienced and witnessed workplace harassment:

* I witnessed the supervisor and other co-workers openly making fun of another worker, saying things like ""she has no friends"", and making fun of her accent and the things she said. There was nothing wrong with what she said, and had it been said by someone else, they wouldn't have been made fun of.
* I experienced workplace harassment by this employer by working in unlawful conditions with verbal harassment and threats of harm by a co-worker.
   * The working conditions were working in excess of 14 hours per day, with a co-worker who would not stop for meal breaks, and by the time we would stop for the night, pretty much all restaurants would be closed. One night I resorted to eating a box of blueberries because the only place still open was a grocery store. We were at a different hotel every night, so there was never any cooking facilities.
   * The threats of harm came from another co-worker who would dehumanize me and give verbal abuse. We were operating equipment together all day, so there was no opportunity to walk away and get away from it until we got back to the hotel we were staying at for the night.
   * When I got back to the office, I complained about what occurred out in the field, and nothing was done. That employee still continued to work there even after my co-op term ended.
* I ended up getting an infection, which I believe was stress related, which resulted in Bell's Palsy which I have never fully recovered.

As you can see, the lack of adequate workplace harassment policies which are appropriately applied, as well as poor working conditions are what turns me off from working in the private industry. So I am selective in working for mainly the public sector. I've been happy working for the Public Sector, but had to quit recently because I moved to be closer to family.

There hasn't been very many job opportunities in the public sector at this time.

I value:

* Work-life balance: I work hard for the companies I work for, but time at home with family is also important to me.
* Companies that value their employees, and see them as assets which bring income to the company, not as disposable items. This includes having workplace harassment policies, but also following through and applying those policies.

The question:

Am I being too selective or paranoid of the poor working conditions in the private sector? Should I give working in the private sector another chance?

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Unemployed from public sector because I moved to be closer to family. Experienced workplace harassment in the past in the private sector and I am afraid to work for them again. Looking for jobs in the public sector again but there aren't very many openings right now.",05Apr2019,1

So naturally the next class I asked her name and followed her on IG. The following class she wasn’t there, and this continued for a few weeks until I finally decided to DM her. I DMed her and talked w her a little (she dropped the class) and eventually got her snapchat. I added her right after but never messaged her.

69,"**TL;DR: I don't know if I want to continue. Here are the pros and cons of school.

PROS:

* I have a lot of hobbies such as building guitars and maintaining aquariums. These are not cheap and I would love to have a high-paying job to be able to pay for them.
* The prestige and self-esteem of earning a bachelor's degree
* I live in California and would like to continue to do so. This will be extremely difficult without making a lot of money
* The sunk cost of having already spent &gt;$40,000 of a college fund on school

CONS:

* An engineering job is quite difficult to get, even after you get the degree.
* Trying to succeed in school is extremely difficult for me, and I called the suicide hotline about it two days ago
* The anxiety of school caused my OCD to relapse after being almost completely free of it for 18 months. I developed an eating disorder as a result which put me nearly $3,000 in debt (I started with a $6,400 savings)
* I am learning about how politically-correct the engineering environment is, how you can be fired for trivial things off-the-job, and how you can be made to work for 72+ hours per week.
* I can probably go to a software coding bootcamp over the summer or something.**

---------------------------------- LONG VERSION ------------------------------------

After graduating high school in 2013, I immediately transferred to community college, which I attended for four years. The first two years were rough, as the stress of transitioning from HS to CC caused my dormant OCD to develop. It was so bad that it took me 2.5 hours to walk from class back to my car.

It got worse and worse over the next two years - but aftter two years, I got a job working at a car wash for nearly 50 hours per week - and I IMMEDIATELY got 99% better. I actually felt productive and like my life had a purpose.




I have also been learning more and more about how politically correct the engineering environment is. My understanding is that you are expected to maintain such a high degree of professionalism that you are required to give your Facebook password over to the company.

Again, I have no problem working hard, but I think it's ridiculous for a job to control me even when I am not working.

I'm (single F and mother to young child) living in a toxic environment atm so I've been looking for another place to go. Car broke down when I started my search, so now I have no vehicle. Credit is too low to apply for a car or a home (thanks college and emergency rooms). I currently have nowhere else to go. Family is helping best they can but the most they can do is take my son for me when needed, but he can't stay there right now cause they currently have a family member freeloading in their house that won't leave. I can't stay there myself because that's also a toxic environment and I have no other family. I was hoping my son could go there while I vagrant for a while and try to just save some money for something, but now that's not even an option.  


To top all this off, my bank card disappeared today so now I'm without money for at least 2 weeks till my card comes back.

78,"I (21m) have been struggling with depression my entire life. It has led me to do stupid things for acceptance like selling drugs in college to feel needed by people. Because of this, I neglected my education and dropped out. Something I have regretted ever since. I struggle with loving myself and motivation to push through life. Here are some facts about me and my current situation, and what I need help with the most:

&amp;#x200B;

* Dropped out of college at 19, have about $6k in student loans which I should be paying off monthly but have not been for sometime
* Currently dead broke with an outstanding $300 credit card bill that I have not paid any toward in about 2 months
* Cannot afford to pay $215 traffic ticket and my license will be suspended if it is not paid by April 13th
* Bank account is -$35 (dipped just below $0 due to a Hulu subscription on auto pay and was charged the overdraft fee
* Struggle with paranoia including not being able to sleep until the sun comes up for fear of break-ins (living alone in a house my mom owns that is out of state)
* Feel so smashed by life that I am completely unmotivated to continue, constant suicidal thoughts and unwillingness to continue
* Car engine caught on fire approx. 2 months ago so I rarely leave the house to do anything
* I have no friends because I have isolated myself from everything
* I have been completely sober from everything including marijuana (my DoC) for about 1 month and do not drink alcohol

&amp;#x200B;

I've become a shell of who I used to be. I have no motivation to work and do not care about my health or wellbeing. I feel like I have accepted an eventual suicide and am simply riding out the storm until I am completely out of options. I have no money, lots of debt, and it feels like my mental state keeps me from working. I know an easy answer is ""get a job"" but I literally feel unable to work because of my mental state. Not only do I feel physically weak (atrophy in my muscles, not seeing the sun, etc.) I feel like my mind has deteriorated to the point of I need some sort of help before I will be strong enough to show up for a job and work. I don't really cry, I feel almost entirely numb to life and feel like my true self has receded deep inside. The only things I really ever feel are paranoia, self-loathing, and occasionally I get snappy and grumpy. I feel ""comfortable"" avoiding life and distracting myself from the reality of my situation but when I snap out of it, I realize how low I have sunk and get incredibly sad and numb.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically i am a few months out from graduating University if all goes well i will have an Honours Degree, my classification would be honours in Psychology with Politics.

I am wondering about possible career paths, i google to try and find out and have asked career advice people but haven't really got any real advice. My dream job is to become a Psychologist, but i think in order to become one you need a Masters degree or Doctorate degree.

My question is, based on the degree i would have, what kind of career paths would you recommend, with my ultimate role of a psychologist in mind. I thought perhaps counselling, but i am unsure if i would need other qualifications to do this.

Basically i am coming to the end of University and i am trying to understand what roles would be available with a degree in the area I have, as i would hate to have studied for so long and go back into a job like my old one of working in a call centre i absolutely hated it.

I want to work in a role where i can help people which is why i want to become a psychologist but i just wonder what  other kind of role could i do while i pursue my dream of being a psychologist

82,"Some background here: Around Christmastime last year, I met a girl from the Philippines on OKCupid. She seemed very nice, and liked a lot of the same things I like, so we decided to friend each other on Facebook. After several weeks of chatting, we decided we both wanted to be BF/GF. We've had three video chats on Messenger since then, the first two during our first ""official"" month as boyfriend &amp; girlfriend. We've chatted and sent pics on Messenger (nothing sexual), and  for the past few months, everything has been great.

As time went on, however, she's been complaining about being in trouble money-wise. She claims to only have a set amount of data for her phone each month, and it at first seemed to check out since she would only message around the beginning of the month, and the pics started getting fewer and fewer. I started to worry, but every month she came back with more pics and the old explanation of her data running out. She also says she's studying to obtain a teaching license.

Just a few hours ago, she asked me to send her $100 to ""get requirements for a new job"". She's hinted at having financial issues before, but never directly asked me to send her money. I asked her what kind of job it was, and still haven't heard back. I also just checked her old OKCupid profile, and it's been deleted.

On one hand, I still have feelings for her and want this to just be a misunderstanding. On the other hand, I am definitely not going to send her any money, and if this truly is a scam, I will definitely be severing ties with her, no matter how much it'll break my heart.

Any advice/help would be much appreciated! Also, if anyone has been in any similar situation, I'd love to know how you confronted them/broke things off.",05Apr2019,2

I think it even deepened my love for music in some ways. I even found a great guitar teacher through my middle school counselor, and I believe they’re the reason I even started playing. Recently though, my mental health has plunged pretty deep, more than I was expecting to. I started to practice less guitar, and my guitar teacher was always rescheduling lessons(he had personal issues with his family, so I don’t blame him) so next weeks lesson would be an hour long- aka two weeks without seeing my teacher and I was barely practicing. Whenever I would come in and see him, I was always forgetting things and blanking out, and I was EMBARRASSED. It should be noted that my parents are divorced, and every week I’d carry this heavy guitar case between two houses. My guitar started to look like a burden or homework from a class I didn’t like, and I didn’t want that at all.

108,"My parents have had a policy for quite some time that a computer must be in the living room facing them so they can confirm you’re doing nothing inappropriate. This system was fine for a while but it’s become flawed.

I have a chromebook that my parents are fine with having in my room, and can access any website. I used this rationale to say that if I could have a chromebook in my room, I should be able to have my desktop there as well. They said no.

The reason I want a desktop in my room is not to look at inappropriate things, but to have a quiet place where I can relax and not constantly feel the pressure of having a computer in the living room.

When I use the computer in the living room (which I bought with my own money, it’s an $800 gaming pc) my parents will make comments about the games I’m playing, whatever I’m programming, whatever I’m drawing, whoever I’m talking to, whatever music I’m listening to,  and have distracting conversations while I’m using my computer. While these occurrences are not terribly frequent, it is enough to cause stress and break my focus. I cannot enjoy games, or use video tutorials comfortably while using this computer.

One thing I don’t understand is that while they thoroughly regulate this pc, they don’t regulate my phone, or my chromebook. This leads to me spending excessive time on my phone simply because I know my parents won’t look over my shoulder and judge my every move. I used to use my PC for reddit but my parents look over my shoulder and saw a curse word, instantly barring my from using reddit.

I understand that my parents want to shelter me, but if they were going to do it right, they would have done it more thoroughly. It’s less of a protection and more of a pain in the ass. I feel I’m mature enough to not constantly be watched by them, and feel like my workflow would improve drastically if my computer was moved to my room.

114,"So there's a long story behind all this, but to keep it as short as possible, my husband just recently lost his job, and it was his fault. I am not upset with him for it. We are in the process of moving, so it is a very stressful time right now. 


I also suffer with depression, anxiety, and asthma. The current medication I'm taking (Cymbalta) has some pretty serious withdrawal effects that I have experienced first hand. I'm a stay at home mom of a toddler, since all the part time jobs around here would only pay for childcare, and not much else. My husband is okay with this, and in fact, encouraged it.  So we rely on him for the finances.


So here's the story:

My husband and I got into an argument last night. He had just finished a match of a popular game and he was angry because he apparently didn't have very good teammates. Anyway, I told him that my meds are available for pickup (which I always do, once I get the confirmation that they are available). He snaps at me and asks me why I wait till I only have 6 or so pills left, and I tell him that that is the way the pharmacy refill system works. 

Now, we live in the US, and we don't have health insurance right now, seeing as it came with his job. So he snaps and tells me that we don't have that insurance (which I didn't know, cause he said he could still pay on it). So I told him that the meds I need aren't the extremely expensive ones and that we can afford to just get that one right now. 

He didn't like that. He gets angry and tells me that no, we can't (we can, we have more than enough saved) and that I need to find an insurance plan to cover the family or call my doc and get her to switch me to a cheaper med (you can't just switch meds on the fly, you have to be weaned off of them). I told him this and he got even more upset saying that I need to figure out something because he's not paying $100 for medicine. 

So I looked into health insurance and not one of them is less than $100 for someone with no job. I tell him, and he says find a cheaper one. I asked him if I could just get my meds since they are cheaper than insurance and he says no, I have to find a plan less than the meds are worth. I even show him proof of all of the quotes and he told me to figure it out cause he's ""tired of taking care of me"". 

I'm not sure what to do from here. Do I go get the meds anyway since I have the access to the funds, or do I try to convince a stubborn person in less than a day (just took my last pill today) to let me get them?",05Apr2019,1

Yesterday, she made a comment on me, i was playing a game with my friends and she was there, she kinda made a rude remark but I wasn’t really affected by it. Someone asked her why I was there playing a game with my friends and she said “I don’t know why he’s here honestly.” 

I took no offence, but damn that made me feel like she was putting me in my place, and I liked it honestly. kinda arousing

I got my paystub and schedule at the same time, so it was a bit of a slap in the face. I do plan on respectfully confronting my boss about it, but I feel really anxious about it.

It’s really time for us to get a bigger/nicer place. Do you think it would make more financial sense to buy a house or rent a house if we plan on moving to another city in a few years? 

Pros for buying a house: better options (one in particular I’ve been looking at online that’s foreclosed that is basically my dream house lol) 
Cons: moving will be harder due to having to sell a house. Also don’t want to lose money or get too attached to the place. 

Pros for renting a house: will be easier to move because we won’t have to sell it
Cons: rent is really expensive here to find a decent house in a decent neighborhood. Which brings me to my third option

Stay in our apartment:
Pros: save money
Cons: living in our shithole apartment for possibly 4 more years which I don’t know if my sanity can take lol

I felt like we had the opportunity to be happy, and I tried to settle with that, but then came the unavoidable stress and anxiety that I can’t seem to escape. The fear of starting a relationship, opening up to someone as my real self and being emotionally vulnerable tormented me. For the days after we hung out, I had felt the most overwhelming stress I’ve had in a long time.

So, me being a terrible person, reacted poorly. I suddenly became distant — I see him on a daily basis, yet I was so blatantly avoiding him. I cut him off out of nowhere with no explanation, and I feel like shit about it.

It has been about a month since then, and since we’re part of the same group of friends we’ll both take part in some banter among our friends, but we’re not close like we used to be. Every time I see him, I get absorbed by a feeling of guilt because I fucked up big time.

127,"Reddit, I need help here. 

I’m a bisexual male who only recently (year and a few months ago) became sexually active. I had my first experiences with guys but met an amazing [bisexual] woman recently, and we’ve been dating for a few months.

I’ve always viewed actual sex as intimate. Yea I’ve used porn to masturbate but until recently I’ve always seen it more as scratching an itch. Only recently have I really found true intimacy in sexual acts. 

A few days ago, she dropped the news on me after discussing a phobia she had. She said she wanted to tell me for a while but could never find the words. She needed to take that job to make ends meet at a different time in her life 

I’m torn inside. I love her, but to imagine her with other people that paid for sex to fill a hole in their lives is just tough for me to swallow (wealthier clientele who often had issues at home or were closeted). 

I didn’t take it well. It emotionally stunned me. I cried, I had a panic attack staying over with her at her place the night of, I cried the next day. I’ve floated between feeling hard emotion and feeling emotionally numb. I’ve always been supportive and have continued to be so, but it’s just something that I know might take time to process in my mind. I feel like a guilty hypocrite as I never consciously judge people, however I come from a culture (liberal black sheep in a conservative family) where something like this would be taken and is seen very differently than how I would like to see it. 

Part of my anxiety around this stems from my insecurities. Ive always had self confidence issues. I’ve always been unsure of my own sexuality and have been jaded about ever finding love. She’s gone from an infallible person in my life to another person (this isn’t a bad thing and is likely a dose of reality I needed to grow), and my subconscious is torn over it. I’ve had irrational anxiety that things may never be the same (this also isn’t necessarily a bad thing).

She herself is one to compartmentalize things and move on quickly so she hasn’t herself gone through the necessary steps to cope with this. It reflects in her insecurity as well; she said to me after she told me that I didn’t have to see her anymore, obviously sensing some level of emotional discomfort. How do you think that made me feel? She’s questioned my love for her before (has seen me flirting with a guy she knows I have a crush on, but not in any kind of serious manner) but of course I still love her even through this. It’s just... I don’t know. 

She’s the first woman I’ve truly loved. I want to make this work, so I’m going to see my therapist again and figuring out how to make this work because I really care about her. I know love takes time, energy, and input and everyone has flaws. I am still trying to process this.

My boyfriend (45m)is embarrassed of (33f) me

Sorry if this seems jumbled because I am crying right now. Where do I begin?

My boyfriend and I have been dating for close to ten months now, and i have yet to meet anyone in his life. I truly thought we were two peas in a pod. We would always tell each other that we are best friends. But one issue always comes up. I have never met one friend of his, no family members, nothing. I am pretty sure he is embarrassed of the kind of work i do. He may also be embarrassed of the way i look? I clean bathrooms for a living and i also work in a factory. I do not make much money. They are not my dream jobs but i do them because i do not have anything beyond a 12th grade education. On the other hand, my boyfriend has a career and does very well for himself. I know he has worked hard and am very happy for him. I have never asked him for a penny. I am with him because I thought he was my best friend and I love him.

We have been together for nearly a year now and i have asked him several times if i could meet his family. He always gives excuses. We did break up for a month because of this (he says that I'm nagging him) but then we got back together.

Well, the other night things came to a head. I asked him if anyone in his life knows about me. He couldn't answer. I got angry and asked him again if i could meet ANYONE in his life. Friends, family, etc. He still didn't give me a straight answer and got angry at me. I asked if he was ashamed of me and the work i do. He skirted around the issue. He basically broke up with me because I'm (his words) ""nagging him and being negative"" because i got upset and cried.

I don't even know what I'm asking for here. I guess i just need some advice because it hurts so much. Was i unreasonable because i got mad then cried? I am so fucking humiliated right now. I saw a future with this man :(

The system i work on is as new to the office as I am. A few months. But, I have used it at a pervious job. So I am more familiar with than most to my understanding. The way everyone is supposed to deal with stuff is different now too. There is a specific responsible party for a group of products now. Before I would do my best to to deal with a problems for all the products. Now I am supposed to just assign the problem to the over seer of a specific group of products. 

My hiring paperwork says I'm an operations associate. But, one of the out of state managers made a speard sheet with everyone's focus, listed my focus as mail clerk/account assistant. 

This is my first issue. It hurts and is demeaning. Also, pay wise it gives me nothing to move up to. Operations associate can make twice as much as an assistant. I haven't been demoted just given a focus. But, it still sets a bad president for future at this job. How do I handle it?

Two: people who have titles like project manager and speacailsit try to push their work onto me. I.e I will just ignore your assignment and let you deal with it.  I understand that the operations of the work flo  just changed for everyone. But, fucking hell I'm just so angry.  I have a full load of responsibilities to do without having irresponsible people who get paid more than me act like fools. 

How do I get past this and not give a fuck? 

I take very specific notes in the system for all to see. So I know the boss will eventually see all my notes on a page and ask where the fuck everyone elses are but, I am super bitter now. A problem once opened must be closed by the over seer so when the boss opens a report full of stuff hanging it'll come to a head. But, I just want to work with not lazy ppl. 

I do a lot of redirecting like this need over seer approval to move forward type stuff after I have gathered info from different departments need to help close the issues. 

Help chill me out please!

136,"Alright folks, here's the long story short. I've been seeing a girl for about 4-5 months now and suffice to say, I'm quite fond of her. She's smart, and makes me laugh my ass off on the reg. She's a catch! The main issue is that I don't think there's much of a future for us at the moment for a variety of reasons. 

Currently we're in university, so we live in walking range. Come summer, we'll still be in the same city but it'll be harder to see each other with nearly the same frequency. And after that, she's returning to university come fall while I'll remain away. We'll be about 1.5 hours away and I'm the only one with a car, so the burden of travel would be on me.

Additionally, while I like this girl a lot, I'm no where near ready to say I love her and I'm not certain I can picture myself spending the rest of my life with her. I'm not even sure if I'm confident I've developed enough as a person to truly fall in love and develop a very positive long term relationship.

All this put together makes me unsure if I should just end the relationship now. I like it a lot, and I'm pretty fond of this girl, but ultimately I feel like I might just be wasting her time. What do you all think? Additionally, do you think relationships are built upon the promise of a future?",05Apr2019,1

150,So full disclosure I have been taking Ritalin as perscribed by a doctor for a little over 5 months for my ADHD. Well at about the 3 month mark I started to get hooked to the ritalin. And this past month I started snorting ritalin for stronger effects and blew through this month's supply in a week. I was taking 60-80mg at a time and I was taking it twice a day. So today I decided enough was enough and that I am going to kick it for good since I wouldn't have it for 3 weeks I figured that was plenty of time to get over the addiction.  I took my last dose at noon and right now it is 9 pm and the withdrawl is starting to kick in. I am having serious cravings and it is the only thing I can think about at the moment. I do not want my family to know that I have been addicted to Ritalin because it knowing them they won't be supportive they will only try to kick me while I am down so going to them or rehab is not an option but I saw severe depression is one of the main symptoms of withdrawl from ritalin due to the lack of dopamine.

I would go to his place after school without my parents knowing. I usually went because I was bored and I wanted something to do. We would talk and then he would give me alcohol and he’d sleep with me. He eventually disappeared, no contact from him at all and four months later he found a girlfriend. 

It’s been a year and he contacted me January of this year. He wanted to be friends and he apologized for everything. I agreed to be friends but recently he started flirting with me. He would say things like “I wish you were here” and “I miss you” or “If you still lived around here would you date me”. I notified his girlfriend that he was acting strange and she didn’t have much to say.

162,"Backstory: 
My dog is about 8 years old and a chihuahua. He had leg problems for probably a year, but it got worse and we found out he tore his ACL. So we got a $3000 surgery to fix it. I have 5 dogs, two chihuahuas, and three Brittany’s. My moms fiancé has lost both parents and has a friend she considers her brother, let’s call him Ted. She also used to foster dogs and her friend adopted a two of them. 

Actual problem:
My mom told me today that my dogs leg has been acting up again and mentioned “I’m not sure how long he has left”.  Now this had me taken aback, so I asked her “you mean how long his leg has left?” And she told me no, the dog will be put down if both of his legs give out because we can’t afford another surgery just for him to mess it up again. 

Well my mom saying this reminded me of something. I asked her if this happened AFTER Ted had watched the dogs (as they had gone out of town) and she said yes, when they came back in town his leg was messed up. However one thing that is different than when he normally would dog sit is that all 5 dogs stayed there, where we would normally take the two chihuahuas to my grandmas to stay with her. 

Well I had been at my dads house for the weekend and dropped by my moms to grab some stuff for work. When I came in, I announced that I was there, and heard Ted’s muffled voice so I figured it was in response to me. So I walk to the back of the house to go upstairs to my room and I see the door to the Master bedroom open and Ted standing in his tightly whities yelling at the chihuahua in question. 

I immediately ran upstairs realizing he had not heard me come in and it was too late to back out now. So I went to the top of the stairs and then I stopped, and I listened to what he was saying. Ted was screaming at this dog, and I mean angry screaming. So I quickly gathered my things and snuck back out downstairs. 


I’m worried that Ted may have hurt my dog and is the reason his leg is bad again. However, accusing him of this would mean two things, admitting I saw him in his underwear standing over my dog (as I would have to explain why he didn’t know I was there and why I didn’t stop him) and that I could potentially tarnish the relationship between him and my moms.

Should I tell my moms? If so how do I address it?",05Apr2019,6

168,"I have been debating posting about this for awhile. It’s hard to get advice from the few people that know about it, because it’s a sucky, confusing situation and I truly don’t know what to do, so hopefully Reddit comes to my rescue.
A little background (I have a habit of rambling so I’m gonna make this as short as I can)... I met my ex my first day of high school. I was attracted to him right away and after talking, we had similar interests &amp; tastes in music/movies/pop culture/etc. He had a girlfriend, I had a boyfriend. We became best friends anyway, where I began to fall for him very, very hard. His girlfriend felt threatened by me, so after about 4 months of friendship, we stopped speaking and did not talk again until the summer going into junior year of high school, when he &amp; his girlfriend broke up. We became semi good friends after this and he admitted to me after 6 months of being friends again, that he loved me like I always wanted him to, but I spent so long being sad over him that I did not feel that way about him anymore. I was in a toxic relationship that I was 5 years deep into at the time and didn’t know how to pull myself out. But I let him take me out for lunch one day &amp; the old feelings came back. We ended up dating for about a year, until I fucked up and cheated on him. We broke up because of this.
Fast forward to last July, we still talked consistently since our breakup a year prior, but I still loved him and it seemed he did not. I kept pushing and pushing, until he admitted to me that he came out as gay to his family a few months back and was finally ready to tell me. It took me some time to grasp it, but I do love and care about him &amp; just want him to be happy, so I tried to be there for him in every way I could. We spent more time together than we had in a long time &amp; I felt like I had a new best friend almost, and I enjoyed this time together. It turns out, spending all this time together was not making anything better. He would sleep at my house sometimes when my parents were away and it seemed to bring out old feelings again, although everyone we both know (both our families &amp; both my friends and his friends) knows he is gay. He has been sad and almost depressed for months now, because I do not love him in the way he loves me &amp; do not want to be with him/can’t make things go back to how they used to be. He will go through periods where he can’t even talk to me because it hurts too much and I respect this, but he comes back around and talks to me anyway.
I do not know what to do. I hope none of this post comes off as insensitive in any way, I love him so much &amp; I want him to be happy, but I can’t do that in the way he wants me to. Any advice is helpful, because I have no idea what to do anymore.

Also, generally if any of you have any advice on shooting a short film I’d love to hear it here instead of on wikihow or something. I did some video projects in school including a feature length documentary, so I’m not a total beginner but this will be my first work of fiction.

Thanks in advance!",05Apr2019,1
170,Ok starting off I’ve been diagnosed with major depression (cuz I’m a typical insecure gay teen) and anywayss I’ve been extra really unhappy lately and I think it has to do with the people I see on social media and YouTube. It seems like everyone is living their dream and going to La and becoming rich and famous and successful and having fun while I work hard in school bored out of my mind. I feel like I would be so much happier if I could switch lives with some of these people I feel like such a boring bunny failure compared to them:( part of me believes I won’t be happy until I’m super rich and successful. I seriously hate my life so fucking much and idk what to do. I guess I just needed to rant but if anybody has something I should hear please give me some advice ;-;,05Apr2019,1

174,"I joined a new company about a year ago that has been growing really fast. The back office is small and I work with one other person. I took over a lot of duties that he didn’t enjoy handling or that he didn’t handle well. I think I’ve been doing really well and the owner seems to like my work. 

 I can’t shake the feeling, however, that my coworker is kind of resentful. I’m leading a lot of company events and meetings and getting a lot of kudos. At the first meeting, he said he didn’t want to present. I urged him to anyway since he’s been with the company since it started and he helped create the slides. I always believe in giving people credit for the work that they do.

More recently, I’ve been creating all the presentations by myself. He’ll add a few slides at the end, but he doesn’t help during the process. He knows I’m working on them so if he wanted to help earlier in the process he could. Instead about a week before each presentation he’ll say something like, “That’s a lot to present. Do you want any help? I can present some of that for you.” He knows I have no issues with presenting in front of the company. If I say that I don’t need his help, about a day before the presentation he’ll say something like, “Let’s walk through the slides and and talk about who says what.”

He does this with a lot of other work too where I will do the majority and he will do Just enough so that when we present to the owner, it looks like it was 50/50. But he’s always very friendly and acts like I’m his best friend. Am I being paranoid he’s just being helpful? How should I respond to this?",05Apr2019,2

177,"So I (25F) got out of a 2 year relationship about 2 months ago. It was very toxic and he was lazy, unmotivated, didn’t make me feel sexy, and generally didn’t make me happy. Also, he was fed from a silver spoon his entire life and his mom was obsessed with him so he never apologized for anything- ever. Never owned up to anything. ANYWAY.

A few weeks ago, I met a guy (28) who has a month left in rehab. He was addicted to pills such as Xanax, Oxy, etc. His mom is addicted to them as well but is prescribed so she doesn’t see the issue. Further, his dad is a meth head- he doesn’t have much contact with his dad because of that. We grew up in very different backgrounds- me in a white suburban neighborhood and him in a trailer park. So far things have been AMAZING. He’s been clean for 6 months and has told me he is never going to use again- and I told him that if he does, I’m out. I’m working on my Masters in mental health counseling and work full time and just got my own apartment so I don’t have time for that. He understands 10000%. He makes me feel soooo sexy and good and confident. He has been helping me get my apartment together and even carries in my groceries!! My ex would’ve NEVER done that! Last night in bed, I asked him if he was okay and he goes “yeah I’m okay. Are you? Stop worrying about everyone else and ask yourself if YOU are okay”. I have never had a man say anything like this to me before and I about cried. He treats me so well and we are constantly laughing and I’m so comfortable around him. Plus the sex is amazing. 

So...this is where I need the advice. Like I said, he finishes rehab in a month. When he finishes, he is going to go back to his old job. However, he’s only living options are going back to his mom’s or dads...both addicts. I told him that he is more than welcomed to stay with me if he wants until he is able to get back on his feet. This might be too quick BUT I don’t want him to be surrounded by addicts. Fast forward to tonight, we were talking about it again and he told me “that’s the plan” in reference to living with me. I instantly got so giddy but I’m also having a few thoughts about it. What if it doesn’t go right? What if we don’t work out? I honestly think we would live really well together. He’s a very calm guy and I’m a biiiiit anxious- so we really even each other out. I keep him grounded and he lets me float a little bit.

Anyway, any advice is welcomed. Thank you in advanced!",05Apr2019,2
179,"my boyfriend, who's my best friend in the whole wide world, and i were talking today and i somehow brought up my weight or something in a lighthearted manner. it was half heartedly serious and honestly i wouldn't have thought a second thought about it if he didn't respond the way he had. here's how the conversation basically went:

Me: *says something joking about my weight* seriously though please don't let me get unhealthy haha
Him: *silence* well i mean you have gained a bit of weight...
Me: you're talking about my stomach right? (i had already noticed me gaining a little weight and have been super insecure about it) 
Him: Yeah you've gained a bit 

He said it in a way that meant he had already noticed it significantly and had been thinking about it. it's fine that he wanted to help
me be the best me i can be, but i can't help but think that he was judging me and thinking i'm gross. 

I made some comments to him later about it and he shrugged me off and basically said i was overreacting and that he loved me the same and that it might just go away. but he was basically just shrugging me off.  he also said that he had noticed it last night and he had been staring at me a lot but i thought it was just because he liked looking at me...now i don't know.

180,"I've been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend for a year now and our relationship keeps blooming strong. I'm 20 and living in the US and she's 19 living in Australia but we manage really well even if we're a day apart from our timezones. Me and her talk every single day for hours, video chat for hours and we always spend our time together watching movies, videos, playing games and just talking in general. But this is where the problem comes in: my parents. They are picking on me and calling me a loser and a ""wanker"" for having an online relationship and they keep telling me that I have problems. I keep telling her that she's wrong and that many people find love online especially nowadays and then I'm told to shut up or that they will destroy my PC and my phone, and that I will get kicked even tonight if I keep talking.  I just can't talk back many times nor defend my position because of this. I feel really anxious and hopeless about what's going to happen next. I've been trying to talk to them for a while about how nowadays this is something normal and many people find love online and it eventually becomes real. Because for them this is an ""illusion"" but I'm really serious about me and her and we're looking forward to meeting each other and eventually living together. If they don't listen to me maybe they will listen to someone else but I don't know who I can speak to and it's hurting me because I really love her and I never want my parents to get in the way of my relationship with her. I don't know what to do. My parents live in the past and call everyone who has a long-distance relationship mentally disabled or a ""wanker"" and this is something which saddens me a lot. I want to move out but I'm not economically stable right now, the cheapest good rent around me is around $1600 and I don't earn more than $800 a month because I'm also a student at this moment. 

When I compare myself to those people who find love online, she instantly compares me to ""millionaires"" at my age. Today she made me cut all contact with my girlfriend. She tells me to go find someone real, even ""the ugliest girl"". 

I really need advice who to talk to, someone who can convince my parents that online relationships are considered normal nowadays and it's not something that makes people mentally disabled. And if I can't find anyone like that then what should I do, I want to move out but at the same time I want myself some privacy and not to live with a roommate.

181,"I just don't really care about what I'm taking anymore.

Small background. I come from a family of accountants, engineers, and nurses. Everyone went to university so it felt like the natural course of life. I was a great student in high school but I didn't know what I wanted to take so by default my mom helped me apply to the business school to take accounting cause why not. First year of university made me very depressed and I learned accounting wasn't for me and went for Marketing and Management Information Systems(MIS) instead. I'm pretty okay at Marketing and I guess I'm alright at MIS. I even got a part time job as a Marketing Assistant and do pretty well.

However, I'm just finding that I really really don't care for school anymore. I'll listen in class but I find it's more so to be part of discussions and make my professor happy as opposed to me being engaged in the subject. More and more the idea of failing courses and wasting money doesn't bother me at all. I skip classess so often to do absolutely anything else. I also don't really see myself working jobs in either of my majors for my whole life. School just feels like a thing I need to finish for my family as opposed to a stepping stone for my future. 

I still need 11 courses to take and 2 co-op terms to fulfill which means around 2 more years of school. We have a month long family trip back to our home country happening in 8 months and I'm choosing to take a semester off. I can't express just how excited I am for it. I'm scared I'll like it too much. 

I'm realizing that there's other things I absolutely love doing more than school. Like singing and playing the piano. I'm no beyonce but Ive always loved to sing. In HS I spent every lunch hour in choir not once questioning what I'm doing there. I recently bought some online courses for both piano and singing and I find myself getting so pleasantly lost in both activities. I could do it all day. Sometimes I play till I start falling asleep at the piano. I love it. I fantasize of one day just singing everyday. Training and being part of musicals. When I run through dream scenerios in my head where I win the lottery and don't have to worry about money, all I can think of is spending my days training in music, teaching kids how wonderful music is, and other creative activities like making cotton candy art and starting a business with that. ( I serve cotton candy for birthday parties part-time and sometimes I like to make sculptures with the cotton candy for the kids).

But all this comes back to where I'm at now; spending most of my days in school for marketing and MIS and working as an assistant marketer. But all the while I really just can't wait to get home and play the piano.

I have no clue what to do. I know this is something only I can decide for myself but I really would appreciate hearing what others think. Does anyone have any similar experiences? ",05Apr2019,1

I really want to start going outside so my skin will hopefully darken over time but I have a really hard time pushing myself to actually go because of concerns like, 

“what if someone i know sees me” 
“what if someone else is out for a walk as well”
“what if my neighbors see me”

All theses questions and more. I am really insecure currently, not only because of my skin, but I also haven’t had a haircut in ages and have pretty severe acne as well.

During this time a very friendly lady in the checkout beside us came up and was getting very excited about our baby. My daughter is one to quite enjoy this type of attention normally but then this lady ended up giving my daughter her keys to play with which my daughter, as babies do, promptly stuck into her mouth. 
I would move the keys away a bit every time my daughter tried to put them back in her mouth but I froze up so much to where I didn’t even say anything to the lady that I was uncomfortable with her giving my baby her keys like that.

I've been with the girlfriend for about 2 years now. We have a house together and have been living with each other for about 6 months. We have a pet together as well.

It's not that she is ugly, she is gorgeous, but, I can't help but feel ""turned off"" when I'm around her or think of us romantically. Another way of putting it is that in most people's cases they strive to find someone that they can picture the rest of their life with, like a fairytale ending, and I don't see that with us...

I am very close with her family so that also throws a wedge in. Does anyone have any advice for me? Do I keep pursuing this even though I have a bad gut feeling when I think of us or do I cut ties? I am 21 so I'm a little worried I am kind out of the ""dating realm"".

I went for the interview and was offered a position the next day. I immediately accepted (it’s my first full time job)  Afterwards, the editor messaged me to get some contacts for this piece she was planning to write. I hadn’t even had my first day of work yet at that time but complied thinking it was nothing.

Then I was assigned to an event alone on my first day of work before I had my orientation in the office. The editor gave me some guidelines to find answers on and let me do my stuff later. I was panicking at the event because I knew no one but tried to get as much info as I can. But when I stepped into the office and debriefed her, she was quite unhappy about my answers as there’s no depth to it and mentioned in a roundabout manner that I’ve failed my job. It made me feel crappy about myself afterwards. 

The next few days were just overwhelming amount of info and tasks to do. It may seem like nothing much to another person but I just feel so overwhelmed. The editor didn’t really meet me face to face much in the office because I assume she has a lot of things to do too. 

I didn’t expect these negative emotions to happen and didn’t expect so many socialising I had to do (but I did my best to do anyway). I couldn’t eat well, my hands were shaking every time I sat in front of the computer and I felt as if someone is choking me every minute. Every morning I woke up, there’s this fear of going to work and a fear of things that just keeps on coming that terrified me. I’ve lost counts how many times I’ve cried in the washroom. 

I had an anxiety attack yesterday in the office on the 5th day of work. I couldn’t breathe properly and my heart was racing. My hands couldn’t stop trembling and tears were escaping thru my eyes that I couldn’t even stop. I escaped to the washroom trying to keep a calm face but I think my colleagues saw. I reached out to a friend in the washroom and calmed down after she taught me breathing exercises. 

I feel that this job isn’t for me but I don’t want to be a disappointment to my parents.

For context, I am a 17 yr old male and the girl I like is 19-20 (unsure) but I know is definitely 19. I live in the US and in my state, one must be 19 to legally serve alcohol.

I dont have any more friends here to hangout with, they all went to out of state colleges, and the only way i get “hangout” is when we finally find some time to play videogames together.I do find some music to be relaxing but with all this shit going on in my life atm its lost most of its effect. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, TIA:)

However, she is extremely pushy when I don’t answer her rants via text immediately. I work full time and go to school full time as well, and a lot of my “free time” goes into my homework. I don’t get much down time. My mom is having issues with her mother that is living with her (who is also pushy), and gets fed up and spam texts me about it. Admittedly, it’s getting old hearing the same song and dance. In my mind, you either need to do something about it or don’t complain about it. I don’t mind lending my ear, and usually she just needs to vent. However, she texted me her frustrations a few hours ago while I have been busy doing assignments before I wake up tomorrow for work for an opening shift. I get snarky comments saying “Thanks for your prompt response. I realize it’s not your problem but you should care” etc. This just sets me the F off and enrages me.
I haven’t responded yet because I will be doing so out of rage, but what the hell do I say to her that gets the point across that she’s being ridiculous but she needs to figure something out between the two of them and stop dragging me into it and blame me when I don’t respond when I am busy?

Her parents yell at her a lot and her dad sometimes gives her bruises. She wanted to ask her biological mom questions but she died before she could.

She started to cut herself as a way to distract herself and had a lot of anxiety attacks. Recently, she was thinking about killing herself and her mom stopped her and brought her to a hospital. They diagnosed her with depression and other issues.

I recently have stepped away from a relationship in order to help both of us find ourselves and become individuals. We were too dependent on eachother and honestly it put me in a bad place mentally because she relied on me a lot for happiness in order to help her mental health. I'm a person who really likes my space and with that type of relationship I became very claustrophobic. My mental health personally is declining but I am finding help, whether it be a psychiatrist or psychotherapist is going to be determined. Regardless, after stepping away from this relationship I am realizing that I have almost no idea who I am as an individual. I'm not a very open person so even writing this is very tough, but its reddit so why not. I feel like I've been so caught up in everybody around me trying to take care of and be there for everyone that I never checked in with myself and didn't see my mental state declining.

211,"( sorry if there are some mistakes I’m on mobile and I’m new)
I started my new school in September like everyone else does but I went to a new school, it was bigger, has more lockers, more space to roam around etc.  my older sister went to the same school until the middle of the year when she transferred.  When I first got on the bus I noticed a guy. He was just like any other guy nothing special about him, he was pretty cute but I didn’t know what grade he was in.  I felt something off about him and I didn’t know why.  I ignored it thinking it was just me getting nervous around new people and all that.  Luckily I had my best friend with me and we sat in the front of the bus. We did this for about two weeks, then she told me that her mom is going to drive her to and from school, and she will go one the bus sometimes.  This made me sad but what could I do.  So I get on the bus like usual and go to school but when we are going home it gets weird. I sit in the front like usual and I am minding my own business when I hear these guys voice talking about a girl.  After that another guys voice chimes in and I noticed the voice, it’s one of my older sisters guy friends.  This is what I remember and I know the weird one who I don’t know started it.  
“ who is she?”  
“Who her?”
“Yeah what’s her name?”
“Oh that’s Lexi, Hanna’s little sister.”
And when I heard my sisters name and mine I turned around to see both of them staring at me. My heart drops because I don’t like people looking at me if I’m not talking to them, like a fear of being made fun of.  I immediately turn back around. Keep in mind I’m in the front and these boys are like three seats behind me on the other side.  I told myself they were probably just talking about my sister but I don’t know why they would talk about her or even me, she didn’t even move schools yet! that is in the middle of the year!  So I let it slide but ever sense then I feel the dude staring at me.  I decided to sit in the back for the rest of the year (that has not finished by the way) and see what happens.  He always sits in the middle so every time I get on the bus I look around and I see him staring at ME not anyone else just ME.  At cafeteria I see him looking at me sometimes and I get uncomfortable.  Like who wants to be stared at while they are eating?  Yes this has happened a few times but I ignored it making up excuses as to why he would stare in my direction.  But this happened a week ago and I lost it.  I have been dealing with this bs for eight months and I could not control it anymore.  I was talking with my friends at the cafeteria and I look around and I realized that he was staring at me with his head in his arms but his eyes over his arms like you would when you are tired in a class and listening to the teacher talk.  But not only was he looking at me so was his friend who I have never seen before and they were both talking without looking at each other just staring at me.  I lost it and turned to my friend with a smile feeling dead inside.  I have done acting for many years and I can hide my emotions pretty well.  When I am walking back to my class I realize who is in front of me, it’s them. The friend turns to look at me before going down a hall.  And it was one of those “hey can you check if so&amp;so is there” looks. I’ve tried talking to my friends about it but one of them knows him personally and says he is a good guy but I’m just creeped out.  Can anyone give me advice please.",05Apr2019,0
212,"I never ever want to lead anyone on in any way, shape, or form, but I have a long history of befriending lonely guys craving friendship and then getting stuck in an endless cycle of courtship. They begin flirting, and I'm not equipped with the mental fortitude to tell them to stop. The thought of telling them to stop makes me feel panicky, but being around them also makes me so tired and anxious after it goes on for weeks or months. I avoid the university cafeterias and dread going to my favorite activities because of them; I lie about where I'm going or when I sleep so they leave me alone; and I don't use social media because I don't want them to see when I'm active.

213,"Throwaway to hide personal details as much as possible. We just renewed our lease and my roommates have been dropping hints that they want to adopt a cat but haven't opened a discussion up with me yet. I want to be prepared for what to say when the time comes. The three of us live together, they're partners. We live together as equals so I feel like it's unfair to tell them no even though I would prefer a pet-free apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what it comes down to is I don't dislike animals, I'm not allergic to cats, so I have no problem with one being in the apartment. My issues are: 1) the majority of furnishings in the living room area are mine and I'm worried the cat may damage them and 2) I don't want to ever have to assume responsibility for it. Part 1 is especially worrying for me because many of my furnishings are brand new pieces that I expected to have for a long time, so any pet damage would be devastating. I'm also worried about the implications for things like our security deposit, extra costs we may have to pay from potential damage, etc. This is mostly financially motivated which could be relieved if I felt like they could cover it all, but I don't. Part 2 is more selfishly motivated but I just feel like they would expect me to take care of their cat in instances where they can't, like for example if they left for the weekend. I would do it of course, I just hate the principle expectation that I would have to. That's a lot of responsibility to thrust onto someone who didn't ask for it.

I was in love deeply and the guy was (and is) my best friend, with him was the first time that I felt that i made love, with him I got my first orgasm, he taked care of me in my worst times and I was there too for him. We ended because I felt I ran out of passional love and I just saw him like my brother. We have a great friendship now. 


I'm saying this because I love to love. Its have been difficult to me to have that empty space in my heart, I feel lonely. I have been dating people just for the hookup because I feel that i need some time to be lonely (I think this in a rational way) and it has been senseless. I have had good sex for sure, but I hate that hookup thing that you don't have the cuddles, no guy have looked me in the eyes when we are doing it, you don't have the kisses and the unconsciouss hugs while you are sleeping.

217,Nothing life threatening but I going through some stuff back home and a lot of decisions I need to make up before sophomore year of college. Message me if you have some time ,05Apr2019,1
218,"First I apologise for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language as I am Mexican but I'm trying my best.

Some context, last semester one of my colleagues who I used to call a friend, invited me and other friend to work and make our social service (where I live, to get your degree you have to make 450 hours of social service) with him at my University library (the kind that sells juvenile books, English course books, enciclopedias, etc.).

So I accepted and worked with them for a whole semester, and part of the current academic cycle.

I was receiving a form of economic support from the University, as it was a project that benefitted the School, and the library. It was about $3000 MXN (about $150 USD) per month.

Now this is where the nightmare begins, at the start of this year, we renewed our academic support to continue working with these people, everything was going fine, we had work reunions (to which I assisted and worked) but there was one reunion I couldn't go, and I send them a message telling them that I couldn't make it because I was working with another professor on another project.

So these guys I considered my best friends, seeing that I wasn't present at the meeting and probably being scolded by the professors, sh*t talked me and told them I wasn't working at all, and supposedly wasn't attending the meetings.

So the professor in charge of the library, took the precipitated decision to kick me out without notice of the project, no message, no phone call, no document telling me the reason, nothing, he decided to straight up kick me out without even talking to me.

I got notice of this decision when my two colleagues told me and by then it was too late to even dispute the decision.

By this time I had already collected the money I deserved for my work.

So I did what a moral student would have done, I went to talk to him and thanked him for his time, and told him my version of the problem, we said our farewells and I left, for I never wanted to talk to them again.

So this is where the threatening part occurs, today I got a call from their personal numbers from both professors in charge of the library, they were extremely mean and hostile, they started lecturing me about being inmoral for getting my economic support, because they thought I really didn't work for three whole months. They continued to personally attack me and in their words they told me ""We could do this the good way or the bad way. I know people high up and I can affect your academic life, and remove your right to any future economic supports so you either bring us the money (referring to the three months of support I had done that was $9000 MXN or $450 USD) or we do it the bad way"". And when I was trying to explain them that I didn't do anything wrong they straight up hung up on me while I was talking.

Needless to say I was in shock, they didn't even listen to me, I had already spent most of the money paying rent and services, and I was hopeless as I don't have that amount of money at the moment, not even working for a month would get me that quantity.

So in my hopelessness I ran to my school tutor and the person in charge on helping students for help, I told them the whole story and told me I really wasn't doing anything wrong, but they would come with me tomorrow to back me up in my claims.

Needless to say this stressed me the f out, my back hurts horribly and I feel that my head is about to explode.

So this is where I cry for advice (or help), I don't know what to do, I'm seriously scared and terrified of what they will do to me and my academic life for not having the money I spent to maintain myself.

tl;dr: The professor in charge of my ex- social service wants all the money back from my support because some guys sh*t talked me and think I wasn't doing anything, and I don't have the money because I spent it maintaining myself.

219,"So, I’m friends with these people and we all hang out frequently. Well, this one girl, “X”, has started spending time with us because my other friends seem to really like her. 
However, she annoys the crap out of me
X is one of those people who brags about growing up without a TV, or says weird things in a joking matter in a way that seems like she wants people to take pity on her. 
For example, she talks about her health issues a lot “yeah, I can’t eat that cause it has pea powder in it, I’m allergic, it gives me stomach ulcers” *awkwardly laughs* and just constantly saying things like that and complaining or telling weird stories that give her “adverse experiences”. Usually I’d feel concern, but the way she says it is like her saying, “please take pity on me” It drives me crazy. She always has to be the person with a sad story or a worse experience. 
I grew up with a sexually abusive father and I NEVER bring it up. Maybe it annoys me because I feel like she’s complaining about things that seem trivial to me. But I try to live by the logic “to each their own” .

224,"This is going to be a long one. Throwaway account because family knows my username. 
I’ll start from the beginning. In August of last year my 13 year old niece ran away. My sister called me in a panic because (we will call her S) S was missing. I went to help search for her. A lot of my family was secretly speculating S’s father had something to do with her coming up missing. 
We will call her father J. 
J had been with my sister for close to 20 years. He has a violent history. We knew he wasn’t a good person. The unexplainable bruises my sister always had and the stories we were told from the kids, we knew he was abusive. As a younger child I witnessed a small bit of the violence and I distanced myself from my sister and her children as I got older. Especially after attempts to help get her out of the situation and she stuck by his side. I love all of my sisters kids but I have always had a close bond with her oldest daughter S. J was very controlling over the whole family and I didn’t get to see S very often. 
The next few days after she had been found is when it had came to light her father J had been sexually abusing her and her younger sister. J did not know the girls had told anyone. 
It took me and a few family and friends to somewhat bombard my sister telling her to turn him in. She did and he was arrested. The kids did forensic interviews and no contact orders were put into place. The first few months were pretty insane with court dates and everyone finding their new normal. 
I have been S’s number one supporter. I take her to counseling and she’s with me almost every weekend when she’s not in school. With the trial coming up very soon I’m worried. When she has to talk she shuts down. I don’t blame her. I can’t even imagine talking about the trauma she’s been through and how much she doesn’t trust people. 
If anyone has any advice on how I can help her. If there’s anything I can say or do to show her that her voice matters and she can overcome this. If she shuts down in court it could mean a lesser sentence for J or completely having the charges dropped. If he got released the whole family would be in danger. S knows the risks but is still very scared to face him in court. I so badly want to help her through this but I’m just unsure at what to say or do. 

A few side notes just for clarification. 
My nieces were 9 and 11 when the abuse started. It lasted for 3 years.
The abuse took place while my sister was working.
No one in the family knew. 
J threatened to beat them if they told anyone. 
S is with me so often since J was arrested her and her mother don’t get along very well. My sister is working out a lot of her own trauma at this time too but my main concern is S and her sister. 
This happened in a small town and it was blasted all over social media, making everyone know what a piece of shit J is.

I'd normally get annoyed but I started screaming in anger with adrenaline rushing through my veins, I completely shattered the container in my anger and broke some other stuff. Proceeded to drum my fists on the table until it really hurt, after that I started eating.

Pieces of scrambled egg kept falling out of my burger, suddenly I grabbed the entire thing and went feral. I held the burger like a starving animal and furiously took bites without chewing at all. I was SO ANGRY, I turned into a damn animal and screamed at everything that went wrong, even the smallest things.

I am not angry often and I have patience, but now I just cracked. I have had no good way to release any anger for a while now and looking back at how angry I was I am actually a bit concerned, the way how I ate that burger like a rabid dog growling whenever another piece of egg fell out.

237,"I work as a launderer for a rich young couple in their house. Job has always been great but today I made a big mistake &amp; don't know what to do. 

While sorting through their clothes today, I accidentally cut into a fancy shirt (outer layer is paper thin) while removing a tag. It is a very small cut on the back that isn't very noticable, but it is obvious based on the look of the cut that it was with scissors not a natural rip. Also based on the location of the cut, it's obvious how it happened. 

The residents of this home buy clothes that cost anywhere from $300 to 2k per shirt. I cannot even find this brand online, let alone the same shirt, but I'm sure it's expensive. 

If I fes up they could make me pay for it or even fire me for being sloppy. On the other hand, I could risk not saying anything. Their closet is bigger than a department store &amp; it's quite possible this top will be one of hundreds that will never get worn. But if it is worn, &amp; the cut is noticed, I may still get fired.

239,"I (23f) am an only child from two very loving but overly protective and a bit controlling parents. I live an hour away from my parents in my own apartment and I have a part time job woking in my family's business. I am partly financially dependent on my parents in the sense that I pay my own rent, groceries, gas, clothes and things like that, while they cover things like medical bills, insurance, and phone bill. I grew up very sheltered, protected, and doted on by my family. I was conformist to the T, quiet, obedient, sweet, demure. not that those are bad qualities but I never quite felt like I was who I wanted to be. I have always been drawn to more edge things and nerdy things as well but never able to explore them until a few years ago. I love my parents and we have always had a close bond but as i have gotten older i have been disagreeing with them more and more. My dad, can be very close minded and he has been having a hard time not controlling me like he used to. I think he likes to be correct and in charge and needed more than he even knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tattoos were always so cool to me and I loved them on other people while dreaming of getting one myself. I've talked to my parents about them in the past and found they greatly disliked them. I wouldn't say they hated tattoos but they always said they would accent a tiny minimalistic tattoo that is easily hidden. Unfortunately, I always wanted a larger one and multiple ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up getting my first tattoo a month ago while traveling solo in Europe. It is about the size of a half dollar coin and is the greek symbol for Psychology which is my career and passion. I wanted to get this small one because i actually have a 4 month in the making appointment with a well renowned tattoo artist in LA for a half sleeve coming up in two weeks. I spent a lot of time researching, reflecting, discussing my decision with a therapist, and reached out to the studio before making that decision. I did not tell my parents before getting the small tattoo and let them see it for themselves when i got back home because honestly i was afraid of what they would say. I knew it would be bad, I did not know it would be THAT bad. Mom took it ok, dad got furious. I have never in my life seen him that angry and i was genuinely afraid of him. I tried to defend myself but when he yells, i tend to freeze and shut down. I get so broken down by him. Getting that tattoo was one of the happiest moments of my life because it represented freedom and independence and pure selfish joy. It was a feeling that made me feel like I was myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that fight with my parents however, I told my parents about my appointment for a second tattoo. I felt that in that moment it would have been much worse if I kept that a secret as well. They asked me to cancel it and I had agreed in the moment. But i never wanted to cancel it. I want this so badly and i do not want my parents to control my life anymore. i am an adult paying for this with my own money. but please the thing i need advice for is how to tell them. I think i need to tell them before I get it instead of them finding out because of what happened last time but I am terrified of my dad's anger and disappointment. Im scared and i'm anxious. 

 

TL;DR I made an appointment for a half sleeve 4 months ago which would have been my first tattoo. i ended up getting a small one in between and my parents saw it. Massive fight ensued and I am terrified of them hating me now. How do I tell my parents I am getting another tattoo?

242,"It’s a long story, but basically I was part of a church / almost cult that pushed me into marrying someone I didn’t really know that well, very young. It went about as well as you would expect.
We had some good times, but they got fewer and further between - and were eclipsed by some really horrific abuse. There were times I thought I wouldn’t survive.
I’m now years free of the marriage and the religion - so much so that I’ll be marrying the woman of my dreams this year (spoiler, I was gay the whole time, just had to be straight for the cult!). I’ve been through / am going through a lot of therapy to get past it all. I’m unfortunately left with some physical but mostly mental scars (PTSD being the main issue).

So that’s the background. Here’s my issue. 

My wedding had all my closest friends at the time (most friendships lost along with the church, aside from a few that left with me) - and had some family that are no longer here. Not to mention we were all younger and fresher. I don’t have a lot of photos of my life as I’ve always been pretty camera shy and my family didn’t really value photos, so we splurged and paid for a really talented photographer that got some great images.

I have such mixed feelings about deleting the pictures. The marriage was horrible, but the wedding wasn’t. They’re also part of my history - will I regret not having them to show my kids? Or are photos from the wedding of a failed marriage not something I’d want to show them anyway? I don’t like looking at s lot of the photos, especially the ones with my ex, but some of them aren’t so bad except for the fact that they were taken at the wedding. 

I know I’m rambling, sorry. I’m just in a weird place and would love some advice, maybe from some people who have been there. What did you do with your wedding photos from a failed marriage?

Thanks in advance for any advice.",05Apr2019,1

So the whole gang was at Tony's house, which was our go to chill spot, and Tony was on a lot of drugs. I'm talking LSD, magic mushrooms, and marijuana. He was super high, and he thought he saw John's girlfriend touching John in inappropriate ways on his bed, which no one out of the 5 people who were there, except Tony, saw. So  a few days later, Tony just decides that John was never allowed in his house again, and that he never wanted to see John again. Weeks of talking to Tony, and trying to tell him that he was just way to fucking high, and that no one saw what he saw,  pass, and he still wont believe us. Now it's like theyre making me choose between them and it is tearing me apart. I've been friends with Tony for about a year longer than I have been with John, but me and John just connect on a whole different level...

259,"Hi reddit,

Thanks in advance for any responses I get. 

So my mom has been a stay at home mom since I was born (23yrs). She was a nurse for a long time before that, but hasn't pursed anything else. Me and my siblings have been long out of the house and all she does is watch Fox News all day long. She never gets up, never does anything. She stopped cooking, going to the grocery store, and every time I come home to visit she's still in her pajamas.

Her health has also been in decline. She has always been overweight, but she has since been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 and refuses to change her lifestyle. It's like she's completely stopped trying. I want to help but she doesn't listen to anyone. She's very religious (my siblings and I are not) and she is on a religious high horse that nothing can be wrong with her, including clinical depression.

I'm at a complete loss. My dad is an enabler and she always pushes him around. He never says anything or encourages her to live a healthier lifestyle. I went to visit her today and I just feel so guilty that I'm standing by watching all of this happen. Nothing I say ever changes anything. Absolutely any advice is welcome.

267,"So my brother has been a severe alcoholic for some time now, falling over everywhere, drinking himself into a psychosis at time. However, he always managed to get it together and go to work every day, and attend family gatherings albeit late usually.

But over the past couple months hes been getting worse. Hes lost most if not all of his friends due to insults hurled at them when hes wasted and hes become increasingly more isolated, although he has always been somewhat of a homebody. At our most recent family get together he was worse, zoned out, not forming comprehensible sentences and unsteady. 

Being a nurse, I have seen the effects alcohol had on people long term, so I contributed this behavior to a decline in heath and possible high ammonia levels. 

Yesterday, my mom called me asking if i would join them in a sort of last minute intervention to go to rehab because they found out he lost his job due to him asking them to drive him to his work to pick up his car. I agreed, knowing in the back of my head he always refused help and to admit an issue. But i thought I would try. It ended up being me to go in first due to his predicted negative reaction to multiple family members barging in his house. I began to ask him what was going on and asking him to get help, he completely blocked me out basically said thanks for caring but get the fuck out of my house unless you drive me to my car. At this point he was slurring his words and would not be able to drive so i refused and left. 

Today he called me and asked me to drive him to his car and i agreed because he sounded ok. However, after waiting for about 20 minutes for him to get into my car then him coming out hammered and half lidded eyes, i started to drive with him. I asked him what he was on he said he used lots of drugs and got fired because of it. He said he was on alcohol and Xanax. I again asked him to get help. 

I asked him why hes doing it. He says, ""I want to be happy"". 

My heart is breaking and ive been unable to think of anything else. I told my family what he told me and were going to keep trying to convince him to get help. I dont think he will comply. Im worried for his well being and I'm afraid one day he will be found dead in his apartment due to his mixing substances and severe depression.

274,"    
First some background on me: 

I’m not exactly the warmest person to be around, I believe I can be egotistical at times. I struggled early high school to make friends but I’m doing much better now. People see me as a sort of goofy smart kid who can occasionally be an ass. My main problem is letting things go. I will correct just about any and everything, but if I’m wrong I will admit it. (I only do this when the issue is either a claim they are making or something that could affect them negatively in the long run)


On to my friend (let’s call him Gary): 

     Gary has had a lot to deal with recently in his life no teen should have to deal with. Mainly his mom is slowly dying and in addition he got rejected from his dream college(s) last week. 


Finally the issue:

     Every time I “correct” Gary he gets mad at me and starts to awkwardly laugh and insult me saying how me correcting him is unnecessary and irrelevant. I certainly have an issue that I feel I need to work on. But recently we were in a smaller class together and he solved a math problem the wrong way, however he got the right answer. This was sort of Gary’s breaking point. He was convinced the teacher and I were incorrect in saying his solution was wrong. The teacher put us against each other because we both had the only right answers. 
      Gary was upset about that, but later in the day he really got mad at me over something I said. I was horse playing with someone else (let’s call him Mark) and he made a comment about how I was considerably less mature than Mark, even though I was 3 years older than Mark. I replied “that’s an opinion not a fact” and Gary demanded an apology (I asked for what he said that I said it was an opinion and that I needed to admit my immaturity and that I am very egotistical). I refused to give him an apology. There were two bystanders, one sided with Gary (someone who everyone regards as kind of crazy), Mark sided with me. 

This is what I ask y’all:

1) I feel sorry for Gary and in general he’s a very nice kid whose dealing with a lot of stress, but as we are both seniors we will only see each other for another month. Should I salvage this friendship? (I just talked about the worst aspects of it here, but it feels as though that’s what makes up the most part of the friendship recently)

2) If I try and salvage the friendship, how should I go about it?


Finally I want to note I’m being very critical of myself, I almost feel unfairly so, but if my egos an issue as according to the friend, I wanted to be as critical as possible of myself.

276,The other day I was looking through my old photos to try and find a picture of me and my friend when I came across a long heart filled message from my ex. It stuck with me with tears on how everything has changed so much between the two of us . He and I are still friends and still keep in touch . Every conversation we have is mostly just small talk and distant very different from how we use to talk . After seeing that message I’ve yet again been struck with sadness from our break up and more and more questions began to pop up wondering why he can say he still loves me but only wants to be friends ?? I know as of right now I love him but I don’t want to get back together with him but I think we could still give it another try ???

278,Im incredibly lonely. I just want someone to share life with. I just want someone to be with. But I can due to my  asexuality. I cant find a girl and even if i did I know she would leave if she found out I am asexual. I know because you just cant make ordinary people live that lifestyle. I am just incredibly desensitized. My emotions have dulled and its hard for me to find joy in my hobbies. But when I think about love My heart splits into millions of unrepairable pieces. I feel like I’m wandering the earth alone yet I’m surrounded by people. I thought I was just the biggest retard in the world for not being able to get over such a stupid problem. I found out that smart people tend to be more alone and an example [article ](https://www.quora.com/Are-intelligent-people-more-likely-to-be-alone) I found and read. I seem to match most of the things on the list. So I took a couple iq tests and I know it sounds stupid and they are not accurate but on most of them I kept scoring above 130. And honestly I might not be smart and it might be untrue but if I am how am I going to find someone who will love me now. That also partially explains why I always felt off key with everyone else. Always surrounded by idiots who cant think correctly. So my point. How. I don’t want to die alone. I don’t want sex or cuddling or hand holding. I don’t find pleasure in such things.

I often think about committing suicide, very often and it scares me. One the one hand, I am very proud of my accomplishments in life, I came to this country about 7 years ago with an abusive partner, no more than a high school degree, and severe bulimia. I weighed less than 90 pounds, felt cold and weak all the time and I had no plans for the future. I am now completely healed from my bulimia (it lasted &gt;10 years), I can run a 10K easily, I left my abusive partner and instead I am engaged to the love of my life (I never thought I could love someone this much). One of the things I am most proud of: I managed to go back to school and  even ended up getting into a phd program. It's hard and challenging but I am doing quite well academically. Ironically now that everything seems to be better in my life, I can't help feeling submerged by very strong angry and sad emotions.  It's as if I was waking up from a 10 year long bad dream/ or as if I just got out of jail and now I have to adjust to a whole new life, but I am older and everything has changed. As a result, I think about suicide more than ever before, sometimes I am in so much pain, I feel like I could easily slit my wrists or harm myself in some other way. I don't really want to die and I know that, I know these moments come and go...but lately there has been a lot of them, everyday, at least twice a day. I have tried talking to a psychotherapist but I did not feel like she understood where I come from so I didn't feel confortable telling her how strong my desire to commit suicide is at times. On my worst days, when I feel like I could really harm myself I tell my fiance but his reaction is the following: he tells me he loves me so much that he can't stand hearing me say I feel like committing suicide, and he makes me promise never telling him things like that again. I understand him and I really really empathize with him,  but besides him I don't feel close enough to anyone to talk about my desire to commit suicide. There are days when I feel like I can really do it, it would only take seconds and the pain will all be over, so I reach out but then he gets mad at me for not sticking to my promise. Should I just hide these kinds of emotions from him and not mention that I think about suicide anymore? Is it selfish of me to reach out when I know I am capable of calming down eventually after a few days? I do feel like a terrible person but I also feel really lonely. I know my family loves me very much but in the past when I was with my abusive partner  I was so isolated from them and I feel like they have continued living just fine without me. My fiance is really the only person I feel comfortable sharing these kinds of feelings with. I am trying to write here in these forum too with the hope that, maybe it will help out. ",05Apr2019,1

284,"Hi all, theres been a series of comments made at work thats got me reeling. I'd just like to see the overall crowd thoughts and maybe advice, but I'm probably more just telling a story.

So to quickly catch up, I was hired to my current job this past December after interviewing for a position for almost 2 years. It is a long story, but its a combination of odd industry dynamics and the specific companies preferring to hire either people fresh out of college, or with years of experience. I came from a somewhat tangential line of work that they didn't consider experience. Now I'm (mostly) happily hired!

&amp;#x200B;

In a team of 2, I'm constantly receiving praise for both my work ethic and my quick progression, and my boss is constantly reassuring me that they are laying down the framework for me to progress; people on this team have left the team or the bank due to stagnation, so its a sore point.

In my latest meeting with my manager, they mentioned that I will be approached soon for a higher position by another team in the department; apparently the department head (that I never really speak to) is on record as thinking it was a good idea as well. My manager (with great stress) wanted to broach the topic first, to express their doubts.

My manager reasoned that though I would survive, I would struggle in the position, and due to the current department dynamics, my line of work would be narrow in focus and my progression would stagnate. They didn't have to mention that our team would lose me, and be left with the manager and one person under. I had no idea I was being considered, especially by people I haven't really spoken to, and in that meeting I reassured them that I would like to stay, as I'm still new.

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention that these positions don't really open up unless somebody leaves, and people like to stay in this line of work. The company is obviously keeping costs down by limiting the amount of heads employed, and this was reaffirmed recently in a department meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time later, my manager mentions that we got a hire for our team who is significantly younger, and goes on to mention that ""they have a lot of experience from a smaller company, and this person will likely be with us for maybe 5 months before they take a higher position in the department"" (similar to the one they had spoken with me about earlier).

&amp;#x200B;

My manager is a good person, and is extremely stressed due to how the department life is. That said, I don't want to say I feel betrayed, but I feel pretty lost and I'm not sure what to feel. I work extremely hard, and I've waited so long to start this career, and I already feel like my work is overlooked and not truly appreciated.

Words of wisdom? Thoughts? Advice from experience? Just spill, I'll read it all. Cheers",05Apr2019,1
285,"I'll try to keep this simple.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend and his wife presently have three kids total. She is unable to have anymore kids. The baby-daddy of two of the children has been calling CPS and falsifying claims against the children. For an example, the other night I was watching the kids with the father (Tuesday in specific) and he called CSP claiming that the mother had the children outside at the time in which they were at my house and had poured cold water over them and slapped them several times. Keeping in mind that from the time they woke up until the very next day (as we were both off), he spent the time at my house while I trained him for work. The mother was out of state and the kids along with the father stayed at my house. In gist, this never happened but he called CPS and claimed it did. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has happened a handful of times with other, notable examples. The children (8 year old girl &amp; 5 year old boy) told us that they've been forced to say yes to everything the biological father has asked because they're scared. Seeing as they're kids they can only really articulate it somewhat but they claim he's hurting them when he gets angry if they say no and that they are scared of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

His background is fairly simple: Her and him were dating for some time and in a relationship for over 3 years but he got caught up in crime, went to jail. Not wanting to expose her kids to this, she kicked him from the apartment. He is backed over $17k in child support and recently has tried to file for conjoint custody (50/50 -- i believe). He lives with his parents and they do not have even a spare bedroom to put any of the kids in. The eldest child says they sleep on the floor or on a blow up mattress in the living room when they stay at their fathers. 

&amp;#x200B;

This weekend she normally sends the kids to see the father but today she had a huge mental breakdown and confided with me that she's terrified for her kids and does not want to send her kids to see him because of the things they have said, fearing for their safety and as well the ongoing custodial battle. 

&amp;#x200B;

She had already been friends with my best friend and we have all more or less hung out with each other for over 15 years. Eventually the two of them got together and had another baby boy. During this time, the biological father has made outlandish claims such as telling the police he believes the kids are being sexually abused which prompted the police to hold her husband in cuffs for a few hours while they questioned the kids in front of the mother. He has threatened verbally the husband and told the wife on a few occasions that he would beat her. 

&amp;#x200B;

She already has a lawyer for the custody part and the lawyer is advising her a paralegal of sorts to assist in the CSP issues.

&amp;#x200B;

What other advice could I provide to them in order to protect their children and push the guy out of their lives?

287,"So my mom want visitation with my since my dad has full custody. My dad has a paper saying my mom has to come see me but my mom isn't allowed to take me anywhere and I can't go to see here, she has to come to me.

Now backstory: Im almost 18. The 4th court date will be April 12. Exactly 4 months till I turn 18 from that court case. (Why so many court cases?? Well every time we went to court :) there was always 1 key element missing. Divorce papers, paper work, agreements, that type of stuff)

My mom has emotional hurt me and my family and caused stress. It got to the point where I was suicidal and had trust issues with family. Because of her I felt like I couldn't come out about my problems which really led me to the bad road. Thank god that part is over at least.

Problem: My mom wants visitation but I don't want to see her at all.  I can't even speak for myself as I have an attorney that speaks for me. 

Since the 3rd court case, I cut all contact from my mom. From. Text, FB, insta, and even snapchat that she doesnt use but jusssst in case. The only way she can talk to me is through my sisters are dad. Even told the attorney if i visit my mom, I will walk the 3 hours back to my house. I am old enough for my decision and I don't want to see her, her new husband, or the husbands kids as that house is a wreak. The husband is constantly drinking and always yells which makes me feel unsafe. 

A while ago apparently she said she was going to petition to drop the court case and we have gotten nothing in the mail for the court house saying that it was dropped yet.

I am terrified. Just thinking about seeing my mom makes me want to cry and scream. I can't stand her and don't want to be near her. I don't know what to do if the case actually has to continue. Every time I walked into the courtroom I almost broke down crying. The first judge try to make me stand in the middle of my mom and dad and that let alone made me freeze. 

I don't even know what advice I'm looking for. I guess advice on how to stay calm in court. How to forget about the entire thing. 
I'm still in school too so all the stress is killing me there. How I could possibly win the case and not do visitation ?? Cause the attorney has to decide if I need my mom or not and it late to even send the attorney another email since it took her a month to reply to my 1st one. 

Not to mention Im trying to get a job this year and would like to get one before summer and Id rather not worry about School, job, and my mom. Not even a mom. A damn Surrogate. 

Part of me wishes my dad never brought my mom back into the family (they broke off when I was young and the when me and my sisters got older, my dad brought my birth giver back to try and 'fix' things.)

288,"I moved into a new apartment complex about two months ago. My building has an extremely friendly orange cat that wanders around it all the time. Originally I assumed he was someone's outdoor cat because he's very open, affectionate and even a little chubby. Over time I've learned that he's always at our building because a bunch of the people in this building feed him, but he's actually homeless.

Since then, we've let him into our apartment a few times. I set out water for him and have given him food a few times. I also bought him a small toy that he really likes. Our whole apartment really loves him, and he seems to really like us too. Lately he's been waiting outside our apartment door at times.

I'm suspicious that he used to be someone's pet, and they may have a chip or something. They also seem to have declawed him. He's extremely well behaved inside and clearly familiar with being in a house. He rarely if ever climbs furniture, doesn't scratch anything but a basket we've designated for that purpose, and guides someone to the front door when he wants to go to the bathroom. He always comes when called and will sit wherever you ask him to. He also doesn't mess with objects around the house unless he's told its okay, and will back away from something if you tell him to. 

On top of that, he's so cuddly and friendly that he's almost like a dog in a cat's body. He loves everyone he meets and likes to play with them, and even gets a little clingy if you don't pet him much. 

He's pretty much the dream cat (minus the declawing, but that's more of a gripe with his old owners), but between him possibly being an ex-pet and also being friends with the other apartment owners (though not nearly as much as us) we're not sure what the next steps would be.",05Apr2019,1

Due to my family financial situation I don’t have to pitch in any money to stay here and my community college has been paid by my parents thus far. I currently work part time as well and I use this money to live on throughout the month (though I only have to pay for what I want to do, eating out, gas, car expenses). My friend is currently employed at a factory in the area and they pay very well at his position. Due to my relationship with him I have been told by higher ups that work there that I can get a job there after the school semester is over. The position I would receive pays about 60k/year for the first year and then after 2-3 years it’s more around 75k. Many people in my area would kill for an opportunity to work here and getting on without help from current management/ employees is basically impossible. I’m not completely sure what I want out of my education yet and saw this is an opportunity to be fully independent and return to education when I’m financially stable as well as determined on a specific career path. There are 3 main factors in my life that currently play into my decision making. My family, my girlfriend, and my group of friends. My family is not completely against this idea but I would be moving out ASAP if I don’t continue my schooling right now. My girlfriend and I have been together for around 3 years and she really doesn’t like the idea of me working full time. She has brought up all of the things you normally hear when talking about taking a break from school such as never going back, being stuck in my home town, getting to used to the money etc. I have been hanging out with my current group of friends for 4ish years. The one that can get me the job however has been my friend since young childhood. They have been pushing me to work full time as we would be able to all live together pretty soon splitting rent 4 ways. 
 
I personally really want to move out as my parents and me don’t see eye to eye on a whole lot and they tend to be very strict. I’m 20 but have to be home before 10pm unless I’m working. Constantly checking up on me throughout the day is the normal. Questioning whether or not I’m sober every time I look tired. It’s been getting old for a while now. I have already tried to make it better with them by asking them to loosen up on how strict they are but they make it very clear that it is their house so therefore their rules.

(i am not). At first he started flirting with my roomate (and close friend) and she instantly fell for him. I did not like that and told her that he is a womanizer and that he will hurt her. But that didnt work out. They started dating for a short while. When he lost interesst in her, they agreed to be just friends. But he still texted her often and flirted, to make sure that she is still available when he changes his mind. When she asked him for clarification he told her it's difficult and he is not sure what his feelings are.

Enter second girl. Also a really close friend and already one of his exes. She told me a few days ago that she and the guy are partners again and how happy she is about that. But she made me promise not to tell anyone espacially my roommate. She told me that the guy wants to do that.

Well here is my problem. My roomate is sad that the guy stopped texting her all of a sudden. She asked me for advice and i know whats up but cant tell her without breaking my promise. It starts to affect my relationship with her.

- Not kept clean, I'd be wearing dirty underwear most of the time because my mother would never clean clothes.
- My belongings would be stolen and sold by her for money.
- I was told to lie about my life in front of other people, she would also lie to me about anything and everything.
- She ran off just after my 16th birthday (I'm nearly 30 now) to meet a man she met on the internet in a different country. I tried to kill myself during that time, she did not care, she wouldn't answer my phonecalls, I even went to the police to file a missing persons report. Turned out that she lied to him about my existence. 

Fast forward to today.

- Living away from her, have a job, car and soon a home of my own.
- Avoiding contact for my own mental health.
- She lives with my dad, illegally.
- If she talks to me, she usually starts wailing and crying if I bring anything up, her life and living situation hasn't changed since I left. It's like going back into a time machine if I go there. It's horrible.

My question is, if something happens to my dad, she's going to basically expect to move in with me. I have screamed at her and gotten upset/angry, that she is not changing anything, she is literally waiting for something bad to happen to my dad, and she is going to expect to move in with me. That cannot happen. She never cared for me, why would I let her move in with me? What do I do?",05Apr2019,1

309,"Title pretty much explains it. My ex boyfriend (M23) won't stop contacting me (F21) 
I have blocked him on everything, I did the day I broke up with him but almost a year later (next month will be a full year) he is still making new accounts and even fake accounts to contact me. 
I even made a new instagram followed no one he knows and only had my first name on it. It isn't linked to my Facebook as I closed that down too  but he still managed to find it I have no idea how!! My username is a made up word. 

This is honestly exhausting and scary. He isn't threatening or mean but he  always says ""heyxx"" or things like ""I just want to talk"" but the one time I gave him the chance to talk he just went back to wanting to get back together so I blocked him again. 

He used to do this with his ex girlfriend all the time but I never knew the extent until now and I always wondered why she kept responding and unblocking him. I suppose it wouldn't matter if she did or didn't since he's this persistent a year on. Now that I'm the ex girlfriend he's moved onto doing this to me and it's honestly so uncomfortable. 

I have told him I'd file harassment forms against him and I even messaged his best friend seeing if he could get him to stop but nothing is working. This is seriously crazy scary stuff and I don't know what to do anymore.

 I'm a shy quiet and anxious person so I'm not confident enough to handle all of this. I've told my family I've told my friends told my boyfriend everyone knows but we can't do anything. I just want him to leave me alone.",05Apr2019,1
311,"I have a pattern of depression. I always put myself down &amp; get sad a lot. Its a normal habit because I was always bullied &amp; teased during early years of childhood. The scariest part... is that I also use it as a coping &amp; defense mechinism for me when I face a problem. 

i.e ... 
- lost a friend ? its ok. im always boring. that also means that I can move on. 
 
- got bullied ? yeah i probably deserved it. but it will make me a stronger person. 

- ugly ? atleast no one will hit on me. that also means I wont be getting uncomfortable attention. 

- dumb ? my friends that stayed means they are people with good heart &amp; patience! 

- crying ? thats normal ! 

- angry ? yeah its because I wanna improve!

what Im trying to say is .... I think negative energy is a good thing but I see positive energy as a bad one. 

Recently I noticed that I was doing well at the gym but that freaked me out so much because nothing bad happened. I wasnt used to it so I immediatly kept putting myself down internally. 

Its horrible. Im starting to notice it more &amp; Im freaking out because Im battling myself &amp; no matter what I do...... I feel like I cant win. 

Im so dumb, stupid, ugly, pathetic, weak &amp; ignorant. Im so used to hearing it.... always in my head. 

I just need advice on the best way to stop these thoughts &amp; evolve into a different way of thinking.... 

however its going to be hard because Ive never changed my mindset before but Im willing to try &amp; take steps.

314,"Let me give some context to this situation by saying that my stepdad and mom have been together for about 10 years. During those ten years he cheated on her multiple times, was extremely abusive, and did drugs during the time they were together. He was absolutely a piece of shit and eventually his abuse turned towards me and my sister (and later on my mom started to abuse both of us for whatever reason). So, eventually I moved out to live with a friend who was offering to take me in away from all of this and got a full time job. Then all of the sudden I get a call from my grandfather while I’m at fucking work(and later my grandmother) that my mom shot my step-dad.

My sister is living with my nana about an hour away and my mom and is currently living it up in jail. My aunt is kind of pressuring me to pay my moms bail which I wouldn’t be opposed to paying if it wasn’t 2,000 dollars which basically is all of the money I have saved up until this moment down the drain because my mother was in a shitty mental state, hated my dumbass step-father, and was miserable being married to him.

316,"First and foremost, I want to mention that this is my first reddit post ever. So excuse my ignorance of reddit jargon and what not. 

Anyways...
So I entered college as a virgin and I met a girl. We dated for 2 years. Her hometown is quite far from my hometown, meaning during winter and summer breaks, we do not get to see each other. At times, we can’t help but feel lonely and detached during this breaks. Last summer, I noticed things felt exceptionally more detached. Keeping in mind I was balancing 2 summer classes, work, and even planning on vacation for my mother’s bday. Half way through summer, she said she felt that she had to focus on herself and might not have time for me. The week school started again she broke up with me. It was devastating because we signed up for a sex class together and we were both volunteering in an on-campus organization. In this sex class, we were required to write an essay about our sex history ranging from family composition to best/worst experiences (remember this essay). After weeks of not having closure, I was able to finally get her to talk to me about why she broke up with me. Turns out her guy best friend of 6 years confessed his feelings and it made her question our relationship of 2 years. Fast-forward a bit, I apologized to her for every wrong thing I did. I loved her so much, she was my everything. In order to get over the break up, I was close to her roommate and she helped me though it. We ended up having sex. Fast-forward some more, me and her roommate stopped talking and me and my ex agreed to be friends with benefits. One week of school was cancelled due to Thanksgiving break and she said she was spending a couple nights with her best friend. She later came back with bruises covering her body, but she assured me that she was ok. Fast-forward even more to present day, we’re back together in a relationship. I was really curious about the essay she wrote cuz she was reluctant to tell me, but she told me some bits and pieces of it. Upon hearing that she wrote her best sex experience wasn’t with me, I felt devalued. She took my v-card (which yes, I know it’s a social construct), but then proceeded to say she preferred to have sex with her best friend because having sex with me felt like a chore at times. She sleeps at my place every night because she doesn’t like going home to her roommates. Anyway, she studies a lot late at night and today I noticed her laptop was left at my place. I couldn’t help but remember her saying she had sex and had bruises. And I remember she said she didn’t have sex with anyone other than me when we were friends with benefits. I quickly found out that was wrong. I assured her many times that even if I was going to be hurt, I would want the truth and honesty rather than lies. She hasn’t came back yet; however, now I’m shaking and antsy. I don’t want to say anything, but at the same time I want to address her constantly lying to me. I feel really bipolar because at times I would adore her and hug her so much because she truly does make me happy and I feel like she’s one of the little people I show my weird side. But then there are times where I’m skeptical of stuff like this and her lying. 

I know I shouldn’t hold the past against her, but it really really really upsets me that she lies to me. And yes, I know it was wrong of me to access her files of her sex history paper. However, I don’t know what to do. 

TL:DR - I found out that, in my on/off relationship, my gf lies to me to make me happy because what I don’t know doesn’t hurt me. I don’t know how to address this, what to do, or even what I should say. I feel bipolar at times because things like this make me wanna break up with her, but she was the only girl to truly make me express how I really feel by showing my weird side with her and because of that, I love her.",05Apr2019,1

SKIP TO THE ASTERISKS IF YOU DONT CARE ABOUT BACKSTORY
*************************
So there was this girl that I considered a very very very good friend, If not one of my best. We both had feelings for each other at one point but the timing was always off (one of those). We were always flirtatious and would do romantic things like movies, dinner etc. All was fine until I got hit with illness (not including my illness names in story since they aren’t really relevant but can tell if you ask) and had to go on home hospital. It could have been fatal so I did not prioritize my social life as I did my health. I didn’t have contact with any of my friends for 2 years and when I tried reaching out nobody responded. That was until recently, I randomly got an instagram dm from the girl saying that she had a dream about me. She went on to tell me that in her dream she thought I was hot and we “did things”. She wouldn’t elaborate. She keeps on sending me flirtatious messages and stuff and have overall lifted my spirits for the first time in years. 

********************
So the problem is this
********************
She would like to meet up but due to my illnesses I really can’t leave the house. I also have a protective mother who doesn’t like me dating. I do want to meet up with her but do not have a way to get there and sneaking out isn’t a good idea since I could end up needing medical assistance. (My cousin might be able to take me but that’s a stretch) 
*How should I go about getting to this girl while being undercover and safe* ?
***********
There’s another problem. (Less serious)
***********
Pretty sure she wants the dick but I plan on staying virgin until I want kids (it’s a spiritual thing). *How do I tell her that I don’t want to have sex without coming off stupid/rude*?

323,"Tonight while I was at work I found out that my Co-Worker, who is a delivery driver for us, called the police on a homeless person who she wanted gone. While she was on the phone with the dispatcher, she lied and said that the homeless person has a handgun. In my state (which is an extremely left liberal state), handguns, but not revolvers, are a strictly controlled weapon. She did not give the dispatcher her name and after she got off the phone, she told the Manager on Duty to say that it was her that called.   
Since were a corporate owned business, I began to run though the possible outcomes of this and how they could have royally screwed up my companies integrity in the community, or more specifically, my managers integrity. 

If the cops arrived and the homeless person had freaked out and the cops killed them, and during the investigation they find out that there was no gun, and that the driver lied about all this, and asked the manager to take the blame, it could have some seriously bad things happen to us. 

The Assistant Manager, General Manager all know this, and she may be terminated. 

What gets better is that this driver has a history of carrying concealed weapons (knives, tasers, flashlights with tasers, etc.) which goes against corporate policy. She also has a history of corruption, committing an infidelity with a married police officer, endangerment of fellow Co-Workers, the works. 

She also wants to become a Police Officer herself. I've hung around cops before, and they have a very strong sense of duty, honor, and integrity. She displays none of these qualities.  She always talks about how one day she is going to be accepted into the Police Academy.   
I considered writing a formal letter to my states Police Academy tonight, warning them of her, if that is even possible.

so whats the problem? well my co-worker who runs the admin side of my team is leaving at the end of the month and despite there being a bunch of better options available upper management hammed in a guy who is a friend of theirs. 

this guy knows nothing about repairs, nothing about how our extremely old computer systrems work and nothing about the business. long story short i could put up with this if i liked the guy but i really REALLY don't.

he's a very serious ""man"" type man. carrys a knife everywhere for no particular reason and quotes jordan peterson and says things like ""I don't think women should wear so much make up."" whatever your views are on this kind of guy I personally could not be more the polar opposite. there is a near immediate personality clash.

329,"  There have been a couple times I can recall that I have just been smacked in the face with this heavy feeling of selfishness from this fairly new ""friend"" of mine. I actually really like her, aside from this one thing. The tipping point that led me here this morning was a crawfish boil we went to last night. I invited her, and I brought a LOAD of sides, drinks, and dessert. I did not ask or expect anything from her. As its time to leave I am helping the planner clean up, and offer him the last of most of my food for him to take him which he gladly accepts. So I ask if he wouldn't mind if I took home some crawfish. He says ""Yeah! grab a pan!"". I am doing a thousand things at this moment and I saw friend grab MY okra pan and dump crawfish into it, I go over and one hand a few things into it and thank her for the help. My car is full so I assume she is walking the food to her car once it is go time. When we make it back to my house, she asks "" do you mind if i leave my crawfish here and come back for it in the morning?"". At this point I ask a few questions for clarification...she thinks it is all hers. When I brought all the sides, traded my food at the end and I was the one to even ask the guy if I could have a pan. Was it just a misunderstanding or should I take this last incident as a final warning sign?

331,"around 6 months ago as I was walking home from the shops, a man offered to walk me home. I kept saying no but he had a very thick accent and was being nice so I though maybe he didn't realise I was scared. As we were walking we were making small talk and I said I was in high school. I knew I shouldn't have actually gone home because then he'd know where I live but I had no idea what to do. When we got to the front of my apartment he grabbed me and kissed me. I pushed away and said I needed to leave but he kept doing it and grabbing at my breasts and my butt. Eventually he let me leave, but made me give him my number first. I gave him a fake.

A few months later he followed me home again, asking why I was being so rude not responding to his messages. I told him I just don't use my phone much. He did the same thing where he started groping me etc and I told him that *he* needs to leave me alone. He followed me inside and kept telling me to let him in. The only reason I got him to let me leave was by saying my dad was home and doesn't let me bring boys into the apartment (a lie)

Over the last two months I keep seeing him right outside my apartment. He follows me around and gropes me despite knowing I'm a minor (turning 16 soon, he's at least 25) and me asking him to leave me alone etc.

Long short; Wife(mother of my daughter) left me after shortly getting married. So I had to move into a friends place for a short while as the letting agents won't let me stay there full term.

Last night the Landlord wanted a discussion about all these concerns about how things are going. I had been stressing all day as Ive had a bad week as it is. A couple of things were fair enough,like leaving my plate in the sink and wash it in the morning(only do this as I have to eat at 10:30pm because of how my shifts are) and leaving my daughters car seat in the dining room(which never gets used). Apparently I can't have friends or family here when he is home. They were all very stupid things that didn't need to be made a big thing of.

He essentially ended the discussion saying I don't think your the right tenant for me and if it happens again I am out. So I am guessing he will be ending the contract sooner rather than later since he has already said it. 

If I am out then I will essentially be homeless,I have no friends to that I could stay at and cannot go back to family.

When I first met him, he was the sweetest and kindest and most supportive person I had ever met. Now, whenever she’s near him, he has become incredibly rude towards everyone else, including me. To give you a short example: One day I had an anxiety attack right in front of him when we were at a club (he knows I have anxiety even though it rarely makes an appearance) and he ignored me because his girlfriend straight up told him to so she could get attention instead.
Another issue is that he just won’t shut up about her. He talks about her and texts her 24/7 (for example when hanging out with me or me + a group of our friends) and doesn’t seem to have the slightest interest in anyone else anymore. I really do want our friendship to work, but I just can’t when he behaves that way. So I really need advice on how to properly speak to him about this. (He has begun complaining that everyone hates her and I consider bringing this up the next time he says it, which is probably within a couple of days)

Fyi, there are no romantic feelings towards him on my part. I just want my best friend back.",05Apr2019,4
337,"So, about a year ago one of my close friends (let's call her J) introduced me to her new girlfriend (let's call her G). Over the course of that year, we've become very close, so close that we consider each other best friends. The night G and I met, J was very enthusiastic about the fact that we got along so well, because that was what she was hoping. This is especially because G didn't really have friends at the time and J was hoping she could become friends with me.

&amp;#x200B;

As our friendship progressed, J became a bit insecure about our friendship. She began to think that I was more interested in G than I was in her, and that I valued G more as a friend. This was and never has been the case at all. The difference between G and J is that that G is very open, and J is quite the opposite. G is the type to message you regularly, asking how you are as well as talk about what's been going on in her life, whereas J isn't the type at all to do that unless you reach out  to her first. I'm A LOT like J in that sense. However, because G is so open and friendly and would message me all the time after we first became friends, of course I appreciated it a lot and we continued to talk to each other regularly online. Thus, we became very close. It was nice to have a friend who cared so much about me, especially because I was going through a lot of shit at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

With J, G is very open about our friendship. She isn't secretive about anything. However, I'm starting to believe J thinks that I have some sort of romantic attraction towards G, or that G has some sort of attraction towards me. I'm not certain that she thinks that, but there's a possibility. However, I have never been attracted to G and our friendship is 100% platonic. Just want to make that really clear. G doesn't have feelings towards me whatsoever either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately G has been feeling very lonely. She lives alone and doesn't have any friends (except for me of course). She spends the majority of her spare time with J, but has been finding it difficult that J has started studying because she doesn't get to spend as much time with her as she used to. So when G isn't spending time with J, she feels empty and alone. The other day, G messaged me asking if we could catch up because she'd been feeling really lonely, and J was busy that night. Although I was keen to hang out because I was missing her and we hadn't hung out in so long, I was reluctant to say yes because I was afraid of J's feelings being hurt when she'd find out from G that we hung out without her. G explained to me that she understood where I was coming from, but reassured me that J would understand because she knew how alone G was feeling at the time + that she needs friends too.

&amp;#x200B;

We spent the evening together and had a really nice time. G explained to me that J seemed a little off earlier after she'd told her that she was seeing me that night, but that she also might've been overthinking things. Turns out, she wasn't overthinking things at all. After G got home from our outing, she messaged J asking how she was and if anything was up. J explained that she would've liked if G had asked J if it was cool to hang with me that night. G got frustrated and couldn't understand why she needed to ask permission to spend time with her best friend. J said that it would've been nice if out of respect I would've mentioned to her that I was going to hang out alone with G seeing as she's her girlfriend. But the thing is, I don't think of G just as ""J's girlfriend"". I think of her as my best friend and I don't think it should be a big deal that we hang out alone when J isn't available to hang out with us. I haven't yet spoken with J about this whole thing because G's told me J doesn't want me to know how she feels about our friendship and that she thinks it's an issue that doesn't involve me. J thinks it should be sorted out between the two of them only. G and I disagree and think I should sit down with J and have a big chat about all of this to clear the air because really, I am involved in all of this. I don't want to start coming between their relationship and I hate that my friendship with G is affecting my friendship with J. I just want things to be cool between the three of us again. I'm scared after I talk to J, she'll still be weird about my friendship with G.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Do you think J is overreacting or do you think her reaction is justified?

339,"Ok so there's a girl, let's call her Mary, that I've known since early high school and we have hung out as friends on and off since then (mainly depending on who we hang out with etc). We have always had a lot in common with similar interests and perspectives on life, I have always had a feeling that she was attracted to me in some way but I can't explain it (I could be wrong that's why I'm posting). Anways, December last year she moved 2 hours away to start Uni and I haven't seen her since then. 2 days ago I invited her to an event that my band was playing at, she said she couldn't come but asked to hang out during the day. Which we did. We got along great and had a good day out together, checking out places that were both interested in and just generally having a good time. I've always had a slight crush on her but never like this. If I hang out with her again ,I have to tell her I have feelings for her otherwise I don't know if the friendship could work. If she rejects my feelings I would still be happy to be friends with her as I would know what she thinks of me and vice versa.

340,"I want to make friends with my neighbour. We are around the same age and I can see we have some similar interests just from indirect ways such as sometimes I can hear the music he listens to from his house (our houses are close together). But we are also both shy/hermits. We've only ever greeted each other in passing a few times and nothing beyond that.

Since we share a mailbox, I know his full name. I know that sounds weird, but when you sort through a bunch of mail all the time and see the same name, you remember it. So I have found his facebook. I am tempted to send a message but it would be super weird because we don't have mutual friends so it would be obvious I found his name from the mail.

Then it all went to shit by me losing my job, my wallet, my phone. Because I decided to drink one weekend and black out and lose everything.

Hi all,

So I have posted this on r/Instagram , but I thought posting on here wouldn't hurt. I have two Instagram accounts, one “main” and one “spam/private”.

My “main” Instagram seems to be missing the “add post to your story” tab that can be found when clicking the paper airplane icon at the bottom of posts/Instagram stories. I used to have it, but it seems to have suddenly disappeared. I have this tab on my “spam/private account”. I use both accounts on the same device.

Here’s what I’ve already done:

1. log out of both accounts and logged back in - nothing changed, “spam” still had it and “main” didn’t.
2. updated the Instagram app - nothing new happened.
3. Deleted the Instagram app and re-downloaded it, then logged back into both accounts - results were same as number 1, “spam” had it, “main” didn’t.
4. Log into my “main” account on two different devices; an iPad, and another iPhone - still the same, the “add post to your story” still does not appear.
5. Contacted Instagram by going to Help &gt; Report a Problem &gt; Something isn’t working. I sent this two nights ago (3rd April 2019) and I still haven’t heard back - not even sure if they even get back to the person or just fix the problem.

I’m just very annoyed? I remember being able to share other posts and stories onto my story just a month ago (March 2019). Does anyone know what I can do or how to fix it?

Refer to screenshots below. I clicked on the paper airplane icon on pictures I posted from the respective accounts (because my both my settings allow my posts to be shared)

It's quite stressful and we all just want to move on with our lives and he is making it quite hard... anything we can even do about this?? We can't just say these things to him or he'll act even more aggressively.

352,"Alright here goes. This is a rather long one, but I need to vent I guess.

 I’m 27 years old, I live in Australia and I’m not sure where to go in life.

 For the past ten years I’ve worked in nothing but hospitality. I initially worked as a bartender because I was attending university. This was when I was still interested in working IT. 
Nearly a year and half into my degree I realised that I in fact hate IT. I don’t know how it took that long,  but I guess one day it dawned on me.
After I decided I was going to drop out, my girlfriend at the time insisted I keep working in hospitality and that we would move to a larger city (Sydney) where I could continue my studies in whatever I wanted. We broke up, I ended moving back to my hometown and I got a job another job as a bartender. That was nearly 5 years ago.

I’v never worked as anything but and it’s starting to scare me.

I’ve recently started applying for jobs within the government and admin work but so far nobody has even called back at the possibility of an interview, I thought that whenever I wanted to get out of hospitality it’d be easy because I’ve always thought I was at least a bit intelligent. 

I met my partner three years ago and she’s everything I wanted in a person and we plan to marry, but she has a step-daughter (Who I also love as my own daughter) which means that moving away for work is out of the question.

I’m at an impasse. For the past year I’ve been volunteering for our local Emergency Services branch (The SES, a little bit like the coast guard I suppose?) and for the St Johns Ambulance service. This is exactly what I was meant to do. This past year volunteering for these two organisations has made me happier than every job I’ve ever had. 

I finally feel alive.

The problem is, I don’t know how to turn something like this into a job. I’ve been considering returning to uni as a Paramedic, but the only university I can seemingly attend does not offer a degree in Paramedic science, but a degree in nursing is a possibility I have thought of.

Just looking for other people’s similar stores and their paths in life as inspiration.

355,"Hi.I really need to ask this even when i don't wanna.It was very difficult to make myself post this.I feel so embarrassed.So i would probably delete this later.It is very complex and hard to explain but i'll try my best,so this post could be very long and confusing.I am struggling to make sense out of this myself for so long.So please bear with me!!!

1. I am a 23 years old male.Since i was a child,i have this strange habit of not remembering anything.

2. The place i live now (for 5 years) or the place i lived in before,i don't remember 95% of people's names.Or the names of people i pass through every day or the names of my very own relatives.I don't know who they are,what they do or who knows whom,who is related to whom.Only recognize some of them by their faces.Only if i met them repeatedly,there is a chance of me remembering them or if you become my friend and i care about you,then only.But Oh man,there are so many people that i am seeing from my childhood,but can't remember anything about them,but only remember them from their faces.

3. This may seem normal uptil now.But thats not the only thing.I dont remember places.If i don't go there repeatedly and regularly,i wouldn't remember how to go there.Even if i always go there,i would many times forget on which direction i had to turn or get confused.That is also fine.But I've been living in my city for 18 years.Still i don't know many places,shops,landmarks.

4. Lets say you are my friend and you call me to meet me near my place.You tell me to come near a hotel and meet you.Chances are that i wouldn't know and think- ""Ok,what is this place.Where is it?""..I would have to ask people for directions.Imagine that.Keep in mind that this hotel is not only in my city but so near my home where i've been living for years,a hotel i've seen and heard about so many times,a hotel i pass through every single day maybe even 2-3 times,maybe i've also stood near it before,maybe even gone inside it one day,but i don't know where it is!! I have to ask people for directions!Just imagine that!! Or lets reverse that..if you asked me what are the places,shops or restaurants near my office,probably i wouldn't be able to tell you!!I mean, i ofcourse remember my office because i go there everyday,but every other place near it,i usually forget!!!

5. Ok lets say you,my friend are my roommate and we have a great conversation for hours one day.Then you go out.If someone asks me- ""Ok,describe what he was wearing"" I wouldn't be able to tell.At all.

6. I tend to forget what i ate on breakfast or dinner after i eat them.Maybe i would remember but then i'd be like- ""Ok,what the hell was this vegetable called again??""

7. I have forgotten so much from my childhood that i don't even wanna write that here.

8. When i talk with a person alone,then everything's fine but when i am walking on a road,then i feel like i am zoned out.Its hard to explain.Its like i am there but i am not actually there.Its like i am seeing people's faces and places but not actually seeing.Its weird,man.No matter how much i try,i can't seem to focus and my head starts to hurt.But weirdly,sometimes that doesn't happen at all and i'm fine.

9. There are a lot other things but i am gonna skip and not mention them.These may seem as extremeties,but other than these things i am a naturally functioning human being.I remember stuff that i need to do or passionate about,the names of people i love and care about,and places that i usually go to or am connected to in some way.Other things not so much. Someone who meets me wouldn't ever know that i have these problems.I hide it pretty well also.But when someone catches me they stare at me dumbfounded,or get angry with me for forgetting stuff or make a mockery out of me.
(There is a guy who lives in my apartment.After a long time,i got to know his name and about him after meeting him regularly.And we used to have long conversations.But then i didn't meet him so often.I forgot his name and who he was.Funny thing is we still have those long conversations when we meet but i dare not ask him who he is or ask someone else.

Or times when me and my friends go to our usual place but sometimes i forget and secretly use google maps to figure out where the bloody place is!!

 I remember once i became a laughing stock in front of everyone when i couldn't remember anything about a relative when his family came to meet us.They come every few months and they are close relatives.I vowed i'd remember who they were.It has been 5-6 times since then and my other uncle never leaves a chance to humiliate me infront of others and he always asks me okay,tell me who they are,what are their names and how they are related to us and i am never able to f*ing answer him or get confused!!! This makes me feel so little.And It is so f*ing frustrating man.Its like i've forgotten every f*ing thing from my life and i can't remember s*it!!)

I don't know if this is a stupid post or not.But i needed to get this out of my system.Maybe i am just a dumb person who needs to do mindfulness exercises.I read somewhere that these symptoms are also related to neurological disorder and i got freaked out.Hence,this post.I am at a  stage in my life where i can't take it anymore.Its hurting me mentally and emotionally.Because this makes me feel so pathetic.So someone needs to tell me that i need to chill and this is nothing and i am thinking too much.",05Apr2019,2
356,"Hey all im looking for some career advice,  


So I have a job, ive been here a year and i am fucking miserable. The company prides itself on being ethical and non discriminatory but in reality its terrible. There is a hostile reject system in place where any number of 1000 things can get my product rejected and i am completely at the mercy of the other shift, but even if they do something wrong they dont face any ramifications. In addition to all of this I have applied for multiple other positions in my facility that I am qualified for but I continuously get passed over. I believe this is because I am a welder and I am either viewed as a dumb blue collar tradesman or my skill set is too valuable for them to lose.  


I took this job because I wanted to go to college but this year they changed the education program from a pay up front system to a reimbursement system which is harder for me to navigate because I already have 3 kids.   


I am currently losing sleep over my performance and the clear favoritism in my shop.   


  
My other options is to either find a new job or go back to my old one. People don't leave jobs where they are happy. I left my last job because my manager was rude and abusive, so when my current company offered me more money and free college I jumped at it. My previous company has since removed my old manager, raised wages and been trying to get me back for about 6 months. Truth be told I loved my old job before my relationship with my manager turned. If I go back I will get a small raise over what I have now and the benefits are slightly less good.  


I just dont know what to do. My current job is making me miserable, but for some reason a part of me is still holding out that I will get one of the three (yes three) positions that I have applied for that are still open, or that I can just find a groove and ride it out until I can get my degree. My wife supports me either way. If i go back to my old job I am going to just get loans and pay out of pocket for school. The difference is I will be able to go for something I know I want (like nursing) in place of something that I think would be okay (engineering).

358,"So hi Reddit. I created an account to be able to share my story, and ask for guidance from y'all.

Background: I'm a young adult in his early twenties. I've been working in this startup since its beginnings, helped build it up until it created a few dozen job offers for fellow engineers. I've been offered a position as team lead in a biotech startup in Germany focusing on food safety, for whom I've been working for a year now remotely.

Current issues:

* **Family:** Culture around here is a very family-oriented one, and I am quite close to mine. I love them, and help them occasionally financially. Working near them allows me to be able to help in so many ways, while moving abroad will make it very hard for them to cope with my absence (emotionally speaking, you can see the mother hen aspect here)
* **Country:** Being able to help my country economically from within is a very good plus for me. Being a role model for others, teaching younger people and generally creating more job offers for people around me is a very rewarding thing for both me and my country. Being abroad and sending money back would help me participate in the consumer market indirectly, and be a potential massive investment for the country.
* **Career:** Taking the job offer to become a team lead in Germany would do wonders to my career, especially at my young age. I'm a workaholic, and working more intensely and being more productive is a need for me to fulfill. Working in biotech is one of my childhood dreams, and I'm happy I'm able to do it now.
* **Dreams:** I am an all-round very ambitious person. I want to save people lives (this job offer would enable me to do so), I want to make science more democratically available. I want to go to space too, or at least improve space travel, or at the very very least work in a field that might help space travel, even remotely so (developing better sensors, better energy, etc.). As an African boy wanting to make an impact on the world, my ambition is massive, and being restrained to one country would not do me good.

Dilemma: Should I stay in my country, trying to help it from within, creating more opportunities for people around and being next to my family to help them financially and emotionally ?   
Or should I follow my dreams, move to Germany, work in fields that I always dreamed of working in while kickstarting my career in a way that will make me closer to achieving my dreams and helping humanity while, at the same time, being able to sustain my family and country even better financially (but much less so emotionally) ?",05Apr2019,1

I’m sick of everyone telling me to just keep applying for more because I can’t handle it anymore. The rejection is destroying my self confidence and I feel like a failure.  On top of that my life is a mess, I can’t afford to do anything so I barely leave the house. I’ve lost joy in all the things I used to enjoy, I barely eat. 

If I had know it would take this long, the old me would have done something productive with the time but I’ve been living day to day just waiting for a call. 

I’ve lost all motivation and the thought of my future now makes me anxious and sad. ",05Apr2019,1
360,"So when my professor saw our exam scores, she saw that I have exactly the same answers as my friend who was sitting next to me. My professor posted on our class FB group page that she knows that someone cheated on the exam. She said that the cheater and the enabler must get in contact with her or else she will report to the dean which could cause expulsion from the university. So later on, the person who cheated off me confessed to my professor and took all the blame because he was able to see my answers without me noticing, which is actually true. But the thing is, when my professor contacted me, she does not believe that I did not notice especially because the cheater is my friend. I’ve been explaining to her that I was simply focusing on the test that’s why I hadn’t noticed, and my friend even said that he was just glancing at my answers instead of staring at it. I was completely honest with her. But it looks like my professor really wants me to fail in the course just because I was not able to hide all my answers. By the way, the reason why he was able to copy all my answers was because it was a matching type. It is very easy to copy a test where your answers are just individual letters.",05Apr2019,2

I have also experienced bullying throughout my teen years and sometimes I just want revenge.

They told me that no sessions where available for Fridays or weekends, the place was also quiet far from where I live.  

Anyways, it has been a year since the incident with my last crush and I still get flashbacks of how he made me feel and the incident prior to that. I am currently doing my A-levels and am in my last year, so I don't really have the time to travel far to see a councillor.

370,"Hi, all!

Some background: I (22) am currently in a very happy long-term relationship with my current boyfriend (22). We have been together for about 3 years. 

Recently, my ex boyfriend (23) reached out to me on Facebook. Nothing flirty or romantic in any way. Strictly “what are you up to these days?” “How is school going?”- stuff like that. He is recently out of the military so this is the first time he has been back in the area in years. Last night, he asked if I’d be interested in grabbing coffee and catching up. 

I am legitimately interested in getting coffee and catching up. I haven’t seen him in a very long time and I would actually love to hear about his experiences in the military and talk to him about what he’s been up to after all this time. What I’m worried about is that by agreeing to see him he will think I’m romantically interested. I also know that he was in a long term relationship himself but from what I can tell from light fb stalking, there hasn’t been posts between the two in months...

On the flip side, I don’t want to tell my current bf that I’m seeing an ex and make him worry, as my bf can be a tad paranoid. But I definitely don’t want to keep anything from him cause nothing funny is going on!

Is it totally weird if I say to my ex “yeah I’d love to meet up, but as friends”?? How do I say that in a normal way? How do I tell my boyfriend I’m going to get a harmless coffee with an ex? Or should I totally avoid the situation altogether??

375,"Some backstory, I'm Asian American, who would've guessed? Specifically Chinese. I'm working my ass off in college and in my internships and just not living the greatest life right now. My girlfriend is an Indonesian girl from the same university as me and I do love her.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I told my parents who I was dating, they seemed eager to look her up on the internet to find her and her family so they can essentially ""judge"" their heritage, and they found out that she and her family are fully Indonesian, so they immediately started to disapprove of this relationship. They are not ""forcing"" me to break up with her, but it's heavily implied because they keep guilt tripping me, saying that I'm going to ""ruin my life"" if I date an Indonesian girl, and that if I marry her then the marriage is going to affect the entire family.

&amp;#x200B;

They try to explain why this decision is justified by saying that when they were living in Indonesia as a teenager, they were heavily discriminated against by the Indonesians. My mom was sexually assaulted by Indonesian men, and my father had been brutally attacked by them as well. They keep telling me that she is ""always going to be the same."" They say that she's going to go back to her Indonesian roots and essentially ruin my life based off of the way they were treated back in Indonesia (the riots back in 1998 against the Chinese).

&amp;#x200B;

My parents say things like:

* You're so naive, it's obvious she's going to hurt you.
* Are you really going to leave us for just one girl?
* We're just doing what's best for you.
* Do you really want to hurt me like this?
* (Mom) You can hurt me, but please don't hurt your father.
* You can do better than her.
* She'll always have her racist Indonesian roots.

&amp;#x200B;

When I bring up the fact that they're controlling of me, they deny it and say stuff like ""Oh, we don't control you! We let you do whatever you want, except some things just can't happen.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I'm still dependent on my parents as of right now, but I know that I won't be in the near future. I have come to the realization that I can't please everybody, and that sooner or later I have to hurt someone. I love my parents, and they keep insisting that they love me as well, but recently I've been going to therapy and taking medication for depression and anxiety, and it really seems like they don't care about my mental health or my social well-being, but instead they only care about my success as a person; they care about how successful my future is going to be.

380,"A bit of background, I recently started university having graduated high school last year. My life was really good: I’d had a leadership position there, started working towards my journalism aspirations and I ended up getting a really good mark, getting into my course comfortably. Was really excited to go to university and had a relatively enjoyable summer, went to South Africa for a trip, basically refreshed and was ready.

About two weeks before O-Week, my long-term girlfriend blindsided me and dumped me, not long after I’d returned from my holiday (which was with my family). It really shattered me and was the first major blow which has led me to where I am now. Obviously she wanted to enjoy uni life and I was now discarded. Sucked because I loved her a lot.

I was ready to get stuck into O-Week nevertheless, also chatting to this girl I’d lost touch with, and was getting very close with her, trying to heal this sudden hurt. Then, as I was going for a run one day, I caught my foot on something and faceplanted, grazing my face really badly and chipping a tooth. Due to tending to my wounds which were very fresh and swollen, I missed all of O-Week (and the camps prior to it, due to work commitments).

Since that incident I’ve felt really unusual. The affection for this new girl I felt was gone, and we stopped talking, even though she is really lovely and I would have loved to give it a shot under any other circumstance. I also no longer had the desire to go out, or drink, or do any of those things that I used to find really fun.

Having missed a bunch of opportunities to make friends, I felt completely uncompelled to, even though I knew it would be best for me. Since starting uni, I’ve gotten along with people in my tutorials but nothing extends outside the classroom. I attend lectures by myself and sit on the furthest side of the room as I possibly can. Part of me says I should talk to people but I have this invisible wall of apathy to the whole situation.

I’m writing this under now familiar circumstances: others are out having fun or at least planning to sometime soon, while I sit at home, actively avoiding any plans that may involve me and sure as hell not planning any myself.

I have a blog which is pretty much the only thing that makes me smile anymore. I am hating university and I count down the hours when I’m there. I leave campus to study because I’m too scared to hang around there. I have no clubs or social societies to go to, which seems bad, but I kind of like it? I like my own company but I am also really miserable.

Idk what’s going on with me. I’ve never been diagnosed with any mental health issues, and I don’t have a great grasp of them. The long-term ex-girlfriend had some stuff but she never talked to me about it, and when helping her I always felt guilty if I ever talked about it in regards to myself, fearing she’d think I was appropriating it. Could I have something going on?

Apologies for the word spew, Reddit, I just wanted to get it out there and was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences, beyond your stock standard uni loneliness situation.

TLDR: Had a fall and hurt myself, missed all of O-Week and have lost all desire to have fun and be social or change my situation, now wondering if I have mental health issues which I have been too afraid to discuss in the past",05Apr2019,2
381,"Hello all you kind people everywhere all around the world! 

I’m going to Make this as short as I can.  So here we go...

I am a Hospice nurse now 13 years total. In 2017 I had a patient we will call him Wednick. I met Wednick in 2017 as he was on hospice services. My company had to take him off hospice service because there hadn’t been any sort of decline (it’s confusing)

Wednick didn’t have any family except for his ex wife that would come and go. It broke my heart we had to leave and i just couldn’t so stepping out of my boundaries I continued to visit Him a few times a week for company. Bought him food etc

He is a very sick man with a multitude of ailments. One day 1.5 years ago  I took him to the ER because he really didn’t look good. He was pale and very weak. They admitted him to find that they would have to remove half of his big toe more than likely to Diabetes. Then one doctor comes in and tells Wednick, “well we just noticed your lab work came back, and you have Kidney failure, kidneys functioning at 6%.”

So they started up the procedure to start dialysis that day in hospital. So one question I have, somebody with renal/kidney disease~~it doesn’t take overnight to become a stage 4 renal disease patient. He was in and out of the hospital for months!  Why couldn’t the doctor find out months or years before?  I’m very confused and sad because things are changing and changing for the worse. 

With Wednick these last couple
Of months have been very stressful. He is extremely confused. He yells at me. He will talk over me. I’m not a selfish person by all means. His wife told me she doesn’t know what kind of person he’ll be that day and she’s figured it out that he isn’t the same. I hope I’m not boring you all.  But it is now in all seriousness life and death. I will complete everything in the next paragraph with a coupe questions 🙏🏽

Lately Wednick has brining up God and Jesus and he believes that god has cured him and he no longer has kidney disease. The last day of Dialysis tx was 5 days ago. He says he feels great. Etc.  His nephrologist called him today on a conference call and specifically told him his kidney level functions are less than 10%. Wednick yelled at the doctor for 15 minutes and told him straight out I don’t believe you, you just recruit patients to your centers also telling the doctor that he has found Jesus and Jesus has cured him. He got so fed up he finally just hung up on the doctor. The dialysis center referred W back onto hospice services today but he has declined because Jesus has healed him.  Normally renal disease without  treatment,, a person can survive 2-4 weeks. Maybe less, maybe more.  But as the days go on he will be weaker, more tired and the worst would be CONFUSION  Where do I go from here?
 He is my friend and he is young as well.  I know whatever decision he makes i will accept it. I respect his rights. How do I talk to him?  I’m at a loss and even though he’s not my family. I’ve known him now for 2 years   

Can anyone give me some advice on anything. Something positive or maybe A negative?  Maybe I shouldn’t have gotten involved 2 years ago, but it’s my heart.  I care so much for people!

Well please anything you can tell me, give any advice. If u need more info about what goes on you can ask me as well!  Thank you all in advance.  I hope everyone has a lovely morning and afternoon!  Oh and if this isn’t appropriate here on the subreddit (Im a noob) let me know I can place it somewhere else.

382,"Alright, some big clarification is needed here. I'm an early highschool graduate who got into a very prestigious acting conservatory, and my first year, I was killing it. However, by the end of the first summer and that first year, my health started deteriorating. I'm chronically ill, and we had known this going into the school, but it hadn't seemed to effect much of my work and I was doing genuinely good, creative things there. But suddenly I started lacking the physical strength and mobility in my upper body to do basic things, like shower or take care of myself in any capacity. So, of course, like a sane human person, I took medical leave. But we're gonna add another kicker here, if you don't mind, because I do think, if only by a smidge, it's related to my rationality behind why I'm even asking this question-- my step father committed suicide that summer as well. 

So, we're close to my second year starting up, my physical capability hasn't gotten much better, and I have to ask-- is staying at this school, or even doing this major, worth it, at this point? I'm confident in my capability to work, and be persistent, and if I wasn't disabled, I'm sure I could eventually push my way into a solid career as an actor. However, that's not the reality, you know? I can't move my arms over my head, I'm not sure I'm physically up to par, nor can I pretend to be, with my colleagues. I'm not sure if the career I've been deadset on and capable of since I was 12 is... Doable, anymore? Which is frustrating, not to mention the fact that the bills for my school were under my stepfathers name, so everything would have to be transferred to loans, and I'd have to work a job at the school to have a place to live. For a career I'm not sure I can physically do anymore.

I do think I could do well in a different major, so long as it steers away from the sciences. I think advertising is a neat thinker, and it minimizes the issues with my physical capability and turns my ability to relate and speak to other chronically ill on this subject into a big benefit? 

Sorry if this is too long, or vent-y, there's just a lot of wheels turning in my head, and I'm not entirely sure which way to go. On one hand, if I stay at school, I potentially lose everything by not being physically capable of doing school and surviving a rigorous career, but on the other, if I switch to the admittedly safer option, I'm scared I lose out on an experience that I'll only get to have once, and that I'll be letting down the teachers and classmates who've told me they're inspired by my work and my potential as an artist.",05Apr2019,3
383,"I've tried lists, meditation, apps, thinking of consequences, all sorts of things but to no avail. The closer I got to a solution was in the form of a book passage I read on this matter. Basically, it said that one of the best ways to overcome procrastination is to have an experience that for being so good or so bad, prompts you to repeat it or avoid it, and so to act. I unfortunately wasn't able to find any viable experience that goes either way. I don't have anything that makes me that happy. I have things that can make me super sad, but they're too extreme for me to go with them. Some include going outside naked, run or walk for until I'm just about to collapse from exaustion and eat garbage. Idk, they really sound too horrible of experiences but maybe it's what I should do? I don't think I have the courage though. One thing is sure, I can't procrastinate anymore. I have to study no matter what and do all else I have to do.

He talks as if his opinions are facts and fails to realize that many things (i.e. music) are subjective. He's also very clingy. Near the beginning of the term, he mentioned how he wanted the entire band living together in an apartment next year. Mind you, this was after knowing him for only 3-4 weeks.

One day we were having lunch in the cafeteria and were talking about music. The night before, I had sent him a link to song that my sister made a cover of. I asked him his thoughts on it and his response was ""Oh it was too slow. I got bored and didn't listen to all of it"". I thought that was a pretty arrogant thing to say, despite not liking it. Then he started talking about how much he hates emo people and how the whole emo ""cutting yourself"" thing is stupid and ""way over the top"". As a former self-harmer, this really rubbed me the wrong way. I pretended to shrug it off and lied saying I was never into the emo culture. He responded saying he was ""glad I was never into it"". This is just one of many things that he constantly badmouths, others including atheists and Bob Dylan (he says Bob Dylan is a ""shit singer"" and mocks the way he sings).

During second semester, we didn't share any classes so I barely saw him. We're no longer friends, but I'm still pretty furious at the fact that he fucked me over for our two group assignments. I am fortunate enough to have gotten tickets to see Avengers:Endgame opening night on April 25th. Since I'm going to university and he's staying at the same college, I've cooked up a plan to get my revenge on him. Throughout the school year, he'd always ask everyone if they wanted to hang out and watch movies with him (since he has no friends). Nobody would hang out with him. I plan on texting him and making plans to watch Endgame with him after I see it opening night. Then when he's waiting at the cinema for me to show up, I will text him all the spoilers and then ghost him, leaving him stranded all alone. I think it'd be hilarious to completely ruin his experience. Not only will he be stranded alone like the loser he is, BUT, he'll also know every single spoiler LMFAO XD!!!",05Apr2019,0

While I appreciate her generosity, I also have a few concerns.  

For starters, despite her reassurances to the contrary I can't shake the idea that she has not yet saved enough for *her* retirement and my father's: as of a few years ago she had no plans to retire by 65, and when I asked outright if she was on track to retire at an acceptable age she gave a less-than-convincing ""yeah, I'll be fine"" kind of response.  (She is *not* one to express herself directly unless pressed -- and even then she will do so only reluctantly.)

Moreover, I'd like for her to have a robust rainy-day fund in place so that she may comfortably look for a new job if need be.  Her current employer, though relatively well-paying, is highly disorganized and disrespectful of boundaries, with such unreasonable workloads as to allow her less than six hours' sleep a night (very dangerous at her age).  She has called me or my father in tears several times, and at least once or twice a year tells me a story about something she had to put up with that would have pushed me to resign on the spot.  We have discussed the possibility of my helping her out financially in case such a scenario played out, and she seemed open to the idea if it were truly necessary to cover expenses.

404,"I'm a female, 27 years old.

&amp;nbsp;

In freshman year of college was the first time I started drinking and going to parties. I remember going out and having so many female friends, some really super close, others just acquaintances who I would still talk to like they were besties. I remember laughing a lot. I remember my laughs and my smiles were genuine, with or without alcohol (this is probably sounding like I needed alcohol or something - I didn't, just felt like mentioning it). Even studying with friends, going to lunch, whatever, I had no problem being social.

&amp;nbsp;

My depression was the worst it ever was when I was in late college. There was no reason for it other than being in my early 20s and wanting to be perfect and attractive and just the best. I did start getting more into weed, but so did all my other friends. I remember this is when my socializing problem started: Where I had trouble just talking to people, especially females (same sex). Talking to guys was easy because I don't know, they're guys and usually there's a sexual aspect to it. But talking to girls, even my own friends, suddenly became so difficult - I wouldn't know how to respond to simple things like ""Oh my goddd guess what happened?"" ... I'd just say ""Haha really?"" I would nod a lot. I'd look like I'm not interested probably and then girls wouldn't want to be my friends. I lost friends, actually. I think people just started to view me as really awkward. Going to parties/bars became almost like a chore, so I stopped going.

&amp;nbsp;

Today, I don't consider myself a depressed person. I'm married (almost one year now) to the love of my life and my job is kind of good. I still have like, 'background depression' like I'll never be 100% which I know is completely normal. However I still suffer extremely from that social anxiety (don't know what else to call it) that started some years ago. Like I said, I don't go to parties/any functions other than work anymore. But two weekends ago I went to my friend's birthday party at a bar, and I brought along my husband. Again, that struggle to talk to people, especially girls, was there. When I laugh, when I smile, it's forced, and I know people can innately see that. When I look at women talk to each other, they laugh soooo loud, they touch each other on the arms, they scream, they take goofy pictures. It's so natural for them. Some of them are pushing 30 and they still seem to have that confidence that I had all the way back when I was like 18. Maybe they're really good actresses, but I really feel like it's just natural for them. And when I have a couple drinks and feel buzzed, it doesn't even help, it almost makes me even more anxious. Like I'm even *more* aware of how I'm acting and looking when I have alcohol in my system, which isn't supposed to happen should it?

&amp;nbsp;

One thing worth noting is that I do smoke weed still, but only like a few times a month, usually only on some weekends. And still, a lot of these girls that are my age and went to that party I know also smoke weed, and they don't seem to have this anxiety that takes over their life, whether high or not.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know, I just wish I could be like those women. I want to have female friends again. I want to like, enter a room and just talk and laugh without thinking about it so much. I feel like that part of my brain has been damaged. I hope it's reversible.  
This summer, my best friend from across the country will be back in town for months. She's a partier, and I was thinking I'm going to try to join her when she goes to bars/clubs more often. Maybe for practice. I don't know. What are your guys' experiences with something like this?",05Apr2019,4

I went to a training camp with my team last summer for a week. I concentrated mostly on my diet and exercise. There a friend of mine and my best friend (let's call them A and B), whom I've known for a long time and is a person close to me, met two girls, let's call them C and D.   

Because of their schedules, they couldn't meet and slowly stopped talking to each other. A local amusement park had just opened in December, and they began talking again at that time, so they decided to go there as a group and here is where i intervene in the story. A went on a vacation, and I was invited by B to come with them, I went and I had a blast. At that time, B was interested in D, and C was in a relationship.  

Fast forward to January and C just broke up, B is interested in C and everyone thinks I like D and let me tell you that D is a wonderful girl but I didn't feel it. Let me tell you a little bit about B, in this kind of stuff he's not really good, he's usually akward and can't keep up a conversation, but he's a really kind and friendly person. I wanted him to ask her on a date anyway, and he agreed, but only if it was a double date. So we planned it all, it was really fun, but there was a problem, after getting to know her better, I slowly started to like C.    

I and C went on a concert recently and it seemed to me that she was also interested, wanting me to hug her all the time (she really likes hugs), holding my hand and being close to me in general. I'm really confused and I don't know what to do, I'm going to go out with C and some of her friends and my friends this weekend. Should I speak to B about it? Should i tell her how i feel? Should i move on and forget about her? I don't want to risk my friendship with B, and right now I just need someone's opinion.

This was because, when he told me about his problems (that may seem big to him) I “belittled”/ told him that his problems actually isn’t that big. 
This is in hope that he realises that his problem isn’t such a big deal and can get over it.
Besides doing that, of course I support him through and encourage him. 

He thinks that me being brutally honest will “hurt” others. But what good is there sugarcoating people?
Often, when you face a problem, if u think 5 years down the road will it still be a problem? If yes, it is indeed a big problem. If no it most likely isn’t.

His exact words: 
he doesn't need to realise his problems are small
but rather, how he will face those problems
problems seeming small are a byproduct

My question back to him: 
If a person thinks his problem is not that big it would be more manageable thus he will be more able to get it done right? 

It’s like if your Friend is crying in pain over a cut, you would be like “it’s just a cut” your wouldn’t react in “oh no should we see the doctor or call an ambulance?”

I usually try to speed up and overtake them or I just cross the street, especially if its a group.

424,"I’ve been doing art ever since I could lift a pencil, and I’ve always wanted a job with some aspect of art in it. Now as a Sophomore in high school, I’m starting to lose my passion for this subject. I used to place high in several competitions each year, but this year I’ve only placed well in one competition.

I just hate how we only do full projects and never small studies, graded sketches, technique practice, and practice with different mediums. We never get lectures or critique. Signing up for this elective is literally just signing up for art prompts instead of art help. All of our daily grades are “work ethic,” which is determined on how much you talk or be on your phone in class.

When I try to go all out for a prompt and practice new medium, perspective, and try a new art style, I get a measly 50 major grade points because I couldn’t finish it in the two weeks time we get while everybody else gets 90+ because they finished a good portion of it. I’m not saying my peers are inadequate in this subject, but they don’t try to understand movement, rhythm, color study, and several other things which are important in this field. Most of them just draw fan-art.

And I wouldn’t try so hard in the prompts if we just got practice elsewhere, but I want to improve so badly that I focus so much on the details that I don’t finish on time and end up almost failing the class each term.

431,"My boyfriend (22) and I (22) have been dating for only about three months now. We met through Bumble and I asked him to hang out on New Year's. It was very awkward for me to say the least, and for him, I think the main issue was me being introverted.
I don't exactly talk much due to social anxiety and a very likely chance that I have PTSD, but that's through self diagnosis and a lot of research. I do plan on seeing a psychiatrist for that in the near future.
Anyway, I should also mention that we live a little more than an hour apart, and he's been coming to my house every weekend since to pick me up and take to his house. We officially started dating almost two weeks later and things were alright. Then he started trying to push me to change little things about me. It didn't seem like he was doing anything wrong at first because it was small things that I should've been doing anyway (cleaning up the bathroom when I'm done, brushing my teeth more frequently, etc.) But then he starts putting more pressure on me to change my personality!
Like I said, I'm introverted and it's very hard for me to hold conversations, ask for help, and also voice my opinion, mainly because of the way I grew up.
He constantly reminds me that I need to be more confident and ambitious about my future and keeps telling me that his parents would disapprove of me if I don't change soon. I tell him he needs to let me change at my own pace, but keeps mentioning his parents or talking about how he'll be disappointed if I don't change. I feel like I can't gain any confidence when he's constantly on my ass about opening up to people and that he's deliberately refusing to understand me and my feelings. He's even gotten upset when he hears me singing in the car, tells me to sing louder, and I instantly shut down. I tell him I just can't do it if he's going to try and force me to, but he brings up confidence again.
And it's not just my personality he wants to change. He wants me to get my license asap (which I am in the process of doing, just not at his rate) move out of my parents house, read this finance guide 10 pages a day and take lots of notes on it, go to therapy, go to college (he said taking notes on the book was to prepare me for that), and move closer to him so that I won't be so far away.
I've told him numerous times that I can only focus on one thing at a time and, like always, brings up his disappointment or his parents. At this point he begins to lecture me about how he's known people in worse situations than me that pulled through and are now more than successful and follows it with ""are you telling me that you're worse than them?"" I don't even know how to respond to that, so I just let him keep talking.
Recently he's chosen to not talk to me as much as he used to and says that if I do it, so can he. I try talking to him and he gives one worded answers and laughs about it when I point it out. He says he's no longer making any plans with me and isn't going to tell me anything at all so I'll know what it feels like for him. I've told him this response is not okay and he tells me he's not doing anything wrong.
A few days ago he said he talked with his mom and she said she doesn't like me that much because I'm not confident and don't stick up for myself. All of a sudden he started shutting me out.
I have said something to my mom and she told me that he needs to compromise instead of forcing me to change overnight, and that his family has nothing to do with our relationship and that it's none of their business. She said that the way he's acting is signs of abuse and manipulation.
My boyfriend told me this morning that we're going to have a serious talk about everything.

I don't know what to do in this situation and I'd like more thoughts and opinions on the matter. The only person I've told so far is my mom.",05Apr2019,0

The reason I haven't left my job when I joined the army,  is that the army's salary is literally  250x less than any job full time job I can get. Now I have become very miserable because of the fact am always working  and am I feel like my work in the company is worthless.

In addition I want some free time so I can prepare for interviews since am planning to move abroad once I complete my service. On the other hand, am afraid of failing to get a job abroad and remaining unemployed for a long while.

I have my own youtube channel with 21k subs and a total of 4,3M views. I have one specific video that goes really well, although my views and revenue has quite dropped the last 2 months. They will monetize and use my video and give me 70% of the revenue. Ofcourse i could make more myself, but the fact is they have videos with over 65M views. Which is if you think  about it quite alot of money (i'd say approx 45K for me if i get the 70%) and my most viewed video has 3,7M views. So this video is more likely to go viral on viralhog which ofcourse means i could possibly earn more with that specific video with them. I asked about this on another subreddit but they only linked me a post about someone complaining viralhog copyright claimed them by sharing one of viralhogs licensed video on facebook, so that really wasn't helpfull to me since that has nothing to do with my situation.

# or you can fucking stop doing it.
#Imagine 
you're on a Jumbo Jet airplane and suddenly all the engines stop working, what happens next? Well .... the next thing that happens is that all these bags drop out of the ceiling and you HAVE TO PUT THEM ON, and they make you stoned within seconds so you pass out. Ever wondered why these masks exist? Why is it necessary to sedate airline passengers? 

#Consider This
 In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines fail, only one jet engine is required stay in the air! There is no explanation yet from Boeing or NASA as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating on ONE (not both) wings. Remember the movie Memphis Belle (1990)? Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn’t the plane immediately drop to one side? What about the real life examples where *ALL* engines  failed and the massive plane was able to turn 180 degrees and return safely to the ground? (Read: Miracle on the Hudson cited at the end of the OP for an example). Have to agree after the last few crashes that something mysterious is failing within these planes, right? I mean, it's not an led light that's the problem here.

#The Big Secret
 Electromagnetic technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Allied bombing raids using child pilots is the inspiration behind the book Ender's Game. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. Had the allies used normal anti gravity technology to win the war, they would have sent the Memphis Belle boys in flying saucers. The pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and we'd all be in our own saucers today. 

#The Only Reason
 to build an airplane that could never fly by aerodynamic technology alone *IS* to hid the technology from the very pilots who are winning the Allies war. Can you agree that saturated air bombing won WW2? All those houses in that movie The Pianist? 67 Cities in Japan, etc etc. This is how we won WW2. This is how NAZI Germany, North Korea, Japan &amp; Vietnam were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 *YEARS*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes since 2014). This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

Oh, wait, what's that? Allies were the 'good guys'? Victors of war never tell a lie? Holocaust wasn't a giant hoax? Save it.

FAQ: 
Q: You're an idiot.
A: that wasn't a question.

Q: Why do people like you post these everywhere and even get banned and shunned for it? 
A: Because we believe as soon as the world realizes this one thing about airplanes, we can start the healing process from 100 years of endless war. Doesn't that sound good?

Q: No seriously, WHY are you doing this?
A: If you can't tell, there is a serious epidemic of censorship destroying the internet we used to know. A big part of the problem lies in the arrogance of those privileged enough to still be on these networks.

439,"Hello, I'm a 22yo that has had some issues at school and is about to get kicked. I would like to know what could be good options to do, like working or so. Firstly, it's not in USA so some things might be different, and my major is related to Computer Science. Now, there was a problem when I was in my third semester where I was assigned a wrong grade and I didn't notice until now that it counted towards the final count of NA (failures while trying to pass a subject) and I knew I was at the limit. I exceeded it now and I accept it but I also would like to know:

* Would it be worthy to appeal to that NA to the school and see if I can stay? Or,
* Would it be better to just appeal in a general manner (sometimes the school makes exceptions) and then mention that part?

So now I'd like to know what options could be better, because I'd like to finish school but if I get kicked then I won't be able to enroll there again unless it's a different faculty. Also I'm 22 and I was about to finish, so I'm wondering, considering I did switch majors and had to begin again and my dad isn't that pleased with it:

Would it be better to tell him all this and try to work while enrolling in another major? Similar but in another school.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday, he was killed.  I learned about this yesterday and was thrown into denial and shock fairly hard.  I went through the denial quickly because I called his phone (he didn't answer), contacted people he knew (they didn't know anything at the time), and eventually went to the news for answers (where I found the exact date and time of the incident and his name identifying him in big, bold letters).  I spent most of last night in on-again, off-again tears, breathing, and trying to piece things together.  I came to the realization that I hadn't responded to his last text while he was still alive, which hurt even more.  Last night was just...difficult.

451,"Last year I had gotten LASIK eye surgery. I had issues starting right after the surgery. My eyes were burning and I couldn't even open them due to the constant stinging. My brother who had this done 5 minutes later had no issues. 

My eye sight was shit before the surgery. I wore glasses for everything. But I didn't have any issues besides just having shitty vision. I was checked before the surgery and nothing more than dry eyes was there concern.

After the surgery I began noticing streaks kind of like [this](http://imgur.com/A2Dwb6c). *For the record I do not have an astigmatism. This is just the closest picture I could find to relate to what I'm seeing.*

I was told that this wasn't out of the ordinary and that it could take up to a year for it to get back to normal.

Well my year was up in December 2018 and my vision remains the same. 

I had an appointment yesterday with the same people who did the initial surgery. The doctor told me my vision was like 20/12 and that the reason I am having this issue is because before I had glasses to correct the slight difference in my eyes and now I don't. 

So he recommended that I use lubricating drops more regularly and....

They wrote me a prescription for eye glasses! 

I was told that the glasses would help correct the issue I was having. Isn't that why I had the surgery in the first place? 

Am I wrong or is that not how this is supposed to work? 

I have never had an issue with my eyes before the surgery, other than being blind. Had no streak marks, no astigmatisms, nothing. Bad vision was the only issue I had. 

Basically I'm looking for advice. Should I maybe go see another eye doctor or specialist? Has anyone else had a similar experience? 

I'm open to listen to any and all advice. The way my eye sight is right now is infuriating and I can't stand seeing like this the rest of my life.

The whole problem is with their Grandma on their biological dads side. Their Dad had a rough childhood. This woman was his foster mom on and off for years before she officially adopted him as an adult. She’s a good woman deep down, I think. But we have a history. My ex was really abusive. It’s the only abusive relationship I’ve ever been in my life.  I was 22 and it lasted 4 years with two little kids in the mix. I hid the abuse from everyone- but her! She was the one that I was calling to come pick him up and get him  after he’d beat the shit out of me. She saw me! She saw the destroyed apartment! I’d cry to her and tell her everything....and she’d always defend him. Always tell me that it “takes two to fight”, that I know his hard childhood and need to feel sorry for him, always say to give him another chance. Looking back- fuck her! Who would tell a woman in my situation that! No Grandma, it doesn’t take “two to fight” when there’s only one person hitting and spitting and choking and throwing and dragging. That’s all one sided. I took the kids and moved out of state to start completely over. I knew if I didn’t have legit distance between us, we’d keep getting back together over and over again like we always did. He didn’t even care. Not about taking the kids, nothing. A year goes by and I meet my husband. He’s the love of my life and the greatest man on earth. A while goes by and we get engaged. Their father calls outta the blue and proposes to me. Omg! I wish we had FaceTime back then so he coulda seen me laugh in his face and not just heard it. Grandma calls the next day. She’s asking about my husband and why I wouldn’t give her son another chance. Telling me to postpone my engagement! I tell Grandma where to go. We get married. Life is great.

Sounds like they had a fun time. Everything went smoothly. A month later I’m at home with the kids and there’s a knock on the door. It’s the CPS and a policewoman. I’m shocked!

Interviewed both my oldest kids, took a tour of the house, interviewed me and then had to call my husband at work and ask him to come talk. Can you imagine! It was horrible all the way around. Everything was unfounded and case closed. I asked who reported it and they couldn’t tell me but she goes “you got anyone who’s angry with you and your husband?” My ex and his Mom! I call my ex immediately and I’m furious. He’s genuinely surprised and then he goes “ohh I told my Mom not to do it.” Their story is that my 3 year old was talking about something and they couldn’t really understand him and his Mom maybe jumped to conclusions but it was coming from a good place and with concern. Nope. Didn’t believe it. I asked them why did they not freaking tell me if they thought my 3 year old was getting molested! They were concerned but waited a month to report it and then never warned me so I could get the kids and leave? “You wouldn’t have left” Bullshit, I left you! I got no problem leaving men that I think I love if it’s not good for my children. I had had it at that point. I cut Grandma off. They kids could see and talk to their Dad all they want- but they ain’t going back to that state to see Grandma until both the kids are old enough to have conversations and not be misunderstood. I didn’t let them go back and visit Grandma until they were 7&amp;5. Since then, they see her every summer. But their Dad is complaining that I need to let Grandma call the house. That she wants to talk to the kids through out the year. I haven’t answered a call from Grandma in 9 years. I don’t want anything to do with her. I resent her for supporting an abusive relationship and defending his disgusting behavior and I despise her for trying to ruin the family I made with my husband. I put her Christmas presents under tree like all the others, I don’t deny the kids seeing her in the summer- do I owe this woman phone calls?",05Apr2019,1
454,"Hello! I need some advice on which job I should take..

Backstory: My husband is the main provider for our family. We do keep our income and other finances separate (it’s what works for us) so the income I earn is used for smaller bills (electric, internet, etc. ) and my own personal spending money. As a family, we do not NEED more money. I’d like more money because 1 who doesn’t? and 2 I could begin a savings plan for myself and start paying off my own debts (like school). I’ve been a stay at home mom for the past 3 years with our son with the exception of a small part time job (usually less than 20 hours a week and only working 4 hour shifts). 


Job 1: I’ve recently been unofficially (pending background check) offered a position as shift supervisor at Starbucks. I’ve worked there prior to having my son and I loved the job tbh. I’m currently in school for Business Management, set to graduate this summer and this could be my first stepping stone to ASM and then SM. The pay isn’t great but it’s more money than I’m currently bringing in by a long shot. 

Job 2: Cleaning rental houses for a family friend of my parents. The pay will fluctuate depending on how many rentals are booked in any given month. I will also stay at my current 20 hours or less job so I’ll be making just as much money most months but won’t have to work as many hours. 

The dilemma: As I said, I’m a stay at home mom. Other than a few short shifts every week, I’m home with him all the time and am finding it hard imagining leaving him for more than a few hours. This goes for my husband too. I see him A LOT. He’s a fire medic and works 24 hours on, 48 hours off. So other than those 24 hour shifts, and my 4 hour shifts, we’re together as a family. Taking job 1 I will see them significantly less but could be a great career move for me in the long run. 

So.. any advice?

TLDR; should I take job 1 where I’ll see my family less but could potentially be a great career move or should I take job 2 where there’s no room for growth but I’ll see my family a lot and make the same amount of money as job 1?

Thanks!",05Apr2019,1

Recently I have done some stupid things such as getting drunk every now and then and slacking in school (which I am now trying to improve on). They see this as a sign of immaturity, and as a result I believe that they are trying to take this money away from me.

Are they trying to take my money permanently?

472,"(Throwaway account)

I have a really bad case of swamp ass. When I sit down for about \~40 minutes, I get really smelly. The rest of my body sweats at a completely normal rate, it's just my arse being an oddity. I already shower daily, and I've spent hundreds on deodorants, antiperspirants, body powders, soaps, and even thick underwear and diapers for adults, but NOTHING has worked. Not a single thing. 

The worst part is that people assume I don't shower and judge me for that even though I shower for nearly an hour on some days. Here's some info that could help:

* Age: 20 (this started when I was 13)
* Gender: male

I've visited my doctor multiple times and tried everything he suggested but nothing worked (or even decreased the problem). I've also visited a dermatologist and tried electro therapies amongst other things but again, nothing worked and she couldn't figure out the cause. I've also gone online and tried every single thing I could find on the first few pages of google search results but it feels like a hopeless fight right now. My passion has always been developing software, but honestly I don't think I can go through like this. It's ruined my highschool, college, and work experience. I just want to live like a normal person and be fresh instead of having to avoid people all day. This has caused some other issues as well. I've avoided people so much and talked so little that I can barely speak my native language verbally. Is there anyone who knows what it could be or am I just out of luck in life? Here's some of the symptoms:

* It happens when I sit at work or at school. I rarely ever notice it at home.
* Even after a fresh shower and with brand-new clothes, it happens within about fourty minutes.
* When I stand up, the bad smell fades over 20 minutes, so it only happens when I sit or lay.
* It's extremely hard to locate the exact origin of the smell, but I think it's my crack and not the buttcheeks.

474,"Hey guys! First time poster, long time reader. So I [24 soon to be 25] went on a small trip to see some friends and just hang out. There was a lot of good, but also a lot of bad and frustration (not only on my part). During this trip, I got something of a crush on my friends' friend, which is a whole different can of worms, that I will more than likely bring up in a different post. Part of my trip included 8 hours to and from a locale, which was only accompanied by me, myself and I, which allowed for a lot of outward singing, but also self-reflection. 

I get really anxious sometimes, and my mind starts to wander. Even before this trip, I've been making an effort to improve myself (volunteering for a local sports team, reading more books [1984 is great, by the way!], experimenting with different music, going to the gym, taking steps to get my boating and motorcycle license, and overall just trying to be more positive and supportive, etc.), but now that there's a girl I want to woo, I have a bit more at stake than just doing it for my own well being. We have another group trip planned in a little over a year to Germany, and I want to really be able to turn heads, even amongst my friends. 

Y'know those people you just inherently want to be around? Like, their confidence and suave just makes them super likeable and you just want to learn more about this person? You want that person on your team. That's what I want. Clearly my friends like me for me, but I want to grow into that type of person while maintaining my identity.

So in saying all of that, what were some things that you did that your friends or SO noticed, in a positive way? Or rather, the people you admire, what traits and why? What hobbies do they do, or experiences they have that makes you interested?

TL;DR: How are you becoming a person people admire? What is super interesting that you see in other people?

487,"Okay, so long story short, my(22f) boyfriends(27m) ex(24f) will not stop trying to contact him. He and I have been together for over a year and a half, and have known eachother for 5 years. Our story in itself is a long one, so I wont go there. But, his ex won't stop contacting him. It's not constant, but everytime I start to relax about her, she finds a way to pop up again. She will email him, text,and relay messages through my boyfriends sister. She'll email him saying she has news about the cats just to get him to unblock her number, then two texts in she will start admitting her feelings and beg for him back, or she'll ask prying questions about our relationship. On valentines day she emailed him this long thing about him being her only love and such. I'm getting really sick of it, and he ""doesn't know"" what to say to her so he just ignores it. This girl has gone as far as calling my work and making false compaints to try and get to me.  Before I blocked her on facebook we've have some conversations a while back and she gets NASTY and has said some unbelievable things to me and about me. I've let it go for a long time but I'm at my breaking point. I've heard through him that she has high anxiety and she's constantly worried about getting jumped. Well, that's not what I want to do.... but I want to make a point. I'm really temped to to go the pub she bar tends at tonight, just go have a drink and be civil to make a point that I'm not scared of her. I might even call someone and talk about how great my boyfriend and I are, or make sure my phone background of us is visible. Just to make a point. Maybe it's petty or imature, but my chest is getting puffed up here. Even if everything is civil, part of me just wants to face her for myself. For what reason, I don't know, but my desire to do this is deep. 

Should I follow through? Or just leave it alone and tell my boyfriend to be clearer with her?

Thanks in advance for the advice... ",05Apr2019,1
488,"My boyfriend of 5 years has been texting this girl from his class and I found out that he has been deleting those messages, lying that he hasn’t spoken to her in a long time when I confronted him about it. Am I wrong for being upset? Especially when that girl has a boyfriend but she has been sleeping with almost every guy in class?

Ps: I’m mostly upset about him lying to my face. Not about him texting other girls bc I’m not controlling. He knows how much I hate people lying to me and her he still does it. Especially when she’s the reason.

Yes, I’m also insecure because 
1) she’s very flirtatious and very good with her words, like lying and making guys fall for her etc. She has openly flirted with my bf.

2) as I mentioned she had sex with almost every guy in her class (except my bf. I hope) and 80% of those guys have a girlfriend. So as you can see, the people around him obviously have no problems with cheating and even enjoy it so I’m afraid that it’ll negatively affect my bf. 

This seems like a childish thing but I’m rlly at loss. Me and my bf is 21 and she’s 23 this year. ",05Apr2019,1
489,"Hey everyone, I (M21) just had what was probably the worst sex in my life with someone I really like. It’s entirely my fault too. To start, I lost my virginity at 15, and have never had this problem before. We’re getting into it, but I couldn’t stay hard, at all. We tried 3 times until finally it worked long enough (lol). I’ve had a couple problems with sex in the past (it’s extremely hard to cum from anything that doesn’t involve me masturbating), but this is the first time I actually couldn’t stay hard. The girl seemed okay, but I feel incredibly ashamed and uncomfortable with the whole situation. I was a little nervous during it, as it’s been awhile, but nothing insanely overwhelming. I’m just wondering from some of the more experienced people out there what their opinion is on this, and if there’s anything I can do to help the situation. Thanks in advance.",05Apr2019,2
490,"So, I’m Hispanic. I’ve never really labeled myself as a POC. Like, yes, I’ve experienced a little bit of racism and had some shitty comments thrown my way, but nothing major that really ruined my day. I kinda just view myself as an average joe- no labels, which might be naive or ignorant of me, idk. I have a friend (who is white, if that makes any difference) that is very active in promoting POC rights, always going on marathons or protesting or donating money to organizations supporting POC communities, etc. I think it’s great and if I had more money/free time, I’d definitely love to join her in some of these activities. But I’m a heavily pregnant stay at home mom of two boys( 1 and 4). The money/time just isn’t there. However, she’s been very upset that I’m not playing a more active role in the community. She keeps likening my experiences to more extreme ones, including me specifically in talks of oppression and terrible acts of racism and how I am a non black POC. But, I personally haven’t faced anything terrible because of the color of my skin. I haven’t felt oppressed or dealt with a major act of racism thrown my way. Yes, I’ve dealt with a few ignorant people being crappy, but no matter how much I explain that she can’t compare that to something more extreme, it just doesn’t seem to get through to her. I do my best to raise awareness in any way I can, even if it’s just sharing go fund me’s/articles/donating what I can. It’s slowly turning into that being the only thing we talk about and it’s making me more and more uncomfortable. I don’t want to end the friendship, but I’ve never had anyone make such a big deal about my skin color,which is really ironic. I’ve expressed this to her several times, but she gets offended that other people’s shiftiness “doesn’t bother me much” but her “encouragement” does. I’m tired of hearing how I’m not acting enough like a poc. How should I go about salvaging this friendship? Or is it a lost cause? I don’t have many friends, so I’m hesitant to end the friendship, but it’s starting to really affect me and how I view myself as a person. ",05Apr2019,1
491,"When I was 16, I started a job as a lifeguard. Most of my co-workers were my own age, but there was an older guy there (early 40’s) who was a lifeguard part time. Him and I clicked pretty well simply due to common interests and working the same shift. He even had kids my age who I went to high school with and became friends with as well. I only worked the job for about 2 years, and then after graduating high school I joined the military. Even after being gone for months/years at a time, I would always keep in touch with my old co-worker and even make a point to go visit him at least once while I was home on leave. 

Fast forward to today, I’m 24 years old. I saw him last October when I was home for a wedding and it was nice catching up. I’ve noticed as of late he’s been posting a lot of political based content on Facebook lately. I’ve never been into posting my political opinions on social media, but to each his own. Others doing it doesn’t really bother me. This plays a role in the story.

I live near Washington D.C., and back in January my cousin had come to visit me for a weekend. It just so happens that as we’re exploring the monuments in D.C., we see and hear a large gathering of shouting people near the Lincoln Memorial. It turns out later that what we had stumbled upon was the whole Nick Sandmann incident at the Lincoln Memorial back in January. Once the news articles started breaking, I posted on Facebook and tagged my cousin with the caption, “This is the commotion we saw this afternoon!”

A couple day later, my old co-worker commented on it, talking about how it was fake news, biased liberal media, etc. He then proceeded to delete me off Facebook. I never responded to his comments because, like I said, I don’t like to engage like that on social media. I was really just baffled by the fact he in essence delete our friendship over a post that I was simply trying to show my cousin that we were literally there during the protest which was a HUGE news story at the time. It all seemed so childish and juvenile to me.

Fast forward to today, he just added me again on Facebook. His request is just sitting in my inbox at the moment. Anyone have any advice/opinions on this scenario? I’m I right I’m feeling hesitant? I feel like true colors have been shown at this point.",05Apr2019,11

My parents are financially stable and I am blessed to not have to worry about money but I cannot afford things I do not absolutely need and I cannot afford luxuries. Living with rich roommates has been difficult to relate. 

For grad, all my roommates were gifted graduation trips to Europe or Asia. Huge LONG trips that I have dreamed about my entire life. My parents cannot afford that neither can I.

493,"\*Background\* In May I'm due to start a job and I'm still going through the background process. I Haven't been hearing back from the person who is supposed to be overseeing that process and I'm getting nervous about being completed by April 15th (personal deadline, I'm supposed to do some traveling and I'd like to have it all sorted out by then). I am supposed to do a drug screening that I will be given 48 hours notice for, so I can't really go too far from home if I will have to run right back to get that taken care of. There is also some security clearance or online portal account that needs to be setup and I have no idea how that's going.

Fingerprints are a required part of the background check process. I had those sent in in early March. Around that time I also sent an email about the security / portal account and got no reply. A week later I got a call from the person saying they would have that portion ready once they did my fingerprinting and they were cleared. I sent an email asking if I would be able to get the drug test anywhere or if I had to be at my current home address to receive specific forms for the drug testing, and that I could plan my days accordingly and be sure not to miss anything. No reply. About two weeks later I got another form for additional fingerprints to be sent in. I got those done the next day and sent a follow-up email to make sure that there wasn't an issue with the forms this time (I had to use local print cards and not the ones for the state the job was in, I know there won't be an issue with the background check itself). No reply. I sent another follow-up this Wednesday, but I still have not heard back. 

Is it appropriate at this point to call in and ask for an update about the process? Apart from my own personal scheduling, I'd like to know that they haven't just decided to go with someone else and ghost me, I somehow failed my fingerprints, and all the other scenarios my brain can come up with. I just don't want to seem unprofessional and impatient, this job means a lot to me. Advice?",05Apr2019,1

So I was texting one of the main managers, and he told me to stop by the place to meet another manager. Anyway, I went there and the other manager didn’t even know who I was, but once I told him the person I was texting - turns out I was texting HIS manager. So I filled out an app and got a ‘tour’

And I met the other employees (all girls/ cocktail girls) all of whom stared me up and down and joked in Spanish which I don’t understand (I’m not even Spanish/ Hispanic or Latin at all, the total ‘opposite’), and barely talked to me or even looked at me (after the initial up and down). After that I awkwardly left and only one just grinned at me as I left, no one said bye.

The manager I talked to, didn’t seem too thrilled and never texted me back after I left (I asked him a couple things that were time sensitive).

Should I even bother getting my certificate to handle food + alcohol?! And going for it?

502,"Hello reddit! So my girlfriend has a very tricky problem. She and her mom live together with their two dogs, with the dog in question being... let's call her Pitty. Even though they raised and trained the dogs together, recently Pitty has been getting far more attached to my girlfriend than her mom. Its problematic because from what I've heard, Pitty doesn't really listen to her mom anymore and seems to run away from her when she tries to pet her. This is also strange because neither of them have ever hurt or abused the dogs in any way. In fact, they both pamper them in a life of luxury. The mom is starting to get pretty sick of this and told my girlfriend that if Pitty does not  improve, then they have to get rid of her. My girlfriend has been considering moving out because of this with Pitty. I don't really want that to happen because it could possibly put a strain on their very close relationship and my girlfriend is DEFINITELY not going to let Pitty go.

503,"So here's a little bit of background: I have a desk job at a company that never pays for over time. The only compensation the employees get is a $10 meal allowance that can only be claimed when we work more than 13 hours per day and we actually need to buy the meal in advance to claim it. The process is so complex that most of us do not even bother claiming it at all. I usually work more than 60hours per week during peak seasons as the work volume is crazily high. Getting no over time compensation is really frustrating. 

Usually after finishing my own tasks, I will do the team's shared tasks and then help out others to clear their own individual tasks. In the past, I wouldn't mind staying late to help them. However lately with the peak season has gone now, I can see that certain coworkers of mine are deliberately working slower to clear their tasks and expect people like me to help out. That is why now, I will only offer my help to others when I finish my task early and not willing to work over time when it is not the peak seasons. What's worse is that with the quarterly performance review coming up, some are purposely staying late to give our boss the impression that they are hardworking. 

What my manager sees though, is how I leave on time or earlier than the rest of the team members. As she is overlooking seveal other teams, she doesn't even try to understand what is going on with the team I'm in. She sees me leaving first for a few times, then immediately assumed that I was slacking off and not helping others. One time, she even asked me that ""Spongiebobb, how can you leave when your team members are still here? You can see them suffering!""

I have explained to her that I have finished my own tasks, cleared off the team's shared tasks and even helped out some of the team members. But she still assumed that I did not help out. What more does she expect? I don't get paid while working overtime and I obviously have done what I was supposed to do and more. Just because I'm leaving on time doesn't mean that I am lazy and a bad employee!

505,"Yesterday I made a post on r/relationships saying that I wanted to leave my husband of 8 years (13 years together with 3 young kids) because I found out he had slept with prostitutes while in the military...BEFORE we met!  I asked if I was crazy for thinking that.  I got 5 responses and instantly snapped out of it.  I was being completely crazy!!!  So thank you for that, Redditors!  I deleted the post because I’m pretty sensitive and didn’t want to see more people say I was acting stupid.  Even though...I was acting stupid.

I have to chalk it up to the fact that since I found out a week ago, I haven’t been sleeping much. No more than an hour or two at night.  So, I finally bought some sleep aids and slept for about 5 hours last night and I feel much better. However, my first waking thought was my husband with prostitutes!  I’m trying to focus on other things, but it keeps creeping back.  I fear I’m obsessing at this point.

Had this been like 20 one-night-stands...I wouldn’t feel like this way because I know he’s had those.  It’s the fact that he paid for it and this was all done abroad where the likelihood of those girls being abused greatly increases (I’m assuming??). I’m not saying he mistreated them, but I just worry that some of those girls were forced into that line of work.  It makes me so sad.  I also just plain associate Johns with being creeps.  

I know I was trying to control and guilt him due to my own insecurities.  I think am just ruminating about it because it’s in the past and nothing can change it.

So now, Reddit,  has anyone experienced this?  Probably not, because it’s dumb, but I want to know if it will pass or if I need therapy.

Oh, and for the record, we have had some major ups and downs in the past, but we’ve been faithful to each other since we got married and he’s a wonderful father.

He is a great guy and I really started to like him (we are not really ""friends"" but you know what I mean). Anyway I also got a long with a surf teacher that was employed by my country-man. both great dudes, love'em. I wanted to come back in the second year but my man had to close the camp for two years because he couldn't rent the house anymore. I started to built a camp-house which will take two years.

513,This is sort of a long story but I hate my boyfriends best friend. I usually get along with everybody and give everyone the benefit of the doubt but I just couldn’t let this one slide. My boyfriend and his best friend have been friends for only about 2 years but are still pretty close. My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and four months. I have never tried to tell him who he could and could not hang out with and I still don’t. I figured that if they’re his friends since I trust him then I will trust them. Me and his best friend had a really good start and even we’re friends up till about 3 months ago. We would always hang out as a group (my boyfriend and I and his best friend and his girlfriend). His friend was always very respectful and nice and fun until he started dating his new girlfriend they’ve been together for about 5 months now. Well 3 months ago my roommate and I (were 21 and in college) decided that we wanted to try weed. She had smoked it before but I hadn’t and only wanted to try it once to see what all the hype was about and add another college experience to the books. Well considering my boyfriends best friend used to smoke all the time his freshman and sophomore year of college we decided to go to him. I had already talked to my boyfriend about it and he said he wasn’t a fan but basically I could do what I want as long as it was safe and we weren’t like being stupid about it. So his best friend was like yeah sure that’s fine! I’ll get it and you can just do it at my place since you guys live in an apartment. But all the sudden he started to be so controlling over everything about it. Like the exact spot we would do it the exact time on the exact day and who exactly would be there and then we had “rules” such as certain ways we would act while on it. I’ve never smoked before still so I don’t know if you can even control it or not. But he was being so controlling to the point where we were like no it’s fine we’ll just take it and pay you for it and leave. Nothing was done over text so there was no way that we could have snitched on him if we got caught. But he lost it. The night before we said that we would take it was the night that I went over there with my boyfriend and I told him that we couldn’t do it tonight because my roommate had a huge test to study for and he was pissed then. So when we texted him the next day still thinking everything was fine but he was being so controlling so we asked him if we could just take it he lost it. He was going off about how he was being nice about us doing it there and he couldn’t believe how stupid we were to try and take it do something else. He then screenshotted our conversation deleting the part of him calling us stupid and sent it to my boyfriend which he responded they can do what they want they’re grown dude just let them have it it’s fine. Then my boyfriend messaged me just to ask what had happened and why he was so mad which we were like we don’t know. I then asked his friend why he sent it to my boyfriend which he responded “Because it’s your boyfriends decision on what you do. He needs to decide and he agreed that you guys were being fucking idiots. I swear you women don’t think. I’m trying to be so nice by telling you that you can do it here but you guys are just fucking it up.” I then got very mad and told him that no one owned me but me. I felt so disrespected and blown away. So I went off on him and told him that my boyfriend did not own me and that I can make my own decisions for myself and told him how much of a dick he was being for no reason. And that my boyfriend actually said that it was fine. He then texted my boyfriend saying “I don’t really care if they get arrested I just don’t want it on my conscience. And I know that you were kind of weird about them driving with it so I told them no that it was your decision.” So basically saying that he didn’t care about us that he only cared about himself and how my boyfriend saw him. And we haven’t spoken since . My boyfriend went off on him about being so rude and about how I’m my own person but they have made up since then. And he still talks to him and hangs out with him like nothing happened which is fine I told him that I respect that decision but I will no longer talk to him. I know it’s important to my boyfriend though that we are friends. Should I reach out and forgive him for it? We did have a great friendship before it but I felt like that showed his true colors especially since after the fact any time he’s “asked about me” it has been him asking if him and my boyfriend are okay because he knew we were a “package deal”. I just hate that it fell apart the way that it did but I don’t know what to do and he hasn’t even talked to my boyfriend about reaching out and has not tried in any way to make amends as he still thinks that he was in the right.

I'll try to keep this short.

I have good grades and I'm generally doing well in school, and last time I checked, if it wasn't for my B in Geoemetry, I'd have a weighted GPA of 4.25... I think. Haven't checked in a while, but I'm proud of it.

And I'm proud of, say, when someone has, like, a computer issue and I help them fix it. 

But, I also seem to lack a lot of common sense. I'll always find myself in situations where I can't seem to figure out how to do something, and when I finally figure it out (usually from the help of friends/family), I feel like a complete idiot for not understanding an obvious solution.

I was sheltered pretty much my whole life, and have ADD/ADHD, but I'm not gonna blame it on either of those. 

Other times, my friends will need help, and even if it's simple things, I sometimes just can't figure it out.

517,"So this is my first time posting on here, i apologize if it’s lengthy. 
A bit of backstory: my parents have always been very supportive of me and I truly do know they love me as they Are my parents. My dad grew up in a household with a mother who has borderline personality, and my mom grew up in a household with extremely strict parents. 
Now for me- my whole life i’ve struggled with depression. My parents have always taken care of me and supported me, my mom has struggled with it too so she’s very understanding with me. More recently it has not been this way. I started school last September and they are paying for my school. I’ve become extremely depressed here and have no direction with my life. it’s made me realize that i don’t know what i want to do. Every time i bring up the idea to my parents of maybe transferring (which they like) or taking a year off / doing online(which they don’t like) for the sake of my mental health, they get extremely defensive. They both come from extensive educational backgrounds and said they would disown me if i even consider not going to school next year. They have aided me Too much in this process and have done everything as far as applications to accessing all of my accounts to make sure i WILL be in school. of course, i do appreciate this but it’s gotten to the point where they don’t even let me have a choice in the matter or even let me take care of it on my own. i am the oldest, i have a younger sister and they won’t let me make my own decisions for myself. 

 Just today, they yelled at me and said i’m completely 
incompetent and can’t do anything on my own. They freaked out when i told them it’s because they never give me a chance to. I’m not incompetent, I do a lot of these things on my own but they just can’t fathom the idea of letting me make my own decision. 

I feel so incredibly trapped. I always have with them. They say one thing but they mean another. They make all of my decisions for me even if I tell them how it makes me feel. I feel like i have no control over my life, i’ve been more depressed than ever because of them. I don’t want to seem ungrateful as they are paying for my school but I need to take care of my mental health. 
I am planning on working 2 or 3 jobs in the next few months to save up enough money to live in my own place. This would just be a start. I want to have a good relationship with them but sometimes they just drain me too much. I know this is probably just a part of growing up and developing a future relationship with them but right now it almost doesn’t seem worth it. They just shut me down and care more about my education than my mental state. 

What else should I do? I’ve tried being honest with them which only leads to more arguments. Right now my best bet seems to be getting my own place and releasing all of those connections they have to me in order to be an independent functioning adult. Anybody else that’s dealt with this- what else should I be doing? ",05Apr2019,1

She thinks people are criticizing her, or targeting her when they're not. Or, in a minor conflict she'll think that she is being yelled at, when in reality she's not. She gets very panicked and she thinks people (sometimes me) are angry when they are actually just explaining a small mistake, or correcting her on something. When we get farther away from the moment, she is able to see that she is really very hard on herself, and doesn't want to be a bad person.  

Some background; she was in a multi-year relationship before me where she was physically abused and without giving away too many details, may have suffered some form of sexual abuse from her parents. She's been in therapy, I never pry about what she discusses with her therapist, but I would really like to know what I can do to help this sweet, caring girl out.

Lets call the gaming friend Alex and The other one Lacy. Alex and I had a small group of gaming friends that we regularly played with. She was very much the leader of the group and others would come out to play when she showed up. 

One day we were playing without Alex. I said something mean about one of our other friends (Later admitted by them to be true but not at the time) one of them rushed off to tell Alex who cut off all ties with me. So during that time Lacy was a great emotional support for me.

This should be the end of it but its not. Several months go by and Alex comes to check on me. She heard the others never invited me to game and was worried I'd be lonely. So we became friends again.

Fast forward another several months and Lacy just....stops talking to me. Cold turkey and with no explanation. My last ever message was about me not wanting to pester her too much.

In the ensuing months Alex has encouraged me to let go of her. How does one do that? She was an amazing friend and helped me when I needed her most. Now I'm hurt and three months later I still miss her.

She was very much, ‘how could you do this to the family’, and then my dad got involved, ‘how could you put your mother through this’. I said I was really really sorry and it was just a phase etc.
She said it was for the best if I got help and stopped and moved away. So I did that.

I can’t tell my wife, obviously.

Recently I feel like he's started to resent me a lot. I don't know why, but the vibe I get is that he seems to think I'm better than him and the rest of our friends, or look down on them or something. I haven't talked to him about this because honestly how would that conversation even go?


He's made half-joking comments about how I look down on everyone else. When I bailed on a plan to go somewhere with him and said I had plans with someone else (which I did), he basically called me a serial liar. I mean the guy clearly has a less than stellar opinion of me. 


Normally I'd just remove myself from the equation - stop talking, messaging, hanging out and whatnot. The issue is I agreed to be a part of his group for our final year project next year. I am having second thoughts about committing to a year long, high stress project with someone who clearly dislikes me. 


Should I find a different group? If yes, how should I break the news to him? Would it be the right thing to do? Wouldn't this make me resent me even more? Would it make things even more awkward going forward? 


Also, he's been depressed for a while now. I've always tried to listen to him and help him vent, and have encouraged him to go to a therapist. Hasn't done much good. I'm afraid if I leave the group, I'll just exacerbate his mental health issues.

531,"I've spent approx. 30-33.3% of my Vegas trip either running to casino bathrooms, or camping out in my hotel bathroom. Is there any way I can make a case/argument against the buffet system at my casino, on the grounds that the food is intentionally supposed to make you sick, so you won't be able/inclined to leave?

Details: I got off the plane and caught a cab to take me to my hotel. I had a couple drinks, walked around the casino, went to bed. Nice, realxing night.

Day two wasn't as fun. I woke up starving, clutching my gut and rolling around on the bed for at least one whole hour before I got up. I needed to eat, and I needed to eat BAD. I almost shattered my teeth from clenching them (I do this when I get hunger pangs). Anyhow, I got up and put on some clothes - went out to seek the closest restaurant or buffet. To my luck, most of these casino hotels come equipped with a rotating buffet. I decided to go get me some brunch, especially after seeing an advertisement of an Asian-American fella looking at an extremely diverse plate of food with wild eyes and fork + knife in hand. Well, I want to be like this guy. I want to be the one who looks down at an extremely diverse plate of delicious food. It should be me. I should be that Asian-American luckboy. 

I got in line, paid the $35 all-you-can-eat-bruncheon fee. Once the transaction was settled, I quickly pushed past two middle aged PAWGs and ran as fast as I could towards the clean plates. Oh lord, the selection was so amazing. I nearly cried while browsing the bruncheon buffet. I don't know if it was the lighting, music, crippling hunger pangs or the subliminal messages transported to my cerebral cortex via the lucky buffet boy advert - but I couldn't stop eating. I ate 4 full plates (plus dessert) consisting of the following:

Tri-tip, Beef Brisket, Bacon, Scrambled Eggs, Lobster Benedict, Ghost Pepper Cheddar, Biscuits and Gravy, Potatoes O'Brien, Fried fish, six fried Twinkies, Pork Kielbasa, Sausage and egg taquitos, soft serve chocolate ice cream with hot fudge, chocolate chips, and fudge laced brownie, oh - and half a hush puppy.

I sobbed loudly with tears of joy, nearly choking on my food the whole time. I had to keep filling my cup full of chocolate milk, just to lubricate my throat so the food would slide down and not get stuck. I was there nearly 34 minutes and 55 seconds before I decided to leave. I did it! I was the lucky buffet boy! It was now time to visit all the wonderful Vegas strip locations of my dreams. I was just about to exit the casino floor, when I felt this incredible sensation. There was so much pain and pressure. I immediately grabbed my stomach and doubled over. I groaned loudly and felt the beads of sweat form on my buttcheeks. I turned around and ran for the nearest bathroom. My stomach was making noises that sounded like a demons voice. 

I was barely able to kick in the stall door and do a backwards hop onto the filthy casino toilet. I didn't have time to wipe the urine off the lid. I clenched my teeth, folded in half while my whole stomach began vibrating and deflating. Viscous brown froth shot out into the toilet at such an alarming and incredible rate. The splashback painted both of my buttcheeks in frothy muck. Oh god, I've never had such a scummy dumper. It was all liquid for the first full minute. I ended up having to flush when I felt the water level rise up and touch my gonads. I ended up filling another full bowl, my sides now cramping. I was moaning so loud and hard that I made my own ears ring from the echos off the tile bathroom floor/walls. Two minutes in, finally the solid logs started shooting out - one after another. The aftermath was horrible after nearly ten minutes of post-defecation hyperventilating. The splashback was all up my back, and my thighs were coated in a wet, stinky film.

This happened to me three times. I lost approximately a third of my time in Vegas having to be in or near a bathroom. I got ripped off, and Im just wondering see if I’m in the right against the buffet system - as it trapped me inside the casino and ruined my vacation.

For context: I'm in NC

So I have been trying to sell a bed frame on Craigslist. I think the high price of the item has attracted a lot of attention from scammers (selling it for $500).

I had a person contact me and go through the whole thing about ""I'm interested, blah blah blah"". I told them I would not take a personal check, but they wanted to pay with a cashier's check. I accepted (thinking they are safer than personal checks). They said they were sending some extra for me to give their movers. I was sceptical but said ok (I want this bed frame out of my small apartment) and they sent the check via USPS. During the time I was waiting for the check in the mail, they changed their phone number from an Arizona to a California area code and texted me saying they'd gotten a new phone and number.
Once I got the check, I saw the amount was almost $2k! I realized this was definitely fishy, so I cashed the check, but held onto all of the cash. Once I told them I had the money, they started pushing me to buy Amazon gift cards asap and saying they wanted to get the bed that very day. Mind you, they hadn't been so rushed about it before I told them I had the cash.
I knew for sure that they were trying to scam me and told them via text that I will be holding the money for 2 weeks to make sure the check clears before I release anything to him or his movers. I also called my bank to tell them what happened. The fraud department opened a case for me, I gave them all the info, and the only issue I had was having to pay $12.50 for a bad check (it ""bounced"" a couple of days after cashing it). The scammer also tried to send me a SECOND check for the same amount from the same bank and everything, but this check looked super fake (I mean ffs it was on some regular looking printer paper).

Losing $12.50 is trivial when considering the fact that it could've been much worse, but I'm sure they've gotten what they wanted from other people. So my question is, what can I do next to make them pay for being so awful? 
I have the 2 phone numbers and an (Arizona) address they sent the check from. I also still have the second check they've sent me. Can I contact some authorities in the area the check came from? Should I contact my local authorities? Is there anything the police or someone else can do? I mean, they are committing fraud after all, just across state lines. I would like to see them put in jail.

536,"  

This is my story, I am a girl (24 years old), a medicine student, a very good student with a very good grades for my entire life. 

I recently understand that my parents were abusive, I grow up without friends, I had just a brother, my parents were so strict that I can't even imagine to disobey, I have always done what they asked me to do, I quit my hobbies and give up on my talents for them. When I started university I felt like a baby among my new classmates, I felt the desire to grow up, stop being a child forced at home and I wanted to build a real life, I did this, I have found many friends, I started a relationship (my first in my entire life!) but I keep going study. 

Since I get this boyfriend my mother became more and more paranoic, she always go crazy if I go back home late, she was constantly fearing that me and my bf could have sex. My father instead became more and more absent, like I was nothing to him, my brother become more and more psychotic. 

Everything become so hard, they do not approve things like going out with friends, so they did not giving me money, they are the kind of person that are scared by openmindess. Everytime that I asked my father if I could find a little job he reminds me that my only duty is studying and that I don't have to lose my time. They never allowed me to work. 

Last year I finally get a kind of prize for study merits, I was very afraid that my parents would take my money so I didn't tell them, I just take the money on my bank account, I finally could pay for a pizza, I bought some adult clothes (they just buy me child clothes even if I am in my 20') and a little laser epilator (in all these years I have to wax myself hiding it because for my mother it was not good, she just pretend me to keep my hairy legs and arms just the way they are). 

Four months ago they discover that I hide theese money but they pretend not to know that, than my brother and my mother sneak in my room while I was at library, my brother hacked my computer, they just read all my messages and chat (with my boyfriend and my friends so they discover that I am not a virgin anymore) than my brother install a keylogger on my computer to steal the password of my bank account. In the evening I discover the keylogger and I asked them explanation, they started to yell at me, they call me a burgler, a bad person, we had a fight, I explained them my reasons, I apologized them so many times, finally my father seems to accept the apologies. A couple 

of days later they ivite my aunt at home to «speak to me» about my faults, but really fast the speaking transform to physical abuse, they forced me on my bad, I cannot move, I cried for 

help and begged them, the abuse just continue for 8 hours, they hit me a lot, and they told me scary things («no one loves you» « you will be alone forever» «you just have to listen us because we are the only people you have»). During the abuse they want me to confess that I was raped by someone or that I had an abortion (crazy things at all!), I keep going cry confessing nothing because nothing was true, finally after hours and hours they call my boyfriend yelling at him, He heard me screaming through the phone and he came to my house saving me, we ran away and report everything to the cops. 

The cops called my family and scolded them, after a couple of days I went back home, here become a hell life, I was not allowed to close in the bathroom, not allowed to use the pans to cook for myself, I was not allowed to have internet, they refuse to pay for my studies, for my books, I was not allowed to use the car anymore to go to medicine classes, I was so scared and terrified that I tried to be at home the less that I could, I tried to study in the city library. I was constantly called a «whore» and other really bad words. I starved for three months, a couple of days ago a had another argument with my brother, I was so scared about his psycho attitude that I was now fearing again for physical abuse, so I packed my things, find a rent and move out when my family was at work. 

Now I am just recovering myself, my mother sent me passive aggressive messagges, my father keeps saying that I just had malignant thoughts, that I am crazy, that I am doing a wrong choice and that I have to go back home because home for me is open. 

I really don't know what to do, sometimes I think my father say theese things because He is scared that I report him and the family to the cops again (this time they will pass real troubles, probably they will forced to pay my studies again and my rent too). 

I loved my family so much, but I don't want to go back in that hell house, I was too scared, I feel also a lot of guilt, they are my family I hardly could accept they are so abusive. 

In my country there is not a support group for people like me I really feel alone, my friends and boyfriend helped me but I feel alone.

540,"I am relatively new to my organization and the person I am discussing (we will call her Betty), has just joined on in the past couple of months. I will preface this by stating, she is obese, not just a little, but she requires 2 large cubicle spaces on her own and most likely weighs around 400 LBS.

It started with going in to the bathroom after her, even 30 minutes after, and a very pungent and distinct smell would permeate. Now, it's full blown, within 10 feet of her, the smell. It's impossible not to notice and from what I understand, HR knows about it and is doing nothing, as other coworkers have complained. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know Betty well enough to be that frank with her, I do not think anyone at work does (at least yet). How do I go about addressing this issue? I don't want to send Betty off into a depression spiral, or quitting her job, but it's creating a very uncomfortable work environment! Thanks!",05Apr2019,3

542,"The situation is this: I am working at an administrative job I accepted in October within the same community college as my last job.  It is full time in a neighboring city and there is a 45 min to an hour commute.  Just recently, the same job I have now is being advertised at a campus that is closer to where I live, and I have substituted at that campus when an employee was out for surgery.  

When I was hired for this job, they made it clear that they were really looking for someone who would be there for a long time.  My immediate supervisor is planning on retiring within the next couple years and eventually wants to train someone to replace her.  At the time I accepted this job, my last job was ending because the whole office was shutting down.  I accepted this because I needed continuous employment and it is the most related to what I used to be doing.   They did not know at the time they hired me that I lived at the distance I do, and they have recently had a few employees in a row that did not stay long.  It feels like they're really banking on me sticking around, and I've gotten to know them well.  My last boss helped me get this job and recommended me.     


The job at the new campus would be a much easier commute for me, and I could easily get hired because they already know me.    It avoids a bridge that causes traffic every day and it's just a shorter drive in the first place.    I just need advice on how to approach my current boss about my intention to apply to work at the other campus.

543,"I have PTRD. I was dating my Ex at the time and he took me for granted throughout the relationship. I was always bussing to be and see him. For about 10 months. I felt sad that he never came to visit me. I broke things off. Later on, he slept with my best friend. My best friend manipulated my local friends and never told them the full story. They suddenly lashed out at me. It caused a lot of trauma. I do not have a good situation at home either when I came home. My mom saw me crying and asked me why was I crying. I told her what happened. Keep in mind. My mom is not a supportive person. She told me it was my fault for being cheated on. 

I stayed indoors for 2 years. All I made was online friends because I told myself repetitively. I was not worthy of having friends. 

I got together with the Ex. I always wanted to know what cosplay was like being around him. He would body shame me a lot. Even at a birthday party. He pointed out at my belly. I felt like I wanted to disappear when everyone started at it. Whenever he met a friend of mine. He would bring up my weight as a topic. I would have people come up to me and ask ""why are you with the individual?"" I just never thought so much because I never knew better. His negging took me down to a dark tunnel. 

He tells people about my body and that I stalk him.

Should I bother attend local conventions? I feel that the little convention nearby me. Is not worth attending anymore. I just feel like I want to leave a letter telling him I'm leaving the city for good. I feel like I'm trapped with my own insecurities and I rather stay indoors than go outside now.

545,"Well, where do I start?! Late last year I found out (inadvertently) my Mum has been hooking up with other men without my Dad having a clue. I think it had been going on for about 6 months until I found out.

They've had a difficult relationship ever since I can remember and should have divorced years ago. My Dad has been pretty bad to my Mum all these years so wouldn't blame her seeking love and attention elsewhere, however the vindictive nature of this (I've unfortunately seen the messages) feels plain wrong and not the mum who brought me up.

So, before Christmas I confronted her about what I knew. I wanted her to be honest and own up but she denied it all so had to share the details I knew (not a great experience for a son telling his mum details of her sexual conversations with other men!). I said, though it's not my business what she likes to do personal life, the way she's done this and the lies were wrong and I felt it is time to move on meaning she leaves my Dad. Our grandmother has recently been diagnosed with dementia so suggested this was an opportunity to spend more time with her and move away from Dad.  I also said I wouldn't tell Dad, mainly because he is an arsehole, he's cheated on my mum and doesn't care about anyone but himself. However it didn't make what Mum did right and not something we just 'sweep under the carpet'.

We agreed after the festivities of Christmas with all the family, she would separate from Dad

Christmas passed and nothing. I spoke to her in January and she said there had been alot on at her work so would at the start of February instead.

And now we're in April and still nothing. No mention from Mum, just carrying on with life as if nothing has happened.

So, to my question. What shall I do? Ignore it and just leave them both to it? Tell Dad? Give Mum an ultimatum? - tell Dad or leave (is this blackmail?!?)

Sorry for long post guys. Having not spoken to anyone about this it's good to get off my chest....

547,"For clarity, I have health related issues that prevent me from working or doing physical labor. As a result of this, my mother has moved in with my husband and I to help take care of things. 

For the *most part* things are fine. She does her own cooking and cleaning of the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. She does her own laundry. Most importantly she doesn’t really get in our way, she’s just here in the guest room if we need her. 

Unfortunately, one thing has come up as a continued source of frustration. Her stuff. She moved in awhile back and brought an entire single unit trailers worth of stuff with her. Most of this is clothing. 

She has a 3x9 foot closet with shelves up top that are so full of clothing that the bar has broken off of the wall. She has four “closet on wheels” that are also so full that she’s had to tape them together to keep them from falling apart. Her room is 15x20, she has a small 2x4 desk, a dresser (2x3?), and a queen sized bed. The floor is completely covered in yard work black trash bags filled with clothes piled up to waist height, with only a path to the closet, the bed and the door. 

She has at least 10 plastic totes full of clothing that are lined up along the hallway that she says she’ll get to when she figures it out. 

She keeps bugging us to clean out the hallway closet, which we informed her was for household storage not personal storage, so she can put bins there. This is where we keep the broom, dog food, cat food, litter, and basically all the cleaning supplies. There is a rack for coats as well, but we can no longer put our or our guests coats up because hers are taking up the entire runner. 

As if this wasn’t bad enough, she’s somewhat of a “neat freak” about everything that isn’t hers. If we leave dishes in the sink overnight (maybe we’re tired, maybe we forgot, maybe we felt like being lazy for a day) it’s the end of the world and she’ll talk about how overwhelmed she gets. She keeps wanting to replace all of our furniture with stuff she has in storage (she has two storage units full of stuff) even though our furniture is brand new. 

In fairness, she moved from a 3 floor home into an apartment a few years ago and didn’t have time to downsize at the time. However, I don’t feel that this is healthy, nor is it fair to us. She keeps talking about how our handful of dishes, or slightly messy coffee table, prevent her from having guests and yet I can’t walk through my hallway without pressing against the wall, and our cleaning closet is completely overrun. 

How do I talk to her about having too many clothes and things, and help her to understand that she can’t store all of that here. We’re not trying to limit her use of the space, but personal storage is ones bedroom, not the hallway, pantry, and corner of the dining room. ",05Apr2019,1

550,"

Sorry for any spelling mistakes. I'm super emotional right now. I just got done crying in the bathroom.

I made a post earlier about being closeted and being in love with my friend, but none of the replies really gave any advice on how to DEAL with it. I don't know what to do. I have nobody I can turn to and all of the responses said not to say anything to my friend.

This is causing me a lot of emotional and mental pain. I have no job (too young to work practically anywhere in my town) so I have no money to get any help or buy any books about this. My parents think my depression is just a phase so won't take me to any therapists. I'm scared my school guidance counselor would rat me out to my headmaster who would get my pastor and parents involved.

I feel trapped and desparate. I'm on the verge of an emotional breakdown and I fele like i'm going to explode. I want more than anything to tell her how I feel but i don't want to lose my best friend because of something stupid i did or because she tells someone in our church or school admin. My parents are sure to find out at some point regardless.

My head and my heart aches. I've cried and cried because i don't know what to do any I've lost so much energy and happiness because I feel so lost. My grades are slipping because I can't find the motivation to care anymore. I know my parents love me but sometimes I feel like that love is conditional on me being a good Christian girl and not embarrassing them by doing something sinful like loving another girl.

I believe in God but I can't help that I fell in love with a girl. I can't justify it to myself and I don't know who to turn to. I don't feel like I can trust any of the adults at my school to keep it private because my mom knows practically everyone in admin. This is making me go crazy.

I feel like I'm suffocating and nobody in my life cares or takes me seriously. I've cried all my tears dry and don't know where to go or who to turn to. I need help. I need advice. I just want to be happy again. I feel alone and I'm scared of what's going on with me. ",05Apr2019,2
551,"If this includes Room and Board meaning that utility bills are included? 

I’m seeking nighttime care for my mother who is quite low maintenance but gets seizure at least once a day. She is able to talk clearly, and is quite independent meaning she can eat by herself, and change her own diaper. If she needs anything that she cannot get herself because she cannot walk by herself she has an alarm/bell thing she can ring. Furthermore, she eats during the day only. Therefore, the caregiver only needs to check up on her maybe once an hour every night from 12 am to 8 am just to check if she is doing alright and give her a pain medication once a night IF needed.

553,"So, my buddy Tito and I were hanging out at his place watching Steel Magnolias and someone drove by blasting some crazy ass music out their car. He paused the movie right before a real tear jerk scene and ran up to the window blinds and looked out. 

I asked Tito what was wrong and he said ""I just miss my B3 yo"". I inquired with my somber friend what this B3 was, and he told me it's a Baby Boom Box. He explained that it's like a ghetto blaster but more portable and takes smaller batteries.

He told me he used to put on his B3 and scrapbook all night long, but he's lost the will to be creative recently. He said the B3 is the only thing that unlocks the creative side of his soul and it's really bringing him down since he no longer has it. After drinking a few Bud Light Cheladas, he told me that he had a scrap booking party at his place the other week, and he woke up the next morning noticing that the B3 was missing. There was only 6 other guys who attended.

I searched the depths of my mind and realized I heard music playing at our mutual friend Ralph's place the other day. I asked Tito if Ralph was bookin wit the boys that night and he just stared off past me for like a minute. I could see the demonic presence burning behind his eyes. I actually got so scared I tried to leave. 

He grabbed my arm and told me there's no way out of this without the B3. He told me he'd tell my mom that I went to the Super Soaker Shootout if I didn't help him. That would royally suck horse nuts because my mom said that I can't get wet. Anyhow, Tito grabbed his Jose Canseco bat and pulled me out the door. He fired up his hog and I rode sidecar, and we headed over to Ralph's. Traffic wasn't too bad, as it was 4am at this point. 

We made it to Ralph's and we saw him look at us from his porch window. He locked the door when he saw us coming, and Tito said ""Go run around to the side garage door, it doesn't even close or latch"", so I did. Ralph was already braced up against the door so we couldn't get in. I pushed as hard as I could, but I couldn't get in. I know Ralph was gettin in pretty good shape after I saw him putting together his Gazelle Freestyle a few months ago. His legs and ass are rock hard. Anyhow, it took both our strength and a little help from god to get that door open. I actually asked Jesus to give us strength right before we bested Ralph. We got into the garage and he tackled me immediately and I realized he had a sharpie in his hand. He held me down with his muscular bod and slashed at my face repeatedly. The black ink dashed across my forehead and I only realized later that he had wrote ""Judas""

After a lengthy grapple between me, Tito and Ralph, we finally called a time out. We interrogated him about the B3 in the kitchen. He denied the whole thing and thought we were the Capitol One debt collectors he's been dodging for 4 years. Tito stared at him right in his eyes and a tiny bit of the demon previously detailed slipped out. He told us to lift our YooHoos and toast to friendship. Tito threw his YooHoo in Ralph's face, temporary blinding him. We duct taped his arms to his sides and dragged him out into the garage (aka his ceramics studio).

We had him tied down to his peter rabbit promotional chair while Tito hovered the Jose Canseco bat over some new ceramic pieces. 

""WHERES MY F***ING BABY BOOM BOX, RALPH?!""

Ralph denied the whole thing and said he never listened to music while doing his crafts. Tito started smashing tons of ceramics and terra cotta pots and some nice vases. Ralph just laid there screaming and crying. We only stopped when we heard a car pulling up in the driveway. We decided to book it, leaving the bike behind.

The next morning we woke up to Ralph's mom knocking at my door. She said she knows about the terrible thing I did to her son and his ceramics. She looked at my forehead and said ""You truly are like Judas and also the devil himself, and it's my opinion that you have a demon in your soul.""

She then told me that I have to pay $1000 for the damages done to the ceramics and her sons physical/mental well being. I told her that it was Titos idea, and I just helped. I said he is actually a little bit demonic and can only chill out and s-book with his B3 blasting. She said she went to his house earlier and he denied the whole thing and said it was my idea.

""Tito, you truly are demonic and are not pure of heart"" - Me at that time

I was betrayed, and I called Tito and asked him what was the hap-e-haps, and why he sold me out. He just told me that if I didn't go along with it or else he'd tell my mom about how badly I got soaked at the Super Soaker Shootout, and that would REALLY suck.

So, basically I just sold the B3 at a pawn shop for like $20 and now I have $980 left to pay Ralph. Yeah I know, don't judge me too hard. It was me who stole the B3, I just really loved how small it was yet how big the boom boom blasted.

Tl;Dr - I tried to do the right thing by helping my friend steal back a boom box, but ended up getting in big trouble for it. What do I do now?

She also started  doing  a stroking motion on a kitchan roll when she jokingly complained  to me  that I didn't put it in the bin.

566,"I don’t understand my [23 F] girlfriend who treats me [25 M].  I’ve known this girl since high school and we had been best friends since.  Yet, however, I stagnated our friendship through an abusive ex-girlfriend I was with long ago. She told me not to talk to her (my current girlfriend who I was best-friends with).  

I’m one to admit my wrongs all throughout this relationship I’m currently in and not afraid in doing so. I’ve been reprimanded by this girl for ever wanting to expose the truth about how she’s lying to others to save face. Yet, hides the fact that she has lied to me about a lot that even led to a costly, permanent mistake having given me an STD on top of genetic disorders I’m currently battling amongst vision impairment and hearing loss.  However, I’ve been fairly understanding and have pushed through relationship despite having been lied to, yelled and cussed at, and manipulated. Yet, I’m told I’m the manipulator and controller.

My mistakes had simply been that I did not let her go and tried to talk to her for the things she has done wrong the other night.  I’ve had a history of telling her that I would admit things to people for having felt depressed over the way she had been treating me all along being insensitive, spiteful and hurtful.  She seems to think I don’t tell the truth when it comes to others, but all else tells me that they would react the way I do considering all the hell I’ve been put through.   I’ve told her that I don’t like the fact that she’s hiding stuff from her family and I’m having to keep my mouth shut for her sake when she’s done me dirty in a major way multiple times.  Even her own sister had understood me and warned me about her behaviors.

I don’t understand if I’m in a relationship with a narcissist and if I am, it’s a painful one because I’m extremely selfless. For example, when she has yelled and cussed at me, I’ve let her stay over despite having that happened. Or, celebrated her birthdays and the holidays with her despite having discovered lies and the entire truth (hopefully I know it all, but if she’s willing to lie multiple times, what would make it any different now?).   I feel completely distraught because all I have ever wanted was this girl and I known her since high school as friends.  

We have been together 1.6 years and the sad part is, she had ruined a lot with her dumb decisions and mistakes.  Yet, I’m told I’m horrible for reacting the way I have for having been extremely patient.  If one were to watch my relationship from the outside, you would understand like my peers have too.  I’ve had my roommate to even friends and my own mother who wanted to give her a piece of their mind, but don’t because of how she’ll treat me. They also respect they’re not in the relationship.  They try and support me the best I can.

The sad part is after every being, having been told I’m hated and not loved anymore for the next day be told I’m loved and she’s sorry for having been erratic.  Her mom has a history of mental health issues and I’m honestly believing she does too. I don’t want to give up on this girl because I made a promise not to, but at the same time, I feel I have to protect myself.  I’ve been told I should not be going to others about our problems. However, I feel this is her tactic to hide who she really is.  

I feel like I don’t understand anything anymore.  I have made mistakes of what she’s said is “threatening,” but others felt it’s an eye-for-an-eye for how bad she screwed me over.  Yet, I would never want to do those things because I care too much about her. I’m sure we’ve all been there where we have said some stupid things that shouldn’t have been said.  I get told I’m clingy and out of control, when I’ve been told things out of manipulation putting me in great fear and anxiety.  I’ve been told I’m clingy when others tell me I’m anxious due to how I’m being treated and what she has done is emotionally abusive.  Everyone sees I treat her well and although that is true, I’ve messed up as friends for allowing another abuser to pull me away from her which I feel guilty for all around.  I even blamed myself for her actions as a result of ruining our friendship when she knows herself that it’s her fault and not mine.  

I don’t know where to start and I don’t know how to repair. This girl is one I love deeply and at the same time, I love her hard to only be hurting even harder because I feel my needs aren’t met. She’s been insensitive towards my disabilities at times due to ignorance and I’m having to educate her on multiple things.  I don’t know what to do anymore and all I ever hear is, “Just break up with her because she’s not as good as you thought she was.”  I understand everyone is imperfect and to be honest, she has messed up from the get-go. However, what others might call me names for, I still gave her a chance.  I just don’t understand.

She constantly needs space and I’m told I never care nor listen. I do listen and acknowledge things.  I’m not perfect at all and I’m here writing this completely saddened over everything.  I’m in need of help and I don’t want to quit.  I feel really down and she gets mad for me going out to people I’m close with about our problems, but she’s never there emotionally available led alone to support. I’m always giving my all even when I make mistakes. She’s always telling me too I’m a good boyfriend but treats me otherwise. I don’t know anymore.  ",05Apr2019,1
567,"My bestie has this really bad habit I've noticed when it comes to her love life. She tends to isolate herself from everyone except for her boyfriend, then when they break up, she's extra upset because she feels alone. She only hangs out with him and me. That's it. No one else outside of school, but mostly him. So of course, when/if they break up, the effects would be a lot worse for her because she doesn't have anyone except me. 

But now, it feels like she's starting to cut me out too. I know her boyfriend isn't doing this, he's a very quiet, sweet, laid back, kind of guy. I'm honestly not sure if he's ever even swore or been loud in his entire existence. 

She won't share things with me, she tells her boyfriend instead. When she's sad, she'll only go to him if he's around. It just seems like she's isolating herself and putting him over me. I know it's selfish of me, but it does hurt. She used to always go to me as her best friend and now she almost exclusively goes to him. 

If they break up, she'll be utterly alone, what should I do? ",05Apr2019,1

569,"Some backstory, I was raised by my mother only, I was an accident. My mom had a one night stand and found out a month later that she was pregnant and lost contact with the man. Flash forward 20 years later, I’m now a college student who’s having to worry about college debt like anyone else here. My mother got in a car accident leaving her unable to do long tedious tasks, making work difficult for her to find something that would be both beneficial for her and the company. She use to take care of my Great Grandma with anything medical so she didn’t have to live at a nursing home. Well she passed away 3 years ago and before she died, she left me $15,000. The account is controlled by one of my aunts and she puts about $4,000 of it in every year so it’ll last me the 4 years. Well for the past year, my mom borrowed some money, nothing big and it was always regulated by me, she has no access to the account. Well recently she started asking for more to pay for bills, she’s borrowed about $3,000 total and I left myself with very little to make it pass spring quarter. When I gave her the money last, I sent a long text message saying that I’ve been struggling with anxiety (which is true because and I have been going to therapy finally) and I asked for her to not ask me for anymore money ever cause it puts me in a great deal of anxiety since I keep that account as a last resort if I can’t pay for a bill (I do work but I only work about 10-15 hours a week). Well for 3 months we had no conversation about money until one day she said “You need to pay for your phone bill, here’s the link to pay for it since I can’t ask you for money. You owe $210.” I start losing it, I text back saying that that was a scummy thing to do. Another thing to add to express my anger, she always told me she was worried I’d date a girl who’d take advantage of me and drag me along, well I also said that she was acting like that women. Well she responds with she’s looking into passing bill responsibilities on to me, so I asked my aunt for about $1000 and pay off the bill I “owed” and then I paid off my phone. My question is, what should I do from here? She’s my only parent so abandoning her is like abandoning both my parents although I have thought about it. I know this isn’t r/legal advice so I’m not worried about the money for now, but what should I do? We have a large family event in July that she has asked me if I was still attending and I told her “Probably not since I’m signing up for summer classes and I’m going to look for a second job for summer.” I don’t want to see her because this happened a month ago and I neither one of us talked since and the event is being put together my Grandma who I also don’t want to see since she emotionally abused me when drunk (she’s an alcoholic and I had to stay with her while my mom was recovering and my grandma would say things like “Well I guess you wouldn’t be sad if your mother died in the car accident since you’re such a heartless child” and more that lead to multiple suicide attempts and another reason that I’m going to therapy). I’m stuck and I’ve talked to my therapist about it and she’s not giving me a straight answer so here I am, I need advice reddit. Do I not go to this event like I said, do I go, do I stop talking with my mother because she’s too self centered?

Well, I don’t know what to do with my life. I’m 20yo and I dropped out of vet school because my narcissistic mum forced me into it. I used to live with her and study what she wanted me to study just so she could show off to everyone. I was extremely down and wouldn’t try to get good grades or anything. She kicked me out of her house and I kept moving places until I ended up at my dad’s house.

This country is just not good and I don’t feel like I belong here). I can’t stay much longer at my dads place because his wife is extremely lazy, rude and gross. She’s driving me crazy.

573,"As the title suggested, currently I’m having issues with my roommate and I’m not sure what to do. A little background info: we lived together for over 1.5 year and we’ve only ever got into one argument before and that’s over the house temperature during a hot summer which I’ll get into that later, and it really was because she started being really passive aggressive and refused to talk. 

So currently in the province we are living at, temperature is above 0 during the day and maybe border lining 0 at nighttime. Back home we usually turn the heat off and open the window a little bit and you get this perfect, nice inside environment where it’s not too warm and not too cold. However in our current house, we have no windows, as in we only have full on backyard like doors that allow us access to our small patio, and since there are no additional security features, we don’t open them because they give access to trespassers if they ever choose to hop the fence and open our door. 

As of now, my main issue with her is that she claims to be very cold, both summer and winter, when ONLY wearing a tiny tank top and booty shorts. Recently she came down with a skin disorder and when I returned following the weekend, I found our heat blasting at 75F ok a day that was 5C outside, and her claiming her body temperature is really low (hence the heat) while wearing a tank top with a small sweater on top and her legs bearing out the whole time when I asked to turn down the heat. Essentially, she is objecting to me turning down the heat because of her lack of clothing. Whenever I’m feeling really hot because of how high our heat is (usually 74), I only adjust it by 1-2 degree so that the heat isn’t on super frequently as oppose to shutting it down since I know she will get cold and also it’s not just me living alone. However what I found is happening a lot is that she will just change the thermostat setting whenever she feels cold or hot to accommodate to her current body temp as oppose to perhaps putting on a sweater or pants (especially if she is sick). She does this a lot especially when she just wake up in the morning and often crank the heat up at 76 and it will just be blasting for over 1 hour until she is ready to leave (then she’ll turn it down) .  This made me, who always wear shorts and t shirts all year long really uncomfortable because of how hot it is, and many times I will wake up in sweat in a -40C winter which I found is ridiculous. If I feel my house is too cold, unless the heat is turned down to a ridiculous range, I usually will put on a sweater/layers, and not blast it. During the summer when she finds our house cold (AC was set at 77), instead of turning it up, she just chose to shut the entire system down which resulted in spikes in our electricity bill because of the constant on/off. Even after we resolved our issues, she still frequently do that in the summer which annoys me because I never shut down the heat in the winter when I find it too hot. I also know that my range of temperature is not ridiculous because when she invited her friends over, they were complaining about how hot our house is to her and she relented and turned down the heat. The same applied to my friends and that put her in a really awkward position as well since she was the one who blasted the heat, and not me. 

Since I am friends with this person, I don’t want to be aggressive in my approach of trying to talk to her. I also don’t want to be passive aggressive either because I have 4 more months of living with her but this issue with the heat is just getting ridiculous and it’s very bothersome. I am
Also very nervous about what will happen when summer rolls around, as in if she’s going to shut down the AC and won’t allow people to turn it on. Please help! ",05Apr2019,1
574,"To make a long story short, I loved my old school, and I only transferred out because my current school had a really strong program for my major. When I got here I fell in love with another subject and ended up changing my major. The program for my new major is good here but it’s also good at my old school (they’re ranked pretty evenly). The only thing is that each is strong in two different areas of the study, and my old school was better in the area I’m more interested in. But I still know I would learn a lot if I stayed here too.

My question is, Should I transfer back (I’d be a junior)? I wanna go back but I don’t wanna start over again. I was happier there and am more interested in the type of classes offered there but the program here is still good too. Also, the teaching style at my old school worked a lot better for me (here at a small liberal arts school the professors assign a large amount of reading and we discuss it in class, whereas there classes are more lecture based with readings to supplement those lectures. I retain info much better the former way). Not sure if I should just stick it out for another 2 years. I’m almost certain all my credits would transfer but I’m wondering if its a bad idea for other reasons. Thoughts? I’m so lost. 

Edit: Grades have been good at both schools, and academically they both have good reputations. ",05Apr2019,2
575,"I (37, F) left an abusive marriage, walked out with the kids and left everything.  Went to a domestic violence shelter for 6 weeks, as that's how long the program was. I didn't know where we were going to go but a police officer friend (42, M) offered to let us stay with him.  It was an unbelievable generosity I can never repay and will always be grateful for.  

We lived with my friend for 4 months and while there, I paid all the bills, as to make it beneficial to him in some way.  My friend and I became closer than we ever had been.

Because I felt safe in this town, especially my friend being a cop here, I decided to reestablish our lives here, even though (and perhaps, especially) it was several states away and I know no one, except for my friend.  I ended up buying a super cheap house here, that needs a ton of work.

I'd accidentally left a few things my a friends house which wasn't a big deal because I thought I could go get them anytime.  One of those things being a pair of work shoes and literally the only family momento I had, a Bible my grandma gave me.

Out of the blue, my friend ghosts me (8 months ago).  I think it may have something to do with him getting a girlfriend.  Honestly I don't know, that's just a guess. I have been tremendously hurt over my friends actions

 Now, I'm starting a new job and really need those shoes back.  The Bible is extremely important as well but it isn't going to cost me to replace it (there is no replacement for a Bible my grandma read through hundreds of times, literally, through the years).

Over the past several weeks, I've called, texted and finally went to his house yesterday in an attempt to get my stuff back.  He didn't answer any of it.  When I went over, his car was there and a neighbor I knew (from previously living there) said he had just gotten home from work.  He is obviously avoiding me.  I left a note on his door.

So I have two things occurring- 1) I'm devastated that I fucking moved here knowing only one person who is now ghosting me.  2) I really need those shoes back to start work.  

I'm asking for advice on 2 things:

1) How does one reconcile in your heart and mind, his behavior?  Him allowing us to stay there when we were homeless, is one of the loveliest gestures of anyone in my life. On the other hand, him ghosting me after reestablishing here, has left me feeling hurt and angry.  One of the ugliest gestures toward me in my life.

2) I really need those shoes back.  I don't have an extra $50 to get a new pair (that's the cheapest I could find and they're probably so crappy they'd kill my feet).  I would really like the Bible as well.  He's a cop and I'd hate to make him mad, especially after all we've been through.  He is obviously not who I thought he was.  

Summary: After an abusive marriage, my kids and I were homeless, a friend took us in.  Reestablished in the town near said friend (a cop) for safety reasons.  Now friend has ghosted me for 8 months.  I need my stuff back I left at his place and he's avoiding me.  I'm hurt, angry and can't afford to replace items left at his place.

576,"Long story short, I'm currently in another country living w/my dad instead of my mom in a private school. During Christmas, I visited my mom and she got me a Surface Pro (Which I'm still in love with). I was talking with her about it today and was thinking of getting a pen to use OneNote when I go back and she says that it might not be a good idea to bring that laptop to school (We don't live in a very poor area, but we aren't in a $500k+ house either) since she doesn't want it getting stolen/damaged by someone else. I personally don't think there's really any issue bring it to school, but then again I have no idea what the kids in my assigned school back where my mom is living are like.

577,"So, I was going home from school, taking the bus as usual.
After 3 minutes of standing, (almost falling down because the bus driver was wild and I was carrying my notebook and my DSLR) I noticed a girl sitting not too far away from me. At first she didn't get much of my attention, as I was thinking of music related stuff, but after an other 2 or 3 minutes I took a second glance, and I was totally amazed by how pretty she was. She looked at me, so our eyes met.
Her blonde hair and her absolutely beautiful blue eyes froze me down for a moment, I felt that moment, as if I was looking through the viewfinder of my camera.
When I'm behind a camera, it feels like I can do whatever I want, almost like my soul breaks out of my body, heart and mind, or wherever souls are located (mini laugh).

Back to the topic.
We stared at each other, but not for too long. I realised I wasn't hiding behind a camera, I looked away, and so she did too. At this point the bus was full, full of other people minding their own business. But I was still there, looking out the window, thinking to myself how I need to talk to her and ask her out.

I noticed a few things, suggesting she might like me too.
I was listening to some good old Queen and Alice in Chains stuff, and when it comes to music, I feel powerful. So I started 'pumping' my feet to the rhythm, totally getting lost in the music. And then I saw her doing the same thing with her feet (Doesn't this sound wrong?), I heard that if you like someone you start copying their movement, without you even noticing it?... I don't know, I'm pretty sceptic about that, she was listening to music too... so it might have been just her enjoying her music too. She looked at me many times, I noticed. I did too.

My chance.
... The lady sitting next to her got down of the bus ...
... She looked at me, I looked at her ...
... She sat on the other seat, so I can sit down next to her ... (I just felt really positive about her liking me by now)
... and I... I didn't sit next to her :-{ ...
She even looked at me with that 'Come here' look. I was thinking about ways to approach her, but my fear and introverted behaviour took over.

I just really hope we'll meet again, and next time I'll say ""Hi"" to her and ask her out for a tea or coffee.
But what are the chances of us getting on the same bus, you know...

I really can't explain more, and I swear I'm not that type of guy who falls in love with every other girl.

Anyways, leave your entries in the subreddi- .. uhm...

ANYWAYS, leave some advice down in the comments, please.
Hope you guys having a good time, bye.

579,"So I met these two girls at my school through the school musical and we became fast friends, everyone was commenting on how we all were so good together. One of the girls I know better because I had done a previous school play with her, we will call her Julia. Anyways we promised each other that after the musical was over that we would stay close friends, and we did for a while, we went to each others houses and hung out a lot, we went out to dinner, went iceskating and overall just had a great time. But one day one of my friends, the one who had recently joined Julia and mines friend group, we will call her Lily, had invited us over to her house to get ready for a school dance. (note I had not been to her house yet but Julia had) When we got to her house we all had a great time and planned to meet up again tomorrow before the dance, when I got there the next day it seemed like lily was completely ignoring me and really only wanted to hang out with Julia. I had barely talked to either of them at the dance and whenever I tried to ask Julia for advice she brushed it off like it didn't matter and went back to dancing. I felt in that moment that she didn't care that this was something that was really bothering me. The next day at school some girls, including Julia, lily, and I, were to perform a dance for the school assembly. While we were figuring out the choreo a couple weeks before lily had a lot of ideas, and most of them were about putting Julia and her in the spotlight. Again I felt completely overlooked but I went along with it. After we performed the dance I saw Julia and lily talking, I tried to join the conversation but they were too caught up with each other that I was ignored. I had apologized to lily for whatever I did to make her angry at her but she just said, ""whatever, its fine"". I didn't know what I did wrong in the first place but I was being the bigger person so I just left it at that. I asked my friends what I should do but they just said to give her space. A few days ago she started talking to me again like nothing ever happened. For a while I felt hatred for them both because they hung out and went places without me, it made me feel so insignificant and I still do feel this way, I felt like lily was stealing Julia because she was so angry at me, but Julia was never angry which confuses me. Why would Julia diss me to always hang out with lily if she wasn't mad at me, did she just like lily more than me? If so why wouldn't she just tell me she didn't want to be my friend anymore? It just hurts because we were so close and because friends so fast, they were my best friends but I don't know how to feel anymore.

585,"My grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament.

Backstory:

I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's  deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed.

Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. 

It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. 

""I'm here with my grandson!""

There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band.

Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us.

Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink. 

Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight.

587,"Okay so I’m a freshman in high school and to clarify I was never a morning person in the first place, but I always got up from 6:15 - 6-30 to get ready and you know, look good for the day. The first day of my freshman year I got up around 6 to look good. And throughout the year I got up around 6:30 every day. 

So, it’s about the end of the school year and I have no motivation anymore. Around the middle of the third marking period I started losing motivation to wake up early. I always went to bed early, but I now don’t wake up until about 7:00-7:10. I wake up in the morning jd debate whether I should ask to skip but I don’t because I know I wouldn’t be allowed. I’ve skipped a few days before but I don’t want to make my mom mad or anything.

So, the last two weeks I’ve been waking up and just, done. I feel like crying and I absolutely despise going to school, my school life is fine, I don’t get bullied, get good grades, etc. but I just feel like breaking down because I’m tired and sad for no reason at all. I just despise going to school.

Is there an explanation for this?

I just feel like all the people who claim to be my 'friends' secretly dislike me and are too nice to tell me to fuck off.
A couple days ago, another new kid arrived at our school and almost instantaneously everyone liked her thousands of times more than me, even though I've been making an effort to fit into the friend group for well over a term. 
The last few days everyone has started ignoring me, excluding me, (can't tell of its intentional) leaving me behind, not wanting to talk with me, and I cant find what I did to deserve this. 
I've been nothing but nice to all of them and none of them give a rats ass about me, and please dont just tell me to 'make new friends' because I've tried and the others are even worse.
I feel invisible and stupid for ever trusting anyone. If I just dissapeared nobody would even notice until the school had one of those assemblies to announce how ""sorry it is for such a tragedy to happen, let's all remember how [trait] [blank] was!!"".

590,"Basically, one of my friends loves singing and playing piano and it’s her outlet for a lot of things, so I don’t mind it... but she’s gotta be tone deaf or something. I don’t understand it. When she plays piano, she is usually not using the right rhythm or adds extra notes, and when she sings she’s just all over the place in terms of key, notes, rhythm, etc. But, one of our friends heard her for the first time and mouthed to me that she was really good and now I’m super confused. 

I grew up doing choir and playing instruments (though i never stuck with them long, i always caught on quickly to whatever i played), and while it really doesn’t bother me when she wants to play and sing (I encourage it because I use singing as an outlet as well), when she wants to sing with me, I’m always tempted to correct her.

There have been so many times where we sing something together, and she does something wrong. I guess growing up in choir has led me to really hate when people just keep on going in the wrong key. She also doesn’t play piano to the right rhythm of songs. Usually our other friends are with us, and while she just happily goes along butchering it, I usually just stop and get flustered and sort of embarrassed because I start to second guess myself and start thinking maybe *I’m* the one that’s bad, but everyone says I’m good. 

I don’t think anyone’s told her, and I don’t want to tell her and then she stop because she gets insecure, but I also believe that people can learn to be better singers if they recognize they’re bad (I mean, when I was a kid my brother would tell me to shut up when I sang. Now he doesn’t.)

I don’t want to be an asshole or anything, or seem like I’m arrogant either. But sometimes she puts herself out there and none of us say anything because we are her friends and don’t wanna hurt her, but I feel like if I was bad at singing, I’d wanna know (I already tell my friends to tell me the truth about my voice).

592,"I was driving down the freeway in my convertible the other day jammin out to Unkle Kracker. My dreads were flyin in the wind, whippin around like a mofo. The sky was a little bit overcast, so I decided to pull over on the side of the road and put the top up. It’s automatic, so all i has to do is push a button. Little did I know, one of my phatties (dreadlock) was snagged. I didn’t realize it, cuz they’re super long. Anyhow, I was just finishing up U.K. - Smile, when I lost control of the vehicle and slammed into the water barrels. This caused me to be ejected forward through the windshield and headfirst into a barrel of water. The doctors said it was the barrel that saved my life, and it was a miracle my head was “mostly undamaged” from the impact. Stupid cheap seatbelt snapped in half, so that probably saved me too. Anyhow, they told me the damage to my dome was superficial. They held up a mirror and I gasped. Not because my face was bruised and puffy...

My 12 o’clock phattie didn’t survive the crash.

I immediately flipped out, and grabbed the mirror and tilted my head down. This is hard to do wearing a C-collar, by the way. I had a bloody bald spot where Twelvie used to be. I’d been growing that snake for years. It was actually my first one. I’d carefully wash and groom the rest of my hair around it, and just have a big phattie dook rope comin off top. I got the idea after I watched Avatar 3D in theaters. I loved the Navï aliens and their long rat tail/dread with the little thing on the end of it. It’s all I could think about for weeks, so I guess that’s my biggest inspiration.

Anyhow, sorry about that little tangent. I just wanted to illustrate what my toppie cord meant to me.

The Sheriff came into my hospital room and handed me a gallon freezer bag. I opened it up and saw my prized Noggin Flogger. I cried a little, took a few selfies with it, and fistbumped the righteous officer of the law. 

I asked the doctor if there was any way he could surgically re-attach it. I don’t wanna be walkin around town with a bald spot on my globe. It’s really obvious that one is missing. Well, he said there wasn’t enough usable scalp attached to feasibly re-attach it. He said the weight of the crust whip might be too heavy, and it’d just rip the stitches and fall out. 

When I got discharged, I went home and tried my best to reattach it. I psyched myself into sewing it back on, but the first needle poke was enough to make me say “F-that!”. I ended up drowning my sorrows and frustrations with a bottle of Mango vodka. I started poking my bald spot, and realized it didn’t hurt anymore. I got this killer idea. I popped in my Smash Mouth CD and cranked it, digging through my arts and crafts bin. I found my old hot glue gun and a fresh glue stick. 

Well, it worked... temporarily. I seriously had to coat my dome in so much glue. It started to burn and itch pretty bad after a couple of minutes. I finished securing it by dribbling gorilla glue all around it. After letting it dry, that sucker wasn’t going anywhere. To help stabilize it, i invisible scotch taped it to one of my other phatties. Partners in crime.

It fell off in the shower like a day later. I’m at my wits end now. What do I do? I don’t like wearing hats or beanies, I don’t have my car so I just roller-blade everywhere. I just have this nightmare mental image that people might think I’m a weirdo or ugly because of my bald spot. I don’t think I can blade fast enough for people not to see.

Does anyone here have any suggestions on how to re-attach a dreadlock, or have any dread oriented advice for me?

600,"Dear Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*first, sorry for the long post\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

My friend of close to 10 years sometimes gets on my nerves and behaves so oddly; can you try and make sense of why he acts the way he does?

&amp;#x200B;

We met as freshmen in college at a very large state school and were suite mates in a suite of 9 guys. Immediately, we hit it off. We were both in a very hard science major--admittedly, he was a better student than I ever was in college. I scraped by with C's and D's, and he hit A's and B's.

&amp;#x200B;

After college, we decided to live together; he bought a condo in the suburbs, and gave me really good rate to stay with him--no paperwork or deposit, or anything, really. It was awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first job out of college, and was working as a phone salesman; he was doing his M.S. and working at in a laboratory. He would invite his friends over and always mention in front of me about his M.S. and make very subtle remarks about how he was a better student than I was and how I would never be able to go to graduate school. I bought a TV once during Black Friday and got a great deal, and he walked downstairs and said his parents have a bigger one. A couple of weeks later, he bought a bigger TV than what I have and put it in his room. My girlfriend got an acceptance into a PharmD program, and a few weeks later, he applied for one too completely out of the blue; he gained acceptance and then dropped out a few weeks later.

&amp;#x200B;

Using this sort of one-upping behavior as a fuel to my fire, I worked tirelessly for a year as a phone salesman and studied Finance independently in the nights. I ended up getting a job at a top-tier bank (think J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, or Morgan Stanley). This was a huge deal for me, especially given my background in school. Once I got my role, my friend asked me what I made (which was more than him at the time). A few weeks later, he quit his job and found another role, mentioning to me that he makes more than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked hard at the bank for a few years,  and eventually moved out of his place during this timeframe. I was very frustrated with him and he was frustrated with me too (I'm still not sure why). We didn't speak for months, until he heard through the grapevine that I got into a top-tier M.S myself. (think Northwestern, UChicago, Cornell); I told a good story about how I got into the bank from phone sales, and the ADCOM let me in, somehow. He randomly texted me out of the blue and congratulated me, mentioning that he will be going for his PhD soon). I figured that this was another one of his typical comments--I just played along and said good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a job in the same city as my M.S. and listed my apartment on FB marketplace to see if someone could take over the lease today. Within 5 minutes of my post, my friend (who last spoke to me months and months ago when I got accepted into the M.S.) reached out to me by text. ""Hey are you moving? Saw your post about your apartment."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I got wise to where this was going, and told him that I got a job in a Big 4 consultancy in the city. He asked me how much I will be making (odd question to ask since we never talk), and was shocked to know that I'll be making 6 figures (FWIW, I would NEVER bring this up to anyone; it's not in me to talk about salary with anyone). I congratulated him on getting into PhD, to which he said that he wants to drop out now (I surmise it's because he knows his salary will be lower than mine during PhD training). He also said that 6-figures in a major metropolis isn't the same as what it is in the suburbs where he lives--he's not wrong, in fact, he's right, but it's his way of diminishing what I'm doing. For Christ's sake--I'm 25, and I think I'm doing okay--I come from a humble household, and I saw my dad go through hell to reach that six figures. 

&amp;#x200B;

He told me today that he plans to start his own pharmaceutical company and that he gets people that reach out to him every day on LinkedIn with job offers.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a MILLION other examples of this type of behavior from him, but I'm keeping it short for brevity. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, Reddit, my question is: WHY THE FUCK IS THIS MOTHERFUCKER SO ANNOYING?! Is it just me, or is he literally the most annoying person in the world? What is causing this? I just can't understand why he's like this.

602,"I'm currently a freshman going to kind of a large university. I have a solid friend group and we hang out at one friend, A's, dorm a lot. He lives in a suite (three rooms with two people per room, a small common living area and a shared bathroom) and early on this semester I met my now current boyfriend while hanging out with the group. In the short time that followed before we got together, we spent a good deal of time talking to each other and hanging out in the suite, as my bf lives in one of the other rooms in A's suite. Everything seemed normal/fine until we started dating about a month and a half ago. Now, it feels like he is entirely emotionally dependent on me, while I'm not quite as invested.

To provide some more backstory, he was in a two year relationship in high school that, from what he's told me, seems like it was incredibly toxic. It was secret, long distance for a while, and ended with her cheating on him with someone who she met playing league of legends. The end was messy and she said some bad things to him about him being pathetic, not capable of making friends on his own, boring, etc. He, obviously, took this really hard and it kind of colored his views of relationships/other's perceptions of him ever since. He is a really relationship-oriented person and has almost always had someone he's liked/been interested in. According to him, some of these girls would seem interested at first, but their interest would fade after a couple of weeks or months, causing him to feel shitty again.

We've been dating for a month and I really liked him for a long time, but it's gotten to the point where it seems like he doesn't trust me. He's always saying things like ""it's fine when we're together, but when we're not, I doubt you and I feel like you're going to leave me"" or ""It's only a matter of time before you leave me"". And perhaps the most disturbing, he asked me if I was down to have sex in a few days, because he thinks it will tie me to him (I've still got my vcard although I've fooled around a bit in the past). In other ways too it seems like he's, mostly unintentionally, trying to emotionally manipulate me into staying with him. For example, he'll also frequently say things like ""I don't think I could ever care about some one like this again if you left"" or ""I really don't think I'd be okay if you left me"". 

It also seems like he's becoming overly emotionally dependent on me, which I'm not really capable of dealing with at this point in my hectic life. He claims he's not, but then he'll mention things like ""I'm only happy when I'm with you"" or ""I think you're the only thing that I care about right now"". He also talks about us spending our lives together. This is further concerning since we don't even really want the same things from life. I want to travel and move around a lot (the idea of being tied down makes me feel really claustrophobic and trapped) but he wants to stay near his family. More importantly, he also told me once that his real dream is to be a stay at home dad. There's nothing wrong with that, it's a respectable aspiration, but I don't even want kids. I've tried to talk to him about this kind of stuff but he just kind of blows it off/sweeps it under the carpet by saying how he wouldn't really care as long as I'm with him. This seemed sweet at first but now it's really frustrating, since I don't want him to give up on his dream/what will make him happy just for me. Bottom line, we want different things from life and long-term it's obvious that it wouldn't really work out. I was enjoying what we had and living in the moment, but he's made it impossible to continue doing that.

I really don't know if I want to continue being with him, but I also really don't want to hurt him, since he's a genuinely a wonderful, caring person and has been through a lot in the past. I was happy with him, but it's gotten to the point where being with him is incredibly emotionally exhausting, as I constantly have to reassure him. I've talked to him a lot about it, but nothing's really changed. 

Please help, I just really want to minimize the hurt, but don't know how.

TLDR: I think I might be in an unhealthy relationship and I want to end it while minimizing the damage being done.

However, I work in retail and as you know customers can sometimes suck. Your boss can suck. And the job itself can suck. Unfortunately for me, all 3 suck (well not all customers). Now every day I wake up unhappy. My boss take advantage me and my kindness (inability to say no), customers say such mean things and treat me like 2nd class subhuman being, and in return I just become more and more emotionless. 

I don't smile anymore. There isn't any happy tone in my voice when I greet customers anymore. Even when I go home, anger from work stays with me. It wasn't until today when someone complained about the customer serious when I stopped and wondered if me not smiling and going above and beyond for customers anymore is the reason. I don't want to let some idiot ruin my day anymore and ruin it for the rest of the customers either. 

I don't know how to not let someone get to me and how to stop being so sensitive. I always tske things personally without meaning to. What can I do to change? At least the way I think.",05Apr2019,1
613,"Pretty dumb but I have a friend who recommends shows and like a good friend I always watch them or check them out, they’ve recommended over 6 and all being anime ( they aren’t into shows with real people ) 

The thing is, whenever I recommend a show it’s an immediate ‘no’ from them. I’ve recommended two of my all time favorite shows and I can never get them to watch it, not even check it out. It’s really annoying. I got them to watch one episode of one and I told them to continue and they gave me a hesitant ‘fine’ which sucks cause it makes me mad. I don’t know whether I should be glad for once they’re checking out smth I recommended or if I should just be like ‘you know what, don’t watch the show. I don’t give a shit anymore’

It’s kinda dumb but it really annoys me",05Apr2019,1
614,"The past year and a half has been a whirlwind for me. I am a 19 year old male who couldn't be more disappointed in the way life is going.

This time last year, my best friend got his first girlfriend. I was jealous and wanted to know what that was like. After searching for a potential gf, I met an absolutely stunning girl on Instagram. We talked every day for hours and hours and I felt it was really love. I was so happy with how things were going that most other things didn't mean as much to me then. I nearly lost friends and did badly in school because of my obsessive love for her.

Upon meeting her for the first time in person and having fun, the next day I asked her to be my girlfriend. She felt very uncomfortable that I asked her this and felt manipulated and used by me. She told me no. I felt crushed. We stopped talking for a few days but we eventually made up because we were really best friends and missed each other for those few days.

Around this time, my friend's girlfriend cheated on him and their relationship ended. He and most of my friends and family warned me that the girl I was into was not right for me and turned me into someone I wasn't. Flash forward six months later, we both hate each other and are not talking now. My overprotective obsessive behavior led to various arguments between us and she told me she felt it was best for us both to separate. I underwent a severe mental breakdown that night and begged her to change her mind, to no avail. I lost all respect for her and stopped missing her when she went on various Twitter tyrades, harassed me, and lied that I had abused her. It was shocking to see her stoop so low as to lie about me and obsessively tweet about me when she was the one that needed space.

She's out of my life now and I'm glad. Now I'm moving on to another girl but it hasn't gone so well so far. Tinder and Bumble have been busts and I have barely matched with anyone, I started to like another girl but she ended up permanently ghosting me, I don't have a job, car, girlfriend, only 3 close friends since high school, I hate how things are going.

When I see a couple at college or in public, I get angry. That should be me. What's wrong with me where I don't have many friends or a girl who liked me? I'm 19, this should have happened in high school. I get jealous of others' accomplishments too because I don't have a hobby or a talent and have never gotten recognized in my life before.

I feel like a worthless loser lately, and I hate how life has been treating me. I haven't seriously thought of anything terribly heavy like suicide but close to it, thoughts of ""if I died today would only 4 people show up to my funeral?"". But nothing too serious, I don't want to do anything that would harm me. I'm just terribly depressed. Lately I have missed the girl I used to love more, that giant space in my heart she used to hold is now so empty. I refuse to talk to her or look at her social media though.

I wish I could be stronger but it's not that easy.",05Apr2019,1

This does not come off in interactions, but I do feel like  they secretly think bad of me and they are acting or trying to be nice instead of natural feeling.

616,"Even tho I would say I'm more an introvert than an extrovert, I am not shy or scared of approaching people or talking to strangers. However, when it comes to making friends I seem to fail. 

It's also not that I can't be friendly with people or hang out with them but I feel uncomfortable when hanging with a lot of my ""acquaintances"" or I find excuses to not meet up. 

With the few friends I do have I am pretty close to and I know I can hang and talk with them however I feel like I need to get out there more and get to know new people with different personalities?

618,"I will be graduating from university over summer and moving back to my parents' house while job searching. I could be offered a job immediately (unlikely, but possible) or it could take several months to find something. I'm dreading the move because I will feel like a child again and like my life has no purpose. I will also have no money. My parents won't be charging me rent, but I'll still be broke because I won't have a job. 

I love my family but they don't do anything. They go to work, come home, watch TV, repeat. They don't really talk to each other and they have no social life or hobbies. Growing up I was constantly bored and I'm worried about feeling that way again. I will try to keep busy job searching, going for walks, exercising and meeting friends when they're available, but otherwise I will be bored senseless. 

My question is this - how do I cope with this move? How do I still feel like an adult, when I live with my parents and have no money or job? How can I keep myself from falling into a pit of despair while waiting for the all-important job offer? 

p.s. this move is inevitable because of money. Until I have money I cannot move out again. Ahhh",05Apr2019,2
619,"I'm 21 and I'm graduating from college next month. I will hold a bachelors degree in political science and a minor in legal studies. I've always just kind of expected myself to attend law school after undergrad and become a lawyer, and live a pretty well-to-do life. I don't have a lot of ""real life"" experience as I've mainly held part-time jobs throughout college.

I want to maybe represent professional athletes and negotiate their contracts after law school, but there are so many other things out in the world to do. I have other hobbies such as traveling and aviation, and I don't want to be tied down to something here. I feel like I have a fear of missing out.

I'm scared that if I don't go to law school, my job prospects will be slim. I'm afraid of only having a job that will monetarily break even with my bills every month. 

I want to travel the world for a summer, or maybe invest in apartments so I can do Airbnb and use that as passive income. The issue is that I just don't have a bunch of money to invest.

Then one day she says she likes me because I give her everything she wants and needs. I tell her I can't do anything since he's my bestfriend, but eventually we got deeper. 

I told the dude a couple times that she's losing feeling and what he should do because I didn't want them to end, but he didn't listen so she got tired of him and broke up.

Now we kinda wanna get together but I'm like nervous. People are suspecting that I like her but I keep blowing off. And like I don't wanna hurt the dude. And he has no evidence that I like her but I know he's mad. And I don't wanna lose him, and apparently people are kinda mad at me.

So the tl;Dr is what should I do? I've been friends with her for almost five months now and best friends with this guy for 4 years.

623,"I recently attended a ""mommy and me"" play group at our local library with my 7 month old. While I was there I saw a familiar face. I knew another mom from high school. She's a year younger than me and has a little one that's just a bit older than my daughter. I hadn't seen her for years, she said she moved away for post secondary and moved back about 2 years ago with her husband. We talked for a little bit while the babies played together. She was very nice.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't describe myself as a ""mean girl"" in high school, but I definitely went through a period of depression and self-loathing that made me a little hateful to be around at the same time I was mean to this girl/mom. For this post, I'll call her Jessy (not her real name). So, this takes place when I was 15/16 and Jessy was 14/15. We had a few shared friends from a large extended network of school friends. She was dating a guy friend of mine for about a month and he broke it off with her because he had a thing for me (him and I were long time friends and was unrequited interest on my end). I heard through the grapevine that she didn't like me (I don't blame her, I wouldn't have liked me either after what happened) and I just avoided her when I could (small town, small high school). Fast forward a few months and I started dating my ""high school sweetheart"", a guy 1.5 years older (he was in grade 12 when I was in grade 10). I get in his car one day after school and he waved to Jessy while she was walking by. I asked how he knew her and he said that their parents knew each other and she had a crush on him, but he wasn't interested because of the age difference. I immediately got jealous and for about a year and a half, until that BF and I broke it off, I'd give her dirty looks and roll my eyes at her in the halls. My friends and I would walk laps around the school at lunch hour and I'd make sure to walk by where her and her friends ate just to intimidate her, I guess. 16 year old me feels foreign to 27 year old me. When I was in my graduation year, I didn't behave like this towards Jessy. I don't really remember any interactions with her after 11th grade. I feel like I was a bully to her and it bums me out to think about how she may feel being around me now. I'm disappointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I brought up how I was feeling to my husband and my mom (separately) to see what they thought I should do. My husband said that I shouldn't apologize or address it because it was a long time ago and said ""it's just stupid high school girl nonsense that doesn't need to be brought back up"". He pointed out that we got along and said to just keep being normal at play group. My mom said that it's never too late to apologize for poor behavior and that an apology may be a foundation for a friendship in the future. I'm not sure what to do. I'm leaning towards apologizing to her in person at the next play group. I feel like bringing this to reddit may be helpful. ",05Apr2019,1

628,"Imma try to tell the story as short and as objective as I can. 

So I'm in my german class and one of my bestfriends sends me a message to buy her some pastries because she had no money on her. I will call her Amy. I told her to wait after my class finished then I would give em to her.

So the class ends and I go to the cafeteria and give her the pastries. I find her with other two friends. They were entering a discount code for bus rides. If your friends registered with your code, the app would give you like 3 dollars.

Anyways, I registered with another friends code, lets call her Anaya. For doing so, the app gave me like 10 dollars. Another friend came to the table and I urged him to enter my code. Amy snapped and we fought over who got to give him the code. I ended entering my code on his phone and got the 3 dollars. 

Amy got furious, and I told her to calm down because she could afford the ride more than I could (I messed up here, maybe). She told me to shut up and that she wont talk to me again. Anyways, we still talked for 3 more hours but with oneliners to each other. I had to go back to class so I left. 

At night, Anaya waited for me to take the bus with her, she was with Amy. Amy was telling some people we work with on an NGO how she fell from a horse. So I couldn't resist to jokingly say ""Ohh so thats why you ended up like that"" Note: she isnt disabled or anything. 

She snapped again, and screamed to the whole corridor: ""Don't talk to me ever again, you fucking lesbian""**

I left with Anaya, she kept saying things but I didn't respond. I dont know why, but I felt and still feel like something broke within me. When I asked Amy for advice, she changed the topic over and over again. 
When I got home, I noticed both of them left the groupchat. So I massaged Anaya to talk to her reasonably.

She did not answer, and when she finally did, she said 'I dont have anything to talk with you'

Amy talked to me and told me she talked with other members of our group. I asked her what should I do and then again, no answer. She only told me that I should do what I find best.

So I waited until the morning. I spammed her and she answered 'Why are you looking for the homophobic one now?'

I was left speechless, I knew that she was mostly done.

I don't know what to do, I don't have many friends and I thought that we would always be to watch our backs. No one except one friend of the gc wants to talk to me or give me advice. I feel really bad, even worse counting that I relapsed on my depression.

**We had an ongoing gag among the gc that Amy is homophobic because anytime I or the only gay guy of the group make comments about our love life, she makes disgusted faces. 

TL;DR: I fought with one of my best friends over a 3 dollar coupon on an app. No other friends except one want to give me advice or support. I dont know how to proceed give that we work on the same environment. (Sorry about my broken english)",05Apr2019,2

630,"So I’ve been working at my new company for a few months now and we just had a new hire onboarded and I feel like they have hired my replacement. 
In all honesty this might just be all in my head and me being just completely anxious and paranoid for no reason.
Here’s why I think this,
When I was hired on. I was brought on as a contractor. We had a verbal agreement when I started that I was to be flipped to a FTE during Q1. Or so I thought... it’s now Q2 and still a contractor through a staffing agency.
There was an open req in Q1 and they decided to add an additional resource instead of flip me to full time. Also this new employee is being trained on one of the accounts that I handle. So it makes me feel like they are training this resource to take over in the event I am let go. This might just me being paranoid but I don’t know. 
I also reached out to my management in order to discuss my Q1 performance to review the things I am doing well vs things that I am not doing well in order to foster my professional development. I have received no response, which is concerning. It makes me feel like they have decided to let me go so its not worth having a review.
Am I just being paranoid or should I be looking for a new job in the meantime to keep my head above water in case my fears are true.

631,"I spent 15 minutes watching an introduction to an online drawing course the other day. I was in such a good mood, I went for a short run. I had a similar experience when I tuned my guitar for an hour. I can't play guitar, but it still felt good.

But instead, I spend time online scrolling through various websites. Discord and reddit, for example, and I don't even have anyone on discord worth talking to. It's just _there_ and it's easy to open. I don't want to say I hate the people I talk to, but when someone messages me privately, even if they genuinely enjoy talking to me, I become so anxious I have to close the window immediately.

There is no sense of temporary gratification either. I just feel uncomfortable, like I shouldn't be doing this because not only do I dislike it, but it's unproductive. It feels very much like I'm draining my time down the toilet, so it makes no sense why I keep doing it when I know it makes me feel miserable. It's just habit at this point.

I couldn't decide if this was more appropriate for r/careerguidance or here, so I'm going to post to both. Thank you in advance for taking the time out of your day to read this!

To start with, I have no significant savings, but also no debt. I live at home with my parents and my partner, and work part-time because I'm having trouble finding full-time work (more on that later). The company I work for is likely to go into administration within the next few months, but I can't seem to land an interview anywhere else, let alone find a new job. I'm not being picky either. I'm applying to every position I'm eligible for, from retail to service to junior management to, well, everything.

While I do have a First-Class Honours degree in English lit. and Creative Writing, I have two significant things working against me: I'm heavily-tattooed, including my neck and hands, right down to my lower knuckles, and I have a *very* patchy CV - I have four gaps on my resumé ranging from between three to seven months as a result of time spent travelling overseas. The job I'm working now is actually the same one I worked when I was sixteen - same entry-level role, same company, still minimum wage - because it's all I could find when I came home and started university at the end of 2014 (graduated 2017, I was a late starter I guess).

I spent the first quarter of 2017 and then the majority of 2018 dealing with repeated retinal detachments in my left eye, which eventually cost me my sight in it, along with five years of sobriety. I've since been advised by my doctor to avoid any and all heavy lifting to prevent any chance of straining my remaining eye. During this time I was unable to look for a new job (I barely managed to complete my dissertation) and it was only around November of last year that I was finally able to begin job hunting again. After spending the past year and a half drinking heavily, I'll have been sober fifty days as of tomorrow.

I think that's everything covered really. I'm probably missing something important, but whatever.

649,"We've been working together at a cafe for a few months.

Here's what's working for us. I think we're both attracted to each other, because:

1) he compliments me in ways he doesn't other coworkers

2) he invited me to something and said trying to be slick ""don't think of it like a date"" but...cmon

3) he has texted out of the blue

4) we trust each other emotionally. His family . We've sat together a couple times on break and talked the whole time.

5) last night we bumped into each other at the grocery store, talked a while, and before parting, shared this amazing big hug. He went for a side hug, I made it a real hug, and he held on and hugged even tighter. We let go after a few seconds, and he said ""your eyes are glowing. That's a good thing"" and it was a little corny, but amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

My apprehensions:

1) about the emotional trust— sometimes I feel like a borderline therapist, and interactions revolve heavily on his family issues, so I sometimes distance myself a little, afraid he'll lean too much on me. I'm too much of a noodle to say ""I can't be your on-call therapist""

2) I think he has Asperger's because of the way's he's subtly socially unaware (if you met him you would understand, hard to describe)

3) the music/movies/sports we like don't really align.

I'm 98% sure we wouldn't work long term for the reasons listed, and so taking stuff further with him feels dishonest. Then I think, there's no contract saying we can't just have fun, and there's nothing wrong with being someone's crying shoulder even if it's temporary. Then again, we're coworkers and this could have unintended consequences. But I'm also a virgin attracted to a person who I seriously think is attracted to me ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

654,Hey guys so I kinda did something stupid. Me and my m8s were fooling around (slightly high) and we went into a local Scientology chapter just to goof around. I asked one of the dudes what he recommended to start off and I bought one of their books using credit card. I didn't give them my number or CVV thing but I did put it into one of those credit card pin machines (it was just your average one you'd find at anystore. It wasn't unusual in anyway). When they asked for my name and stuff I gave fake info. Am I in danger of some sort of financial fuckery? is there anything they can do? Is there anything I should do? I can give more info if needed.

656,"throwaway account because duh.

i was snooping through my mom’s drawers looking to see where she put the money she’s giving me to buy a passport. i found her old wallet/purse thing in her drawer under a bunch of underwear so i figured it was in there. i open it and there’s condoms (kind gross to me but thats besides the point) and two straws that are cut probably the length of half of my pinky with white powder residue on it. immediately i’m like “oh shit what the hell is this??” and see theres a square paper folded up in a triangle with it. i open it and see a bit of white powder. at first i think it’s the BC ibuprofen things she likes to take (they come in little papers that you just drink with water). but then i realise that those are folded into rectangles, not squares. so i kind of freak out and put the paper back and put everything back where it was. immediately i think her newest shitty boyfriend is influencing her and it upsets me because my mother has had a history of choosing men that are terrible for her. i’ve already had my fair share of bad experiences with men because of her and i never want anything to do with any of these new flings she has. 
i’ve just texted my two sisters (one that i havent spoken to for months because we were on bad terms for something else) saying i need to talk to them serious concern our mom but not to mention it to her. i don’t know if i’m overreacting or what but i just have had so many traumatic experience in the past and this is not something i want worsening what i already going on with me.

But since he got a girlfriend we've been getting distant and it's not just him it's with everyone I know.

So I started to make conversation  with my friend(m) ,we talked for a bit but then he cut it short to fuck his girlfriend and some of her friends which I didn't mind, actually I'm really happy for him since he suffers from some mental and physical issues.

All of this started to make me think (and no I'm not a nice guy who hates chads)
Why am I still a lonely virgin?(kinda funny)now I'm not trying to bum myself here and I know people fall for others for different reasons. 

I'm a average guy, average grades, average physical abilities etc. In class I was rated 10/10 personality 8/10 looks with beanie 10/10, since I was brought up by women I'm chill around them and I'm not scared by periods and I'm good at comforting people but since I'm a guy I also have a horny, creepy angry piece of shit. I've been told that I'm scary when I'm angry and that my resting face is a scary glance or some shit like a cheap manga. 

I like cleaning, art, reading and manga/anime (the reading is what I think contributing to being distance) I like my alone time but I get lonely and going outside is nice sometimes.

I hate loud crowds and crowds in general. You get the point I'm trying to make I'm not that bad of a person in fact I thought girls would like people like me but I was wrong I'm just good at making friends. Every single girl I ask out which isn't a lot 
I mean the last person I ask out was a year ago (we were close friends) I thought she liked me since she said she loved me so on, anyway every girl I ask out says no or try's to ignore me one girl dated for half a year out of sympathy.
Every time I get happy i think of all of this and get really fucking depressed and can't think straight I just don't understand why girls don't like me, I mean why one girl offered me nudes I said ""sure"" but at the time I didn't really feel comfortable in the end she called me a creep, pedo (I was three months older) and other things.

662,"Hi,

Backstory: I was raised Mormon. My mom was a born and raised SLC Mormon and even attended BYU Provo. Then two years ago my father died at the age of 83.

Last year she started dating again. Her first relationship was with a man.However, now she is dating another woman.

I have always been a gay rights advocate and supporter of both gay marriage and adoption, albeit being Mormon.

I had a hard time dealing with the fact of her dating again, even when it was the other man.Bc I had seen her with my father 24/7 for well over 30 years. But now, with her dating a woman is totally new to me.

Even though I am a supporter, I however, never saw this coming from her. I always saw her as ""the goody two shoes Mormon"" aka ""Molly Mormon"" of our family. So this is still a HUGE shock to me, and its a HUGE pill for me to swallow, even though I do support it. She is happy and thats what matters to me.

However, I am looking for books, movies, documentaries, basically ANY and all media, I can get my hands onto to help me cope with this transition. ",05Apr2019,2

In the holiday I mentioned, I went out drinking, and in my intoxicated state I decided to call my parents. As Icalled my parents, I came out as homosexual over the phone since we were having a joyful conversation, and I thought the conversation wouldn’t be in jeopardy. As soon as I mentioned it my mothers tone quickly changed, I tried to ask her how she felt but she became extremely short with her words and her tone changed completely.  I eventually hung up and fell asleep shortly after. The only other time I called her whilst on holiday was when I was coming home and in the airport. When I arrived back that’s when things got strange, my mother and father hardly even said hello to me coming in for the first time in a week. Once I was home I wanted to sleep, so I went up to my room to sleep,  and that’s when things got very strange. I went to sleep and I hear tapping on my walls, in my confused state I was somewhat scared so I just kept listening. I eventually heard what sounded like my mother whispering into my bedroom door, I was so confused by this point I didn’t even want to believe it was real, so I eventually just tried going back to sleep. ever since then things in my room have been moved and my parents are asking me questions about how I’ve been feeling, I’m extremely worried about this since they’re also adamant on making me food, and it’s one of the only things they actually give me more than one word answers for explaining.

So recently found myself stuck in a rut working a job that made me unhappy in a place that made me unhappy so I made the ultimate decision of packing my bags and leaving. I moved to Texas where within my 2 months I have found an amazing job and have really grown to be a better person working for an ambulance company as an EMT with great opportunities for my future career. The issue is my funds right now are none existant as I just started working there. I'm about $8000 in debt and share a vehicle with the friends and there family that I live with. Downside is a lot of times I am on call and I want to try to prevent the issue of not getting to work because of it. There is no real way for me to plan ahead of time. So...

I started car shopping and trying to find something reasonable and doable, I applied with USAA and with nonexistent credit and all my bills being under the table through my family or the family I now live with, I have nothing to back a loan. Even with a cosign through my mother it seems like it might be a stretch as I only have one pay stub at the moment. I found a great car thats used and in great condition where I have recieved discounts and incentives for working EMS. The total comes out to 12.8k but without a downpayment or any idea of where I might be able to get a loan I feel stuck.

Right now it seems the best option is to wait a couple months and save as best as possible to use as a downpayment for a vehicle with a cosign, but it feels like walking on thin ice when borrowing a car and being on call unable to plan in advanced. 

So for the advice I'm looking for is other opinions and ideas for what I can do or what might be my best course of action. Anything at all would be great! Thank you to everyone in advanced!",05Apr2019,1

I was at my family reunion at a park in California the other day and I whipped my dick out once I saw a nice looking gaggle (of geese) down yonder. This was after a couple mai tais, so my desire to copulate with the avian kingdom is increased by thrine.

Anyhow, I dropped a line on the sexy gaggle. I cupped my hands around my mouth and gave a few good ones.

*Honk*
*Honk*
*Honnnnnnnk*

At this point, they craned their long sexy necks around to investigate my love call.

(Disclaimer: I've fornicate with a lot of feathered floozies, but never a gregarious gaggle as such)

I had made a huge mistake, the long necked beasts of my dreams identified my pulsating schlong as a *big tasty worm* and immediately went into attack formation. I held still, thinking their vision was based on movement. My eyes locked on one Canuck Duck, who I assume was the alpha. What I didn't see was the two at my sides. One jumped through the bushes at me - I was flanked. I had no idea they were pack animals. ""Clever girl"" I said, as I was knocked over. Before I knew it, I had three geese taking turns biting at my 'worm' while I lay on my back. I laid there, screaming and cursing my creator. Their beaks were now bloody, with bits of my cock meat hanging in shreds.

""Oh god not my balls!"" I yelled, just as the gaggle started to gobble my hairy bean Stantons.

The pinching was incredible, they got mouthfuls of hair and gulped it down with their bloody beaks. The last thing I remembered was one of my actual testies being ripped from my sack and swallowed.

Anyways - it was a learning experience, and I lost half a shaft and one ball before my grandfather chased them away with an umbrella and called 911.

I managed to get a rare job in my field where I can have a pretty big impact. I spend most of my time alone visiting different sites and don’t have a lot of accountability. I work two days a week with my supervisor we usually leave at least two hours early, in my lazy mind I figured this is how we could normally operate. 

Yesterday my boss asked me to do a summary of EVERYTHING I’ve worked on at a certain site for the last two months. When I asked them what it was for, they were vague, saying they were making sure the site was getting was their “supposed to”.  I’m pretty sure someone complained that they weren’t receiving enough coaching or training from me. 

Each April we renew our contracts and my boss was typing them up today. They said that I would receive a contract for another month until the end of my probation, and then we would “look” at it after that. This was the first time I’ve been told I there was a probationary period and I assumed I would be renewed for another year. On top of it all,  my boss told me a former employee contacted them trying to get their old job back (which I now have). 

I looked at my original contract and it did not have an end date and didn’t state anything about probation. It seems like my boss is trying to send me a message without coming right out and saying it. I HATE this uncertainty and it’s really fucking with my head. 

When I first started I was really motivated, but now (like every job I’ve had) I can’t wait to leave and go home. I feel like I oversell myself and always end up disappointing my employers. When I first started I overheard my boss telling their Manager that they were glad I didn’t need “hand holding” because they have been too busy to walk me through everything, so I’m really thrown off by this sudden change of attitude. 

While I want to take responsibility for my actions, I’m feeling like the example set for me and the amount of training is PART of the reason why I’ve already started slacking off. On the other hand, I have taken advantage of the fact I’m not very closely monitored and I don’t work for the sites/companies that I’m visiting. 

I’m so upset and nervous, beating up on myself for being a fuck up. If I’m in my “dream job” shouldn’t I feel motivated to work hard, seek more responsibility and be where I should be, when I should be?!

683,"This is an alternate account as my friends know my reddit account. I (F21) have recently moved in with my roommate (F27) at the start of this year. This is my first time living away from home. My roommate and I study the same course and are in the same cohort. She has been living in the area for the past year. She has her own group of friends that she hangs out with. Since I am new here I have been trying to find my own group of friends and have just started to get close with. I am a fairly introverted person and I see the home environment as a place to unwind and be with myself. My roommate however is more social and extroverted and likes to talk to me about her life or ask to hang out together when I just want to be alone at home. I don’t mind this sometimes but it is getting exhausting. 

Another thing I have noticed is that whenever I do go out, she’s always asks where I’ve been when I come home and in a lot of detail. She would ask something like ‘where did you go’ and I would reply ‘out with friends’ thinking that would be enough but she would keep asking for more details such as ‘with who’ and so on. And when I plan on going out with friends she will ask if she can come as well. Now when she does hang out with her friends I don’t try to invite myself and once I did ask her where she was going and she said ‘to hang out with friends’ I left it at that. 

I have tried to invite her to join with my friends a few times in the past because she asked to come and but last minute bails. I feel like she tries to join when it’s at most convenience to her. It has started to make me annoyed every time I want to go outside for gym or with friends because she would always ask where I’m going and if she can join. I don’t know if it’s a jealousy thing but I would just want to have a group of friends that doesn’t consist of my roommate. I don’t hate my roommate she is very great person but sometimes I just find her too much for me seeing her all the time. It’s also hard because we are in the same cohort so do everything together. 

Is her asking where I’m going a normal thing for roommates? And am I a bad person for not wanting her to hang out with my friends? If we plan something together I don’t mind if she comes but most of the time, my friends and I plan without her and she asks to join when asking what I’m doing and it’s hard for me to say no since we are all in the same cohort. What do I do if I made plans to go out with friends that day and she asks where I’m going? ",05Apr2019,2
684,"I went on vacation for 3 days. When I came back, I took my dog on the first walk I’ve taken her on and she pooped a grape. Grapes are arguably the most dangerous food item a dog can eat as the toxin is highly unpredictable and doesn’t start shutting down their kidneys for 24-48 hours following consumption. I immediately asked my roommate if she had any chance of getting into grapes while I was away. My roommate had cleaned the refrigerator the day before I returned and threw away a cheese plate. The plate was not thrown into the garbage can; it was thrown into an open paper bag next to the garbage can. My dog got into the paper bag, ate all of the cheese and grapes, and my roommate did not tell me anything had happened (thinking that the dog was fine/probably didn’t want to stress me out on vacation, even though she had texted me on a vacation day saying rent was too much and she was going to be financially strapped because of it). She did not know that grapes (or any food) were poisonous to dogs as she has never had a dog. 

Anyway. I immediately called an emergency vet as it was then after hours for a real vet, and we went in. 

The dog is fine. The vet bill was (surprisingly) only $300 after running a kidney panel and flushing her with water. She needed monitoring for the next 24 hours, so I took the night and as my roommate had no work the next day, she monitored her while I was working (but said she had lunch plans, which I asked her to cancel or rearrange for home since she should take some responsibility. She did. But I also feel like I should t have had to ask). 

She said that due to her finances, she couldn’t help with the vet bill. At the time, I was very stressed out and don’t remember if I agreed to this. She was crying because she almost killed my dog, said she never wanted to watch her while I was away again, and I was just trying not to guilt her. 

Now, I am feeling like it SHOULD be a financially shared responsibility even though she is going through a hard time financially. We all go through financial troubles and we all should also take responsibility when things go wrong because we were careless. I let her know that she could pay me what she feels is fair when she is able to, but that I don’t feel it is fair for me to foot the entire bill immediately after coming home from a vacation and having not known what happened while I was away. 

I’m kind of worried about the ramifications on the friendship due to me asking for her to pay some. I know with good friendships, sometimes you should just let things go in order to preserve the relationship, and I don’t know if this is one of them. Do I let it go? Or should she pay me (whatever she feels is fair and when she can) without it hurting the relationship? What would you do? This friend is like family to me and has been there for me through my absolute lowest points for the last five years. I just feel like she’s letting me down with carelessness in this and other things right now.

I wanted to go get a teaching license but doing so would cost me 20k and I'd probably start out making less than i currently do.

I feel stuck in a career field i never intended to get into where I'm constantly watching others do the kinds of jobs i thought I would do. I tried going for an MA but dropped out bc a)working full time and school full time destroys my health and b)I was meeting people with master's in my field of interest that couldn't even find full time positions. Ive been told I'm doing everything right , but no dice. 

What should I do? Keep working security and try to get promoted so that one day i can have enough money to go back to school or branch into a field I'd enjoy more (education, museum programming, collections, social work, caretaking, general civil service jobs)? I feel like despite working hard and serving my community , ive disappointed the people i grew up with since i was ""gifted and talented"".",05Apr2019,1

690,"So a little backstory on my life. I’m 17M and I’ve been playing football for about 8/9 years now.

The problem that I have rn is I don’t really enjoy outside-of-school football (i.e I only care about HS football not University or Club) and my parents keep pressuring me to go play in tournaments and try to get a scholarship with football.

I really don’t care enough that I would actually hate life if I would have to play 4 more years where football is everything and I also want to go into Music in Uni so those two things I believe would conflict with each other so much.

I know I can get a small scholarship from football, I talk to many coaches and they all like me, but it’ll only be small and less what I would make from a job.

691,"I'm [23F] and I'm kind of a fucking failure. I don't know what to do with my life anymore and honestly I'm pretty sure this post is just gonna get buried so I don't even know why I'm trying. 

The tl;dr is I came from a shitty abusive home, tried going to college, got really sick due to a mold allergy in my dorms, moved out and eventually dropped out, bounced around, got arrested for protecting myself, lost all my stuff and am now sleeping on the floor in my abusuve mother's living room. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have a car and I can barely hold down a job more than a few months. I've had like over 15 jobs and it never seems to work out. Granted, most of it was contract work/work-study but it still doesn't help me. Without a car the few jobs I do get offered are often too far out of reach for me and with bad credit, no money, and no license it's impossible for me to get a car. Even when I have a job I end up commuting anywhere from 2 hours each way a day. I've done everything from administrative, to soliciting donations door to door, to IT, to customer service and retail. 

I've tried killing myself and landed in the hospital in the past year and have done 2 out patient programs. I can barely function and I've tried so many medications that either don't work or make me straight up projectile vomit. I read tons of self-help books, I try to do yoga. Everything. I'm trying literally everything in my power to get better but I can't. I finally found a trauma therapist and I'm going to that, but I'm afraid even that won't help me. I'm trying to figure out if there's something wrong with my hormones and my psych thinks I'm sleep deprived from sleep apnea. I'm waiting for those appointments. 

I don't know what to do. I can't hold down a job and then am unemployed for months at a time. I've even tried applying to jobs programs (like year up) and they've literally told me that they couldn't let me in because they didn't believe I could support myself and/or needed income disclosure from my mother (who refused to give any to me).

693,"I started working at Wendy’s about a month and a half ago (need college money) and I’m starting to dislike it.

I was trained on sandwiches, which I love because everyone leaves me alone, but I was thrown onto register after someone quit. I received little training. When I work register, people forget I’m human, and often times they look at me like I’m an idiot when I don’t understand their mumbling. Today, a man came in and I noticed he was acting strange. He gave me a 20, and I was looking for the counterfeit pen, but nobody knew where it was. I asked someone for help and they told me to hurry up because there were like 20 more people behind him.

After finding out it was fake, my manager gave me a verbal warning and said he was gonna write me up. He told me to go slower when someone gives me fake money. I didn’t want to argue him that nobody would assist me on finding the pen, so I simply said “I’ll be more cautious next time. I apologize,” clocked out, and left.

I was gonna start crying after finding out I was 20 dollars short, and I was already damaged by the woman who had the audacity to call me dumb after not giving her extra pickles. I want to find a new job, but it’s so hard nowadays and I can’t quit or risk losing this. What made them think I was fit for register?

694,"It was only today that I really just started really questioning it (probably from my increased paranoia from watching conspiracy videos) and now that I’ve really thought about it, it’s been happening for a while. 

I’m a high school student and I’ve had my cell number since 2nd grade, and I’ve never encountered something like this until it started three years ago. I get called by a number, one that’s typically listed in my state, but very occasionally listed as “United States”. They’re, from what I can remember, all different numbers but occasionally are from the same town/city. I open with a “Hello?” and only receive dead air. I say “Hello?” again and then they hang up. I’ve pretty much responded to the dead air calls the same way since they started in my freshman year. They’ve always just been dead air and never really say anything, but occasionally the dead air will crackle. I’ve also missed calls from what I assume to be the dead air numbers (because they comen from a town in my state) and they don’t leave a message. 

I also want to add that the calls aren’t frequent enough that they annoy me. They’re actually spaced out just enough that I only really remember them until they call again. Which, I guess, is why it took me so long to question it.

There's just something I wish was different, and that's our sexual differences. I am naturally very sexual and kinky, and he is vanilla ice cream. He doesn't want to have sex often, and when he does he wants 20 minutes of the routine stuff and that's it. 

Don't get me wrong, he knows how to make me feel good and I never have trouble 'getting there'. I just wish he would be more open to stepping outside of his comfort zone. We've talked about it, and he is just the kind of guy whose not comfortable being aggressive with women, even upon their request. He says he loves and respects me too much to do something like slap me or call me a b**ch in bed, even though that's all I want to experience. 

I love the fact that he's such a good person and all that, but I want to know what it's like for a guy to screw me like he's trying to break me. I already know I like being choked, held down, and having my hair pulled, and he's done that a few times for me, but I still just want more. I want to be dominated.

698,"Ok, so I recently got my first job working at a local Domino's, and I've worked there for about a month and a week. The pay is pretty good, but I really don't like the work itself, and I have a really volatile schedule as well (I'm in my last 3 months of High School). I've had to make some minor changes to my schedule almost every week, and it's clearly pissing off the manager. Which is fair, I mean, I can't exactly blame him for not liking when he draws a schedule every week to which I reply ""Hey ____, I can't work on this or that day this week. Sorry.""

This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't leaving to work at a summer camp right after School gets out, and I won't be able to work pretty much at all when I get to college, for various reasons. I love the place, but I'm not getting paid a whole lot for the summer, so the majority of the spending money I'm going to have for my first couple of college years is going to come from what I make in the next couple of months. I don't spend a whole lot, so it's not out of the question, but I also can't afford to waste a lot of time.

I've just finished applying to one of those food-delivery apps (Automated system said yes and the kit is on its way), and I plan to use that now to get the money I'll use when I'm off at college, but how do I leave my current job in a professional manner?

To complicate matters further, my store's manager is leaving for vacation in a few days, from the 9th to the 25th of April (this month). I could wait until he gets back to tell him, but I would REALLY prefer to not have to do that, if possible. Waiting another 2 weeks to then give a 2 weeks' notice is something I don't want to have to do.

And to top it all off, schoolwork is kicking itself into high gear, right as I began working. Classes that have had little to no homework earlier this year are now giving it out in spades, and the already difficult classes show no sign of slowing down.

How do I go about quitting? My first instinct would be to say something along the lines of ""recent changes to my school schedule make working here any longer an impossibility."" But I don't know hardly anything about this (again, first ever job).

I think, more than anything, I just need a starting off point for this whole thing.",05Apr2019,1

700,"Well, here goes...

I am an assistant in a preschool classroom. I'm 20 years old and I got this job straight out of high school. I worked at this school last year, and this is my second year. So earlier in the year there was a little girl who said I woke her up from her nap by choking her. (! Absolutely NOT true. Under any circumstance did this happen, or come close to happening.) My boss and lead teacher were defending me adamantly and the situation died down and after a while the girl said she was unsure if it had happened. We thought she might've had a bad dream, as there were no marks or anything otherwise to tell you that it happened (because it didn't). Anyways, it is over with. Then, a few months later a boy apparently went home and said I grabbed his arm in a way that he ""didn't like"". Again, no marks, or anything just that he didn't like it. When he was asked again about it, he said he just didn't like the way I spoke to him. I have overall very positive moments with the children in the classroom most all days, but there have been times where my words upset children. Naturally. The mother who said this has a history of fabricating stories. Not important. Anyways, these two incidents happened but I just assumed it was bad luck.

So, here's where it boils down. Yesterday my boss came through doing a tour. There was a child who had a push pin (needle with handle) and was saying he was going to poke me and that the police would have to come. This child has a documented and recorded history of verbal threats. He had the push pin in his hand and was sitting criss cross applesauce with his head in between a cubby thwarting about (literally about to rear his head at me). In a quick action, I grabbed the push pin and scooted his body over about a foot (still he is in criss cross applesauce) and quickly got up to place the push pin high above the cubbies where no child could reach. My boss of course walks right in at the moment that this happens. Whole day passes, nothing else happens.

The next day (today), is standing in the hallway watching me while I was having another interaction with the same child. It was nap time and he was not sitting on his mat, running around, finding any excuse to not sleep. He asked to use the bathroom so we sent him. He comes back. He's up again crying about needing to pee again. After being told no and he could wait a few minutes because he literally JUST, he started screaming cry. The only thing I did in that moment was say his name, and walk over to him. My lead teacher also goes over to him. We tell him that he can go again but we will be standing close by to be sure he actually goes and is not playing. He agrees and I wait by the door. When he comes out, he claims there are no towels so I grab him a rag. I ask if he can them sit down again. He said ""NO!"". I said ok, what can I do for you. He was saying his face was wet from tears so I hand him the same rag to wipe his face with. I ask if everything is ok then and he says still no. I then ask if he needs a hug and he says yes and then I can finally get him to lay on his mat. A few minutes later, my boss comes through. She proceeds to sit in the entire afternoon and then after school, asks if she can have a minute to talk to me.

She starts with how ""mortified"" she was that someone coming through for a tour saw me treat a child that way. (OK, I get it. It is embarrassing to have an altercation with a difficult child, AKA I am also embarrassed.) However, working in a preschool classroom is NOT all sunshine and daisies and I expect most people to know and understand that there will be difficult and dangerous situations. She then proceeds to say that I spoke inappropriately to the child and that she ""heard it"" because she was in another room close by. She claims I was yelling at him. Myself and my lead go on to tell her that it wasn't ME yelling, but rather him. She claims that's not what she heard. She then goes on to say that maybe she shouldn't have defended me in the other situations/accusations. She says that this behavior I exhibited was extremely inappropriate. She claims that I shouldn't have touched him no matter what because I need to consider ""outside perspective"" and how it looked when she walked through that classroom without prior knowledge to the situation. There are a lot more details to this story and my relationship with my boss, but I am basically feeling abused by my administration. I am extremely hurt by this accusation. It feels very personal and I feel like I did my best job.

I have put so much into this job and I'm just feeling very discouraged. I have already decided I am leaving at the end of the year but I honestly feel like just leaving now and not coming back. I have about 2 months left of working here but I am just so tired of it and feeling very emotionally drained. If this was not coherent, I apologize. If you have any questions so I can better explain my story I would love to answer and any advice would be good. I feel very embarrassed and never want to show my face there again.

Edit: After rereading my post, I remembered a few details. She says that she was unsure but she THINKS that she saw me come out of the bathroom with my hands on his shoulders. I denied this because no, that didn't happen. I was outside the bathroom and I did not touch his shoulders. This to me was odd because WHY\* would she be forcing the narrative that I would hurt this child?Also: When I initially moved the same child the day before, he was not upset after I moved him. He immediately calmed down and we were able to go back to something else right after. He was not bothered by me moving him, he just literally switched off. There have been many times where I wanted to leave my job. I have 2 months left and I just can't stand to go back anymore.",05Apr2019,1

706,"At my job, my role is somewhat unique in that I unofficially serve as the trainer, quality control, subject matter expert, boss's right hand, researcher, procedure writer, etc...  About 5 years ago, I trained a new hire and she was pretty run of the mill, average trainee, average performer.  She's been considered ""trained"" for several years now.  Over those years we have become very close personal friends.  We spend time together outside of work, love on each other's kids, all the things that good friends do.  We are open books and trust each other fully.  We love each other.  

In the last year or so, she has been struggling with performance.  A lot of errors and mistakes coming across the boss's desk that end up on me to confirm the mistake, question why she might have done something, etc...  To FFWD, she's been kind of high &amp; low.  I hate doing her regular quality audits because they are not good and they go to our manager.  But, it's my job and she knows that and she knows I have to be fair, so she's understanding.  I've offered myself wide open for her to reach out to for help, questions, etc... Whatever it took to get her on track.  She's aware of the issue (undocumented at this point) and she is really bothered and worried about it.

Today, I had another couple of things of hers to check out for the boss.  When I checked them out, I found she was wrong and found some other things that were wrong as well.  So, I decided I would just grab a random sample of some of her recent work and check it over.  I want to pick out the areas where she is struggling and work with her on them.  I wasn't asked to do this and I have plenty of other work to do.  For the most part, I did it on my own time after the end of the workday.  I didn't spend company time trying to do a ""favor for a friend"".  Well, it was terrible.  Worse than I thought.  I don't know what is happening.  Her work is just a complete mess with gross errors, mistakes and completely overlooked important things.  She knows that I'm doing this as a favor to her and I was honest that it wasn't looking so good and that I would get her my notes when I was done.  She was very grateful that I'm looking out for her and commented that she owes me big.  (No.  She doesn't.) 

Here's where I need advice.    First, I'm curious if this sounds inappropriate for me to even give her special treatment.  My goal is always to support, mentor and grow my team members and avoid throwing them under the bus.  That is part of my role.  But am I out of line to spend personal time and work with her under the radar?  I don't think I can bring myself to just bring up the issue with the boss.  I don't technically have any obligation to do so.  My other option would be to look the other way and let her crash and burn.  But, I know she's capable.  I've seen it.  

Next, I don't know how in the world to approach her with the horrible results.  She's going to be upset even though it's not official or on record.  She *wants* to improve.  She already thinks the boss thinks she's a moron.  But we have a really great &amp; caring manager that wants people to succeed.  I've decided I would hold the results until next week because I don't want to ruin her weekend and I don't want her to find them first thing Monday morning.  But, it's just so awkward and uncomfortable!  This is why they say not to date in the workplace.  But they never say not to become good friends.  How can I balance this and what else can I possibly do?  There's a reason I have passed on management for years and this is it.  I don't like telling people they are failing.  ",05Apr2019,1

honestly I'm sad really fucking sad I feel like a  Schrödinger's cat I don't know if I'm dead or alive it happened so fast it feels like a dream, it started recently when my friend(m) said he had found someone I was so happy for him since he suffers from depression and some other illness that I don't think he'd be happy with me sharing(like it matters) he's like my brother my best friend I've know him 3-4 years and I'd hate to loose contact, but anyway once he told me I had extremely bad luck on the week he told me I had a football match for charity where I fractured my elbow a week later hearing test day later smash my head on a brick wall now I've got a really bad cold not to mention my distancing with my friends, and all I can think about is falling in love so I can relate to him but funnily enough this is where this starts.

I was talking to him over text and he cut it short to fuck his girlfriend and some of her friends, he smokes pot ,athletic you get where I'm going with this so you can understand  this more here's my personality.

(I was bummed out and had a cold) I'm not that athletic but once my elbow heals I'm starting to workout, I'm good at cooking and my stakes are pretty banger, I like responsibility so I clean a lot and act like a dad to my mum. I was brought up by women so I'm chill around them and I've bought pads and shit for my sister no problems, I'm also good at comforting people and I've been told I'm very caring  but I'm also very tuff (not trying to bum myself btw) I'll stick up for my friends so questions ask unless their in the wrong I'll Deescalate the situation. I like art ,reading ,cooking cleaning ,manga/anime ,I'm a very reserved person but I'm not disgusted by people who are sexual I'm actually pretty open I'm only reserved when i comes to love and being around ""friends"" not best-friends if you get me, I'm hard working but like to chill. tbh I thought I'd be popular with girls and I was at one point I was asked out a lot but I chose an ugly as fuck girl we had a lot in common so I asked her out (btw this was long ago like 3 years ago) she waited a week then said ""sure?""

This guy used to bully me throughout high school. He's a douchebag prick.

I see him at my gym or at work and he's always flirting girls. Girls love him.

It makes me miserable inside. Every women who flirts with him, I fuck loathe.

Douchebag bullies are rewarded with sex. It makes me he hate the world.

I'm not jealous toward any man. If a man is noble and women love him, I couldn't feel happier for him. But when I see assholes and bullies and douchebags being rewarded by girls, it eats me up inside.

712,"Hello All,

I will try to keep this as short as possible. For the record, at the time of writing this I am incredibly pissed off and want to make the best decision I can which is why I am here for your opinion and advice. 

BACKGROUND:

I am a 4th year college student in my final year of a bachelors degree in aeronautical engineering. This course has a mandatory project for final year students where we have to design from scratch and build a radio controlled plane which complies to specified requirements which can be quite difficult. This years brief was quite difficult and took a lot of time to get right. There was roughly 14 people on the team. 

It took one whole semester (14 weeks) to DESIGN this aircraft. It took another whole semester (14 weeks) to BUILD this aircraft. This happened while we had other modules, assignments and exams. 

I was the head of the wings team for this project. i.e I was the head of a group of 4 whose specific job was to design the wing for this aircraft. We had the most workload when compared to all of the other groups because of the design brief. The wing had to unfold and lock into place automatically, done by radio control. This took a lot of work. 

I mentioned I was the head of the wings team, there was 4 on the team. One particular individual contributed almost nothing to this project. He barely attended any of the meetings, the ones that he did attend he did not contribute towards them in any significant way. We were constantly waiting for him to submit work assigned to him which he submitted late on multiple occasions, and on top of that, the work he submitted was not satisfactory. This meant myself and the other 2 members of the group had to redo this work. 

When it came to building the aircraft he was not helpful in any way. He showed up in the lab every now and then but even when he was there he wasn't very helpful. 

Everyone in the wings group and the entire team realized this was happening. But nothing was done about it as at the end of the day we are all friends. Myself and this individual are not close friends, but we are friends nonetheless which is why this is a complicated situation for me. 

THE ISSUE:

The aircraft was built, tested and flown. It satisfied all of the mission requirements but unfortunately it crashed during some aerobatics which meant the plane was written off. Some people decided to salvage the aircraft including members of the wings team (which i am the leader) without me knowing. Unfortunately my friend decided to take a whole outboard section of the wing (More than one third of the wing) for himself. He has taken this home with him as a souvenir yet I do not have a part of this wing. 

He did not make any significant contributions to the design or the manufacturing of this wing. Yet he has taken a significant part of it home with him even though I, the wings team leader, do not have any section of the wing. 

MY QUESTION:

What do I do? What do I say to him? Other people on the team are on my side but I want to make the right decision without ruining a friendship if possible. I am incredibly pissed off as this has been 2 semesters of work...... my entire final year of my bachelors degree. Please help, I really don't know what to do.

714,"Hi Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I need your advice. I don't really know what I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no diploma, bachelors or master degree. I live in my own flat and don't own a car. I have only one smartphone from my fulltime job which i also use privately. So my work is with almost all the time, even if it's probably just subconscious.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working fulltime developing a SaaS for another company. Besides, I am a consultant. And when I find free time I want to create a SaaS on my own. Often times i wanted to quit my fulltime job, but somehow it is keeping me from doing so as it gives me a bit of security and I might earn a bit from the profit, if there will be one in the future. I also improve my coding skills and learn how to create my own SaaS. The work besides is in the field, which I liked a lot in the last two years. But somehow i struggle to focus on doing this work on the side and it isn't so much fun since i need to keep all the documents, bills, pay taxes and all the other tasks there are. I also need to thing about that work almost always in my free time now, as I might get a new call. Or I might need to finish some work very fast because of some deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a lot of health issues, starting from gluten sensitivity to knee problems which are keeping me back a lot. I almost can't eat anywhere outside and I always need to take big care of what I will buy. Else i might get health problems for the next days and i can't focus on anything as my mind is foggy. Going the shopping mall is also very energy consuming for me as i need to watch out for what food i can eat and carrying all this food home is heavy for my knees. And doing this almost every second day is hard. I could let everything get delivered by them, but I am a bit paranoid with giving my address away as I am working in the security field. And because I am a big minimalist, I also don't want to create a new account.

&amp;#x200B;

My minimalism. I don't own much and if I have clothes, I soon have almost the same of every cloth a lot of times, becaus it costs me a lot of energy to decide what to wear. My drying rack is full all the time as it is so energy consuming for me to fold them and put them in the wardrobe. When I don't do this, there is a big pile of clothes on it soon and this costs me also a lot of energy as there is so much stuff undone. The drying rack, the kitchen, the bathroom. And if i don't have everything clean, I can't focus on my work and I always need to think about the tasks subconciously. The same thing is with hard drives, i take soo much time to always keep the content on my hard drive clean. I also always reorganize the data or rename the folders or find new structures. But I do this so often, i never stay with one decision. I looked so many times for new ways to structure, organize or sort data on your hard drive. But there is too much different stuff and not one good guide. I somehow need a guide for a lot of stuff, or is it just structure I need? Did I maybe do not have structure because I didn't stay in school longer?

&amp;#x200B;

My smartphone is the same, I don't have a lot of apps. And if I need 2 apps just for messaging, it is a pain for me. My emails also need to be clean everytime.

&amp;#x200B;

Over 150 books are in my bookshelf currently and I would love to read everyone of them. But if i start reading one, I often stop in the middle of it. And then i don't read for weeks. And somehow I have the need to sell all my books as this is too much stuff to own. But i also can't own a Kindle, because then i always want to keep this one clean and without books.

&amp;#x200B;

I also often look for every stuff in my flat, which i could throw away. Old Bills, Boxes and so on. And I really do this often.

&amp;#x200B;

Everthing I own must be ""doable"" somehow. Like a Puzzle, finish it, throw it away. Some notes on a paper, use that information somehow, throw it away. And if there is something ""doable"", like a task at work and it takes over months to finish that, then that is costing me so much energy subconsiously.

&amp;#x200B;

But somehow I also struggle with ""doable"" stuff like taking supplements. I know that I need to take them, but I just forget them at work. But i also don't want to set myself a reminder on my phone as that would be another thing or information there is.

&amp;#x200B;

This all is costing me so much energy and I don't know what is wrong with me? I don't know which questions to ask you, but i feel helpless somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

What is wrong with me?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks &amp; Cheers,

715,"I live in a duplex and last year a single man moved in. When we first met him, he said nothing about his child. But we soon learned that he was a bit difficult. 

His son is  teenager that is blind and autistic. He screams out loud and bangs the walls a lot. It has been very disruptive to live this way. We’ve thought about moving but we literally just moved in a year ago. When we met the child, it was nice to see him but he is severely disabled. He had bruises all over his head and he punched himself a lot. We even noticed feces in a corner of the room. He says he doesn’t want to medicate him and turn him into a zombie but at this point, I just don’t know.

We really feel for the single dad because it can’t be easy, but isn’t there something that can be done? I’m at the point where I’m thinking we might even need to love for our safety and health. This kid has kicked out his fathers car side door and has shattered the windshield. 
The screaming and yelling has woken us up several times at 4/5 am some mornings. 
We rent our place but we feel like the only option we have is to move. We don’t want to be the jerks that make a single dad’s life worse ya know?

718,"First off just want to state my Marketing Project Manager (PM) is swamped, while it’s not a good excuse I’m not upset personally with them - just the situation. 

This question is more of how to roll with the mistakes and come out the other side alright...

I’m new to my job and was thrown into the fire, which is cool as it’s not my first rodeo. Part of my job is taking over invoice processing(#startuplife) from the PM. The company just changed to a whole new system two months ago and I’m learning it on the fly with everyone else.
After two weeks and some mistakes I’ve got the process relatively down, and I’m starting to drive invoices. 
However during these two weeks my PM immediately dropped all of it and so a few invoices went missed for two weeks and are going to be late.
I’ve been going back and forth with accounting and our event director who submitted the invoices trying to fix the mistake, I’m taking ownership even though I had literally just started my second week when I was brought into this. This isn’t the only mistake I’ve made this week, but I’m just trying to roll with it and be solution oriented. 
During all of this my PM is silent. I usually respond as quickly as possible on emails but I’ve been waiting several hours on some to let the PM step up. I don’t think it’s going to happen.
Now end of week three I’m playing clean up and have to look like a total mess to my various coworkers. 

Sorry it was a long rant long to get to my question. What can I do to protect myself? I don’t want to point fingers, I just don’t want to look like an idiot three weeks into my job...
 
TLDR: made a lot of mistakes learning as I went, probably look like the village idiot. 

Any advice on how to proceed?

720,"It’s important to note now that this is an online friendship. I’m very well aware that it isn’t the same as an in person relationship. However, it hurts all the same. 

I have this friend, who I’ve known for around eight months. Probably the longest time I’ve ever had a “stable” friendship. I’ve been dropped, used and “replaced” many, many times. That, paired with my father leaving, has left me with deep-rooted, “people will always leave”, “please don’t leave me (even though I know you will)”, frustrating anxieties over relationships. It’s so obvious people I am friends with all say they can clearly tell I’m waiting for them to leave, including this online one. 

So they keep leaving me on read, and never seem to message first. I know they have reasons and stuff. That’s fine. I just feel... I don’t know. Hurt? I think anxiety is better. I’m anxious I’ve done something wrong, something to upset them. My anxiety is going overdrive on all of this, and it’s really fucking frustrating. It’s like a constant weight on my chest. It’s not so much the fact she doesn’t want to talk. It’s not that. I miss her, duh, she’s one of the coolest people I’ve spoken to. I’m just... I feel this awful mix of emotions. I’m scared I’ve upset her, I’m worried I wasn’t good enough, I feel guilty incase I’ve upset her (and also for feeling very selfish over all of this), stupid because I allowed myself to think she wanted to be my friend (and even stupider for thinking she’s dropped me), and I am angry because I feel like I’m being selfish. I have anxiety, depression and autism. I have these extreme mood swings, and I’m currently dealing with the depression end. In some ways that’s a good thing. While I feel intensely sad over it all, if I was in the other mood, I’d have ended up saying something I would later regret. I’d be rude. I’d be angry. My emotions are very intense during those periods. It’s scary. 

I just need to know how to cope. How to cope with these stupid feelings. I understand if she doesn’t want to be friends; I know I’m a pain in the arse, and I don’t offer much to a friendship. I constantly worry I’m not doing the right thing, hell, I don’t even know what that is. 

I’m female, and a young adult. Obligatory “this is a throwaway” (well. Friend’s throwaway that she doesn’t).

Newly single, young, no kids or pets, my lease expires in 4 months and I've been seriously considering moving to a new state. The reasons are complicated but it all boils down to me thinking it would be the state I would by far like living in the most out of the 50 states to choose from. It is also a bit cheaper to live there than where I live now. There are numerous things I dislike about where I live now, but I've lived here most of my life and my family and parents whom I'm very close to, and a select handful of my friends i went to high school with that I'll miss so much, all live here.

I have an uncle who lives in this area but I haven't talked to him in a few years and I dont want to lean on him or ask to crash at his place until I find a house. I want to do this all on my own.

I have done tons of reading and the area I'm considering moving to, over 1000 miles away, consistently ranks as the place with a very high quality of life in America, especially for it not being expensive to live there. I actually lived there when I was very little but dont remember much of it. I am from a military family so I've lived in quite a number of places growing up but settled down here at age 13. I'm planning on visiting it for a week before i decide but time's running pretty short and I don't want my nomadic spirit to keep longing for another year if I sign the lease again.

I have a decent amount of money saved up, well over $10,000 in pure savings. Im not a materialistic person and saving my money feels better to me than spending it generally. My credit score is pretty good, but not amazing as I only recently starting building it when I was 21. But my biggest concern is this: I am a locksmith by trade, that is what I do and what I've always done, but I suspect it would be harder to find a job in the new area because the locksmith licensing requirements are much much looser, and I suspect I'll have more competition per capita. But overall it has one of the most booming job markets in America, from what I've read. The beauty of being a locksmith is that I can get a loan down the road and work out of a van self-employed. That is what most locksmiths do anyways.

I have A LOT of stuff, but I only have a small 2017 Volkswagen Passat, so I'll  definitely need to rent a U Haul and make the trip, go back and pick up my car.

I dont know how moving to a new place and setting up a job and a rental house/apartment when I get there really works, I've never done something like this. Am I making an emotional decision? There's really no logic behind this as I live very comfortably where I'm at now, but I want to have the chance to live comfortably in a location that I chose, not the location I ended up in by chance.

730,"**(TL;DR)**  
**Mother is scared of me driving because she's scared of driving and only does so out of necessity, she's not a terrible driver, but not a relaxed driver and avoids driving when she can. Father is a relaxed driver and drives often. Mother refused to teach me how to drive and father didn't have the time, but bought me a car despite my mother's wishes because his parents couldn't afford to when he was in high school. I did well in driving school (I guess) but failed my driving test twice, was discouraged over taking it again. Tried to learn to drive little by little for a few years, got into some minor driving trouble. Parents would far much rather drive me around places than teach me to drive even if they feel burdened over driving me places. Haven't driven in a year and half. I want to eventually get my license, but I don't know what to do.** 

So I guess it's a bit of a complicated story, but also not really.

I really started thinking about this when I was talking with my father about finally trying to get my license again in the far future and he mentioned that he believed my mother was scared of me driving because she's scared of driving herself and only drives out of necessity.

Up until I was about 10-12, my mother didn't have a license and never planned on getting one until she got a job that my father wasn't able to drive her to. She's been driving for about 10 years, but I can tell she hates driving. She doesn't take left turns or drive on the freeway and she gets anxious, angry, or frustrated over other cars or road conditions, making comments and that multiple times a trip. I honestly don't like being in the car with her that much, and my father definitely doesn't like to be in the car with her she always seems on edge and she also breaks hard. It takes a long time to get to a lot of places. At the same time though, she's never gotten a ticket in or a car accident.

My father meanwhile is a typical driver. He got his license at 19 and he doesn't mind driving at all, but doesn't love it. I think he just finds it boring sometimes. He's pretty much relaxed when he drives and doesn't think much of it. He'll occasionally get frustrated or angry while driving and comments about others or the road like maybe every 5-10 drives or so. He's comfortable for driving, it's like no big deal for him. He'll even eat while driving and his job requires him to be on the road for up to 6 hours a day. My mother doesn't like how he drives, but I do. His turns and stops are usually soft. He hasn't been in a car accident, but gets a speeding ticket every few years. 

I started learning to drive at the age 18 and went to a driving school with an instructor. I remember on my second day at the school, my instructor suggested that I drive home whenever my mother picked me up and then she just started immediately having one of the worst panic attacks I'd seen from her (she doesn't have panic attacks much, I don't wanna give off that impression) like hyperventilating and stuff, and to be fair, my driving was also shit. We pulled over then she drove me home. Honestly though, I felt like I wasn't even given a chance. 

When I graduated high school, my parents bought me a car. Luckily not an incredibly new or nice car, just a typical teen starter car that was pretty nice and decent. I found out a few years later that apparently my mother was extremely against me buying this car and my father said he wanted me to get a car for a graduation present because he wanted one for his, but his parents weren't able to afford one. 

I kept going to the driving class and my instructor for whatever odd reason was not very concerned with my driving or anxiety until one day he told me that I was ready to take the test and he didn't see any use of me coming back for anymore lessons. I told my parents about this and they insisted that I continue to take lessons from my father (my mother refused to teach me to drive after that incident) who only had the time to let me drive from my work and back for a few months (this was the only route I ever drove) until I had them take me to the DMV for a driving test even though they kept telling me I wasn't ready.

Yeah, I ended up having a panic, they had to pull over and drive me back to the DMV. I tried again a month later and failed again because I turned out of the wrong lane. I honestly got pretty upset and gave the instructor a lot of unnecessary attitude and blamed my parents to her face the drive home with my father was awkward. I said I didn't care if I had to take the test 10 times, I was going to get my license. He said he didn't want to waste the time and money for me to just fail again. I think it was something he said in the moment but I still feel bitter when I think of this moment.

A few months of 'practicing' (that is driving from my work and back with my dad) my father said he thought I was ready to test again but I didn't feel ready, I didn't feel confident. I tried to drive little by little and went to a convenience store on my own with my father following me and on speakerphone with me in his own car. Leaving the store, I had the choice to turn left over about 6 lanes that weren't very full (it was nighttime) or go the backroads that weren't lit at all to get home. I didn't want to be driving in the dark, so I wanted to take the 6 lane way, but my father said he thought the backroads would have been better....I hit a deer. My dad said it 'jumped right in front' of me, but idk I think I just fucked up or something. Luckily I breaked in enough time to where the deer was likely just bruised because it ran away, but I still felt like shit and didn't drive at all for a few months.

I tried to take up driving with my dad here and there when I went back to school, but a about a year and a half ago, I ended up blowing out my tire when running over a sharp curve when turning too close, I pulled over and we fixed it and then I think I actually drove home this time, but I haven't driven since.

I live in a city where it's almost impossible to get around without driving, it sucks but I deal with it I suppose.

I know I need to take personal responsibility for my own short-comings, but I really truly do feel as though I was set up to fail when it came to driving because of this. My mom is constantly talking about self-driving cars, but that's not what I want. I want to someday be like my dad, someone who drives like it's mundane and second nature. ",05Apr2019,1
731,"Hi!  I'm a college student going through a rough mental health patch right  now, and I've discovered that one thing that a genuinely big difference  for me is a regular sleep cycle where I'm early to bed and early to  rise. My problem right now is that it's not really possible for me to do  this, because I'm a really light sleeper, and one of my housemate goes  to bed late and keeps me up. I think some of this noise she makes  unreasonable - for instance, she used to use a hairdryer at full blast  and play music through speakers 1:00am - but I've brought this up with  her and she's agreed to not make this kind of noise anymore. Other of  the noise she makes, however, is pretty normal - opening and closing  cupboards, washing dishes, taking a shower, closing a door by pulling it  and letting the latch click, etc.. She could probably do all this  quieter if she tried, but none of it is super loud.

I've  tried white noise apps for my phone, earplugs, adhesive strips to  better soundproof my door etc., but I can still hear her, and I still  can't get to sleep. I think it's a holdover from childhood - I tiptoed  around my parents as a teen, and they were very quiet at night, so I'm  really attentive to every little noise. I think it would really help me  out if I could find a way to get around this problem and fall asleep  sooner - is there any way I can, or do I just have to accept it won't  work?",05Apr2019,1

733,"Ok, so here's the thing. I'm 23, studying in an uni.

There will be a meeting with teachers and such this Tuesday, and people who were elected by our colleagues are in charge of the organization. I am included in these people, and was put in a team that is meant to organize food and beverages. All is cool so far.

However today I was talking with everyone else in our Facebook group chat and I ended up asking what they were planing to do regarding photography, and that I had a semi-pro camera. Out of a sudden, a girl, who was on my team around the food, volunteers to take the pictures, and everyone else agrees without ever actually asking for my consent and how comfortable I kinda was with it... They said since I had something to do, it was better to give away that function to someone else, even though that ""someone else"" also had something to do... I just went with the flow and complied.

I mean, I don't really mind that much. Organizing the food part is pretty easy, and after that I can just stay outside reading a book or working or studying, whereas taking pictures would actually take some work and effort, and I really don't find myself having fun taking them. That said, I really don't trust the girl or any of these people and I feel kinda stepped on. Then there's the added obvious fear that if something happens to the camera, nobody will take responsibility. 

Ideas? I'm feeling a bit resented but I'm not sure if it's that legit or if it's just a petty feeling I should overcome. What do you guys think? Should I say something, at least express what I'm thinking? ",05Apr2019,3
734,"This all starts 1 year ago my colleague that I'll call f1 (side note: f1 is the company owners partner) was going on maternity leave and the company hired a replacement that I'll call f2 to cover her duties and take on some extras that f1 could not do.

So all is good working with f2 for the year while f1 is on maternity, f2 and myself even become quite close and have a strong workplace friendship. I found myself looking forward to seeing her on a Monday morning, catching up and discussing what the week ahead will bring. F2 did state that they thought when f1 returned things would change and most likely for the worst (I did not understand this until later). We both knew that having f1 in the office would be awkward (f1 is not the most diplomatic and known for sharing thing told to her in confidence). 

A year passes....... f1 returns from maternity. After a year away a period of settling in and catching up was expected, as f1 and f2 both share a fluent language (Romanian) I accepted that it's easier for them to speak in their fluent tongue, so letting them discuss things in Romanian for a few weeks to speed up the process. After a month or so f1 was all caught up but was not really doing anything, generally just micro managing what f2 and I were doing, slowing us down by asking if we had responded to this email or dealt with this customer query. It's really become quite tiresome gojng back and checking if I did do this or that or simply knowing that if f1 would look a little further up their inbox they would see our responses, no longer needing to bother us with the questions. 

During this period it became obvious to me that Romanian was becoming the predominant language in the office for both work and social conversations, my relationship with f2 also deteriorated as we both feel we cannot speak as openly with each other when f1 is present, it is also possible that our general daily conversations were now taking place in Romanian and having the same conversation in 2 languages is just silly. 

I started to feel isolated in the office as small comments and laughs were passed between them while I sat quietly in the corner. I stuck with it and mentioned my feelings to f2, she understood and apologised offering to do her best to speak more English in the office. 

Another 3 or 4 weeks pass and I have one of the worst days of my working life. During a 8hr day there were no more than an hour conducted in english, to say I was feeling excluded, worthless, miserable and depressed would be an understatement (I have very low self worth evenon a good day). I finish out the week feeling bad and find myself leaving work on a Friday already dreading the next shift with them both and seriously considering ending my life to end the misery (have no fear I suffer the thoughts when depressed but I have coping methods). 

The following Monday I inform the company owner (f1's partner) how I feel and he is understanding. F1 and f2 are politely asked to conduct MORE workplace business in English (not an unreasonable request, it will always be easier to explain some things in Romanian and hold private conversations, even I understand this). 

Things improved for a while and my friendship with f2 began to regain some lost ground, f1 is upto speed with the department changes and has been given the task of completing month end proformas (this is her only specific task and takes about 4 days including any alterations requested), she is still micro managing and is now doing very little other than that. 

I notice again that Romanian has been creeping back into the workplace and trying to be as 'chill' about it as I can, I let it slide for a time. During this time more of the conversations are of a social nature, whilst I do not speak Romanian alot of words are very similar, I notice that there are more laughs and giggles, I hear alot more words that could not be associated with a work conversation etc. 

Today was a good day as f2 taking notice of my mood yesterday made an effort to include me, for which I thanked her privately after work. She shows understanding and says she will try but she '..just cannot make you understand sometimes it's more easier to explain yourself in your maternal language...'.

Am I reading too much into this, as f2 has stated its just 'easier' for them, how that applies to social chit chat I don't know, should I forget about any form of social interaction at work and be strictly wirk orientated?

744,"This is probably a really common problem, but one of my best friends for around 4-5 years has started to ignore me. It’s not she’s ditching me for a different group of friends; she still hangs with our “friendship group” , the difference being that she just flat out ignores me when I try to initiate conversation.

She’s completely fine with our other friends, and talks to them, makes jokes with them, but the second I try to talk to her, she just gives me a tight lipped smile and nods (and kinda widens her eyes, if that makes sense?)

I’ve asked her if I did anything wrong and why she was ignoring me, but all she said was “No?” Which DOESNT MAKE SENSE because I asked my other friend and she said it was really obvious that she is.

Just this morning, I texted her about a dream that I had where she completely severed ties with me as a friend and I woke up (irl) crying, and all she replied was “Ik what you’re hinting at lmao”... I didn’t send her the texts for that reason, I just wanted to let her know how much I *actually* value her as a friend and how bad I’d feel if we lost that friendship.

Do any of you have any advice for how I should tackle this problem? ",05Apr2019,1
745,"Hello reddit I've recently come to the realization that I am the black sheep of my family and it really hurts. I've gone to psychiatrists about these issues and I've been advised to seek family counselling or to change my environment. I've tried getting my family, all or some, to come with me but they've all refused and I am having an extreme difficulty changing my environment. Some background on what's going on... I'm a male in my mid to late 20s living in North America. I am the youngest of two. I have one older sister by four years and two parents, mother and father. Growing up I was always encouraged to follow in my sister's footsteps. Whatever she did I was made to follow. When my sister and I were in gradeschool my parents wanted us to learn a musical instrument. My sister chose piano so we were both enrolled in piano lessons(my sister started 4 years before me as she is 4 years older than me.) My parents got a keyboard for our home for her to practice on and took her for lessons. My sister was a natural so my parents got a piano for our home and when I got a little older I was enrolled in piano even though I showed no interest in piano and actually wanted to learn how to play guitar. After years of no interest, several piano teachers and my complaining how I wanted to learn guitar. I got a guitar for a Christmas gift and was promised if I learned a song by myself then my parents would get me lessons. They didn't want to spend money on lessons if I was going to behave the same as I did during my piano lessons. I understood the deal and I learned black bird. I played this for my parents and never ended up getting the lessons I was promised. My gradeschool gave my sister and I another opportunity to learn another instrument. My sister chose strings and learned violin, I chose band and learned the french horn. My parents bought my sister a violin for home so she didn't have to worry about carrying her violin to and from school. I had to carry my french horn to and from school every band day. When my sister started middle school my mother took a full time job so at the time both my parents were working full time and wouldn't get home until the evening. Since my sister was a preteen she was old enough to take care of me until our parents got home. Regularly my sister would have her friends over and I would be locked in my room. My room didn't have a lock but they would put me in my room and tie my outer door handle to the banister so I couldn't open the door or they would just lock me out of our house and make me do stupid stunts to be allowed in. Every time I would tell my parents about how my sister would treat me they never once grounded her or punished her. Then the way my sister would treat me just got worse. I gave up trying to get help from my parents and just started lying to my parents telling them I stayed at school after hours when I would go to Toys R Us until I knew my parents were home so I didn't have to be subject to my sister and her friends. Unfortunately they found out I was lying about staying at school after hours so I got grounded and since I lied to them they completely stopped listening to me when I would try and tell them what my sister was doing to me. Later when my sister was in highschool my parents enrolled her in a yearly March getaway for snowboarders and bought her a snowboard to learn on. When I needed new shoes I wouldn't get a pair until here were holes in my soles. My sister and I grew up in the same house but had polar opposite upbringings. Every time my sister had a hobby or activity she wanted to try my parents would always encourage her and tell her how she can do anything. When I would show interest in any hobbies or activities I was told to just do what my sister was already doing and if I showed no interest or didn't immediately flourish then I was made to believe there was something wrong with me. My parents always had issues when my sister and I were growing up but they would say to us how they're staying together for my sister and I until we finish school. When my sister graduated my parents helped enroll her into university they paid for her registration and first year, helped her move to campus and my grandmother bought her a car. Now she's finished school and works as a lawyer. In my sisters last years of highchool and starting university she was regularly allowed to go up to the family cottage with groups of her friends by themselves. Around the same time my mom brought a me and a friend of mine up to the cottage. After the summer was over my friend said he would be busy with school and work and wouldn't be able to hang out much. Around the same time my mom started going out a lot during the weekends and evenings. for my entire highschool years I was home alone. My sister was in university and neither of my parents were ever home except to sleep and there were months at a time where my father was not home. One night my mom was drunk and was trying to go out for a drive and I was the only other person at the home. By this time my parents were done with eachother but still lived under the same roof. I took my mom's keys and she threatened me that if I don't let her go out that she'll run away and I will never hear from her again. I took her very seriously as she was yelling this to me outside of our home so I gave her the keys. I then called my sister to ask her for advise and she berated me for letting our mother go out drunk driving. Then she hung up on me. When I was in my last year of highschool my parents split and we all(my mother, father and myself) left our family home. My dad moved to an apartment  by himself and I found out that my mother was moving in with my ""friend"" from highschool I brought to the cottage several years earlier. I also found out that all the times my mom wasn't home she was hanging out with my supposed ""friend"". I had decided I wanted to go to school for graphic design and told my parents.  I was told they would not be helping me become a starving artist and if I were to register for school that I would have to pay for everything myself. I was working at Starbucks and quickly realized I wouldn't be able to afford school so I would have to save up money for my application and apply for student aid to pay for tuition. I lived alone, I paid my own rent and bills and started saving so I had enough money to register for school and not be homeless. While working at Starbucks I got sick with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, I no longer able to support myself by working and when I asked my parents for help I was told I had to figure things out myself. I ended up having to take out loans for medication as I had no health insurance. I got better, I'm no longer sick but my financial situation has been in shambles ever since. I cant get a loan to save my life as my credit is destroyed. So I've been working what little jobs I can to pay of the debt. All minimum wage jobs. It's not easy to come across work when you have no formal education except highschool. I started working in the cannabis industry at a dispensary. After a year of working the store was raided and I ended up on charges. Since then I've been looking for work everyday for the last 8 months, I am back in debt now and when I asked my sister or parents for help they tell me to stop being lazy and get a job. Which I've been trying to do for the last 8 months. I'm going to end up homeless at this point and am losing hope. Please help I do not know what to do. I've tried going to Ontario works for job fairs but they don't have any programs currently active and they're waiting on funding. ",05Apr2019,3
746,"My friend is *constantly* negative. I mean no matter what he will find a way to turn something into a negative thing. It's emotionally draining on me and I have given him advice to go to counselling (we have free resources in our town, that I myself utilize). I also have explained that is very hard on me as he complains to me that he needs me to fix it for him. And when i say that I mean that he says it'd be nice if I wanted to pick him up and take him somewhere to be social. I don't understand why this is my responsibility. It's not fair to me. I go to school full time and I work and I have expressed this.

The times I have invited him along he did not talk to anyone and sat on his phone then complained that I was ignoring him because I played pool 2feet away. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be a b*itch but I also can't take this anymore. I explained to him that people aren't drawn to negativity so it'd explain why he feels like people don't want to be around...
