0,"go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then talked upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?'

1,"Her birthday is in 3 weeks and I want to give her a present but I don't want to look desperate or seem like I'm trying to get back with her yet. We ended on ""good"" terms and we keep in contact as long as I message first but besides that, I'm torn. I want to be friends but I also want to move on and stop annoying her every other week.

5,"As the title implies, my boyfriend's 9 month old nephew has very recently figured out an easy way to open his bedroom door and ever since then, the baby insists on opening the door every time I come over and occasionally does it when I'm not there as well. (For the sake of clarifying, his nephew hasn't quite figured out how to properly walk yet, but since my boyfriend's door is the type that has a door knob but still can be pushed open from the outside, the baby will sit up, give the door a push, and then pull it open from the bottom enough for him to crawl into my boyfriend's room. His nephew also knows how to pull it shut. To add insult to injury, the lock on the door knob doesn't work, so we can't lock my boyfriend's nephew out.) Anyways, we need an effective solution on keeping the baby out of the room since my boyfriend works night shift and can't always keep on an eye on the little guy when he decides to crawl in for a visit. I'm worried mostly because my boyfriend's room has a lot of breakable items that are both expensive, and certainly not safe for a baby to play with or ingest. The nephew's momma does a good job keeping an eye on him 98% of the time, but the problem is that he loves to crawl into my boyfriend's room while she's peeing or having a smoke on the porch. Anyways, what's y'alls best advice on keeping the nephew from crawling into my boyfriend's room unsupervised?",29Apr2019,1

7,"So I've been best friends with a girl for about 30 years. She gets me like no one else and she says the same about me.

Problem is that she's an introvert and has been going through a bad period and basically shut down. She told me that she isn't up to talking anymore, so it's been a few months since we've last talked.

At first I was super understanding, but the problem is that she has a history of dumping me for guys. She'd tell me that she was too stressed to talk much which I'd respect, but then it would turn out that she'd been spending almost every waking moment talking to guys.

We've had talks about her doing that in the past and she's promised not to do it anymore. 

As time goes on though I'm finding that I'm resenting her and I'm angry that she's dumped me once again. I'm wondering if I should just unfriend her and walk away.

I don't know- what do you guys think?",29Apr2019,1

9,"Hello. I'll try to keep it short. I met this girl 2 years ago and we have become really good friends. When I first met her she was going through some things with her own friends and my roommate. The friend side of things has cooled off but her issues with my roommate have been nonstop and I've been there for her the whole way thru

Basically, I've heard her say alot of the same stuff to me and she has been trying to be friends with him again. She believes he's being difficult but the same thing keeps happening, her getting upset and whatnot, and I hear it over and over again. I care about her tons don't get me wrong. Today she was texting me about him, and I say that at some point she has to consider stop trying with him. I know it's not the best advice, but this has been going on for almost 2 years now and she's only been getting hurt in the process. She snaps back saying ""yes *name*, please explain to me how to stop giving a shit about people. If it was easy I would've done it a long time ago"" 

I didn't tell her to stop caring about people, just to consider stop trying with him. I apologize and try to explain, she then says she thought she could talk about it with me and mopes about him, I say she can def talk to me about it and send more stuff, then she just responds with ""I'd rather not, thanks"". I care about her a lot and I've been by her side for this long. I'm just pissed cus why get mad at me, y'know? Should I say something which might backfire and odds are she'll just stop talking to me which has happened before, or just not respond? Will she reflect a bit if I be passive?",29Apr2019,1
11,"Tldr: My team lead is upset about his peer evaluated performance review, is threatening retaliation on his staff, and I have no faith in our manager or HR. 

Team lead is person acting unprofessional. Manager is his boss. 

My immediate supervisor just received this new position and has already shown high levels of neuroticism. He received his performance review and shared the near perfect results, 4.6 of 5. 

One of the opportunities stated in his review, he should flow to other areas and help more. He's in charge of 2 areas and solely works in the same one i do. 

After reading this, he became upset and asked me who i thought it was who wrote it. He started making passive aggressive comments towards me, threatening to ""tell the manager where i was also lacking"". 

I never received a review to file on him and went so far as to show him my email to prove i wasn't lying. 

This behavior continued the remaining 6 hours of our shift. He refused to discuss anything else. 

I took the next shift as a sick day just to avoid him and was told he acted the same way the entirety of the day while i was gone. 

I've never worked with a lead this unprofessional and have little faith in his immediate manager or our HR, given when I've spoken to HR before their answer was to discuss the issues with my manager. 

My job has great pay with good benefits and i don't want to leave but his behavior is causing me to dread going into work. 

Has anyone faced a similar issue and was able to get it resolved?",29Apr2019,1
12,"I hope that this isn't long but I'll try and only include stuff that's relevant. I don't really know where to start so I'll start by talking about myself. I'm 24 turning 25 soon Lebanese guy, born and raised in Canada and live a pretty comfortable life I guess. I've always been single but I'm pretty sure that's due to upbringing and my parents telling me it's bad to get a girlfriend. I mean I'm pretty sure I'm at least decent looking and don't really have any social problems. I have like no experience flirting, asking a girl out, dating, etc aside from one tinder date. I don't have or use tinder anymore.

So for the past two years or so my parents have been slowly putting pressure on me to get engaged/married. Now its getting to a tipping point almost. There's this girl they're asking me to meet and see if I like her pretty much. It's like a supervised date with my parents and her parents almost. It sounds pretty strange but I guess it's the way of the culture, nothings forced at least for either of us. I'm not against meeting this girl, I'd actually like to talk to her but it's the circumstances I think that I find awkward and hard to engage with her. Especially when our parents are there. I haven't met this girl before but I know her Instagram account from my mom showing me her photo lol. So what would you guys suggest or do in my spot? I'm kind of tempted to go through with ""supervised date"" but I'm pretty sure it'll be super awkward between us because of our parents over us or maybe my anxiety is just through the roof. Do I go out on a limb and add her? She doesn't know who I am so I wouldn't even know how to start the conversation without it being weird because she doesn't know who I am either.",29Apr2019,1
13,"A couple of months ago she dropped her phone in a lake, and couldn't immediately replace it so she borrowed a friend's phone to log in and let me know the situation.

I last heard from her on March 8. She was last online some time between April 3 and April 15.

All I have is her kik, her first name, and her fiancé's first name. I'm about 80% sure of which US state she lives in, where she's currently working/studying at a college although I have no idea which one. I'm on the other side of the world with no idea how else to reach out to her or find out what's going on. I can't imagine she's okay...I'm fairly convinced she must be dead but I have no way of knowing.

He regularly tells me I’m cute, my hair looks nice, my eyes are beautiful etc. and calls me babe/babygirl a lot and he thinks I’m 16 and asks me for pictures a lot. I’ve considered sending them but GOD this would be illegal. It already would be if I was 16 but at 14 it’s just kinda fucked and even though I do like him, I don’t really want anything with him. I don’t wanna send pictures either, I’m just selfish right now for attention, but at this point I pretty much don’t want it anymore, at least not from him... I don’t know how to break it off.

15,"I'm a twenty-two year old male that is currently living with his grandparents. I've lived with them basically my whole life and never had issues except the here and there, ""teen-angst"" situations back in high school. I have been working in a great company for the last year and as well as taking online college courses. I pay for my bills (car, credit, school, etc.) and would consider myself to be in a good financial point and place in life. 

Everything is taken care of at the end of the day and coming home from a long shift is great except for one single thing: my grandparents. As they begin to get older and older *(late 70's)* but they are beginning to get more and more on my nerves. 

As I've started to mature, I've also started to do new things with friends, as any other college student would. Some would consider it ""growing up"". I like to go out, have a little bit of fun, have a couple of drinks here and there and just go on with life. For the last 5-6 months I've also been trying out new beers and new foods. Basically just new things to try for **myself**. Things that I think would most certainly make me a more complete individual. In other words, I'm doing what makes me happy. So I think. 

Grandma and grandpa both have a tendency to look out for me. They tell me what's wrong and what's right; there's nothing wrong with that. However, sometimes they will make me feel either guilty or sorry for trying new things that I think, or for once, thought would make me happy. They're always keeping an eye on me and it makes me feel like I can't do anything at home or I might just tick them off the wrong way. I'm annoyed at being treated like a little baby that needs to be nested and fed once he's home. Anything that involves something out of the ordinary, I either have to do in secret or just do it out of the house. It's the worst feeling ever. They will comment on things that I have no control over such as 
&gt; ""Don't do too much of **insert activity here** or you will ruin yourself! 

It's gotten to the point to where I'm considering getting my own apartment or just simply comfronting them about how they make me feel (which, *honestly*, is more than likely not going to make a difference). I continue to do my routine normally, except for the new things that I've learned to try and enjoy. I want to be able to feel like I have the liberty of doing something on my **own**; which I know I'm more than capable of. The only problem here is, again, my grandparents. 

Tl;dr Grandparents talk to me as if I'm doing more harm than good when in reality it's just me growing up and trying new things. Thinking about spending money to move out or to just deal with it.

23,"Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

25,"Hey, m18 here and I'm kinda confused. Me and this girl I go to high school with hooked up a while ago and that's all it was, a hookup. Well just so happens I'm not a hookup kind of guy and at honestly thought I had feelings for her. A couple of weeks later we hook up again but this time actually do it. So an embarrassingly short and dopamine-fueled while later I seriously thought I had feelings for her. I tell her this after getting completely wasted later that day though later realized I wasn't sure if it was true.     
I lost my virginity to this girl and we still hookup/hangout. I know through friends that she likes me but I have absolutely no clue if I like her back. I know you guys can't tell me how to feel but I'm really lost. To me, it seems that if I tell her I don't want to date her she'll get the idea I was using her for sex.

After the hurtful things he had said during the argument it ended with him telling me not to text him because he wasn’t going to read it as he was unhappy with me.

I left him on read again and he hasn’t said anything since.

My problem currently is he’s really the only person I talk to and I feel like I’m going crazy not talking to him despite the argument itself only ending less than 12 hours ago. Should I cave and text him? Or should I wait? And if I wait for how long? This is awful for me 😭",29Apr2019,1

She's okay now and living stable on her own. I got myself into legal trouble. I got addicted to xanax around September of last year and got clean in January of this year, without my family ever finding out. I recently got in legal trouble and had my cell phone taken and searched, and I told my family about the addiction (so they didn't find out from the phone and make the situation worse). They've taken all my privacy, including my bedroom door, and have given me two choices. Deal with it, or move back with my grandmother. They feel betrayed and honestly don't give a shit where I end up. If it weren't for my girlfriend, I would move in with my grandmother in a heartbeat.

33,"To try to keep a long story short, I was supposed to present research I had done last summer at a large international conference this weekend. The conference was a ways away, so I had several connecting flights, the last of which ended up being grounded (along with all other flights out of that airport) due to a massive snow storm. Yes, in April. Because I was only going to be at the conference for that one day (today), and because my presentation was in the morning, there was no reason for me to try to get to the city where the conference was. So, I ended up sleeping in the airport and arguing my way onto flights that would get me back home at a reasonable hour.

My reaction to this turn of events has been pretty terrible. I spent a good part of the time stuck in the airport in hysterical tears. In a very public place, no less. I needed my friend, who is a saint and stayed up until 3 am his time because of this, to talk me through the steps I needed to take to get back home. I literally couldn't do it myself, and only part of that inability was due to massive sleep deprivation. My mind spiraled; this one thing going wrong made me seriously want to stop doing everything: research, medical school, being a functioning adult in general. 

I'm less distraught now, but I still feel numb and kind of frozen, like I don't know how to get back on track after this derailing. I need to figure out how to contact the conference organizers, because there is a pretty steep penalty for you and your lab if you no-show. I probably should contact the lab I did this research with, which I really don't want to do because I have since stopped working with them because they're terrible, and because I had to fight them tooth and nail to be the person listed as first author on this paper so I could present it at this conference in the first place. Nothing feels real, and I still don't want to have to go to school and do daily life tomorrow with all of this swirling in my head.

I'm sorry if none of that made any sense. Basically, I react this way more often than I'd like, and I want to know what the hell is wrong with me and how I can fix it. Thanks.",29Apr2019,2
35,"As the title suggests, my girlfriend insists on drinking when she goes out, even when she’s alone or without a capable guardian.

I would like to preface this by saying that I’m a victim of childhood sexual assault, so I worry a lot about those around me becoming victims because it took me a LONG time to come to terms with what happened to me.

My girlfriend is the love of my life and she’s the last person I’d want something to happen to. I hate the idea of her ever feeling the way I did when I met her - damaged goods.

When she goes out with me, I always make sure not to drink to an extent where I can’t protect her. I hate to be THAT guy but I know she wouldn’t be capable of defending herself on a good day, moreover when she’s drunk.

I’m not terribly worried about infidelity or anything like that. I’m comfortable with our mutual feelings towards each other, I just worry when she goes out with a friend or two who are, or are going to become, equally incapable of stopping anything that might happen.

Am I worrying too much? Is there something I can say ?",29Apr2019,1
37,"Ok so to start off from the beginning, I met this girl on Tinder about a year ago, We hit it off pretty good. She gave me her Snapchat, so we took to Snapchat to talk from there on out.  We never got the chance to meet last year because of us both not having our driver's licenses. Around May of 2018 she started seeing someone from her school. A couple of weeks later out of the blue she just cuts off all contact with me and leaves me hanging not knowing if she wanted nothing to do with me or what. I sent a message to her on Tinder around November of 2018 saying how I felt about her and how I missed her and wish her the best. There was more personal things I said but you get the gist of what I said to her. Nothing mean though. 

Fast forward to January of 2019. At this point I pretty much had gotten over her, and out of nowhere she hits me up on Tinder again, cause we had never unmatched, and she hits me up on Instagram saying how she misses me and would like to talk. She goes on to tell me that her bf had made her delete all her guy best friends across all her social media accounts. She had told me he had become so toxic towards her, he was pretty much a lowlife, with no job or motivation to do anything other than play video games. She was working at that time so Everytime they went out to eat or do  something she would always be the  one paying. She said he had pushed her a couple times and she had been hospitalized towards the end of the relationship because of how she was doing mentally. So I believed her and we started talking again. We then made plans to hangout in person, at that time I had my license for about 4 months. She suggested that she come and get me but she didn't have a job at that time, she still doesn't, but that doesn't matter to me. So I offered to drive down to where she lives which is in Coatesville, it's about an hour and ten minutes from where I live.

We ended up hanging out, went to the KOP Mall aftwerwards, then went to eat at Olive Garden. We had a great conversation at dinner. We talked about her life and mine. We went to the movies afterwards and had a good time even though the movie sucked. I know this is going to sound foolish but we both didn't want to go home and wanted to continue to hangout, so I suggested that we go to NYC and go up the Empire State building because the building doesn't close until 2 am. She was thrilled about the suggestion but ultimately we figured it would be pointless to go all the way there, because by the time we would get there it would be closed. So we just went to her house to make cookies. I met her mom and her ""sister"" I think I made a good impression with the both of them. I end up staying at her house till 4 in the morning. We hugged goodbye and I went on my way. 

Judging by how comfortable and genuine she became around me I'm pretty sure she was into me. I was into her the moment we met in person, but because I'm not a guy to rush into things I tried to play it slow. We hungout a couple more times after, the last time we hung out I went over to her house to watch Netflix, we decided on watching a horror movie, halfway through the movie she jokingly says she's scared and I offer her to come and cuddle with me and she smiles and we cuddle watching the rest of the movie, we continue cuddling watching TV shows on Netflix. 9 o'clock rolls around and I say to her I unfortunately have to go because of having to wake up for work at 3 in the morning, and it takes me like an hour to get home so it wouldn't leave me much time to sleep.

Fast forward a couple weeks afterwards. We never got to finish watching the one show we started on Netflix so I told her that I would come over  the following Tuesday and we would finish watching the show. She happily agreed that sounds great. So Tuesday comes around, she sends me a snap out of the blue saying that when she got home her mom was throwing up. I told her I hope her mom feels better. I get no message or snap saying not come over so I just assume she wants me to come over, so I end up going over to her house after work, I get there and no one answers the door. Her neighbor comes over and asks me if I'm looking for M, I say ""yeah is she home""? She tells me that  just M just left to take her mom to the doctor or urgent care before I pulled up. So I tell her I had no idea the severity of her sickness. I ask her if it would be okay if I would be able to come over when she got back. I went to Dunkin while I waited, because I didn't feel right just waiting for her on her porch. Was it insensitive of me to ask that? I figured I would come over to comfort her while I'm there and help her take care of her mom. So an hour later she gets back to me and says her mom is fine and she won't be able to hangout when she gets home. She then says she told me her mom was really sick and we wouldn't be able to hangout. She then says she felt a little disrespected that I showed anyway out of nowhere. I was thrown off because she had never mentioned to not come over, and I'm not one to disrespect someone like that, if someone tells me they can't hangout I respect their decision and just find another more convenient date. So after she sends that message she literally deletes me off everything and blocks me. I haven't heard from her since the 5th of February. I talked to her sister awhile ago and told her to tell her that I was truly sorry and that I don't want to lose what we had. I know in hindsight I should've assumed that we wouldn't be able to hangout even though she didn't say to not come over. Was her blocking me and not letting me explain myself right of her to do that?",29Apr2019,1

This one girl I had a bit of a crush on sat with us in our group, and at one point, after the initial 4 left, put me and this other girl together to dance. This other girl and I ended up dancing together for most of the night, I just sorta followed her lead, and she kept pulling me in *really* close when she did, and anytime we went anywhere she held my hand. After the main dance was over and we went to the schools ""afterprom"" party, she kept holding my hand a bunch and her and I just sorta stuck together. She gave me her snapchat. Should I just send her a message and lead into something like ""hey I enjoyed hanging out with you last night. Would you like to do something together later this week?"". Ive never been in a relationship so idk how this works.

Sidenote - the girl I initially had a crush on was single at the dance, but mentioned that she got asked out a few days ago. I wouldve asked her to dance otherwise. She started to seem progressively more bored and upset, like something was up, after she put me and her friend together to dance. Idk whats going on there but its conused me even more.",29Apr2019,1
40,"I have two weeks left of undergrad and I’m finishing up my final projects. For my capstone course, I have a group of five people (randomly assigned) and we each got the responsibility of two sections per person. 

I wrote my assigned sections and sent them to the person who was putting the paper together, and was at work all day today and didn’t realize they were submitting it so early. My impression was that they would submit it tonight after I got off of work so we could all go over it. 

I just got home from work and I am absolutely shocked by what I’ve just read. 
1. There is absolutely NO citing of any sources. There are a lot of resources listed at the end of the paper, but no in-text citations. One guy wrote his section strictly based off of his own opinion/experiences. 
2. The grammar is some of the worst I’ve ever read. Every paragraph was a run on sentence, and there were no commas. Said guy also used personal pronouns. 
3. The introduction and conclusion were VERBATIM. It was literally copy and pasted, and the wording in the conclusion was just changed to past tense. 
4. The girl who put it together used my rough draft for one of my sections instead of my final draft. This means there were no in-text citations in my sentence. 

I am freaking out. I’ve worked so hard in this class and on this final paper. I’m embarrassed to even have my name on something like this. The worst part is that we have to do a presentation on the paper in class this coming week. 

How can I fix this? Should I wait until after the presentations to confront the professor about it? Should I confront my group? 

Any advice is appreciated. Sorry if this is a bit overkill. My anxiety is thru the roof about this whole thing right now.",29Apr2019,1
41,"I am a 15 year old boy who decided to take the choice of learning the Quran off by heart. Many other Muslims here will understand how difficult of a task this is to begin with, never mind with exams and other stuff. I have learned 11 and a half sparah (in other words, sections) and this makes up more than one third of the full Book. Now, this is a big deal. For me, and for my family who support my decision for learning.

However my problem arises with the fact that :
1. I don't want to learn any more (for the time being). 
2. I'm slowly forgetting a lot of which I have learned. 

This wouldn't be such a big deal, except for the fact that forgetting parts of the Quran which has been memorised, is a big (BIG) sin. And as much as I am aware of it, I don't want to do anything about it.

Hell, I don't even know if I'm the right subreddit right now but let's get along with it. So I finished high school last year and after that I just took a year off to realize what I wanted to do with my life. In the meantime I sent some CVs around but I knew I wasn't gonna be hired so I just enjoyed my time. Last October my sister showed me a project about an internship my district was gonna plan in some European countries. As soon as I saw the project, I agreed. I felt useless at home doing nothing and finally I had an opportunity that could help mature and even make some money out of it. So after some meetings with the directors of all this project I'm finally taking the flight and I'll be there for 5 months alone. I'm renting a room in a old lady's house and I feel like she's gonna be the only one I will talk to outside my colleagues. I just feel anxious and worried because that's my first real experience alone. I stayed weeks without my family before but now that I'm also without my friends I feel a little lost. I also feel a little dumb to be bitching about being alone at 20 yo but I can't help it. Deep down I know it will be a good experience that will teach me the value of money (since I will be given an allowance monthly for my rent and living expenses) and also the value of independence.

49,"I work at a really busy Irish Pub in a small tourist town. 

Their revenue is 4M per year and their capacity is 100 people.

Anyways, I worked there for 4 years as a server/supervisor. My responsibilities included opening and closing, locking up at the end of the night, balancing and counting the tills, dealing with complaints, voids, discounts, calling people off, dealing with kitchen issues, cutting staff when it slowed down etc...

The best part is I still got to serve tables every shift while doing all that. 

So basically I got paid a decent wage and still made great tips.

After the 4 years I took a year off to start my own business.

After the year off I went back to the pub as just a server with no extra supervisor responsibilities and still do my business. I also do all the pubs online marketing and website stuff.

I currently make...

$1100 / month for the online marketing
$18 / hour for any other online work I do for them
$12.20 / hour when I'm serving
And about $1000 / week in tips

With no extra responsibilities.

I serve about 35 hours a week and do about 10 hours a week or so on marketing stuff.

The owner just pulled me aside and asked if I would consider being the front of house manager. Which would mean $55000 per year salary and 50 hours a week work.

I would keep my $18 per hour marketing position but I wouldn't be allowed to serve and make tips.

Serving for me is honestly something I love doing and the fact that tips are more or less tax free means I have a lot more take home.

Should I do it?

50,"In my 3rd and graduating year of college and I've realized that the moment I step out of the doors after my last class, I'm most likely never going to see or talk to anyone ever again.

I might message 1-3 acquaintances who I eat lunch with at school here and there, but I'm not sure if they're that interested in keeping in touch.

I'm scared of being alone since I don't have any close relationships anymore. 

I did my last 2 years of high school in a new city. None of my hometown friends kept in touch with me.
It was painfully lonely in the beginning until I met 2 other people almost just like me since it was nice meeting people who understood what it's like to have social anxiety.

I would meet up with them every weekend and sometimes randomly during the week when I started college. Mixed in with school friends, I felt good until I realized I never managed to keep in touch with any of them, and that when my 2 close friends drifted away from me, I felt the wrenching sensation of loneliness again. 

It's so hard meeting new people when they all have their close friendships they've maintained over the years and you're just there on the outskirts as the 2nd/3rd tier friend.

I just don't want to feel lonely anymore but I feel like if I don't start getting it together in  my 20's, I might be lonely for the rest of my life.",29Apr2019,1

i just don’t think i’m fit for school. the way our education system works just doesn’t work well for me. and i’ve gone to counselors, i’ve gotten notes from my psychiatrist to get me some help with this and they just told me to get over it, get used to it, work to better as if i hadn’t been trying that for my entire academic career!!!!

59,"I will start this out by saying I was adopted when I was only a couple months old. However when I was 20, I found my biological parents. I’ve known my biological family for 23 years now and am pretty close with them. 

My question is about the mom (adopted) I grew up with. We never really saw eye to eye growing up and we pretty much only see each other about twice a year. I will admit that I don’t really try to keep up a connection with her because of a myriad of reasons. The biggest reason being this: I have four children and three grandchildren. My kids are as follows: a 26 year old girl, a 23 year old son, a 19 year old son and a 14 year old son. My mom has never had a relationship with my boys, only my daughter. When my daughter was growing up, my mom would watch her and have her stay the night, take her to do things etc. Then I had my boys and my mom literally would not take them to do anything and still only sees them at Christmas and maybe a birthday here or there. When I asked her years ago why she wouldn’t take the boys, she said that she was too old to babysit and that my boys were naughty. Which I will say two of my boys were diagnosed with ADHD however I don’t feel that’s a reason to not be a grandma to them. Fast forward to present day.....my daughter has two children of her own now and my mom takes her girls all the time. She is constantly buying them stuff, having them stay with her for weeks at a time, etc. and to this day she never sees my boys or gets them anything except when it comes to Christmas and even then she will ask for ideas as to what to get them and I will give her ideas and she will complain about how expensive the ideas are. Point in case: this past Christmas I told her my son would love a basketball and she replied “those are so expensive.”  I was pretty angry because A) she never see them or myself yet she sees my daughter and her girls all the time. And B) she’s constantly buying my daughter and her girls stuff. My daughter even moved 4 states away and my mom has traveled down there to get the girls and when she’s not there visiting, she’s sending them packages. This Christmas she bought my daughter a really expensive Kitchen-aid mixer and had it sent down to my daughter. She got me some clearance high heels that were clearly hooker style heels with the clear plastic heel, which I would never wear and she has to know that. She had even texted me to ask me my shoe size before buying them and when I told her, the shoes she bought me were the wrong size. As stated they were on clearance so there were only certain sizes left and the ones left were not in my size. I know all of this about the shoes being on clearance and not available in my size because she texted my daughter about them. My daughter and I are super close, so when my mom texts her crazy stuff, my daughter will tell me. So naturally when my daughter got the text with these hideous plastic green dollar sign high heels, my daughter laughed and texted that she knew what I was getting for Christmas. I’m bitter because I’ve been a single mom for 8 years and my mom has never been there for me or my boys. I’m sad because they don’t have a grandma and that breaks my heart. When I was going through my divorce 8 years ago, I asked to borrow some money ($800) so I could make the deposit on an apartment and she told me no and that I’d have to do it on my own. Which I did and yes it’s made me stronger.  After she told me no she wouldn’t help me, she paid for my daughters apartment for almost a year because my daughter just wouldn’t and knew my mom would. I’ve tried to deal with it over the years and just realize that she’s an odd person. But it’s draining and hurts my feelings. And then after this past Christmas and her lamenting about buying my boys presents, I’m just down right angry.

 another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away.

She tells me she loves me but this is shit. When I’m with her, I’m the happiest I’ve been in a long ass time and when I’m not, this stuff goes on and it hurts me so bad. I don’t feel like I can break up with her but this is shit. Thank you guys",29Apr2019,1
65,"I’m new to reddit and I’m not entirely sure how this works but I’ll start by giving a bit of a back story. 
   In August of 2018 I changed schools and immediately became friends with a girl named Jamie. We sort of formed a clique and would constantly get in trouble. Eventually I was expelled from school and put into a mental facility for 50+ days. Fast forward and I get out and we get back into contact, but I go to a different school and live further away than before. Eventually I end up moving 1,000+ miles away and we lose contact for about 7-8 months. Its now early 2019 and I make new social medias and talk to her often. She tells me about how she and my other friend had gotten arrested for robbing a vape shop and how they ran away together for months. We talk more often and she eventually reveals she has congenital heart failure. The last I’ve spoken to her she said that she would be put on oxygen within the next 4-5 weeks depending on her breathing ability. It’s been a month and a half since I’ve spoken to her, she hasn’t been active on any social media, hasn’t responded to me, and I haven’t seen her name in any obituaries. She is online schooled so I can’t reach out to any of our friends asking if they’ve seen her, and as far as I know she doesn’t talk to any of her old friends except for me. I doubt that she could’ve been arrested again because of how sick she was. At this point I don’t know if she’s even alive and I need closure. If anyone has any advice on how I could possibly find her it would be great.",29Apr2019,1
66,"Before I start I will honestly admit I am completely in the wrong here and I was a jerk but I am going to try and get help.  i have borderline personality disorder(going to attend DBT for this), Generalized anxiety disorder and depression, a bit lacking in communication skills; and over the last 2 months I have been stressed to the max(Mom showing signs of alzheimer, way too much hours at work, My father flying back to his country for vacation and I am scared of my family members dying and planes. These all led to me being stressed to the max and then some guy trying to take the girl I romantically like? I just broke.
  
So I am 29 and I met this amazing girl on a mental health site and we got to talking and we eventually moved to another chat app with a group and we have been talking for a year and a half now. I fell for her at first(she told me 2 weeks ago that she fell for me 3 months in to talking to me but decided to just friend me due to very Long distance), but she was too shy for skyping and I lost interest in wanting a relationship with her for a while but my romantic feelings were still lurking in the background. I come to find out she has been talking to this other guy while basically ignoring me(there is another girl that loves the guy and she told me the guy told her that my friend was giving him constant attention and he was falling for her; and she told me this out of jealousy) for a month or so I just assumed she was romantically falling for him. I bottled it up as long as I could but because of my poor communication skills I just out right blew up her(I am a bit immature due to sheltered life) I can't be in the same place where she is having romantic feelings with that guy she said she had no romantic feelings for him and 2 days later I confessed I had romantic feelings for her and asked her if she wants to do LDR and she said ""no I am not comfortable with LDR"" and I told her I was saving money to move countries if that is what would help anything and she said she was unsure and she needs to think about it and I still didn’t believe her and out of jealousy I just blocked her that didn't last long because I kept unblocking her and it happened for a few days until I was like ""I can't do this"" and I asked her to block me but she refused so I hurled insults at her in french (she is french) I called her a salope(slut) which seems to have hurt her the most and then she blocked me and couple of days later I reread everything she wrote and it seemed like she was telling the truth and I was in the wrong and I emailed her explaining this and she unblocked me and we were re-building friendship.  
  
But I am stupid enough not to know better and my jealousy and anger got the best of me again and on last week Tuesday I told her ""I am not going to compete with him for your attention, lets email and keep it impersonal"" and then got blackout drunk because of stress and anger and jealousy. And I brought the drama into the main chat and cursed out all parties involved and called her salope again and I got blocked by all of them and the girl I liked has no longer been replying to my emails where I apologized. I made her a private YouTube video this saturday explaining my situation to her that led me to overreacting(Mom’s signs of Alzheimer, and my dad flying back to his country, and losing her? I even said I was being irrational because she is 33 and the other dude is 22 and lives in Pakistan while she lives in Finland. I asked her to reply to the email with the video if we are on a break or if this is permanent and she has yet to reply to me.

I just want to know if she is ok or not and try to be friends with her again. I am also bit nervous that the dude is not comforting her and she will now fall for him and skype him and move to be with him. My anxiety has been gone up to the max every 1 and a half hour I wake up with anxiety and cold sweating, I am no longer working to the best of my abilities, I haven’t been able to eat, I am going through the day anxious.

People have told me to get hobby and when I went to the gym all I can think about is her feeling bad and the guy comforting her and seducing her.

72,"I have not been in a situation like this before and could use some advice. I will try to be as succinct as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Context: I (26 yo middle class male) am preparing to move (far) for graduate school, and one thing I have decided to do before the move is to get caught up on all of my health check ups, and, in particular, go to the dentist. I have been experiencing really painful strain and tenderness in my jaw, temples, and neck, as a result of a recent onset of jaw clenching at night, and wanted to see about getting fitted to a night guard. I was given a baseline quote of $820 for the night guard and decided not to do it as I cannot afford that expense at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Circumstance: At dinner a few nights ago, I shared this story with my (best) friend and his mom, whom, coincidentally, was raised in a family of dentists, and, too, has experienced her adult life dealing with bruxism (teeth-clenching). Side note: while it sounds like a very innocuous ""condition,"" let me just say that it is truly painful and cause cause serious temporary and permanent issues. Today, I received a call from my friend's mom where she explained that she wanted to front the money for me to get the night guard and that I could later pay her in installments. I was super shocked and, of course, very grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I need help: I am, of course, very grateful for this offer. This isn't the first time that my friend's mom has offered to help me in some way (often financially), but this is the first time I am inclined to accept her offer. I mainly want to accept this offer because I know that she likely put a lot of thought into it and I find it overwhelmingly kind. I think it would come off as rude or ungrateful if I did not accept. Plus, I would be so happy to have this pain alleviated. On the other hand, accepting this offer would instill a lot of guilt in me. I have chosen not to ask my parents for help with this because for the first time in their lives, I see that they're living comfortably and that they're enjoying themselves quite well. Asking them for help with the expense could potentially cut into their savings or money that they had hoped to use for a vacation. However, if I did ask them for help, I think that they would help me. Second, I have really nice things, such as a good computer and a new phone. These expenses I have chosen to prioritize in my life, but they aren't needs - they're wants. I likely could have afforded to pay for this night guard if I had chosen to not upgrade my phone recently or to not have gone out last weekend with friends. I am having a hard time parsing the morality of accepting this help.

75,"This is all over the place, and I know it's going to come off as ridiculous, but it's truly how I feel. I'd appreciate any advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am wasting my youth away. Everyday that i’m not doing anything to have fun, I feel like time is passing me by so quickly. I am about to be 20. I can’t believe that, just like that, my teenage years are gone. I have absolutely nothing to show for them. My whole life, I chose to be the “good kid” or the “responsible one,”  and I really regret it.

In the moments, when I chose to not drink, not smoke, not go out, I was fine with my choice. But then came graduation time for high school, and I realized that i had not done anything to actually enjoy my time here. My nights were filled with homework or watching Netflix. I felt so sad. I smoked for the first time, went to one party but it was not what i wanted. I wanted to make up for everything i missed.

I got to college, and more than anything, I wanted to live on campus my freshman year. My parents are middle eastern, so, they wouldn’t let me. I am still so upset that i never got the freshman experience of living on campus, I truly wish I could go back. 

Fast forward, it’s the end of my second year in college. This last semester, I lived on campus for a few months (i moved back with a month and a half left in the semester), and I spent all my time living on campus stressing out about finances. I only enjoyed myself twice. February, the second month in, I went to my first frat party. I drank for the second time in my life, and I actually had fun. The day after, I went to another frat party. I truly had fun that weekend. It felt like I was finally making up for it.

After that weekend, I tried to go to other parties but could never find someone to go with me again. So, that was it. It was just that one weekend in February. I have gone out since then, but it’s been pretty lame. 

Now, I’m faced with a decision. What am I going to do with my life next semester? For the longest time, I have wanted to study abroad. I tried already two times, and i ended up delaying. This time, I have applied, committed, done pretty much everything, but now I need to confirm, but I’m not sure if I want to go.

I made a huge mistake, the program I applied for and committed to wasn’t the one I wanted. I still don’t know why I chose it. I know this might sound ridiculous to some, but I think God made me choose it because it’s the path that I would do the most good on (i’m likely not going to have opportunities to party). This program isn’t at a university, it’s at an American study center, meaning I won’t get the full immersive college experience. I am not sure if I should even go.

I want to be in London, and I want to travel, but I also want to party. I am so sick of choosing the responsible route all the time, it gets me nowhere. I am going to have my entire life after graduation to be responsible. When I look back, I’m going to have nothing fun to remember. I am just not sure what to do.

I could stay at my home university. I could maybe convince my parents to live on campus/ move out again (though it’ll be really difficult bc they don’t see a point). I could enjoy fall semester at my university, but there’s no guarantee to this. I already tried to have the experience, and I only got invited to two parties (i’m a girl btw so it doesn’t have anything to do with it being tougher for guys to get invited). So, I’m not even sure that it would be worth it to stay. But, maybe i can go abroad the semester after with a better choice. But, that does mean I would be older and I might be surrounded by people much younger than me when I go abroad. 

I could go abroad. I could go on the program I chose, but the one don’t really want. I have no idea, this program may be great. It may be everything I need, but I’m not really sure. It’s simple, I want to have a “uni experience.” I want to party, to drink, to try some drugs, but not being at a “uni” will make it hard to do those things. I’m planning on taking one class at a university while I’m there, but still, I won’t get to live in the flats. I believe I’ll have access to the student union, so I may get access to events. I just don’t know that it’s the experience i am looking for. What if none of the other program students want to go out to parties and such? How do I stop feeling like that’s all life is about? 

I do have a second option. I can go to an actual university, but it will be far more expensive, but it is the experience I want. I am not sure how I could actually afford it though. I literally have calculated all of my possible resources, and still the cost is high.

79,"So, I'm currently in therapy for depression. This stems from poor social skills and social isolation. A big part of that is very little self-confidence, stemming itself from a bad rebound relationship (of sorts, never actually dated but heavily flirted, borderline mutual sexting (no pictures, but text), before she randomly stopped talking to me). As a result of the low confidence, I'm a virgin and have not had a girlfriend since my first at 16. 4 1/2 years later, I'm in therapy, getting some self-confidence slowly.

Now, it comes down to the situation. Coworker A is reasonably attractive, and has heavily hinted into a physical attraction to me (she literally told a coworker she'd ""do"" me when I was pretty close and she knew it.) We have some very strong sexual tension between us, with the blatant comments coming from her as I'm somewhat uncomfortable with it as I have no experience with sex in any way except masturbation. However, it would have to be purely physical, as I think we'd be a terrible couple, as we are very different in many ways and I've yet to hold a serious conversation with her, which is important to me. Coworker B is my supervisor, seems interested in me, is a genuine, caring person who I enjoy being around. Problem is obviously she's my supervisor, as well as the fact I seem to be attracted to her in most every way but sexually. 

Coworker C is a completely different situation and I'm just including it for advice. He keeps hitting on me, despite the fact I've told him I'm straight. I think part of it may be the fact that I got uncomfortable when he first hit on me, since I'm not used to being hit on by anyone at all, and he perceived that as homophobia and now he's just messing with me. How do I shut him down? Do I blatantly tell him?

A few years back we had a pretty rough patch, no sex at all for nearly a year. I tried but kept getting knocked back so eventually just stopped trying and we basically just lived together as a couple without any intimacy.

     At the start of the barren year I thought we were in a good place, we'd still get high and be honest with each other, after a little while though I got a weird vibe and when I tried for sex I got knocked back. After a little while I asked and got the stock sort of tired response. I fell hard into the drugs for a while (totally my fault) and she's always used that as an excuse for why we weren't intimate even though we'd stopped before then, I'm pretty sure she cheated on me right around the time we stopped having sex, my gut told me at the time even though she was acting pretty normal otherwise.
   
  She's denied ever doing anything wrong since but occasionally we still get high and she talks about boyfriends that have cheated on her, if I question her she gets pretty evasive and swears she's never done it but she's lied to me in the same situation before.

So, to start off, I’m going to be focusing on the United California Marine Corps, the main principle faction in my trilogy. For context, California is an independent nation called the United California Republic/UCR that’s essentially the entirety of the Western US (along with Sonora and Baja California). The Midwest is a massive neutral ground called the Neutral Zone and borders three other nations that rose up to replace the US after it collapsed. 

Anyway, the UCMC and UC Army operate a system of small peacekeeping outposts 100 miles into the Neutral Zone pass the border of California. Under Californian military doctrine, military outposts are split into three levels: station outposts (SO), forward operating outposts (FOO), and finally the largest ones, central command outposts (CCO). SOs are company-sized encampments, FOOs are battalion-sized installations, and CCOs are massive based composed of at least one or two regiments. 

Anyway, my story focuses on a Marine Corps station outpost. Here’s how it’s structured: 

There is a company of 175 UC Marines living in the outpost, with their CO being a captain and their XO being a lieutenant (I’ll explain) while the senior enlisted advisor is a first sergeant . They are split into six platoons composed of: 

- Two rifle platoons (60 Marines in total) 

- One heavy weapons platoon (30 Marines) 

- One mounted cavalry platoon (30 Marines and horses, excluding five reserve horses)

- One artillery platoon (30 Marines, one modified former US military M777 howitzer, two M119 howitzers, three M252 mortars) 

- One armored platoon (25 Marines, six modified M1 Abrams) 


Every single Marine in the company is a trained rifleman given infantry training since the UC Marine Corps adopted the same strategy and doctrine of the US Marine Corps 100 years earlier in making sure that every Marine is a rifleman. Also, due to there being only 145,000 Marines in total (100,000 active duty, 45,000 reservists), it’s the best bang for your buck strategy that the Marine Corps at its inception adopted. So for example, if PFC Joe is sick and Sergeant John needs an extra body to go out on patrol in town, he can just take Corporal Jim from the artillery platoon along without much problem. 

So, would a military unit like my company here make sense of function well? What could be some problems?",29Apr2019,1

89,"TW for depression, attempted suicide and self-hate.

To start off this monster, let me paint you one of the current recurring issues in my situation. My(18F) best friend(19F) likes this band called X. Keeps talking about it, sometimes ignoring what I have said just to keep talking about X. Over time, I come to hate X. This is true for everytime the object of her affections change; be it X or Y or Z, I'd come to hate them. My hate stops once she stops liking/talking about said thing.

Background: my best friend has a lot of self-confidence issues, to put it simply. She has depression but wouldn't go to a therapist because she doesn't want her mom, who has enough on her plate, to worry over her. She thinks she's with it for life. The liking of Xs and Ys stems from the need of a distraction so that her depression doesn't eat her whole. I am one of her closest friends and she comes to me not only for the obsession rants but also for depression rants detailing her deep hate towards herself.

Honestly? I'm quite jealous over some of the things she has. As much as I hate to admit it, she has been the cause of several of my low moods this past couple months. It's toxic but I don't say it because I don't want her to withdraw and keep these things to herself, that would make it much worse for everyone involved. I also sometimes instinctively believe she is very selfish because of this, and I hate that I have come to think this way of her.

On the other hand, I think my moods are somewhat becoming dependent based on whatever she feels/says. Sometimes it's good when she voices her appreciation towards me, more often than not it becomes terrible when she ignores whatever I say to her or when she gets complimented on things and I get jealous over it. I have a 'confront your problems headfront' style of dealing with my issues so while I have no right to judge, I just can't deal with this any longer. I want her to face herself and stop running away but I don't think she has the capacity to withstand facing her issues headfront just yet. She has attempted to commit suicide several times before when she tries to do this.

Returning to the main situation. Her obsessions towards Xs and Ys are... pissing me off. I know it's a coping mechanism but I find myself not being able to stand X (her object of affections atm) whenever I come across X's pictures or videos online. I can't exactly ask her to stop, but I can't make heads or tails on how should I approach the matter. Xs and Ys are very good people/things, I don't want this shit to cloud my views on them. Thoughts? Opinions?

And thank you, if you made it this far.

Before I moved in (mostly to help them pay bills, but also my lease was up, but also sleeping next to my best friend) we asked her if it was okay.  But after she became quite hostile.  She seemed under the impression that we weren't actually dating or that it was a phase and she wanted him to be with one of two ladies she was friends with at the time (she has since seemingly broken ties with one or both of them, although it is difficult to say).  While we were friendly before, she has been avoiding me.  I've made repeated attempts to talk with her about ways to make her more comfortable, each one ending worse than the last.  Sometimes she also give the impression that she is his girlfriend.  As one can imagine I absolutely hate when she treats him that way.  After the last time we fought she told her family (but not me, because talks are usually purposefully away from what she thinks my earshot is) that she wants to move out.  I really hate to leave things in a poor state, and that is troubling to me on it's own.  However, I think she is trying to bribe my cat.  I believe she wishes to take him with her.  I have no idea how I can prevent that from happening.  My boyfriend caves very easily to her whims and their parents aren't enthusiastic with me.  But they ALL love my cat.  I really don't want to lose my cat and I can't afford to move out before she does (also, actually that would make my boyfriend pretty sad. He might cave easily to what his family wants, but we are emotionally bonded in a way that neither of us can replace.  It's a pretty normal relationship except for his sister)

93,I am leaving soon for summer break and am considering leaving some expensive-ish things in my apartment like a tv and a nice mattress. How likely is it that college apartments are broken into? Is there anything other than locking the front door that i can do?,29Apr2019,3
94,"This is going to be a long one. I'm sorry in advance, there should be a tldr at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my boyfriend, (Who we'll refer to as B from here on out) is in a really rough patch right now. Aside from what's been happening with his family, he's got a lot of emotional walls and issues that are yet to have been worked through. He saw a therapist for a month or two and was diagnosed with dysthemia and passive suicidal tendencies. He still hasn't told his parents yet because he feels like they'll just pity him and that's the last thing he wants. He quit therapy because he said it wasn't really doing anything for him, but that's a whole story for another day. The point is that he really struggles with dealing with any emotion and that he's currently not receiving professional help with working through it.

&amp;#x200B;

 B and I have been together for almost two years now, and have a very healthy relationship. I've known him since first grade and as long as I've known him I've known that his family is really unstable. His father had a bad childhood and is currently disowned from his entire family and his mother has been abused, cheated on, and has had a stalker for a long time now. Don't get me wrong, they're wonderfully sweet people, but they do NOT mesh well together at all. B's father goes on work trips to D.C. and Houston pretty often, and I'm pretty sure that's been the root cause of the tension in the marriage. Anyways, B's parents fight and scream at each other so often that B is completely used to it by now. It almost never shakes him anymore. His parents also have sex with each other all the time and make ZERO effort to be subtle about it. Doesn't matter if their kids are home and have friends over too, they go for it and again, there is NO secrecy. But about two months ago, they had a fight so bad that B was sincerely afraid that his parents were going to split up. He hid in his room and listened to every word they screamed at each other. It was around 5 hours of screaming, throwing things, crying, and occasionally deafening silence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since that fight, everything has been going downhill. At first, there were little things, like B's parents not talking to each other in the mornings. Then it was his dad's alcohol issues resurfacing. Then they stayed at his grandparent's house without his dad for a few days. B was still feeling horrible, but things had calmed down and his parents said that they wanted to work it out and go to couples as well as individual therapy. There was hope for everything to work out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or so we thought. Two weeks ago B's mom started to sleep downstairs in the basement on the couch next to her jewelry workspace. She didn't tell B why, it just seemed spontaneous. Tensions were high, especially because B's dad started up his drinking and smoking weed again. They weren't having their noisy obvious sex anymore either, which was very unusual. All of a sudden, last week on Saturday shit hit the fan. Since B's mom was sleeping downstairs, his dad was the only one using the bathroom connected to the master bedroom. B's mom went in there presumably to grab something for the downstairs bathroom when she found a bag of illegal street drugs. That was it, after that there was more yelling and crying, but there was no more question about it, they were splitting up. Things kind of settled down since it's been spring break, and B, his twin brother, his mom, and grandparents had a trip planned, so they got to relax and not think about it for a while. While it was pretty obvious that they had split, there still was no word of divorce until today.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, they casually dropped kind of a big bombshell on B and his brother. They told him a lot of shit, and he's really been taking it hard. First off, they told them that the divorce is happening. His parents are splitting up and his mom gets to keep the house. Second off, they told them that for years previous, his father has been saying that he does not want to stay monogamous. Third off, they were told that his father had an affair for three weeks and that his mother had also slept with 3 other men on various occasions. Obviously, this is not the kind of thing you want to hear from your parents. B's brother has been taking it *really* hard, but B hasn't really said anything about it at all. I'm very worried about him because I know him well enough to know that it's really tearing him up, but he's not saying anything at all. I feel like he's teetering on the edge and that he's one more unfortunate event away from falling. I don't know what will happen when he does fall, but I have a gut feeling that it would be really bad, and I want to do everything I can to prevent that. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my problem comes from. Usually, I do my best to listen to people's issues and to offer advice on how to handle it. It's one of my strengths, and people come to me for that reason to talk often. However, I am at a total loss of what to do here. He matters more to me than anybody else I know, and I have NO idea how to support him here. I have zero experience in matters like this. My parents are happily married with a perfectly healthy relationship. Just a divorce alone is incredibly complicated; you go your whole life thinking that having a happy family is a given and just like that it all gets whisked away. Nothing that I would usually say works here, and especially since it's more complicated than a normal divorce, I'm totally at a loss. Not only does he have to deal with split parents, but he also has to rebuild the trust with both of them after learning about the drugs and the cheating.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a lot easier to comfort him when I'm physically with him, but I am 17 and he is 16. I am working on getting my driver's license, his family can't afford the insurance. We live a 25-minute drive away from each other, and my parents are never thrilled to drive me all the way there and back. I see him every day at school but we don't have classes together and the time is spread throughout the day so it feels like 15 minutes. I've been doing all I can over this break to remind him that I love him and that he can get through it but I can't help from feeling that it's not as effective as I want it to be. I'm really the only person he tells all these things, so other friends can't really help in the same way I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice. Not only would I like advice on how to help him with his depression and what to do with that, but I also need to know how to support him through this time with his parents. I really appreciate the help, and thank you for reading all the way through this.

96,"I met a friend in a psych hospital and left nearly 4 months ago. I haven’t talked to her since because last I saw her she was getting ready for a residential which lasts 6-9months. We became really good friends and I miss her a lot. She gave me her number to stay in contact, and then I thought of switching the last digit of her number and low and behold, a middle aged woman responded and I hung up right away. I lowered the digit again and a man responded. I think I found her parents. All I want is to talk with her, to make sure she’s alright. The thing is that her parents have never heard of me, and talking with them will bring up the awkward conversation that I met her at the hospital. I want to believe that they’d be sentimental and at the very least tell me she’s alright and pass on a short message. I don’t expect to get as far as to have phone privileges, but on their perspective, some random guy calls to check up on you’re daughter is suspicious. I just want to ask if she’s okay, but I don’t want this awkward situation to backlash on me or especially her.

I asked for their Instagram and they gave it to me.

They followed back, but it's been a week and today they unfollowed me.

I think it has to do with the fact that I'm literally just a stranger, and that I haven't posted since 2017, despite having a full profile full of old photos.

All I've done was watch one of their stories, and like their most recent pic, so it's not like I did anything wrong.

We use protection every single time. 

We're very open with eachother and I have never felt like I had a reason not to trust him until now. I was on his phone (not snooping) and clicked on his Facebook messenger. I saw some unopened messages. I see the name and instantly recognize it. The girl he had the one night stand with. I keep scrolling and begin to realize that they are talking about their child. My boyfriend goes home on most weekends to visit his family but I had no idea it was to visit his son. I started freaking out but kept my cool when my boyfriend came back in the room. The next day I confronted him and he admitted everything. He said he was too embarrassed to tell me and he thought if I knew about it I might leave him. I feel betrayed. His son was born in December of 2017, we had been dating for several months at that point and he knew she was pregnant before we even met.

110,"I’m a senior in high school and I was planning to go with my two ‘closest’ friends. Air quotes because while I do have a few similarities with them there are a some things they say and things that they did that I don’t agree or approve of. In my freshman year of high school, I’ve been planning on going for sure to my senior prom, even if I never went to any of the dances the previous years. 

In my sophomore year of high school we made plans to go together senior year, and a few months ago I guess it kind of hit them that prom is right around the corner. They’re both extremely awkward and quiet in school but are loud and extroverted when we’re together. 

In the middle of the school year they weren’t sure if they wanted to go anymore, couldn’t decide where to eat, how to drive there, etc. A month or two ago I asked my mom if I could order my ‘dream’ prom dress that I really wanted to wear and she said she could pay for it. I brought this up with my friends and they said they weren’t going to go anymore because they thought it’d be weird to go to the dance. I said that I could pay for their tickets, pay gas money, etc and that I was 100% hoping to go. I told my mom that they didn’t wanna go anymore  and she and I decided it would be best not to order it just because they were contemplating for too long. 

Today, one of the girls randomly told us that her brother could bring us. I was kind of annoyed that she told us so late because prom is five days from now and I haven’t bought a dress. The entire day I’ve been working, and the only day that I’ll be able to even possibly find a dress is on Thursday. She said that I could borrow her old dress and she could borrow one of mine, which I did not agree with. I told her I wasn’t sure because I didn’t want to borrow a dress and I was planning to order my dress a few months ago, which they still said no to. 

Sorry, I really don’t mean to sound stuck up at all. I’m just upset that I’ve been waiting for their response and for them to still contemplate if they should go or not. I’ve even told one of them that I could pay for her dress. I’ve been looking forward to this for years and suddenly they shut me down but bring it up again at such a stressful time for me. I was really looking forward to wearing a dress that I really liked, not one that I had to borrow from a friend. My family are advising me not to go with them, but with other friends. But they’re the only ones who I know the best, so I don’t know if I should bite my pride and go or to not go at all.

So, growing up, we always hung out together. He was pretty mature and I was kinda naive so it worked out, plus we had similar interests. Our families lost touch for a few years but we’ve recently been all hanging out again. The two of us naturally gravitated back to each other and he’s still really cool and we still have a lot of the same interests, even the same career field. Here’s the problem: when I hang out with him, it feels kinda the same as when I’ve hung out with guys I’ve had crushes on in the past, there’s like this click and everything is just, I don’t know, good.

But I’ve also never had a best friend before, and I’ve never really had any friends of the opposite gender before. So maybe he’s just my first male (best) friend? What do you all think? Or am I just overthinking all this too much?",29Apr2019,0
124,"For background information, I have only one sibling. We've both pretty much moved out. My parents, who are mid-fifties, are selling the house, which is quite big, and downsizing to an apartment. They didn't have a dip in income or anything; they just feel that the current house is far too large for just two people. I live with friends who live with their parents. Their dad, R, is pretty wise and always tells it like it is. He talked to me this morning and asked:

""If you had to bet 100$, do you think your parents will stay together or not?""

I had to think. I've been bracing for a divorce for years. My parents fight all the time, only talk business and essentials, take trips and vacations separately, aren't lovey around one another, and I know that my dad is seeing a therapist about the marriage (though it's not couple's therapy; my mom doesn't go with him).

R said that it was extremely likely, because what kind of married couple would spend the rest of their years in an apartment, especially when both of my parents are well off? He explained that people often move to apartments before divorcing, where they'll split the money or whatever and one will move somewhere else. That made sense to me...

Should I ask my dad if he and my mom are planning to divorce? I feel like he'd lie to me, but if there's a chance of him telling me, I want to know. I can't ask my mom; she's crazy and will freak out on me. Is this any of my business anyway?  I'm over 18, after all. 

I want to know because if they do, my mom will most likely drink herself to death or kill herself. My brother would be absolutely devastated at the divorce and the possible death. I wouldn't be, as I know my mom better than he does (at her possible death, I'd obviously be crushed). I don't intend to convince them to stay together for anyone's sake. I just want to know so I can prepare myself for really hard times. Should I ask him?",29Apr2019,1
125,"I go to university and I've been acquainted with this guy for a little over six months. I bump into him maybe once or twice every other week. Every time I see him, we chat for a minute and he always asks me the same, specific questions.

By specific, I mean really specific. I don't want to say what the questions are for privacy reasons, but it's similar to someone asking you ""where are you from?"" or ""how old are you?"" or ""what are you studying?"" every time they see you. I wouldn't expect someone I didn't really know to remember asking me those questions, but as I've mentioned before, I see him semi-frequently.

The first few times he asked, I thought he probably just forgot I already answered those questions, but I've began to notice he always brings them up whenever he sees me.

As an overly anxious person, I'm not sure why he keeps forgetting. I've began to anticipate his questions whenever I see him.

Am I just a really forgettable person? Does he just have really bad memory? (He studies engineering so I'm not sure if this is likely.) Or am I just over thinking this like I do with everything else in my life??",29Apr2019,1

128,"A couple years ago an ex friend and I had a falling out after I found out she made a group chat to make fun of our other friends (other students, and strangers) and telling them to commit suicide (a lot of them already having suicidal tendencies/depression issues). I called out her actions and she said I hurt her feelings because I told her she was a bad person for doing this. Keep in mind we're adults, not petty high schoolers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Since years have past since I called her out on this, I've moved on and am frankly (not to flex) successful in my life and in the industry I work in. This scares her as she knows I have the ability to ruin her reputation by telling my higher ups of what shes behind to this day. The strange thing is that she is obviously uncertain as to how she wants to interact with me, one day shes friendly and kind and treats me like a human because she knows I could easily get her fired, the next shes stone cold and cruel making sure I'm aware that she very much hates my guts. Because of this, I have attempted to cut her out of my life only for her to keep finding ways to me to which she begins to act kind again and a ""changed person"" act.

&amp;#x200B;

She hasnt become a better person, she hasnt apologized for her behavior and confidently continues her actions but i also (somehow) do not want to be the one to ruin her chances of getting work in our field. Shes clearly a troubled person, not many good friends and she's deeply hated by a lot of people we know for being a really scummy person. I can't confront her and ask her to get help because I know she is already with two separate therapists and know she can lash out.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am completely unsure how to go about this, she isnt (so far or as i know so far) hurting people directly by harassing them in our work spaces but instead behind the scenes online which she deems ""okay"" 

I'm afraid for the possibility somebody will one day come to me telling me she is causing issues like a teenager and know i could have kept them from happening. 

Do I let my higher ups know about her? Do I give her another chance? It's clear shes trying to be a better person and shes troubled but after enough personal chances isnt enough enough? Or should I be more mature and leave my personal experiences with her out of it and let my higher ups decide themselves after hearing from others.",29Apr2019,1

131,"I'm 15 right now, and I've been living with a Russian narcissist mother all my life. And when I mean narcissistic, I mean SEVERELY narcissistic. Also, this is my first post and I'm typing on my phone, so please excuse the format. And, also, please excuse how jumpy this is, I'm just listing the worst things that have happened, just not in order. I need to get things off my chest. I would also appreciate advice..

My mother, of course, expects the best grades. A few weeks ago, she called me a whore because I started dating my first boyfriend, and then got a B on a test because I was caught up in the romance and all. She's called me worthless, a slut, a disappointment, the weak link, etc.  Whenever I try to fight back and tell her that what she's doing is wrong, she'll scream at me. She's even gone as far as to throw CHAIRS and BOOKS at me.

Now, you might be asking; Where's your father? Why isn't he stopping this?

Well, the answer is because he's been so degraded by my mother, that he's too scared to do anything. He's been my best support ever since I was little, and is a literal angel to me. He's even offered to divorce her if need be after a huge explosion of an argument had happened. But he's just too scared of her, because of what SHE'S done to HIM.

One of the worst experiences I've had was actually this past summer. My mom goes to Russia every summer to visit her family, who are more than terrified of her at this point, so she leaves my little sister, my dad, and I to clean the house. Of course, my grandmother on my dad's side, who is also an absolute angel, helps out too. Mom used to take my little sister and I to Russia  every summer so Dad and grandma would have to clean, but we stopped going together whenever I was in 4th grade. My mom is also a horder, so she would stuff a lot of garbage in the attic, and wait for us to clean it. Anyways, this summer, my grandmother helped us clean the attic, and did an amazing job. She then declared that the attic would be our (my sister and I) hangout area. For a little more context; my mother would never mind if my grandmother would clean the attic. She would always thank my grandmother and relish in the work as though she had done it herself. Well, this year, after grandmother proposed to the idea that it would be our area to hangout, my mom COMPLETELY flipped. She was screaming and rioting around the house. It was to where she almost grabbed a knife on my grandmother, and we almost had to get the police. Now my mother demands we cut ties with my grandmother, but we refuse.

Recently, my boyfriend heard about what was going on because I accidentally slipped a bit of information. I don't like to talk to anyone about it. Only my family knows. So he was absolutely fuming about what I had gone through my whole life, and is now very protective of me, especially around my mom.

I just don't know what to do. I have gotten anxiety because of her. I have low self esteem because of her. I've almost commit suicide twice because of her. I'm never
 enough for her... What should I do..?",29Apr2019,1
132,"I'm going to give the people from the story names.

My brother and i's friend would be cullen and his girl friend's name would be Chass, My brothers name is Brian

&amp;#x200B;

I had this friend well he was more of Brian's best friend and he became my best friend as well, he would help me with trying to get a gf or to get out of the house more or just to talk if i needed to, and well he stole from me and my brother which i was not very happy about but we got everything back and all was all but i didn't really trust him very much but then he started to date this girl and then he started to drink and smoke weed. then he just recently got her pregnant with her second child, which not the main problem. A couple of days ago He took a vape from Brian and  cullen told me that brian and him had a agrement sense brian owes him 50 that he would just take the vape and that brian would only owe him 40. well he didn't talk to my brother at all and just took the vape from his room and left. That is where the shit hit the fan.

I told my brother what he had told me and they talked and they weren't the nicest to each other and i got pulled into it which i told brian to fix it cause i was not about to deal if that because it was not my problem. But some words were said and the drama unfolded which they told my mother that i was smoking with him( which i have never smoked ever before) and my mother was involved with it and my mother got a text that i had drank ( which again i have never.) and i got into trouble for that. and more stuff was said and in the end they are not allowed back over to my home and not to contact me or our family ever again.

What i am trying to get at is i was really close with cullen but he is cause to much trouble for me and my family to deal which really sucks and all but i fucking hate having to lose him i have done so much for him as have my family, we have let him stay at our house for more that 2 years because him and his family were having some issues which was great honestly because it was someone new and i grew close to him he was like my older brother and i could connect to and talk to him when i was feeling depressed. He helped me out more than my parents have had and it really bugs me that i have just lost a long time great friend.

135,"Since I moved with my parents last October I’ve fallen in love with this cat. The lady who used to live here fed him and now I feed him when he shows up at my basement window when I wake up. I know this can be a slippery slope since he isn’t the only one around but I make sure to remove the food so housecats/raccoons don’t eat it. 

The problem is he seems chubby enough to be healthy but I’m not sure if it’s another issue and he has pink eye/ slime around his eyes so I’m not sure he can hunt properly, and seems to be in pain sometimes; in addition I live in Canada so the temperatures in winter go wayy low and long, I’m worried since I’ll be moving to the city next year, and no one else that I know of feeds cats and my parents definitely aren’t. 
He definitely is a stray and after a few months seems comfortable with me/ eat out of my hand and lets me pet him but recoils as soon as there isn’t food and runs away from everyone else. 

I wanted to take him to the vet at least but would he be happier in a warm home with toys and food? Or should I leave him outside?

137,"This seems really stupid, but I've been thinking about it lately.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend details cars as his main job and then does a bunch of detail work on the side at a garage he rents just to make some extra money. He'll details cars for friends and stuff and they'll pay him, it's cheaper than taking it to the shop he works at but the quality is basically the same. I asked him one time in person if he would detail my car and he said ""no"" but I think either he was joking or he just meant he couldn't do it right now. But he does it for a lot of other people, even people that aren't really even friends. He's actually my closest friend and has been for like 5 years, so i find it weird that I'm afraid to ask but I am. I'd pay him the same price everyone else does, I don't need a discount or anything, I'm just afraid to ask for some reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just take my car somewhere else to get detailed or just ask? The problem is, if I ask and he says no, I will be angry because he's been doing it for people that aren't even friends but he won't do it for a close friend?

138,"To start off, I (14F) am on mobile. Formatting may not be great, but I’m trying. I have an older brother (15 but almost 16, we’ll call him Big Brother, BB for short.) and we are both devastated when we heard our mom telling us individually that she wanted to go back to Japan. 

The first time they split up was when I was 6, and when BB was 8. I don’t remember why, but they split apart for 3 years, until I was 9. They had apartments across the street from each other and we would spend some days at one parents place and then the other. 

Everything happened today, and it’s been happening since Friday night, after my dad came back from Germany to finalize his work for 10 days. Brother and I have been listening to their arguing for 3 nights in a row. 

My mother is amazing. So is my dad. They may not agree on most things, but I know they love each other very much, or at least I hope they do.

This is my dad’s side of the story:
My mother didn’t do anything for the house or for me and BB during the 10 days he was gone. We don’t listen to what he wants, we don’t appreciate what he buys and does for us. We can’t organize for shit, and we don’t clean anything until he gets mad and almost yells at us to do so. 

He’s half right. My mom tries to do things for the house. She feeds us, she did the dishes even though it’s the kids’ chore. She and I even baked a cake together. We had fun. It was nice. But, we don’t listen to him. And I really don’t know why. I’m really trying to change everything I’m doing wrong but I end up going back to square one, and then I get in trouble, my grades slip, and everything becomes one shithole. 
BB is the quarterback for his high school football team, and since he doesn’t have *ONE* good grade, he’s not allowed to play football??? Hold up. He can’t do that. That’s really not fair. It’s just one grade and I doubt it’s that low. My brother, my mother and I are really trying our best. Apparently he doesn’t think that way. 

Now, I know where he’s coming from. He grew up with not-so-great things. His punishments reflect what we did. But sometimes, I think he could be a bit lenient. Just that. And if he weren’t so loud all the time, singing his country music all the time and trying to embarrass the family all the time, maybe everything will be all good. But I can’t say anything because I don’t want to hurt his feelings and I don’t want him to argue again. He’s been through so much for us already. 

As I said, this is the third night they’ve been arguing. I don’t put yelling because my dad doesn’t yell. He just has a loud voice. My mom on the other hand, she screams. 

Tonight they argued about cleanliness around the house and how BB and my rooms are pigsties. I admit, my closets were disgusting, but I managed to fold all my laundry and hang all my shirts up. I did what I was told, so did BB. I hear more yelling and loud voices. My mom said something about how she should leave because she can’t organize or something. She then says “I’m going back to Japan.”  My dad says to us: “You hear that, kids? Your mother is going back to Japan. Do you want her to go back to Japan?? Do you want to go back to Japan??” 

Of course both our answers were a straight no. 

Next thing we knew, my mom was going downstairs and actually buying tickets to Japan. 

I follow her downstairs and when I see her at the dining table with her iPad, I ask her (in Japanese, because BB and I are half, my mom is full japanese) if she is actually buying a ticket to go back. She relies yes, and that she doesn’t want to argue with my dad anymore because it’s killing her. 

I heard my heart break. 

My dad comes back down with my brother and talks about how she’s running away from her problems because she’s going to just leave BB and me here. 

I don’t want my mom to go back, Reddit. I really don’t. She’s really important to me and I want her to stay. At least go to marriage counseling with my dad or something, just don’t go. 

My brother and I don’t know what to do, and I don’t want to have divorced parents again. It’s going to be so fucking disgusting if we’re left here with my dad, especially me.

140,"So I do have a little bit of a problem. And this is my first post, so this oughta be interesting. Anyways, I’ve known this girl for pretty much all my life (since kindergarten), and I’ve had feelings for her for a while through elementary school. I’ll just call her Sally through this post (not her actual name). So I’d known Sally through elementary school, and even asked her out in 5th, getting denied, but I didn’t take it too hard since I was an oblivious little kid who didn’t exactly think it mattered much. Throughout middle school, I only really saw her a lot in seventh grade. We’d walk the halls a lot and it was nice to talk to her, cause we’d been friends for a long time and had plenty of stuff to talk about.
Then a while after, couple of years, I was talking to her and she just out of the blue says; “If you had asked me out in seventh, I would’ve totally said yes. But now I’m not so sure.” 
The conversation we were having wasn’t aggressive, and usually she just only tells me that I should stop telling sarcastic jokes for longer then five seconds when we’re talking. This has been messing with me for a while now. And I had actually been walking with her in the halls more recently, cause we share way more classes then we did last year. I don’t exactly have experience in this and I can’t really tell if she’d rather me a friend or is making some kind of move. Either way I’m confused. I think I still have feelings for her, but I have no clue if the feeling’s at all mutual.
I feel like I could have a decent relationship with her, and we’d have a fun time with it, but I’m just a nervous and scrawny kid that is way too nervous about this to be reasonable about it. I don’t know if I should start making some kind of moves, or even how to make those moves. But I think I need help telling friendliness from flittering.

148,"Im laying in bed and its difficult to think of anything in my head at all. I have nothing, if not, barely anything to think over that comes from my mind. Its like my thoughts come from things situationally, like the articles and videos I see in my reddit feed as I’m scrolling through. So it feels like the majority of the time I can only think in response to something external. Even when I meditate to try and search around in my head nothing really comes up. Unless I have a particular focus on something of interest any time of the day, or if it’s happened recently but its still hard. But how do I even find anything to focus on when my mind is like a field of nothingness, of which there’s nothing to pick, or at least everything is hidden away. Am I just not guiding my thoughts in the right way, am I in the wrong mood? Cause I desperately feel like theres so much I should be able to think about like my own memories, interests or current world events. Tbh i think my memory in general is a bit fucked.

This also becomes quite an issue when I socialise whether its with good friends or new acquaintances. Though this particular example may be hindered by the fact that I also have social anxiety.

Im a high functioning autist and I suspect also OCD.

Is this normal to deal with? How does thinking work when you’re by yourselves? What do you usually think about? And how could I help this issue? Please share anything.

150,"I'm a single dad. I walked in on my daughter (14) and her boyfriend (17)  making out about an 4 hours ago. I don't think they saw me because I was being sort of sneaky (I just wanted to see what they were doing. I always check in on them every hour or so.) I just walked away quietly and did not disturb them. I've had the sex talk with her and she takes birth control and always has condoms. (I buy her a box every few weeks and I know she uses them. She doesn't say so but I'm not aumb. She just says thank you.) I'm comfortable with her having sex with this boy. She dated him for about a year before they had sex (even though that doesn't matter really, she can make her own decisions about how far into a relationship she should have sex.) He left about an hour ago and as soon as he did she came to me and started crying. She said that he ""never listens"" to her about ""stuff"" they should do. She said that he made her feel worthless. I was very confused so I asked what she meant. She said that when they had sex she asked him to do something (she told me what it was but I don't think it's necessary to state it. It's not anything crazy.) and he called her a ""whore"" and told her she was ""weird."" I don't know what to do?? I told her that it was okay, she didn't have to do anything she did not want to do, and neither did he.

157,"Like I said, I will be graduating in a couple weeks for engineering. I have an awesome job lined up when I do graduate, but as I get closer to the finish line I'm starting to feel so confused. I love the field I'm in, but I can't help but wonder is this the right path? I've been so set on graduating and finding a job, I think I didn't allow any other thoughts to come into mind. I've personally motivated myself everyday, and have had serious graduation/stability goals. Now that I'm graduating, I just can't help to think what's next?

158,"I guess Im wanting advice or if you've been through something similar please tell me, Im, not alone...

So this is what's happening, I am a 17-year-old female and currently, I feel absolutely crazy due to my family. I guess this mainly started when I was younger. As I started puberty depression hit me really hard. I isolated my self and my family started to make me think I was crazy and just a terrible, annoying person. I have three older brothers and they would and constantly do things to upset me. When I was younger it was telling me to kill me or that I was an accident, that our parents never wanted me. And because I was 12-14 and already depressed I believed them.  My mom didnt care that they would tell me to kill my self either, but if I told the to fuck off or to shut up I would be in trouble. Now they egg me on and do things to upset me to the point of tears because they find it funny. sometimes when I ask them to stop they never do, I can be begging hem to and they just laugh and mess with me more. And when I say anything back I'm being bitchy I can't take a joke, Im a prude and no fun.  More recetly Ive been trying to break out of my shell because after After years of being told to shut daily I've become soft spoken, quiet, and at one point pretty much mute. But if I raise my voice at all to speak to my brother behind a door I'm a bitch, I'm angry, I'm accused of being hostile. But If I speak too quietly Im being annoying and a problem. I don't know how to speak around my family and I normally resort to saying nothing. But because I just say nothing Im no fun to talk to or something. Most recently my brother moved away and before he left me, him and my mom were standing in my moms' room. My brother put his arms out to hug me and I went in to hug him. He didn't wrap his arms around me or make any movement to hug me back. So I pulled away, he scoffed and left. My mom gave me a look and made a comment that I couldn't even hug my own brother. But I did... or I tried to. Next is me driving. A while ago my mom would take me driving but in the past few months, she refuses to let me drive at all. But complains about having to take me everywhere. She won't let me drive but says I have to go take my driving test first. I don't understand it and Im not sure if this is a normal thing. How am I supposed to taking a driving test is I hasn't driven a car in the past 6 months? Following this she refuses to get me a car and dismisses me when I bring the topic up. For my two middle brothers, she got both of them cars, and helped my oldest get a car. Im not getting anything so even if I could drive my self I have to rely on everyone in my family. Im at the point where I feel like thse event are normal and maybe Im overreacting... I dont know what do anymore and I just need and outside opinion to tell me if Im in the wrong here and maybe really as bad as my family says I am. Because I honestly dont know.. this has been my life for as long as I can remember I dont know anything else...Thanks for any help",29Apr2019,1

160,"I'm sure people have issue similar or maybe even the same as this, but I've found that looking at answers to individual parts of my problem isnt working so here it goes.

Im about a week away from finishing high school and fortunately I've done well enough to ensure that I graduate. Despite this, there are some long term issues. My family doesnt have enough money for me to go to college so I have to rely on scholarships. I had it planned out to where I have enough to get me most of the way there and in the end the student loans wouldnt be that bad. My dream is to be an aerospace engineer and I want to start by going to the college I've already been accepted to so I can major in mechanical engineering and minor in physics. All of this sounds like it's going to work out right? That's what I thought until I went to my school councilor.

She told me that in order to get one of the big scholarships I thought i already ensured I would get, I had to get certain grades in certain classes for the semester. She told me this about halfway into the semester and from the looks of it, it was going to be difficult to get that. All of my work was going to come down to this last stretch and I though I had it. But now here's where my issues come in to ruin me this prompting me to make this post.

I have my end goal in mind and a manageable road bump ahead of me, but I feel like I'm holding myself back and I dont know why. Like there will be homework assignments that I can easily do for point but I'll get lazy and beat myself up after for not doing it. I've tried setting very specific and somewhat relaxed schedules in which neither have worked. I've tried making sure that distractions are no where to be found, but then I feel tired and fall asleep. I been through countless forums and videos trying to find help, but none were successful. I've been to therapy and one of the big things he told me was I need to solve me eating issues as I've learned that I throw up most foods and dont eat that much or that well.

To put things in general my mind is on board for my success, but my body isnt. I'll literally save entire days to study and do work, but only actually do stuff for school for about 2 hours at most. Please if anyone knows how to help me solve this problem please let me know anything will help.

161,"Okay first some background. I live in Australia as a permanent resident,  meaning I have to pay for university until my citizenship is granted. I have been involved in music for quite some time but never really excelled in neither theory or my instrument. I always admired the idea of becoming a music teacher. I have struggled with anorexia and depression since high school. Recovered from Anorexia but had a relapse last year and only became weight restored again before Christmas holidays. 

NOTE - made a major move to a city to attend this music university 

I'm halfway through my first semester of music education and am really struggling with the music components. I haven't picked up my instrument in 2 weeks when I'm supposed to be practicing 3 hours minimum a day. I'm falling back into anorexic behaviours and have had days where I skipped class because I couldn't get myself to leave the house. 

Main reasons that are holding me back from dropping out are:
1. I already paid for this semester and am not eligible for a refund
2. Disappointing my lecturers (especially instrumental teacher) 
3. Disappointing my partner - he doesn't know I'm struggling this much 
4. Dissapointing my peers in upcoming concerts

163,"Alright, so this is my first real post, so forgive me if I don't do this right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lost my job in Los Angeles due some shady dealings with my employer in November 2018. I worked and lived in a hotel and had to use my minimal savings to move back home (to South Dakota) as I had nowhere to go. I don't have many friends to speak of as I am generally very reserved in person, though online is a little different. My mother is toxic, an understatement honestly. I am preparing to move out now, however I'm wondering if the problems are myself or my family. I finally got a job after 5 months of searching and I want to move out, but now I'm wondering if I am the fucked up one? I'm sorry this is a bit winded, but I want the backstory and the math available to be as transparent as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

As children (I have two younger brothers, I'm the oldest and only girl) CPS was called numerous times, but nobody did anything since ""injuries"" were not in ""sensitive"" places and the emotional issues weren't severe enough either I guess? We were regularly subjected to things being thrown at us, I was slapped and tossed into walls. I have physical scars from some of the things that went down. My mom would call us horrible names and slaughtered any self esteem. Most of this happened after my mother and father divorced. My mother and father divorced when I was 8, after my mother up and took my brother and I away from my father just leaving the house randomly a few months before. From there until now (I'm 27), I almost never see him, and barely know him, so I couldn't go live with him. I was too afraid to tell anyone about the abuse because as military kids, we moved a lot, and never had any friends. We had lived in this one location after my mother married again (my first step father) and this was when the abuse started, or maybe I started remembering then. This started about 10 and lasted until I was about 16. Then my mother and first step-father divorced and I moved out of my mother's home and into my grandmothers home (almost 1500 miles away) and spent my senior year of high school in a new place. I was so messed up I was angry and threatening to a lot of people and saw a counselor for the next 3 or 4 years until I finished my first college degree (AAS in Animation). Eventually I calmed, but was very sensitive and my PTSD would trigger easily at first. I was ok for a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never dated during high school or my first year of college. I am absolutely terrified to date, though I did try. I couldn't, and still, stand to be touched in any way. Even just from friends, or other family members. My body just pulls away instinctively, and this makes my ""friends"" think I hate them. I tried to date one guy, but after he tried to cuddle with me and I pulled away, I got scared of any commitment, afraid it would turn into a controlling environment after his reaction. So I left him after only a few months. The only guy I truly liked had died in a car accident in high school, so I simply shut down in terms of looking for any sort of emotional connection to anyone between the abuse and relationships not working out. 

&amp;#x200B;

However my grandparents and I didn't get along either. We fought constantly, mostly because of issues with my self-esteem and anger from getting over stuff in the past. They said I wasn't living with Mom anymore and needed to ""get over it"". I was overly sensitive and angered easily, however my grandparents were also angry I was studying art and telling me to get a ""real career"". When I applied to transfer to another art college, I was literally kicked out. I moved in with a friend for about 2 weeks, I was 20, almost 21, and didn't my family didn't have to keep me anymore. I got my acceptance letter soon after and was granted permission to stay with my family for two weeks until I got my stuff together to move 2000+ miles away for my new college. 

I got mixed messages from my family about them being proud of me for pursuing a Bachelors degree and for them being angry about it being Art. I should note I was not drawing all my life, I had planned on being in the medical or animal related fields but had a TB scare, and thus it was on my record, as far as I know, am not allowed to work with children or animals. I wanted to be in forensics or a biologist of some kind, probably bats. That's why I started drawing art, I loved animals and originally wanted to go into wildlife art. However during my years at my first and second college, I started loving storytelling and fell in love with comics, manga and animation. I was studying illustration at my second school and had a good enough portfolio to transfer and skip freshman year. 

&amp;#x200B;

However college was still expensive, each year of tuition was about 30-40k. My father, who was far more supportive, gave me his GI Bill, but as the school was private, it was capped at 20k, plus the money I got from the VA and College via the Yellow Ribbon, so an additional 10k a year.  I pretty much got my tuition covered, and had to pay almost everything else. I still ended up with sizable debt in 3 different loans, one in my name and one in my parent's (mom and step-dad #2) names, which THEY decided to take. I was going to quit, but they took it out. I found this strange as they were not the most supportive, but eat of us had about 25k in loans, so about 73-75 was my principal amount. Yeah, I know it's a lot, but considering the 3 years cost about 150k total, I got away pretty good only owing half of that. I'm making payments, and have been since graduating in 2015. My personal loan is at about 24k, so I'm keeping up with interest at least, not too bad, and my mother and second step father are paying the Parent PLUS loans they took out. I pay one of their loans, on top of mine. So that is about 600$ a month I have going out since NOV of 2015. 

Additionally, I know my mom and second step-dad used some of the loan money for THEMSELVES, because when I did the math on my loan money given versus what I spent, I was over 9k SHORT. I love math and am very good at it, I was a hawk tracking my money. The loan money was given to my parents and they had to give it to me, I know they kept some of it. They expect me to pay ALL their parent plus loans back and I'm resistent, so I'm only paying ONE of the two parent plus loans. Legally, they can't force me to pay more than I want to, and stealing from me was a betrayal on top of all the abuse growing up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the fuck ups: 

&amp;#x200B;

After graduation, I moved back to my grandparents, they needed some help, I needed a way to get grounded after graduation. My grandmother ended up in cardiac arrest and died for 7 minutes a few months after I moved back. My grandparents are not working, one on disability for 30 years and one just retired. Money was... not readily available without huge withdrawls. I had about 7k saved up and decided to help out my grandparents. I GAVE them the little money I had saved up for moving and getting my own place, and I found a job working at walmart at night to give me something for the moment. We continued to fight, they called me lazy and other things for staying up late and working on my comic and art after getting home from my shift at walmart. I did my chores and helped with finances and helping my grandmother recover from her near-death experience. She only survived, according to doctors because I was able to talk my grandfather through doing CPR (which I learned a few years previous when I volunteered at a hospital for high school community service credit). I was being treated like the bad one and kicked out after a year living there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had nowhere to go, my father couldn't take me in. I had no friends to take me in. My mother was my only choice, and she lived a few states away. She came to get me and seemed nicer, so I thought maybe she had changed in the years I was away at college. Not really. She was nice at first, but her and my step father were constantly guilting me about my loans. Telling me how them paying BOTH those loans (at 600 a month) was killing their retirement and that it's my fault for not having a good job and picking a shitty degree. I pretty much went from one frying pan to another. I got a ""get out letter"" for christmas 2016, literally on that day and moved out in January to a friends home an hour away and had to look for work, I got a job 4 days later, but was asked to leave my new home in March 2017 when one person and I simply didn't get along AT ALL. Again I was homeless and nowhere to go, I had only been working my job for 2 months and didn't have enough for a new place yet. Nobody would lend me the extra I needed to move into my own place versus going back to my mom's home... which I had to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't able to afford the 1 hour commute (one way) everyday, so had to quit my new job, but thankfully I got another job soon and worked very hard, lots of overtime and earned assistant manager position quickly. My mother and I went back to fighting over ""being lazy"" and ungrateful, despite paying them 600$ a month and doing all the chores, and I moved out in October 2017 into a good home, very cheap but mine. I worked regularly 70+ hours a week at my job, easy to do as an assistant manager to 3 different locations I worked at. I made a lot of money, which was great. I paid off all debt I had (about 5k in credit card and medical bills, mostly medical). I cut up and destroyed the CC's after it was cleared. Then in January 2018, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and begged me to move in with her. My step dad was an over the road trucker and wasn't home. She needed someone to care for her, I was initially resistant becuase I finally got my freedom, but she guilt tripped me. I gave in and moved back in. I paid rent, I was paying for the loans, I was her caretaker. I still was working 70+ hours a week and trying to be her caretaker too. I was on call for her and for work 24 hours a day. I got very sick, had lots of panic attacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom's cancer wasn't even THAT severe. I don't want to minimize it, but she had Stage 0 Breast Ductal cancer. She acted like her life was over and she was going to die. She was an emotional mess and was angry with me if I seemed unsympathetic, usually I was just tired from doing commissions, caring for her house and her and working my regular job. Plus I was taking almost 600 to 800mg of caffiene a day. Most times I was on a high or a crash. no inbetween. I am SO ANGRY at how I was treated. I don't mind paying rent, that's fair, but I was frustrated with her calling me an ingrate and ""I wasn't working hard enough to contribute"". I was working myself to death already and began to have regular anxiety attacks. When that happened, she said ""I needed to get over it and stop worrying so much"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I got my internship at a manga company in Los Angeles and moved there in June 2018 after my mom's cancer was cleared and she was proved cancer free due to treatment. The whole time leading up to my internship, Mom was telling me it was a mistake and a bad idea. she put doubt in my head and I found out after the fact, she doubted I would actually leave. Well I did. My internship was great, I learned a ton, it was unpaid and unlikely to get a job (I didn't), but I knew that before I left for Cali. The networking ALONE was worth it as I got a ""job"" with Wacom and Clip Studio while I was out there. I worked another job at the hotel I lived at but when I found some shady shit went down, I spoke up and was asked to leave. I did and was forced to move back to South Dakota.... with Mom. Since I moved back in, we fight almost daily. She mocks me for not having a ""real job"" however I do, I work for a wonderful company, making good money, 15/hr now and I'm up for a raise to 17 by the end of the year. I work in my field, art doing graphic and printwork and soon I'll be trained in lazer and sandblast engraving. I'm taking a business class and still doing comic and animation work privately. 

&amp;#x200B;

I pay my own loans and one of theirs, 600$ per month total. I do teh dishes, laundry, catbox, sweeping, mopping, dusting, etc. They leave dishes on the table after eating (just walk away and leave it there). They can't throw trash away or put their own cloths away. I am told I don't contribute to the household. If I disagree with my mother in the SLIGHTEST, Mom has a fit and says I have an attitude. I am making enough to move out soon, as I am making 4$ more than I ever have before when I lived here. I can easily afford to move out in about 2 months, so I plan on it. I'm not telling HER that, because the time I even suggested it, she flipped out on me. Told me I am too inept to live alone, I'm not smart enough or wise enough, keep making mistakes and bad choices and I will fail if I move out. I can't even tell her I'm too tired to go out to a garden party/plant swap because she accused me of being uninterested in HER events and HER life. I had been up all night doing a commission and had only slept about 4 hours. I was too tired. I went anyway, and she ignored me the entire time and talked to her friends, pointless that I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

She still gets in my face yelling at me. She still threatens me, but doesn't touch me anymore in terms of physical violence, probably because I'm not a child anymore and could kick her ass now. My step dad is even worse, calling me a millenial snowflake because I eat carefully (I have celiac disease and am intolerant to nighshades and milk). Says I am making it up when I have official celiac diagnosis, but unofficial intolerance. I haven't had insurance in 5 years, so I can't get a nutritionist to look at me. I'll have insurance starting in a week, so that's not an issue anymore, but they refuse to accept my dietary needs and regularly make food I can't eat, mostly stuff with gluten in it. I tell them I can't eat it, and they yell at me for wasting food and well, I make myself sick eating it. I know it is damaging my body, but it keeps the peace. I have started being mute at home in the last two weeks unless spoken to and HAVE to give an answer, but now they think I am being mean and giving the cold shoulder. Im just trying to keep peace since they always think I have an attitude in my tone of voice. So I can't speak and I can't be quiet.... 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on moving out in September before winter strikes. I'll have savings enough by then. However... I'm wondering if I am the bad one. If they say I have an attitude I do? My grandparents say it... I don't have a lot of friends. I don't ever ask for anything from friends or family. I don't talk much in general honestly except online. I don't talk about my homelife in person or at work. I literally have 1 or 2 IRL friends, both co-workers. If I got stranded on the side of the road, I would rather walk than call someone... I feel lonely and hated by everyone. I had a friend I talked to for almost 5 years every single day and she suddenly ghosted me for months. Later found out she got a GF, and was busy with summer stuff and her new GF. So I felt abandoned by her and I really only talk to one other person on a half decent basis. She is pretty busy, so I try not to bother her. Overall I feel abandoned, hated, ugly (I am overweight due to complications from celiac), and in general not someone anyone would like. I have bad health, I hate TV and going out. I hate movies, I don't enjoy stuff ""regular"" people like... idk I just... don't enjoy those things. I don't like parties or games. I like sitting in and reading, or drawing, puzzles and mystery documentaries and books. I've never had a REAL boyfriend beyond some dinners out, but it never went anywhere if you know what I mean. I don't know how to be close to people. I don't know how to make friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I just... feel like someone nobody likes and I don't know if it's me or my slaughtered self esteem or both. Probably both. I haven't really been this open before, so I apologize for the insane text wall. I mostly just want to know if people think if I really am a horrible mean unlikeable person... or if there is some hope for me.",29Apr2019,2
164,"Hi,

This happened some time ago and it’s beginning to bother me more and more because I’m not sure if I have a right to be upset and I’ve been having nightmares about it. 

I was homeless. I had stayed at a friends house because I couldn’t sleep in my car anymore. I laid on my stomach as he crawled on top and did his thing. I gave absolutely no indication that I wanted it. I was quiet and motionless. I felt like I owed it to him for letting me stay with him in his bed. Several times he asked if it was okay, but I never responded. He just kept going anyway. It happened twice. 

I feel like it was my fault. I always told myself if I was in a situation like that, I would stop it from happening, and I didn’t. I feel like I deserved it because I was too much of a coward. I don’t feel like I could say I was sexually assaulted or raped because I just let it happen and it makes me feel guilty.",29Apr2019,19
165,"My SO is depressed and has been for a long time.  He's finally admited it, but he isn't one to seek out help. He is a very private person and it's taken a long time for him to let down his wall,  even with me.

I blame some of his attitude on dpression on his mother, who believes that one can simply ""snap out of"" depression.  It's strange that she thinks this, given that she has another son with schizophrenia and treats him like a baby because  he can't help it. She even enables his drug habit, because ""he's just crazy, he can't  help it"". I've tried to explain to her many times that depression is a mental illness, just like schizophrenia and there is no ""snapping out of it"". She simply believes that she's just never met anyone with clinical depression (although there are quite a few in her family that have it and she is quick to place blame on them).

But back to our story. At first he played it off as stress from work and lack money.  He was working and going to school full time and we just had our first child together. I  tried to explain that he was depressed (albeit briefly, I did study abnormal psych in school and have dealt with depression myself since childhood, so I am more than familiar with the signs), but he refused. He assured  me things would be better when he graduated. He graduated. Things will be better when I find a job. He found a job. Things will be better if I ever manage to make enough to support our family. He's gotten several raises and his income alone has brought our family from poverty to middle class. When we get a house things will be better. We bought a house and even had a second child. Here we are 3 years later, and things are getting worse.

He is irritable most days. He loses patience very quickly and loses his temper. He's tired all of the time. He'll fall asleep watching the children sometimes. He has no motivation to do anything.  We put up a nice sum of money to save up so we can build him a shop, a long time dream of his. He often says he doesn't know when he'll find time to do anything in the shop anyway. He feels guilty because he wants to spend time with our children,  but he is so tired. He feels guilty when he needs to take a day off because the exhaustion that comes with depression has become too much. I try to tell him, I get it. I know what it's like when you cannot seem to motivate yourself to even get out of bed. When he needs the rest, I let him have it and I don't hold it against him, yet he still feels guilty. 

We've had a serious breakthrough (at least I feel like it, maybe he feels differently) in our relationship recently. He's started sharing with me and communicating with me a lot more of his emotions and deeper thoughts.  He's been so reluctant to be vunerable with me in the past, but it's finally happened. Unfortunately,  everything he's communicated has completely confirmed my theory, he is depressed. He has finally admitted that he is depressed,  but he is still sure that he can just 'snap out of it' (thanks, MIL..). I haven't discussed the idea of therapy with him recently,  as in the past I was met with much contempt at the mere thought of him ever seeing any doctor, let alone a therapist. I'm trying to be a little more tactile about it this time. I am so afraid that if I mention it, he will build his wall up again and be even more reluctant to ever let me in again. 

But the time has come. Things have gotten too bad and I am becoming affected and so are our children. I  must admit I have been in denial myself lately. I've been going on and on about how I am finally not depressed,  but I know it's a lie. I've even lied to myself, telling myself that I'm finally in a  good place. Big mistake,  because the darkness has been slipping in for some time and when I finally crash, I know it's going to be hard. I've decided to seek out professional therapy for myself. The hope is to encourage my husband to do the same and, well, to get some treatment before I'm too far gone.

But I need help with this very sensitive matter. And I feel like I may only have one shot, so I've really got to make it count. My heart is breaking for my husband. Watching the person I love most suffer this way, it hurts. But I will not give up on him, I refuse. 

How do I get him to finally get some help? How can I go about this so that he doesn't completely shut me out?",29Apr2019,2
167,I’m kind of annoyed or feeling kinda crappy I really like this girl and she’s kinda just been ignoring me the past few days. Like I just wanna talk to her and see how she’s doing and ask her how her day is an crap but I don’t want to be annoying and text her every single second. I asked like a week ago if she likes anyone and she said “ehh maybe”. She asked me if I did and I told her I did and I said “ I’m gonna try and move on because there’s no point” and then she told me she understands but she said if you see a slight chance don’t give up and try. The thing is it always seems like she’s kinda flirty with me by always blowing me kisses or hugging me or even walking super close to me but I don’t want to take it the wrong way because she’s just a friendly person like that I guess. Anyways what should I even do.,29Apr2019,1
168,"Does my boyfriend seem emotionally into his ex? They’ve been meeting up secretly behind my back and talking for hours. 

She texted him this: 
Hey so is there like zero chance of whatever between us being like a thing? Like you’re very happy with your relationship status with your lady and you want something strictly platonic here?

He said: 
Without getting into detail, honestly my relationship feels like it is nearing its end. But to answer your question, I think it would be best to be platonic friends or at least have that mindset and have that be the expectation. 

She said: 
Thanks for being upfront. 
So it seems there is no chance of us seeing each other romantically in the future? I feel like we have a connection but I’m assuming that it’s tainted to the point of no return, correct?

He said: 
I think using extremes like no chance or 100% is not productive. However, You just described it perfectly, and I am pretty torn and not sure how to interpret this situation. A situation that I've thought about a lot and still don't know what to make of it. That's just the truth. 

She said: That’s fine. I won’t pressure you to articulate any more feelings right now.
I always think of you and your family because y’all made me who I am. Sorry that I reach out and pester so often. I just am trying to grow and better myself and find myself reflecting on lessons y’all taught me to do so. So naturally I end up thinking of y’all. Have a good night.

Him: Those are very kind words and sentiments. That means a lot to me. Thank you. I share similar feelings for you and your family too. The more time passes, the more I appreciate things like that and the more thankful I am. It's amazing. You have a good night too. When I get on vacation, we could talk.

Her: if you don’t wanna talk and are just trying to be nice I understand. Sleep well.

173,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible but I’m probably going to ramble so apologies in advance. And I may be over thinking this so again apologies. 
About a week ago, I found a little chihuahua puppy. I posted I found this dog on a few places, including the local animal shelter. The dog had no chip or collar. Unfortunately, I already have a full house of pets and am not able to keep the dog. 
After about a day, I was able to secure a foster home for the dog with the possibility of adoption if no owner turned up after 30 days. I spoke to the people at the shelter, they informed because of no chip or collar, the dog is considered a stray but I should still try to find an owner, they said 30 days is more than fair. So that is/was my plan.  The foster mom was aware and on board with the plan. She kept the dog for about a week but because of health reasons, she was unable to keep fostering him and so I was able to quickly find him another foster home under the same conditions. 
While browsing craigslist, I saw a lost dog post that matched the description of the dog I found. I called and spoke to the people. I should also mention the were offering a reward, in all of this, I have not asked for any monetary compensation nor do I want one. Anyway, I asked them to please send me a picture of their dog to match it up with the pup. They said they had none since the phone they had it on was lost. Ok so then I asked for some sort of identifying features of the dog. The said their dog had a  bend in the tip of his tail from an accident and that his front nails were white. These things did not match up with the puppy I found. Nor does it respond with the name they gave me. I told them I would send them pictures of the dogs tail and nails so they can see it is not their dog. I didn’t hear back from them until today, they asked if I could send more pictures. I did so in good faith. They are now insisting it is their dog even though the description they gave me does not match up and they have nothing to back up their claim. A dog’s nail color and tail do not change in a week of missing. They want me to bring the dog to the shelter to make sure it’s not their dog but i feel uneasy about it. Things just do not match up but I also do not want to possibly deny someone reuniting with their pet. I also will say I feel like my judgment is clouding me because I think it’s irresponsible for any pet owner to not a chip or even have a collar on a puppy that is not even six months old. That reward money they are offering should have been spent on getting the dog a chip, if it is their dog. The foster parents are an older couple who are responsible and I know the dog will have a great life with them. They foster parents know that there is a potential owner Im speaking to and have advised me to do what i think is best. I’m not sure what is the right thing to do at the point. I’m sure it may be obvious but sometimes I need an outside opinion. Thanks for anyone who made it this far and any advice willing to be given",29Apr2019,1
174,"Typing this as I just balled my eyes out over the thought of him leaving. Our relationship is suuuuuper complicated so I’ll sum it up best I can.

Using “Adam” in place of his name

Met in 8th grade, became best friends, and I had a huge crush, we dated for a month broke up, picked up contact around 9th grade.

Used to talk very consistently from summer after 9th through spring of 11th. Finally got my license, picked him up and hung out a few times, took his v-card, dated for a while, broke up. 

We saw other people throughout high school, kept light contact as he went into college with gf. I dated loser abusive guy who I’d tell Adam about. Adam and GF break up, he quit school to destress, we started hanging out a lot when he moved back. 

One of my best friends killed themselves and Adam was there for me when no one else was. He loved me, helped me, and we eventually started dating a couple months later, we were living together due to his life situation.  This was in 2016. We also worked together starting in 2017.

I have terrible anger issues I wouldn’t work on because “they weren’t that bad” which obviously caused issues. We started fighting a lot, I went to therapy, I got better, but then it all got worse.

July 2018 he told me he wanted to break up and he wanted to live in a van, do off-grid living. I did not. We felt like we had too many differences. He did not have his license yet, so I had to teach him how. We’ve gone on spurts of me trying to want to go but not being able to. He’s moving across the country in about 5 weeks. I am emotionally destroyed. 



So, what I need help with is how do I begin to accept this? Do I live in the same spot? Do I have to find a new job to help heal? What do I do to fill this empty hole in my chest AND my life. This is almost 9 years of love for a person, I’m almost 22, so this had been a huge chunk of my life. 

I battle depression and anxiety, and I feel so fucking terrified and lost and sad and angry, every emotion fills me when I think about it. I don’t want to harm myself or becoming addicted or become idle in life. I’m losing my best friend/lover/home-away-from-home and I can’t handle it. Any advice would be awesome.

175,During high school one of my classes gets really quiet to where I can hear my female classmate seated next to me swallowing sylvia is this weird or no? I kinda think its weird but I need others opinions,29Apr2019,1
177,"TL;DR. 
Had a brain fart because I was put on the spot and I was slightly drunk so I  rejected her by saying 
“I could care less of what you think of me” but what I was trying to say I generally don’t care of what people think of me and I can’t invest my time in relationships (despite my line of work I’m a bit of antisocial cunt so bear with me) by the time I realised what I had said I already saw her tearing up as she hurried away from the booth. I feel really bad for not chasing after her to tell her I’m sorry. As in I didn’t mean for this to happen I care for her but I don’t care for her in ‘that’ way. 

So at my previous workplace I was in charge of several interns in the operations department one of which is the aforementioned girl. She’s a really nice person, down to earth  and was always willing to go out of her way to help others. I know for a fact that a lot of guys at work wanted ‘get on’ with her however as her senior I had no interest whatsoever, the most appropriate way to describe how I felt towards her is, I regarded her as a little sister. It made me want to lookout for her because it’s her first corporate job, she’s straight out of university and that’s it. 

Fast forward 8 months and she gets the placement, I invite her to join our drinking group and there’s that or so I thought. Whenever someone brought up the topic of love or relationship I try to avoid it but as usual I tell them I don’t date anyone from work and I’m not interested in that sort of thing rn. Most of the time I’d stay back later than the others because well I live alone and I like to get borderline hammered and she also made a habit of staying back as well. She usually doesn’t get as drunk as I do but once I had to drop her home where she insisted I should spend the night at her place but I shrugged it off as not being herself at the moment. Despite having left my old job (almost 3 months now) I still hangout with her and the rest of the group and we never spoke of this incident. 

Alright now that’s the backstory let’s go back to last Saturday.

We had a couple of drinks the other guys bailed and yet again it was just the two of us. She was certainly drinking at a faster pace. We were talking about some stupid gossip or rumours the usual stuff  that had been going around my previous workplace and she asks how life is going on my end. I tell her I’ve never been better and all is good. She still probes me and she knew I was a bit down a couple of weeks earlier the cause for this was seeing my ex with her husband (the man she broke off the engagement with me to be with) while I was out. So I tell her this and she goes something along the lines of  
“ you know if you have problems you can simply talk to us. We care about you and I care about you a lot so and you don’t have to be alone. We can share the pain together. You are someone who’s important to me and I hurts me to see you like this” (this isn’t word for word but this is what I could I remember) she said this while she was holding my hand and it felt like she was going in for a kiss. 

I hate to say this but what she said then, it felt nice. She was genuinely concerned and knowing there is someone out there looking out for you; it was a warm feeling. But I don’t think I can bring myself to love someone again, it’s not I can’t get over her (my ex) it’s just the idea of feeling vulnerable and being truly open with someone else. It scares me now. I don’t wanna get hurt again. I don’t believe anymore, that you can love someone unconditionally because of this I said something I shouldn’t have said. 

In the heat of the moment, I was flustered and nervous. I literally had a brain fart as these words came out of my mouth. “I could care less of what you think of me” what I meant to say was I could care  less of what ‘you’ as in people in general think of me and that I’m fine by myself. She apologised for assuming things and I saw she was started crying right from the point she was leaving the booth. I could see it even more clearly through the window and all I fucking did was just stare like a dumbass. 

This is a bit of though situation for me all because I was a massive cunt to this person who cared for me. It’s always the same thing even with my family I keep hurting people around me and this is why I feel like I shouldn’t let anyone get close to me. 

So if any of you have suggestions to unfuck this all I can give you is my deepest gratitude from my heart.",29Apr2019,1

Now I do still love this girl and care about her more than anything so I don’t know whether the right thing to do would be to leave her as she is and let her be happy without me, or constantly try to get back what we had.

181,"Today, my close friend and I went into the topic of one of our friends (let's call her Anna). We started discussing about how toxic her actions were towards another one of our friends (let's call her Julia).

Anna and Julia have gotten close since freshman year of high school and during that, I was also with them. While being in sophomore year, I saw subtle hints of toxicity from Anna and I couldn't handle how I was being treated while being with them. I got left out during hangouts when Anna hung out with Julia, and they would exclude me purposely. Julia was more of a follower so whatever Anna did, she did. I was the middle ground between them but I guess Anna didn't like that. She favored Julia a lot and so because of how biased Anna was, I left the mini friend group knowing how bad it had affected me. Now in junior year of high school, Anna and Julia's friendship started to take a steep and abrupt turn. Everyone in our big friend group can see how harsh Anna treats Julia. My close friend mentioned to me how during one of the music concerts that Anna, Julia, and I were in, Julia talked to Anna about a cute guy and Anna responded with ""You'll never get him because of how you look."" and she also mentioned the acne that Julia has (obviously knowing how sensitive Julia is about it). Not only that but during one of my friend's mini hangouts at her house, we were in her basement talking about tea and all of a sudden, Anna and Julia start arguing about something. They start pushing and shoving each other and Anna proceeds to yank on Julia's hair and Julia does the same to Anna. While this was happening, me and four of our other friends froze in our spots because we knew they were just playing but it was also too real to have not been fake. I've seen Anna and Julia fought like this before and it just sends a big red flag to me because after the fight, I could still see the anger in Julia's eyes but amusement in Anna's. It's just so fucked up because it's like something like this is normal to Anna. Shit talking to Julia and getting into real physical altercations like it's a joke is just not a normal friendship nor a healthy one. Anna also expects Julia to treat her like a queen because I've seen Anna make Julia open doors for her and make way for Anna to go first and then herself last. 

A day or two after the music concert, my close friend talked to Julia about how Anna shit talked about her right to her face.  Julia got upset at remembering what Anna said and my close friend could tell she was deeply hurt. She told Julia that she shouldn't have to accept what Anna says and that any person will love Julia the way she is and when Julia heard those words, she was touched. But when my close friend mentioned more about Anna's actions and words, Julia made up excuses that would explain why Anna says what she says and does what she does. Julia was defending Anna like what she said was ok and that her actions with Julia is how she treats her family at home is ""ok"". That is just so fucked up. Julia has gotten so used to Anna's abuse that she truly sees it as ""normal"" and that terrifies me because I got myself out of that black hole before it could consume me. But for Julia, it was too late and it's so obvious that she is trapped and can't get out. So the only thing to do is to keep being with Anna and let the abuse continue and get worse.  Julia has also gotten used to Anna's habits, shit talking whenever she can, copying the small dramatic movements that Anna does, and throws shade to me. This means that I can't just walk up to Julia and start having a basic talk because even since I left their mini friend group, we haven't spoken to each other since.

My close friend and I discussed how we could help Julia get out of Anna's grasp but no solution made sense or would work because of how Anna is. Anna is very self-centered with a high ego and also stubborn. She will hold any action against you and even if you explain your side during an argument, she will stand her ground and refuse to understand the other person's shoes. It's hard to negotiate with Anna because she's the type of person that cannot handle the truth and deal with acceptance. I can't help Julia get out of the situation without hurting Anna because honestly, I also care for Anna knowing what she went through in her past and why she is the way she is.  I am stuck and so stressed about how to deal with them and help Julia deal with Anna with no misunderstandings. I am so desperate to free Julia from being choked up by Anna but there is no solution that comes to my mind that will do any good on both ends. Please help.",29Apr2019,1

183,"Backstory: M=me B=brother GF =girlfriend D=Dad MT=mom/mother 

Parents spoiled us rotten with various activities in 4h and FFA. I still live with them, I'm working and paying my way through college until they can get their house paid off. They spoiled B (who is 7 years older than me for context), too. Before he got GF pregnant (when he was 15 and a half) he showed horses, went to skeet shooting tournaments, showed chickens, raised sheep, etc. After B had the first kid he wanted to drop out of high school to work and support his new family. Parents made B stay in school to get HS diploma, lived in house rent free, parents bought B first car. The only things B paid for was baby formula, car insurance, and anything GF wanted. Parents did not react well when he told them they were grandparents, MT cried eyes out for weeks and D didn't talk to him for days. However, they never punished him. Parents never sold any of his animals, never made B pay for feed, the only requirement I explicitly remember is that he take care of the kid. GF lived here too, finished HS, and never had a job.

B accused D of beating and never supporting him. M was 9ish at the time B got girlfriend pregnant, but I don't remember anything physical. Our parents fought a lot, had screaming matches with both of us at home, worst thing D ever did was punch a wall. To this day, he has only punched 2 holes in walls, and normally goes outside to calm down before talking to M again. Did this when I was younger too. M, being skeptical, asked to see a police or medical report from B, none were produced. As for D never supporting B, whenever B called needing money, D would drag M with him to get the money and give to B. No matter how much or what time of day, D would take M with him. Once, D dropped $1,400 on car payments so B and GF would have something to drive, the money drop off occurred on a monthly basis. On top of all that B has turned down Dad's offer of paying out of pocket for B's welding school fees in front of M.

B has also accused our MT of verbal abuse and constant nagging. The latter is true, but I've talked to MT and told her about it driving M crazy. She backs off when I tell her too, it's taken time but she's improved. B never stood up for himself, never tried to talk it out. As far as I remember, there was no communication between B and MT about how it made him feel. 

Also, B has accused my MT's parents of offering to pay for an abortion. I know this is bull bc I've talked to them and they disowned another grandchild because she got one. Does not have any complaints of other grandparents as far as I know.

Present: Parents filed in court for visitation(and only visitation) for grandkids. B started coming around, wanting them to remove it. I don't want to engage with B, knowing this could be just a rouse to get full custody and move out of state. 

Thing is, my parents aren't perfect, every party I talk to is biased. I have a nagging feeling there is more information. Should I talk to more ppl to get more info? That means dragging more ppl into this mess, and opening some serious emotional shit. Frankly, I want to give up. Should I investigate more or just give up, knowing I might never see B or my nieces and nephews again.

TL:DR- Brother accusing family of some serious shit, most fact checking turns out bullshit on his part. Should I investigate further or just give up on him?",29Apr2019,0
184,"Like the title says, this started about one month ago when she suddenly stopped replying to my messages, because usually she replies quite quickly, but at that time i thought that she was just busy doing her assignments or helping her parents out. The day after, I messaged her again but this time I asked her if she was okay, and that I would be by her side if she wasn't and do my to help and comfort her. She didn't reply, so I thought maybe she's taking a break from her phone (usually she takes breaks from social media so I didn't think it was odd for her to not use her phone for sometime) and I thought of just meeting her during our lunch break in uni on Monday.

Monday came, and I rushed to uni to catch her before her class would start (I only had afternoon class and came late) but I couldn't find her, not even in her class. I asked one of my friends if she had came earlier and just left, but they said they haven't seen her at all. I was getting very worried that she might be having a serious problem, and I messaged her again and said that I would be with her through thick and thin and also that I had faith that whatever problem she's facing will all work out good in the end. At this point, I resorted to stalking her social media accounts, to see if she was still alive (she told me that she once went through a suicidal episode and this was my concern) and she was posting on reddit every other day or so, and I thought that's she was probably okay but in some problem that she didn't want to share just yet. (I guess this was my mistake) I went around and asked several of her friends if they had received any messages or anything from her, but they all said that she stopped responding sometime Friday the week before. I told them not to worry too much, and that she was okay, based on her reddit activity (barring the fact that I felt that she was not mentally okay.)

A week passes, and one of my friends came to me and told me that she came to class that day (she didn't attend any since she stopped responding). One of her friends came up to her and gave her a hug, and told her that I told her that she was okay based on her reddit activity (yep, I eff'ed up real bad here.) I was really relieved that she came, and thought that she would start responding to messages again, and I stopped looking for her posts online. But she didn't.

Now, I knew she was alive and struggling and I felt the need to give her the space she might need to get herself sorted first, so I pinned her chat to the top of my messages and stopped messaging her (I really should've continued messaging her.) I told myself that she is strong and she will be okay and I went about focusing on my classes and assignments.

Another week passes, and a friend of mine asked me if I had heard anything from her recently, and to that I said, 'not any messages from her but she did tweet something this morning.' She asked me if my best friend does this often and I said yes but not to this extent and also that she would talk it out before going offline (this time she didn't.) At that time I was very worried, and I went to search for her reddit posts. In the last two weeks she posted memes, discussions and two posts on r/Vent. The first post was in her first week of not responding, the same day I stopped looking for her posts online and another one in the second week. Both were about herself not talking to her peers for over 2 weeks. I read them and cried, feeling like a shitty and insensitive friend.

From then on I have been at a loss of things to do, and its almost an entire month without her.

What do y’all think I need your advice! Thank you :),29Apr2019,2
190,"Firstly I'd like to put some context that may or may not be needed. My mom has a lot of mental health issues including bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, depression, anxiety, and paranoid personality disorder.   
I have depression, anxiety, ocd, and bipolar disorder. I have started experiencing symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. I hear whispering/screaming and I'm seeing hallucinations and having a lot of paranoia, also self harm/weird behavioral patterns. I was doing really good but everything is plummeting. I've quit my job because of all of it, its just breaking down my mental health.   
The only thing is I've known my therapist and psych doctor for 8+ years and because I've been doing so good its almost as if they dont believe its happening or they dont wanna believe me. idk what to do",29Apr2019,1
191,"I've always felt like I am a pretty good person. However, I would not say I'm the most attractive. Regardless, I decided to put myself out there on Tinder and Bumble and just see what happens (as a side note, I've never been in a relationship or anything). Because I'm not the best looking, I haven't gotten too many matches, and literally 1 could have led to something but I really just wasn't interested... that is, until the other day.

&amp;#x200B;

On Bumble, this cute girl (I'd say a solid 8) messaged me saying that my pic is cute, to which I responded that she meant my dog. She doesn't message me back until the next day and says that she'd love to meet me (Cue red flag #1, which could just be because of my insecurity). I say that'd be nice and ask when she'd want to meet me. She just messaged me back saying we should get to know each other first and her number, which happens to be a number that is on the other side of the country from where I live (Cue red flags #2 and #3). Keep in mind that we've exchanged like 5 messages over the course of two days at this point. I haven't done anything yet besides just google the number to see what came up, because I'm just paranoid about this.  I checked her account, and all of the pictures (about 20 or so) are definitely of the same girl (she has a more pronounced collarbone, and in the pictures that it is visible, it's definitely the same) but her account hasn't been verified, which just makes me suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want this to be real, and I hope it's a chance for me to make something interesting happen in my life for once, but I just don't trust it. Every time that I've started to get happy, something bad has happened that's forced me to humility, and it is almost like I don't allow myself to be happy because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I text the number she gave me and just see what happens? Or should I just leave it alone and pretend it never happened?",29Apr2019,1
192,"Yeah, basically I have one friend who I consider my best friend. I have a decent amount of friends outside her, but I’m really close and comfortable with her. I also feel like a lot of my friends are kind of weird in some way, and I might idealize my friend excessively. For some reason when I see her with other people who I don’t like, I feel kind of jealous? Not quite sure how to explain it, but she has a lot of close friends I think are quite shallow which I’ve voiced out multiple times.

I feel as if I am really close to her, but she’s like that with at least 4 other people that I don’t like. How do I stop feeling this way over my friend?",29Apr2019,1
193,"We met in high school and have been close ever since, we always have late night calls, we always have since neither of us can sleep usually. She's positively stunning and I can't seem to stop loving her, sometimes it subsides but it always seems to come back stronger, I've told her before and she rejected me, but I made a promise that Id always be there for her. She has really bad mental health and I'm one of her only friends you see. So now I'm here, 7 years in, I can make her laugh until her abs hurt, and I think she's only continued to shine, I think she's absolutely perfect. Yet I can never have her. Will my feelings ever change? Will hers? Is there an action I should take?",29Apr2019,3
194,"This girl and I aren't friends at all (she oversteps a lot of boundries)  but I can't shake the feeling that I should tell her about a few things. They have been dating for over a year and are now engaged and this whole time I've always thought ""its it's not my problem anymore. HE is not my problem anymore"" but the thought of this child (they started dating when she was 17, he claims she lied about her age) marrying my ex makes me sick.

1. He often forced me to have sex with him. On our 9 yr anniversary, it was literal rape. I was drunk and crying and he kept going until he saw I didn't stop crying then he finally stopped. I guess he thought I was too drunk to remember because he never acknowledged it. Months later when I told him I wanted to divorce him, he forced me again the next night. He pinned me down and said ""I want to"" and 2 days later when I was moving out, we started arguing and I brought up that no means no and his response was ""well, you let me"". We kept sharing a bed up until that night and multiple times I would wake up to him touching me. That next day I told my friend and she let me sleep with her until we found an apartment. 

2. While he was already with her, he still tried to get back with me. He would ask me out for coffee, breakfast, wanted to spend time as a ""family"" with our daughter. I had to remind him how disrespectful it was to her to still ask me out. About 6 months into their relationship he said he still loved me and asked me for the last time to get back with him.

3. He told me he only got involved with her because he didn't want to be alone. He can't do jack shit for himself.

4. He is doing the same things (cycles?) as he did when we first started dating. Going to church with her and claiming to be super religious (even though after a while he will start saying that all Christians are hypocrites), claiming to want to be close to the family, getting her to leave her family home very soon into the relationship, etc. If things keep going at this rate, at the 2.5 - 3 year mark, he's going to start showing his real colors.

5. To this day, when he is out alone and we run into each other in the street, he does everything possible to get my attention. (Blocking my car with his so I can't get out, driving right next to me and revving his engine, or driving past me really fast again revving his engine) this one is just plain annoying and I wish it would stop but I've always pretended to not see him and if I ask him to stop, he will know that I do notice him and I don't want to give him the attention. 


I've also always been hesitant to say anything because I don't want to seem like the jelous ex. I'm not. I have nothing to gain from telling her. I'm engaged to an amazing man to loves and respects me and has been very patient with me when I have anxiety episodes. I keep telling myself that it's not my business and not my problem if she goes through the same things I did but being that shes so young and naive, I don't know if I should keep quiet.

He and I do share a daughter. If I meddle in his life, I'm scared he will try to use her to hurt me emotionally.",29Apr2019,1
195,"Alright so I need maybe an outside perspective to help me make my decision. Right now I’m finishing up my first year at uni, and I don’t know whether I should take a calc 2 class over summer or get a job as a valet in a very popular hotel.

Calc 2 class over summer

-Most likely will have to take in the fall anyways 

-The class has a low passing rate and I’ll be taking it at a community college where hopefully it’ll be slightly easier

-lets me get ahead on classes I need to take

- Be surrounded by students and maybe make friends idk, I’m just trying to list positives 

Valet job
- Make money and have a little financial freedom 

-hopefully gives me more people skills since I have to work with coworkers and chat people up

-it’ll be really fun since the job is literally a minute walk from the beach, and the hotels really fancy and that makes it cooler 

- Hopefully having a job will make me realize what I want to do in life as a major

- potentially guaranteed since there’s connections 

-overall would look more forward to this and am leaning on this side, and most looking forward to just getting outside my comfort zone 


With all this being said what has been your experience, or what do you think I should do? Right now I literally don’t have one single clue as to what I want to study. I’m not really passionate about any academic subject and am just tolerating college. I have this romantic view of the job just because it seems really cool, but maybe it could end up sucking who knows.",29Apr2019,1
196,"I never thought this would happen to me. I always knew my family hated me but not this much. I'll admit I never was the best daughter, but I was nice most of the time. We would fight and argue like many other families but then we would be ok after we cooled down.  I helped pay off the house we were living in. I helped my family many times with money issues. They would also help me. But at the same time they would just do things to upset me and it always felt intentional. I would always ask nicely for my mother and father not to do certain things, but it always felt like they never respected me or cared for what I wanted.  we lived in a small house and we would constantly butt heads, and I could not take it anymore, so I started saving money and finally I moved out. It took me years to do this, and I only saved up for a few months worth of rent. I was going to move out with no plan, because it was not healthy anymore for me to stay with my family. I loved them but I felt like I was going to go insane if I stayed. It was damaging me mentally. My family did not like this. Especially my sister. So I moved out with no idea how I was going to pay the bills. With sheer luck I managed to get a really good job and I started to do ok financially. Enough to pay all my bills and maybe 100 for myself at the end of the month to go out or eat.. They saw I was doing good and taking care of myself. This made my sister jealous. I would invite them over and my parents seemed to like the apt but my sister would just say mean things like, this apt is trash, your furniture is ugly, you are going to go broke, you will never be anything, instead of congratulating me on being on my own. Not once did she say anything nice while I was there. For a year I did ok in this apt. Then my world turned upside down.  For a long time I have been dealing with having a STD. I have oral herpes. My family never knew about this. I never told anyone because I never had a outbreak. I was also told that this was very common by the doctors and they said that almost everyone has this. When I got this new job I started to date a co worker.  Bad decision. I wish I did not get into a relationship with this man because I knew if it were to not work out, he would tell people about my STD. But I could not help it. He was too charming and he was really nice at first. Before we started having sex, I told him that I have hsv1 and that we would both need to get tested. So we did and it turns out he has it too. 10 months later, things did not work out and I broke up with him. Bad decision. I started noticing when I came into work, people would look at me funny and kind of smile. Then they would pretend like they are choking and gagging. Everyone kept doing this to me and at first I did not know what was going on.  Then I noticed people started acting strange around me. They would talk to me and say things like "" Man my crotch itches, I think I got the herps!"" Or they would say "" Geeze I think I need to get checked for STDs because something is going on down there!""  and it always sounded like they were indirectly talking about me. This went on for months. No one would tell me anything but in the back of my mind I felt like my ex boyfriend told people I gave him herpes. I could not go to HR or tell anyone because technically they were talking about themselves and not me, even though I know they were referring to me. I guess they were gagging and choking to show disgust for my STD. This stressed me out so much that I quit my job. Now jobless and unable to pay the bills, I had to get ready to move back in with my family. Before I did that, I explained to my parents what happened. I wish I diden't. I told them I have a STD and what my co workers were doing to me. I explained to them how they would choke and gag when they saw me. I thought they would be understanding.

At first they told me it was all in my head and they would tell me not to worry about it.  So they helped me pack and move all my stuff back into the house I use to live in.

&amp;#x200B;

Now everyday, my father, my mother, and my sister, choke and gag when I am in the house. Everyday, all day. When I ask them why they are doing this, they lie and say they are sick or choking on a piece of food. They do this to me everyday, all day. No breaks. nothing. I have asked them many times to stop and they wont. I explained to them how much it is stressing me out and they still won't stop. It is killing me inside and they do not care. I told them it is making me suicidal and they do not care. It has been 8 months, and they still do it. How do I make them stop? Can someone please help?",29Apr2019,0
197,"I am an international student from a West African country, attending university in Canada. I worked very hard in high school to get accepted into a well known Canadian university. When school started I made all kinds of friends, but fell into really poor habits. I ended up spending way too much money on myself, smoking and drinking often, not studying and generally fucking up. The school year has just ended and I am in a much worse condition physically, mentally, emotionally and financially. I feel completely drained and exhausted. I am scheduled to leave Canada in two days, but I don't even have a place to live for next year, and absolutely no money. Currently, I am staying with a relative until I leave for Africa. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thought of me coming back home as a failure is seriously eating at me and I feel ashamed, anxious and guilty.  I know I've just wasted a really big opportunity and I am afraid my parents might refuse to let me return to Canada for the second year. 

&amp;#x200B;

How exactly should I go about this situation? If I tell my parents everything and let them know what I've been up to for the last few months, surely they would get angry and refuse to let me continue my education in Canada. I know I can't hide the fact that I have no money and my poor grades.

198,"Okay I’ve never posted here before but I just want some opinions. 

So I’m still in love with my ex, and we don’t see eachother much but we still talk on messenger every day. He currently has a new girlfriend (he moved on VERY fast) and I asked him not to talk to me about her because it makes me so upset that I physically feel sick. Yesterday, we agreed to catch up after months of not seeing eachother (which is crazy because we used to see eachother every single day) and we got lunch, and then dessert, and we started talking about stuff and I started to get upset, so I said I was going to leave to avoid the situation getting awkward. He asked me to come over to his place to “hang out” and i reiterated that it was a bad idea cause I was upset and didn’t want to ruin my day or fight with him (we have massive fights). He kept asking me to come over and I said no multiple times and said we could catch up a different day at his. This next part makes me sound like a shit person but I promise I wouldn’t be saying it if he didn’t initiate this sort of behaviour - but I told him another reason I didn’t want to come over is because I wanted sex (he messages me MINIMUM once a fortnight saying he wishes he could have sex with me, and asks if I can send him nudes), and I didn’t want anything bad to happen while I was over at his, cause he can be quite pushy and it’s usually up to me to say no, so I went home. I then fell asleep for two hours and woke up to him asking me to come over again and again. 
I eventually agreed, mainly because he said his parents weren’t home and I’m super close with his parents and not emotionally ready to see them again yet. 

When I arrived at his place he was under a blanket but I could tell he was masturbating. I told him that was unfair cause he already knows what I want but we can’t. He didn’t stop wanking, but he looked at me and continued. I sat on the bed and said “this is really hard for me” or something like that because I still have super intense feelings and I was getting conflicting messages. I also want to be a good person and not hurt the person he’s seeing now. He then suggested we both masturbated while watching each other, but I said no. I told him it was upsetting me and I felt like he was teasing me on purpose but it was mean because he wasn’t going to sleep with me. He came next to me on the bed and started dry humping me from behind while spooning me. He grabbed my breast and kissed my shoulder but then suddenly stopped and said “I can’t do this”. I got really upset at this point because I felt guilty, frustrated, annoyed, and kind of worthless. He said “you can’t come over here and want to have sex with me” and started accusing me of starting all of this. I literally initiated nothing but I feel as though he was portraying it as if I came into the room and started it. 
I told him I wanted to leave but he begged me to stay and just hang out with him with nothing sexual going on. For some reason I agreed, but every minute that went past I got more angry and upset and I just had enough and wanted to leave. So I messaged him that I was leaving (he was in a different room cooking, otherwise I would have told him face to face). Then he messages me after it saying he was sorry he couldn’t sleep with me but he cares about someone else?? And I feel as though he was sending those messsages super arbitrarily as we had already had that exact conversation many times - my guess is that he was setting up messages to show his girlfriend if she asks/works out what happened. He made it seem like I got angry that he wouldn’t fuck me, when really it was him initiating. 

So I guess my question is - would you put up with this if you were the other girl in this situation? I don’t know if she has a right to know what happened/messages he sends me all the time. It’s a very new relationship and I feel as though she could have some forewarning before things go bad, so she doesn’t waste 2 years of her life on him like I did. On the other hand, I still have a very deep love and connection with him, we went through so much together and I just want him to be happy.

When he got it a year ago there have been times where he's asked me if I wanna go ride with him and I flat out said no Everytime because I preferred being glued to my computer which I know is bad but I can't help it. So time goes on until it's too cold to ride and the requests have stopped and a few weeks ago the news came that he is just going to sell it. I keep getting informed by my mom on how sad my dad feels that he was never able to ride in it or use it at all matter of fact because he'd have no reason to go alone. My mom keeps reminding me every few days on how she really feels bad for him because he has to get rid of something he'd hoped would be a bonding experience between me and my dad. Don't get me wrong, I love my dad with all my heart and he's a great worker but I never feel like riding out an hour and being away from home for a whole day. I just rarely get time to spend with him. Today someone came by to check the Polaris out with a little girl and I was with my dad as a translator just in case he couldn't remember how to say something but my gut was wrenching as this guy talked about how he always goes to different trails no matter how far they are with his kids because it's good for them and brings everyone closer together.

So I ask if they could handcuff me. They agree because I’m clothed and it would just be chill. To preface this, I think his gf is kinda attractive. He knows this, and so does she(she didn’t mind). So I’m sitting on the couch handcuffed just chillin. She teased me a little by saying things like, “If you can uncuff yourself, you can touch my boobs.” Or “If you catch this pillow, you can touch me.” I go along with it knowing she’s joking but I am confused because she knows I like it. My friend is just doing his own thing during this knowing she’s just messing with me. Then he has to go out to his car, which leaves just me and his gf upstairs. His gf says, “Do you like feet?” I go “Uhhh kinda.” She then puts her foot on my leg, then onto my crotch. At this point im turned on and don’t know what to say, so I say nothing. He comes back and she acts normal again and we just hang out. After I get home, I am confused af. Should I text her to tease me more—&gt; no, she would think that’s too weird—&gt; but she acted like she enjoyed teasing me—&gt; nah still weird. I texted her asking that, then since it was discord, i unsent it. So the next day I was still confused. I texted her from the thought of she liked teasing me, then unsent it again when I thought it was weird. She is usually active for a long time, so I would know if she saw the message, she didn’t. Then she tells me- “You know your messages are piling up, also I had family stuff to deal with so I was busy.” I tried to apologize but she eventually blocked me. I had already spammed her and said sorry too much in the past. Then I told her boyfriend about what happened. Apparently he was busy too since he didn’t answer for a very long time and since I was freaking out on what to do, I texted him a bunch too. He got annoyed and said he would talk to me in a couple days. I wait and ask him, “Can we talk?” He is active but doesn’t reply. Then I say, “Look if you ever want to talk to me again, here’s my number.” And remove him as a friend on discord. He rarely uses Snapchat or Instagram or fb, so no other way to contact him.

I can’t hide that im hurt I told my parents if we could leave her house today cause It was too much for me and I couldn’t hide or feel awkward there because i feel hurt still. Im asking how can I move on it’s really hard to control my emotions i feel like i might burst out and cry at any moment because Im so sick and tired of all this emotional pain im carrying.",29Apr2019,2
214,Yesterday my girlfriend broke up with me stating that we both weren't happy and we needed to be able to be happy alone before we can be happy together. At some points throughout our conversation it seemed like she really still cared about me and loved me and then in other parts it seemed like she was ready to move on. I told her I loved her and when I got better and happier I would come back and we would try again and we would be happy together and she nodded. She said she wouldn't take off all the jewellery I bought her and I told her that is the part of me that she can keep while I'm gone. She told me how her cousin did this with her boyfriend and they've been together for years now and it really improved their relationship. I am really upset and lost because she was my best friend before my lover and it is hard to deal with the fact that I can't talk to her anymore. She asked for space for 2 weeks and then she would like to start being friends again because she doesn't want to lose me. Do I really have a chance anymore with her or was she just trying to make the relationship end smoothly? She genuinely made me feel like I could have a chance with her again one day but for some reason I feel like this is the end. What is the best way to go about this situation other than just give her time and wait it out because it is getting hard to keep calm and control my thoughts. It has made me really determined to better my life and mental health for me and so that one day I can get another chance with the girl of my dreams. Any advice would be appreciated as I am struggling a bit at the moment.,29Apr2019,2

217,"I started uni in a new country a few months ago, moved everything out here, put all my hopes into it being great and exactly right, but things haven’t turned out right at all. 
I decided to move here because I needed a big change, I’d lived in this country as a child and loved it so much, some of the happiest times of my life, and I’d been feeling down in my life at the time I committed to this uni and moving. I kind of pinned all my hopes on it going perfectly, the course seemed amazing, I was told the students would be mostly in my age range, that the social life was great, etc etc. However, in the time between me committing to move and actually moving I met someone in my home country, fell in love, started finding happiness and close friends again, it’s just typical isn’t it. I still hoped it’d be great here and i know that long distance works with my parter, but when I got here the course had changed into something I really don’t enjoy or feel is helpful to me. The course is causing me stress and making my anxiety about ten times worse and every day I dread going in. In terms of the social side of things, I’ve been here months and not made a single friend despite how hard I tried, there were no social events at freshers to give me a chance to meet people and my course is far from the main campus so I’m separated from everyone in the main campus. My course is tiny, 50% of the students are way outside of my age range which I’m not complaining about but it makes it so much harder to find friends and make connections with people especially since unfortunately the older people in my class really dislike my age group (19) and make this very clear. The people my own age seem really uninterested in speaking to me or hanging out and I’m just feeling worse and worse every day, I’m not getting my work done because I’m feeling miserable, and I’m crying basically every day. 

I want to apply for another uni in my home country again but it’ll have to be through late application which means my chance of getting accepted is slim, it also means the cost of moving back there, I have a cat so there’s the cost of flying her back plus all the quarantine and health checks. This university has everything I want and I’m so hopeful when I think about it, but I’m terrified I won’t get in or I’ll make the move and find I’m unhappy again. I want to be close to my partner and my friends again. I’m also afraid of people who knew how strongly I felt about moving ridiculing me and thinking I failed. 

I’m struggling so much staying here, I really want to differ my place and stop going as of tomorrow but if I don’t get into this other uni I’ve wasted time and disappointed my parter who I told I was coming back. I just don’t know how I’m going to be able to get through this semester, let alone this year, I’m falling behind and I’m getting more and more anxious and upset every day, I have no one to talk to here and I feel so alone. 

I guess I just want advice on what to do, supportive words, to know that people understand and relate?

218,"Hello. I’m a 29 year old heroin addict. I suffer from severe depression, chronic pain and bipolar disorder. I’m trying desperately to get sober, but as soon as I clear my mind, my depression kicks back in and forces me to relapse. I’ve made such a huge mess of my life and I don’t know how to clean it up. Ironically, my mental illnesses peaked at an age where no one really cares anymore. I don’t want to kill myself or anything, but I don’t want to live like this. How does someone fix an issue like this if they lack the mental stability to follow through on anything? Am I destined to become a homeless drug addict mumbling on the street? Or is there still hope to become something more? And if so, how do I break the cycle?",29Apr2019,1

220,"I have a friend who I don’t want in my life anymore. We were great friends for about 3 years but over the past year it is like she has become a different person. She checks all the boxes for a toxic friend and is not someone I want to surround myself with anymore. She has become really depressed, started drinking and doing drugs excessively. and even dropped out of her classes. I have tried to help her to the point where I was putting her needs above my own. She absolutely refuses to go see a therapist even though everyone she is close to has told her she should. I want her to get better so bad but there is only so much I can do for a person who is not willing to help themselves. 

I’m afraid to be be honest and tell her that I think she’s a toxic friend and I don’t want her in my life anymore because I don’t know what she would do. She has said before that I’m her only real friend. With the situation she is in right now, losing her “only” friend might be too much for her to handle and I don’t know what she would do.

I’m starting to have a harder time focusing in high school lately I guess. I usually get A’s with an occasional B but have gotten great grades all through my schooling so far. My problem is I don’t feel like I have had much ambition pretty much all year. I haven’t been interested in my classes like I have in the past as well. I used to enjoy going to school but like I said I just don’t have that interest or joy about it that I used too. I often find it difficult to start projects and do homework. It doesn’t help when I still get mainly A’s or high B’s on tests consistently either, because it makes the homework and stuff seem more pointless to me. I guess I don’t know what to do because it’s like I know I have the potential to excel, but I lack the ambition and the ability to actually apply myself more day in and day out. I am just wondering if anyone else has ever had a similar feeling to me or if anybody can just give me some advice to maybe help me recapture my joy of learning again, or regain the motivation to apply myself. I guess I’m just scared of completely losing the ambition to excel that I once had.",29Apr2019,1
222,"I’m trapped between my school, my kids, my mom, my sister, my ex wife and can’t let any of us down.

I drive between my house at my school and my parents place on the weekend where I get my kids, it’s close to 500 miles a week. 

I don’t have time to date or meet women(it’s been months for me and seeing my ex wife get to act like a kid and have relationships and do stuff after everything she’s done) , my cars are both on their last leg and need a lot of work and parts, I’m trying to deal with a post divorce dui, and get my VA medical knocked out.

223,"I just don’t know what to do. I have good days (can elaborate) and bad days (like now).

I’m 21, f. I don’t have a career - don’t even know what I want to do for a career anymore (a couple months ago I had everything planned out - same plan for years - and I was excited about it - but now I don’t even have any interest in that field...). I never graduated from college as I left after my first year to pursue my own business/ my plan (that I no longer am interested in since like a few months ago as previously stated).

I live with my parents still and younger sibling. I don’t have a good relationship with my parents. Sometimes I get incredibly stressed out because my mom will often get high on pills and not be sober for days - so I have to take over being ‘mom’ to my sibling until she gets back to normal.... my father often yells at me for ‘allowing’ my mom to sleep all day/ be high even though I have 0 control over that.... this doesn’t happen often but when it does, it literally chips away at my sanity. 

After being oppressed by being forced to stay in my home all day to drive my sibling places, cook food and take care of the house for days - and this happened since I was a young child. I often had to take care of myself and be by myself as a kid. Growing up, I learned to drive and could be more independent, but now that I have my sibling - in good conscience I can’t leave her home alone while my mom is high and my father is yelling at my mom about being high. I want her to have a normal as possible childhood/ know that I’m here and taking care of her...

Well after years of that.... I literally just... went into some weird depression, where I lost any and all hope and desire. All of my ambition for a career went away. I broke up with my long term S/O of 5 years, - it was already going downhill because it was a long distance relationship... but I ended it. And he was also manipulative and controlling and jealous even in the distance, so yes it was a toxic relationship anyway. And I no longer have feelings for him. Like at all. So now...

I no longer feel oppressed or held down by my ex. I have no desire or ambition for a career. I was used to constantly being my sibling’s second mom and taking care of a house and family I never wanted. 

So now.... my life has basically gone downhill. I have 2 jobs. 1 is a normal job. And the other is like.... low grade prostitution. I work topless at an underground gambling site, and while nothing is sexual at all - I earn money by giving players massages at the table - so not sexual, but obviously it’s creepy and weird being topless and giving these old men massages. There’s a lot of drug use in the facility - and I never got high until I started working there.

I now spend my time working, and hanging out with guys I meet on local social apps. I just feel so empty, I desperately crave attention. I don’t want a relationship, can’t handle a relationship, but at the same time I find myself being desperate for a connection I claim I don’t even want. Half of the time I’m working I’m also drunk +/- high. It’s basically a way for me to ‘have fun’ - and I never ever drink but now it’s like I do 3-4times + a week. 

I don’t know what to do. All of my motivation and ambition for a normal healthy future is gone. The way I think now is... if I were to die right now, then I’m having fun doing what makes me feel happy/ satisfied - hanging out w my dates, drinking/ partying... etc. I now engage in all this risky behavior, and it’s so so so different from me like 2 months ago. 

It’s like the only way to make me feel anything at all, is to do all this risky stuff that makes me feel something I’ve never felt before. I hardly drink, and have never even smoked (until I started my gambling job). I feel cheap and stupid, my parents don’t know but often times they ask me where I’m out so late at night and end up ignoring me for a couple days because they think I’m doing ‘bad’ things - sometimes yes (party) sometimes no (actually hanging out).

If I go out, an early night I come back home around 4a. A late night is past 7a. Some nights I don’t go out at all, like tonight and I feel so empty and desperate for anything. I don’t want my life to be like this, but st the same time I feel like there’s nothing I can do besides 1) engage in risky behavior and feel somewhat satisfied for the moment and feel empty when it’s done and over with 2) don’t engage in risky behavior and become desperate and anxious to do something/ anything to give me any emotion.

228,"Hi everyone, pretty serious post here. Asking for any advice or input from anyone, anything is helpful. 

So I had to take this semester of college off for health reasons. I became so stressed and depressed during the fall semester my friends became really worried about me and I wasn’t acting like myself. My parents (and myself) put a lot of pressure on me.... I go to a very demanding University. To be honest, I’m not ‘naturally’ smart. I make the grades because I put in the work. Hours of studying, pulling all-nighters, taking loads of (prescribed) adderall. Last semester I barely slept, I got a stress ulcer, and my body was constantly worn down. 

It took me about 2 months to get my sleep schedule back on track once I took a semester off. I began working, saving money, hanging out with family I hadn’t seen in forever, and working out/ eating healthy. I’m finally starting to feel recovered and happy! I’ve made a lot of progress and I’ve taken time for myself for once, which was MUCH needed. 

Of course, I have to go back. I’ve done a lot of planning ahead, but I’m still really really worried. I’m so scared I’ll become overwhelmed and find myself in an unhealthy place again. 

I’ve decided to do the following to have a better semester: 
-cook my own meals 
-go to group fitness classes 
-do my homework at better times so I can actually sleep 
-PLAN AHEAD, e.t.c 

If anyone has any advice or secret weapons they use in college, I’d be happy to hear it. My goal isn’t to just make it through, I want to make it through happy and healthy.",29Apr2019,2

I have never been comfortable putting that label on him until now, the reason being that he never abused me. Growing up, my father used physically abused my older brother (choke, hit, etc.) for talking back or whenever something went wrong in the family. I vividly remember him breaking through locked doors and running after my brother just to beat him up. He was also extremely abusive (verbally &amp; emotionally) and controlling of my mother, calling her lazy (even though she works full time while cooking, cleaning and taking care of all of her kids), controlling her cash flow, and never letting her talk or be an independent woman. My mother also has none of her family here and my father refuses to let her visit them. However, I have always been treated like the angel of the family and never once hit by my father.

Pan to now- my brother is older and my dad doesn't hit him anymore. In fact, they don't talk. My brother holds a grudge against my father for making his life a living hell growing up, and also for the fact that my dad has a more chill approach to parenting my younger siblings. My older bro and I still live our parents, so we see how much differently our younger siblings are being treated which makes my older bro pissed because he was beat as a kid, so he resents our younger siblings as well.

233,"I am currently in grade 11 and there is this guy named Liam. I never thought I would ever come to like him but I guess I played myself. He was first brought to my attention in the beginning of grade 9 when he dated my friend, Lilian. He and Lilian dated for about 3 months before he broke up with her. Obviously, my friend started bawling and she had a conspiracy that he only dated her to get his ex-girlfriend back. About a month later, Liam started dating that ex-girlfriend again. Shortly after this, Lilian and my friend group started to drift apart because she would always victimize herself when a problem arose in our group. (Now, we barely even talk anymore) So, I slowly started to forget that a Liam even existed in our school until the beginning of grade 10. I had a class with him for the first time (Physical education class) but none of my friends were in that class so I was alone. I was pretty sad because the teacher always told us to get into pairs but I had no one to pair with. One day, he approached me and helped me become friends with these other 3 girls in my class. It was kind of like magic because I’ve always been an introverted person. He’s super extroverted. From that day on, he always called out my name in class out of nowhere and whenever we talked he always somehow made me laugh. That’s when I thought, he was totally the opposite of how Lilian described him as. I slowly started developing feelings for him. Although he didn’t have a girlfriend throughout grade 10, confessing never crossed my mind because I didn’t have the courage and I was scared. Fast forward to the beginning of grade 11, I found out that he got a girlfriend. That’s when I decided to fold away my feelings for him because it’s become an impossible love now.

235,"First off, sorry if I'm doing this wrong. I've never posted the same thing to two different subreddits.

Hello strangers of the internet. I follow this subreddit on my main account but figured it would be better to post from my throwaway.
I am an almost 30 year old woman. I've been stuck in my home town damn near my whole life. I moved away for 2 months a couple years ago and coming back turned out to be a huge mistake.
Now I'm stuck owning a house with my piece of shit ex. He won't take the house or take his name off of it. I think his mindset is that if he's not allowed to leave our city (bc he's on parole), I'm not allowed to leave and if I'm stuck in a mutual home ownership with him, I can't leave. He's been punished bc I turned him in to the police, so I have to be punished too. My dad suddenly up and got remarried and got a whole brand new family and basically became a stranger to me and I haven't spoken to him since my grandmother's funeral over 2 months ago. My insane mother got pissed at me almost 2 weeks ago because I wouldn't go to the movies with her bc I was having a bad day after my first session with a new therapist discussing said ex (to sum it up, he's an animal fucking pedo who just got our of federal prison in case you guys are wondering what the great hatred with this man is). Now she's sending me insane shit about how she can't wait to die bc she's tired of me making her feel like shit and how I've always made her feel like she's not a good enough mom. I've been listening to this song since I was 4. Literally. I was 4 the first time I remember my mother telling me she didn't want to be my mom anymore. She beat the shit out of me growing up. Called me a slut for wanting to wear hip hugger jeans that were popular when I was 13...told me I was asking to be raped. Called me pizza face when I started having acne. Weird religious Bible quotes. Telling me my life is fucked up bc I'm an atheist. You get the idea. I've been ignoring her since the last load of shit she sent me bc I've had enough even though she's been trying to kiss my ass ever since I started ignoring her. I was hoping that as I got older we could become friends but that clearly hasn't been the case and never will be. 
I've completely fucking had it with everyone's shit. Everyone has their breaking point and I think I've hit mine.
Now 3 weeks ago I met a guy. We matched up on Tinder last summer and never met. I deleted my account. Got back on in February and we rematched. He offered to meet up but I was out of town and he was moving out of state. 3 weeks ago he came home for some stuff and we met and hung out. Ended up spending almost our whole weekend together. I was already planning a short vacation near where he lives, we had talked about it before meeting in person. That was why we kept in touch after he moved. Well he convinced me to go for a week vacation and stay with him. Ok, fine, not going to argue that. Then my therapist tells me they're from that same city and I'll love it so much, and that I won't want to come home. Then a female friend who currently lives and works near there (an hour away) asked me to leave all this bullshit behind here and be roommates with her for July 1st. I work in a good field that's literally hiring nationwide and sure enough there's loads of job listings for that whole area for my field.
I feel like all signs are pointing to this new area. I've been having a lot of weird coincidences involving this area.
So...I've applied for multiple jobs. I've gotten some emails. I have a phone interview tomorrow with one place. I haven't told the guy yet about the potential moving stuff but he knows about the ex and that I want to get far from here. He's admitted that he ""felt a spark"" between us and that he's super bummed he didn't actually meet me until after he moved away. I feel like a damn teenager crushing on this guy but he's like a breath of fresh air after the shit show I've been through. Actually he's probably the best guy I've met in years. He's amazing. It's funny to think I almost didn't even bother with him bc he's technically not ""my type"" and he's younger than me. I'm worried I'll scare him, though, so I think I'll wait to tell him in person when I see him next week that I might be moving closer to him. 
I excited and terrified all at the same time. I want to just drop everything and start a whole new life. Change my phone number and all. I've always fantasized about it. And now I might actually have the chance.
I have some friends interested in renting out my house. But I'm also considering just abandoning the damn thing bc my ex is equally responsible for the payments and quite frankly his perfect credit score is the only thing he has going for him so he won't let it foreclose. He was already considering taking it from me as a rental property for extra cash until he heard I was trying to move.
I guess I just needed to get all of this out. Out of my system and all. I just started seeing my new therapist and we have a lot of shit to cover so I haven't really had a chance to talk much about this whole up and leave thing with them. I'm sure there are people who follow this sub who may have gone through similar things and can offer words or wisdom or support.
A lot of people I've tried to talk to about it here are like, ""Oh you're just moving for that guy.""  But I was honestly planning to move away anyway. Maybe not quite so soon or to that particular state but an opportunity came up. I'm also still going to be like 1 1/2 hours from him. Other people have said, ""You're just going to abandon your parents and your house and your current job like that?"" Psh...yes? I feel like more people are trying to make me feel guilty for my decision rather than supporting me.
I just want out. Before I end up one of the several thousand people that's just stuck in this town for life. And I want to be far from the people that keep shitting on me. Life is too short to be feeling stuck, having anxiety attacks and crying, and being unhappy.
Anyways...yeah...so that's what I've been dealing with.
And I would like to give an advanced thanks to anyone who reads this all. I like that I can feel safe venting to Reddit. 
Just typing all this out helped me feel a little more calm.

236,"I remember seeing this thing called ""Ikigai"" a while back, a Japanese concept for finding a fulfilling life: [here's an image of it.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*qNNzYd3SE1Z09d_IaJOdGA.jpeg)

So I recently decided to try and fill out my own Ikigai and [this is how far I got.](https://imgur.com/a/WTUitgp)

I also took an Ikigai test I found online and the results were.....[mostly far off](https://imgur.com/a/vmgyJON), to say the least. I think it said my Passion was in Computers and Mathematics because I said I was good at ""staying up to date with and implementing new technologies in the workplace"" or something like that. So yeah, please don't suggest I take any online tests, they never work for me.

Won't say my age but I'm well past being a young college student. I know there's people who make a living (not rich and famous) from doing the things I'm passionate about, and I've been doing everything very similar for a while now - auditioning for acting/music gigs, occasionally getting performances, doing the general hustle - the only difference is I'm not making money at it yet. Maybe a couple hundred per year. I'm not discouraged about this, I know it takes a long time to get established, so don't think that's what this post is about.

What I'm looking to find is something I can do/try to possibly get a job doing that I actually *like* in order to get out of doing Food and Customer Service gigs. I do these gigs because of the flexibility they offer, but in reality I'm not even close to the point where I need to take 2wks off to go film something or go on the road to perform. The problem is that I'm not interested in anything else. I've done coding/web design work, I've worked in sales/commission-based jobs and hated them. Whenever I think about doing any other job, literally anything outside of the creative arts (or even office jobs within the creative arts), I just think about how much I'll dislike it and don't think it's worth it to learn an entire new skill (go back to college or take a 6 month certificate course e.t.c.....) just to get a job I'll dislike.

243,"We have been together for a year, and we live together. 

He is usually kind, considerate and treats me very well (although he is not thoughtful or romantic, but he does look after me e.g. cooking, cleaning, making me cups of tea etc). A couple of months ago I would have happily married him; we were like best friends as well as lovers and he was supportive and made me laugh (or this used to be the case). 

He used to smoke copious amounts of cannabis very regularly before we got together, and a few years ago developed cannabinoid hyperemesis. (Google this if you are unsure what it means - he was hospitalised several times and had severe kidney problems, and lost several stone). It took him a couple of years of being ill on/off before he realised that the weed caused it. 

He didnt smoke it at all almost when we got together. It was a very casual thing, perhaps once a month or so (not enough to make him ill), and he gave it up completely for around 3 months from Sept-Jan. I did not smoke any cannabis for around 7 years prior to this. 

Then, after my SO stated that he would enjoy it if I got stoned with him once, I had some (around Feb time). He then developed the taste for it again. He has started smoking it almost every day, and his personality has changed. He is acting as though he doesn't care about anything except getting stoned again. 

I spoke to him numerous times, begged him to cut down, explained I was becoming unhappy and I was worried he would get ill again, and that I could see his mental health declining. He promised multiple times to cut down, then actually needed up taking time off work with sickness and using the time to get stoned. 

Until today - when things got much worse. He is ill again with Cannabinoid Hyperemesis, and we both havent slept all night because of it (being sick/heaving up bile every 20 minutes and constantly having to get in the bath). 

He has done this to himself and I have no sympathy, but it is hurting me to see that he has done this to himself too. It is horrible to see someone you care about retching their guts up all night and shivering constantly. 

But guess what? He just came downstairs at 5am and ROLLED HIMSELF A JOINT!

I must admit, I got so angry about this, and threw his grinder into the pebbles in the back yard. I couldn't believe how ridiculously stupid he had been! (The only thing that stops the illness is cutting out weed) 

I'm afraid he will lose his job because of this - he already took 2 weeks off to get stoned and now he is too ill to go back to work on Tuesday. 

Am I being unreasonable about this blip in his behaviour, and what can I do here? Talking to him any more about it at this point seems futile. 

Tl;dr- Boyfriend has made himself ill (cannabinoids hyperemesis) by smoking weed again after quitting. Has completely changed. Has ignored my pleas for him to stop and is now very ill again. The relationship has suffered because of this. He knows it is the weed making him ill and still he is smoking it.",29Apr2019,1
244,"My employer brought in a speaker from a ""workplace wellbeing consultancy"". The key learnings from the presentation were that:
- We are still geared to living in a life threatening world, i.e. with plants, animals that want to kill us
- Workplace stress is not life threatening, but the body can still perceive it to be and consequently activate fight or flight
- Stress is only bad when you perceive it to be so. As soon as you perceive it to be bad it activates the fight or flight mechanism which is the unhealthy aspect
- Fight or flight can be activated for hours, days, months or even longer
- People who perceive stress as bad live shorter lives

246,"F 18 (not sure if it's important but thought it would be good for context).   


I am currently pretty in love with my best friend's ex and things are getting serious as we've been flirting and talking for months now and he was there for me in a lot of hard times. The thing is is my best friend states she is 'not over him' and feels like 'i'm stealing her dreams and goals' to which I would usually step down. but you see she cheated on him multiple times with his best friend and basically ruined the relationship between the guy I love and his best friend  (they had been best friends for years before hand).   


we'll call the dude i love ""B"", my best friend ""M"" and the guy she is with now and the guy she cheated on B with ""P"" just to make things simpler.   


I was talking to both of B and M, as she wanted me to meet her now ex boyfriend, at the time and i chose to stick up for B because M was cheating on him which in turn made her cling tighter to her P and made me and B get closer.   


Around the time B, P and M decided to talk things out i had grown to have a crush on B and i'm not very good at hiding my feelings and he had stated he felt the same. This of course made M furious and making her say we weren't giving her a choice to decide her feelings and were rushing her. In the end she did choose P and me and B began to 'wheel' unofficially.   


That went on for awhile until M began to state that she felt uncomfortable with me talking to B because of her being her ex and wanted me to break things off with him. I came clean and told her our feelings and she made it apparent that if i continued to be with him  she could no longer be friends with me.   


I felt bad about this because i maybe didn't give her enough time to get over him so i decided to ask him to just be friends. after a few months i got back together with a long term ex boyfriend and everything was normal until me and my ex started fighting and i began to rely on B for comfort as M would never pick up her phone usually. I began to realize i still had intense feelings for B and struggled with that until one night when he got drunk and confessed he also still had feelings. I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend after weeks of straight fighting and that realization.   


Which prompted me again to ask M of what she thought of me 'liking' B. She said it would be a betrayal, that i'm her best friend and shouldn't date people she is still 'in love' with and that i'm basically torturing her by talking with him. I don't truly believe she loves him as she even stated she never wanted to get back with him, she was unhappy with him and once they broke up she said she would never want to see him happy or move on from her but she'd like to be his friend. I feel like she is being very selfish with this mindset and i don't understand why she can't be friends with both me and B if we date. She of course stated she would be 'too jealous'.   


Am I being a dick here for truly caring about B and wanting to be happy with him despite my best friend's feelings? Or is she being a dick? (sorry for the use of the word dick. i wasn't sure what other word to use. any feedback would be appreciated and sorry for the long post.)",29Apr2019,1

251,"TL;DR

Boyfriend met up with his ex. After the meeting I asked him how it went. I sensed something was off so I pushed him a bit harder. He told me that he still is in love with his ex, and probably always will be. He then however told me that he's in love with me too though, and sees a future with me, and wants to be together for the long haul. I have no idea how to think about this, and am wondering is it normal? Should I be alarmed? The relationship otherwise is great.

Hi ya'll. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've \[26 f\] been dating my \[29 m\] boyfriend for about 10 months now. So far things have been going great, and I can confidently say up until now I've been very happy in the relationship. Now, I don't know what to do.

A couple of weeks ago my boyfriend's ex contacted him because she had a key to his house that she wanted to return to him. My boyfriend was honest with me about her reaching out, and we both agreed he should meet up with her and get the key. Well, what was supposed to be a short in and out interaction, actually ended up with them getting coffee. He initially told me very little about their interaction, but did tell me that she is now aware that we are dating.

But something seemed just a little bit off, and so I pressed him for more details about their meeting. After a bit of probing, he told me, point blank, that he still feels like he is in love with her. I was at a loss for words, and completely caught off guard. He started to back-peddle and told me that he is very much in love with me, that he doesn't sit around wishing to be with his ex, and that he's happy with me and wants to be with me. But he did say that he thinks he will always have feelings for her, always be in love with her, and that seeing her reminded him of that. 

I obviously had a hard time hearing that, and I began to get really emotional. He comforted me, and it did help me feel a bit better. He assured me that he does not want to be with her, and that he never should have gotten with her in the first place.  I genuinely don't think he would ever cheat on me, and he has been fantastic to me in our relationship otherwise, but I can't lie and say this doesn't worry me greatly. When I asked him if he ever saw himself falling out of love with her, he said no, that he thinks those feelings will always be there and he's okay with that. He says it doesn't take away what he feels for me whatsoever and reiterated that he is committed to me and loves me, and wants a future with me, not her.

I don't know how to feel about any of this. I have exes of mine that I have love for, but I definitely would never say that I'm still in love with any of them still. To make matters worse, this ex was horrible to him. She nearly cheated on him,told him she'd never been attracted to him, and constantly fucked him over by leading him on as she broke up and then got back together with him multiple times. It worries me that he can still be so emotionally attached to someone who was bad to him.

I am so lost, and I need advice. I don't want to end the relationship, but I'm now having big doubts. What would you make of being told this. If he's committed to me, and says he wants to be with me--does it matter if he still is 'in love with her', especially because he doesn't plan to pursue any relationship with her or have her in his life?

I worked at company X and my manager hired me 3 yrs ago and we got along great for the most part. 6 months later she hired another employee, my co-worker. I used to be passionate about my job and went above and beyond and worked late without being asked, read up on things without being asked, but never my co-worker. My co-worker doesn't have the correct education for the job, has 10 years less experience than me and is not diligent in the quality of their work. Last year I spent a lot of time doing my work and doing/correcting my co-workers work. I also tend to work on the more complex tasks as my co-worker doesn't have the education or skill set to do these tasks. My co-worker used to work in sales before and has the gift of the gab and will tell you what you want to hear. Over the past year, things have deteriorated professionally (we get along well on a personal level) between myself and my co-worker and I've pointed things out to my manager and she addresses some of them but makes excuses for others things. I've also noticed that my manager has a tendency to over scrutinize everything I do, give a free pass to my co-worker and then I have to point things out. In the past few months, things have gotten really bad with my manager making up rules and guidelines as she goes and things arbitrarily applying to me, whereas my co-worker gets a free pass. On top of that, my co-worker has started to try to mimic my manager during meetings and cross question me of every little detail. Things got so bad one day that I had to take the day off because I felt physically ill. We have a new and existing manager who has started to work with us and another employee join our team who is as senior as me. They've all seen the nonsense that has gone on with me getting cross questioned, undermined, they've noticed how my co-worker over sensationalizes work assigned to her, constantly talks about how busy she is and accomplishes very little work. I've also asked to partake in certain things as I have the best knowledge in the company about the systems, data, how things talk to each other and processes, but after an initial agreement, this was reneged on. After experiencing all of these things, I decided that I am stagnating career wise, and being valued at the same level as my co-worker (I make more, but we share the same title, no senior or lead title), being micro managed and undermined and have decided I need to do my own thing. The existing and new manager have spoken to the VP of Sales and the boss of HR about my situation, they really like me as I tend to know what I'm talking about at meetings and I get things done.

Anyways im lonely as shit, my first and last relationship ended August of last year. That relationship only lasted 2 and a half months and it made me realise what I was missing this whole time: Companionship. 

But now I am rolling with a new group of friends from work. And im crushing a bit on one of my dudes gf of 3ish years. The group is about 6-8 people strong and she is usally the only girl there when we hang out doing DnD or some other nerdy shit. But realising that I am crushing on someone made me wonder:

256,"i don’t believe this belongs on r/datingadvice as i know myself and this girl would never date. so i’m posting here, let me know if it doesn’t fit! anyways.

i’ll start off by saying i find this girl attractive, and have hung out with her a few times outside of school - in which we weren’t in the same group and only had a few classes in early high school. 2 of these ‘outings’ (not dates, as i saw it as 2 friends hanging out) consisted of going to the beach at night, getting ice cream and just chilling on a towel watching the ocean, talking shit and reminiscing.

both occasions, we never hooked up or anything of the sort - purely chatting, however it did feel as though it wouldn’t be a surprise if anything happened because this was different to what 2 ‘friends’ of opposite gender would do. however both these times i had a strong ‘no relationships’ mindset (to focus on school etc) and was never was one to hook up with people, especially people that i knew. so maybe i misinterpreted the mood of the night, not sure.

this time (3rd time we are planning to hang out) it feels very different. let me reiterate, this isnt a case of ‘seeing someone’, this girl and i wouldn’t date as we aren’t each other’s type at all. initially the plan was to do the beach thing, however i asked and suggested a drive in cinema (which i realise is kinda romantic however i didn’t think of it like that). she said she’s been to one and would happily go. now is where i’m getting a real different vibe...

we both check online as to what movies showing (avengers + some horror movie) in which we both agree we aren’t bothered for either. UNTIL she says ‘actually, i don’t care we can watch whatever’ which could easily be seen as ‘well if the movie is boring, we could occupy ourselves with something else’. 

this is where i need advice from either you guys that have had this same sort of lead up to a night, or have tried to act on this or been rejected. i’ll just say i won’t be disappointed if we have a regular ‘friend’ night or if we hook up.

or, i’m asking you ladies, if you were this girl, are you dropping hints or what. it’s an important note that me and this girl aren’t meeting for ‘old times sake’ and to ‘catch up’. we are 19 and 20 respectively and not the type of stuff we would do. also, she’s come out of a relationship within 6 months and has had some boy issues recently. 

so whether that means A: she’s looking for relief somehow or B: she’s feeling lonely.... regardless, i’m not trying to fuck with her emotions. but that being said, this isn’t a case of dating or ‘leading someone on’ because things aren’t like that between us. your advice is much appreciated! TIA

tl;dr: me and this girl are going to hang out, isn’t a case of dating, and have never hooked up. known her since high school, and are going to a drive in, in which she ‘doesn’t care’ what we watch.",29Apr2019,1

I'm a 30 year old male and in college I was invited to a house party. The house party was a setup and I was drugged and raped by 4-10 men. I'm pissed, angry, but also worried and anxious, I don't want to turn my or my gf's world upside down. 

At the same time, it's affecting my mental health. The more I think about it the more I can't let it be.  

I was dating a girl in college and her good friend was the one throwing the party. I have one picture of us on FB but I think he deleted his or has me blocked. I've tried reaching out to her tonight but I guess she's asleep.

Recently David came and started sitting with my group of mates however he isn't friends with any of them he just sits there and doesn't speak.

264,"This is a long story. I'm going to make it short so I can get a quick answer as my heart is pounding through my chest. I purchased an essay with this guy my friend referred. He purchased one too. **(Let's call this guy the Writer)** It was for this hard assignment that nearly everyone we went to rejected because they couldn't really grasp how to do it. The guy that accepted it said he could do it but it turns out he didn't follow our actual instructions nor did he follow samples given to him and just did it how he thought it should be done. Our teacher is insanely picky about how he wants things and has no real grading scheme so this was not going to fly. We worked with the writer day and night during our own exam season where we were already extremely stressed and didn't have much sleep due to this. We contacted this other writer **(let's call him Fred)** that charged more but really knew how to do it and we went with him even though it was after the deadline. My friend had a very bad temper tantrum because the guy took our money, didn't complete the assignment properly and left us with 1 day to study for our 97% exam for another course. With enough arguing, he got us both our money back but he went too far by shitting on the guy's forum that basically relies on reputation. I was furious with this because I just wanted to let it go and get my shit done but I was looped in this bullshit now. The previous writer had our professor's name or initials and threatened to email him if we used any of the work he gave us and/or if my friend kept up the bullshit on his forum. I assured him I would not touch any of the work he gave because it was useless to me anyways and I did the whole assignment myself. My friend, however, has another guy who uses his account and that guy scammed someone on the same forum which gave the writer a reason to finally get revenge. Last week my friend texted me saying that the writer had emailed our professor and he never replied to me since then. Now I just got an email from my professor saying that he needs to set a meeting to talk about my assignment and that is the reason it hasn't been graded yet. I am scared shitless because the writer hates me too because he thinks I sent my friend screenshots to ruin his reputation but my friend had taken these screenshots himself through my account since he has my password. The Writer denies emailing my professor but I have every reason to believe he did and even though I didn't use his work I am really scared. Can I get in academic trouble for having purchased an assignment in the first place?   


The problem is, I don't know what my professor knows so I don't know what I'm walking into. When I meet him should I just come clean and say yes I purchased it but I never used it? Should I tell him that I pissed the wrong guy off online in the same group chat where I was asking for help with the assignment?  


I don't know what to do. In the end, I didn't hand in anyone's work but mine and I didn't use anyone's ideas whatsoever. I followed my own past assignment's format.

268,"First of all, I apologise in advance if this turns out messy and hard to follow. I find it incredibly difficult to express myself and I haven’t had any sleep. Please bear with me. 


I’m really struggling and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m in my last year of high school and for the past 5 to 6 years I have been struggling heavily with my mental health. As you could imagine, over the past few years my mental health has been seriously affecting my education. 


Currently I have 6 overdue assignments that I haven’t even started yet and as a year 12 student, you understand how terrible that is, at this point I’m 90% sure I’m going to fail.


In the past I have tried to reach out to my school councillor and he pretty much brushed off my concerns, stating that there could be many other reasons as to why I’m feeling ‘down’ and that doesn’t mean I have depression, which of course I understand, but this isn’t just a one off thing. It’s been a constant in my life and I know that there’s something not right with me. 


We just had 1 month long school holidays and I mean it when I say I didn’t leave my house the entire month. I have no desire to go anywhere or to do anything. Even doing simple things like showering or brushing my teeth regularly is a chore to me. It’s so difficult for me to get out of bed at any time, I’m always so tired no matter how much I sleep.  Often I find myself up all night overthinking things and then I have to get up and go to school running on no sleep. I come home and crash, sleep for 15 hours and I am still tired. Repeating the process over and over. 


I have no motivation or energy to finish my school work even though I know how much I need to and how far behind I’m falling. I physically can’t do it. I stare at a blank screen for hours, my brain just can’t function. 


I’ve also noticed how this affects my relationships with my friends. During school holidays especially I pretty much fall off the face of the earth. I barely answer their messages and I decline going out places with them simply because I don’t want to leave my house and I don’t want to dampen the mood with my obviously foul one. 


I’m scared of what the future holds for me if I fail to finish work and if I continue to push my friends away. 


I’m to scared to tell my mum because I don’t want to be a bother to her or my siblings and I don’t want her to worry about me or to treat me differently. I’m worried that seeing somebody for my mental health may cost to much for her to handle or it’ll be too difficult commuting back and forth.

272,"Hi everyone, just needed some extra advice/opinions please. I already asked in r/raisedbynarcissists but I just wanted a broader opinion please.

So my mother is emotionally/psychologically/physically(on occasion) abusive and my father is emotionally/psychologically abusive. I finally found the courage to talk to my Doctor about it, because I wanted to see a psychologist and she can refer me to one and give me a mental health care plan. That way I pay $25 per appt, not over $100.

So I told her private, personal things. I took to long at the appointment and my mother was paranoid that I was speaking about her and kept questioning me. Just before I found out (through my mother), that my Doctor asked her if she's close with her daughter. Me and my mum see the same GP.

This is the part where I needed an opinion, is it illegal for my Doctor to have asked my mother ""Are you close with your daughter?"" out of the blue - because she basically hinted at my mother that I spoke about her. When your parent is a narcissist, they are VERY cautious and they are almost like interrogators. So that would have sent red flags to my mother. Because they have a guilty conscience and know they've done wronged, they are extremely paranoid - now my mum has it in the back of her head that I spoke about her. Well, I did speak about her.

I lied to my mother and said the Dr thinks I have ADHD (partially true, I may have ADHD). And that maybe she asked her that question because I told her no one else knows about my attention difficulties. I also accidentally left my appointment card out for my psychiatrist (this is where it all began - long story, to much to explain) and I told my mum it's a neurophysiologist, and she googled the name and saw he is a psychiatrist, and kept telling me ""Don't make up false accusations about me.""

Should I start seeing a new Doctor? I see her again on Friday, I was going to tell her the lie I told my mother about the ADHD to get her off of my back. I'm definitely going to have to tell her, but after that, I don't know if I should continue seeing her. 

I thought when you tell Doctors something that it has to be confidential, obviously she didn't disclose the details but she thinks my mum is kind and her asking that question really made me lose trust with opening up to specialists.  


TL;DR: I told my Dr personal information about my narcissistic parents, and she asked my mother if she's close to me - now my mum is very paranoid that I have been speaking about her.",29Apr2019,1
274,"I’ve posted this once before but nobody replied and I really need help before my next shift.

Hi so I’m a student in high school at the moment and I have a part time job at a small supermarket. There’s this guy 8 years older than me in his twenties, who’s always been nice to me but kinda in a jokingly annoying brotherly way. One of my friends said he was creepy because he seemed to like me too much but I brushed it off.

Someone said something about a booty call in conversation and then I didn’t really say anything. He then proceeded to say something about V plates, and I didn’t know what that meant but I shrugged it off. He then said yeah I’m gonna make up a little sign that says V plates and put it right here (fingers brushing across my upper chest).

275,"Hey Reddit, I’d really appreciate advice on how to deal with a situation regarding two non-collaborative colleagues on finals for uni. 

I’ll try to keep this as short and to the point as possible. Skip to the TLDR, after you read the “context” below, if you want a shortened version. 

Context: I’m a certified professional writer with a BA in English pursuing a masters degree to become a teacher. I did a project for the masters program with a couple colleagues. The course’s unit final assignment is a group paper. The colleagues were previously yelled at by the masters’ program department chair and faculty for “complaining, unprofessionalism,” and that they’d “never be teachers.” That was completely unrelated to me, though. Last week, on a separate assignment for the project, they wrote a couple paragraphs while drunk and handed me their response s and told me to complete the presentation. A day, a 4 page report, and a 20 slide PowerPoint later, that assignment was done. 

That aside, regarding their non-collaborative efforts on the course final paper:
Each person was assigned their section of the paper. The two colleagues “wrote for four hours two weeks ago” so they “wouldn’t need to work on it [the paper] during finals week.” I reviewed what they wrote last week, prior to writing my section. I emailed them some revisions necessary and how to revise their sections, they essentially wrote “fluff” and didn’t include any academic topics from the course - I am not exaggerating nor being “nit-picky.” I set expectations for everybody to revise their section before Monday...

In response to the emails, and my attempts of outreach to meet in-person and complete the paper, the colleagues *tried and failed* to flip their lackluster efforts on me/make excuses about the syllabus. Believe me, I compared and contrasted what they wrote and the syllabus, they failed to complete any aspects required by the syllabus. 

Fast-forward, it’s the day before the paper’s due. Nobody did the revisions or anything. I already revised (pretty much re-wrote the first 5 pages). I either revised what they wrote or wrote my own paper. The syllabus clearly stated *”this assignment is to be written in groups and not individually.”* I revised (essentially re-wrote) the remainder  of the final paper which ended up being about 17 pages. About 2 pages (max) was excerpts from my colleagues’ “fluff”/non-academic writing. 

Now, as I am about to be done with the paper, the colleagues simultaneously log on to the Google Doc and start erasing everything I wrote. They said “it’s not your [my] place to re-write our [their] sections... what we wrote was fine...” I asked why they deleted my work and the person literally said “to get my attention.” I said that was unnecessary and they should be more respectful on the fact I worked so hard on the paper to which they ignored, and then they pasted what they erased from my work back on the document, and passive-aggressively told me to “turn in the paper however you [me] want.” Among other things said, it felt like I was interacting with a child crying for attention in a rude way. I shouldn’t have responded to them at all.

The paper was written via Google Docs, so their version and the version of the paper I edited/produced are both saved. 

TLDR; my colleagues wrote a bunch of horse shit for a final paper and didn’t collaborate with me on revisions. I emailed them solutions and tried to meet with them, they ignored. So, (for my own sake) I did my group a favor and essentially wrote a 17 page paper for the final (via revising their “work” which was about two pages of just fluff and non-academic, the rest my work). Furthermore, they were rude about my efforts, completely unappreciative, and childishly sought my attention my deleting my work, re-pasting my work  then telling me to turn in the paper however I wanted. 


Conclusion: 
I am wondering whether or not I should tell the instructor (who is the department head who leads the program and previously yelled at the colleagues for complaints &amp;amp; unprofessionalism), and/or turn in my own paper vs. their papers. 
Otherwise, I can just avoid conflict, not stoop down to their level, and just turn in the paper and not collaborate with them in the future. 

Personally, I’m leaning to the latter because that’s what my grandma recommended. She’s wicked wise.",29Apr2019,1
276,"I'm currently in a situation where I was watching my nephews for my sister full time as a ""child care provider"" for The Department of Social Services. Apparently there's an income based program that allows you ""Child Care Benefits"" which pays a child care provider (me) a standard rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

It literally took her several months to get all her paperwork in that they needed and the process of getting approved to receive payments from dss just tends to take a few months apparently. So what they do is back pay you once everything gets finalized. They agreed to back pay me until December 18th. Thing is she worked a different job with less pay and less hours until the end of February. Starting in march she got a new job with better pay and much more hours. I assumed that when she started her new job she would no longer qualify for her child care benefits because of the increase in pay but to my surprise she told me that since her rent was so high she would still receive her childcare benefits. That meant that I would still receive the same rates from dss. Also that I would have to take on more hours of watching the kids but more hours equals more money so I happily agreed. 

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify I was watching the kids maybe 30 hours a week when she was at her old job. When she started her new job in march I began watching her kids 45 to 50 hours a week. Obviously I only agreed to the increase in hours because that meant that I would still be getting paid the same rates but for much more hours.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been in contact with dss about the money that they were gonna pay me from the hours I had watched the kids while she was still working the old job which was for Dec. 18 thru Feb 28. I mailed out bills that I had to fill out and document all the hours and and money that they owed me based on the rates I had been given. March had gone by and they were still getting some final papers and stuff in from her so I just figured I'd hang on to my bill from march and just send it in with my bill from April(they pay month to month). At this point I still haven't been paid any money from dss but I was assured by them that they just needed some more papers from my sister then they would mail out my checks from December thru February. I didn't even think to ask about the hours I had been watching the kids during march and this month because in my understanding nothing had changed and she was still able to receive the same benefits as she did when she was at her old job. She explicitly told me this multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Last week I found out that she missed a deadline for turning in a document concerning her new job and they cancelled her child care benefits altogether. Moreover, she told me that she was never eligible for the same benefits while she has been at her new job from march until now and that it was her case worker who told her that she was eligible and that it was the caseworkers fault. I tried contacting her caseworker but she hasn't returned any of my voicemails yet. I'm hoping to get to speak with her this week. My sister is a compulsive liar (I'm not saying that out of spite or pettiness she legitimately has a lot of issues) and I'm almost positive her caseworker never told her that she still qualified for the same benefits at her new job.

These happen to be a loving relationship with a ex, my grandmother, my job, and complete motivation to move forward at the time. Nearing October I went through these struggles and have found my self on the better side of it and its struggles it posed but. Now I feel as if I am stuck in this cycle. I constantly feel not as enthusiastic, a bore with myself, unmotivated, almost a shell of what I once was. Everyday waking up late, taking medication and just going to work, arriving home and talk to friends who probably don't even want to talk or relate (if anything they rather send memes and belittle me about it). I've talked to numerous people and they've said that life sort of just happened all at once, too fast for me to really comprehend.

I guess sort of living in this very masculine house with parents who are very 1st generation  I have been told numerous times to just suck it up and move on, and that feeling like this is just a phase to get out of doing work, which has lead to a fear or social anxiety.

So my girlfriend and I were making out, and as things can sometimes get uncomfortable, I had to do some old fashioned adjusting. Well I was fairly turned on so I quickly realized I got some precum on my fingers. No biggie, wiped it off and completely forgot about it. Things heated up and about 5 minutes later I ended up fingering her.

Now, my assumption is that I have nothing to worry about, but the thought is always there. Is there any way this could get her pregnant?",29Apr2019,0
289,"I am not in the US so will try to explain this generically, because I don't know if the terminology is the same in other countries. At the moment I have two bank accounts, a cheque account and another one that is more of a long-term savings. On the last day of the month a sum comes off my cheque account and goes into the long-term account. 

Over the past few months I've had massive medical expenses, time spent off work, and just the usual struggle I have keeping up with work because of mental health issues, so often I've had to transfer money from the long-term account back to the cheque account in order for the sum to be transferred back on the last day of the month. The one time I missed it, I got penalised and money got taken off my account because I didn't have enough money for the sum to be transferred. Today I went to the bank to change the amount that comes off or cancel it totally, but because it takes five days, tomorrow the usual amount will come off my cheque account. (Yes, I should have done this sooner)

I've got three options, I think.

\- Do nothing and just get penalised because I don't have the money for the amount to be transferred tomorrow. \[It will not be the end of the world but every little bit of money is a lot right now\]

\- Ask my dad if I can borrow money and pay it back straight after the transfer is done. \[This is totally possible and the banking side wouldn't be a problem, but I don't want to ask my dad for money, because my parents struggle financially and already help me financially. I try to transfer money to them whenever possible, so it feels ridiculous asking to borrow money when that honestly shouldn't be happening\]

\- Try to sell something really quickly, probably for cash (because if the buyer banks with a different bank, the money won't transfer by tomorrow). \[The downside of this is that it's probably not going to work out.\]

&amp;#x200B;

At one point I was consistently getting paid at the end of every month, but now the work I do pays every week, or every two weeks, and doesn't coincide with the end of the month. I'm torn between options 1 and 2. 3... I'll probably end up trying to sell a few things anyway, but doubt it's a solution for tomorrow.",29Apr2019,1
290,"Just give a bit of background, I graduated university at the end of last year and have been looking for full-time employment since then whilst working my part-time retail job. I haven’t had much luck until recently. I had a job interview last week that I thought went well, the owner of the brand and Marketing (or possibly HR) person seemed to like me a lot and said they would let me know at some point this week if I got the job or not. Sounded really promising, I was really excited and was prepared to take the job if they were going to offer it to me straight away!! Note that the job I interviewed for isn’t strictly related to my degree (I studied Marketing Communications/Public Relations), And the job I interviewed for is kind of office/customer service admin type stuff, with helping out on their company website and possibly even social media content management. The skills I got from my degree are kind of transferable into this role though. HOWEVER, I came across a job this morning that was exactly what I’ve been looking for. It’s a Marketing Communications coordinator position for a large retailer, and the job description for it really really speaks to me. Of course I applied for it and refined the shit out of my CV and Cover Letter to make it super appealing, however applications for this job don’t close until May 10th, so I imagine they won’t be reviewing applications until after that date. So that leaves me in a a small pickle, if the place I interviewed for last week offers me the job do I take it, with the risk of the Marketing Communications coordinator position for the large retailer possibly contacting me for an interview for a later date? Or do I just take the job, hoping that the large retailer that has the Marketing Communications coordinator position doesn’t contact me? Do I not take the office/customer service admin job and hope that the large retailer contacts me? Or do I just not take any job at all??

Also note that I’ve applied for positions with the large retailer in question before, and I almost always never get a response back for an interview. That’s why I’m hesitant to turn down the office/customer service admin job, in the case that the same thing happens again. But I don’t know, I feel like I’m qualified and have some relevant experience under my belt (I did an internship relating to my studies in my last year of university and also have plenty of customer service/retail experience), so I have a somewhat small glimmer of hope unfortunately. But I know with jobs it’s never too good to get your hopes up. I really don’t know what to do lol. Please help!! 😢😢😢",29Apr2019,1

292,"I'm a 19 y/o female. I've always been a hopeless romantic and would always obtain crushes on people pretty easily. 
8-9 months ago I got out of my first real relationship. We met at 17 years old. There was an immediate connection where I felt like i knew this person already. In an instant we fell in love and naturally built a relationship. Our feelings were both super intense and the relationship felt like constant ecstasy. He was my absolute best friend and we had already began living together and talking about a future. There was no fights in the relationship and it ended rather abruptly and in these 8 months we've been in contact only a handful of times.. we always try to work things out again, I know he still loves me dearly. 
Since this relationship I haven't been able to hold any strong feelings for anybody anymore. It's almost like after experiencing something so great, nothing catches my eye anymore.
I had recently started dating again and it didn't turn out the best. The guy was a inexperienced asshole to me but we still continue a friend's with benefits relationship.
Recently I met a guy who I know I would NORMALLY fall in love with quickly. Hes gaining strong feelings quick, but for some reason, nothing in me wants a relationship anymore.
My sex drive has been falling durastically over the years.
It's completely impossible for me to have a romantic interest in anybody or even find anybody sexually attractive. The most I would gain in a relationship is attachment. 
I am bipolar but this has never been an issue before.

295,"This is my story: 

I am a sophomore at one of the most competitive high schools in the Bay Area. I get good grades,  play sports, clubs, you name it. I keep a smile on my face through it all. Nobody knows what actually goes on. My mother committed suicide when I was 8 and suffered with schizophrenia. My father is an abusive cunt who has been arrested on numerous occasions for being violent and neglectful. He doesn't work, and just sits home all day drinking. I am currently in foster care because of him. I have been in foster care twice before. He has never been receptive to any parenting classes or family therapy that was court-ordered. I think this is the last straw. I'm done with him. 

Last September, he punched me so hard I sustained a concussion. I pushed through recovery believing I had to survive for my own sake, and I couldn't risk going back to foster care. The previous home I was in was dreadful. The family was Christian and kept forcing me to get baptized and did everything they could to change every part of me. I hated myself so much because of this. I know i'm a bit weird, but I like being unique, you know? If that wasn't enough, the foster dad molested me. I hope he drops the soap and gets raped in jail. Fucking pathetic excuse for a human being. Anyways-getting beaten is ok compared to being molested.

 I thought I just needed to focus on school. So, I did that. But things just kept getting worse at home. More beating, yelling, punching. I simply can't take the abuse anymore. My body can't handle it. I am bruised and hurting on the daily. Most people believe this is just disciplinary methods that any sane parent would use to control their teen. But no- my dad beats me just because he's angry. I'm not even a wild teen. I don't party or do stupid shit. In fact, I am very far from a normal teen. I don't have any friends because it is so hard to open up and trust people after going through what I have gone through early in my life. I believe I might actually have Asperger's or something. Most foster kids are deranged drug-addict misfits. I am a misfit, but in a different way.  

If there is one goal I have, it is to go to college. Only 3% of foster youth graduate college! With these odds against me, however,  I am determined to succeed. I would love to attend UC Berkeley, as many of my pure early childhood memories with my mom were there.  Currently, my grades look pretty well. However, I am concerned about my Chemistry Honors grade. I got a C last semester because I didn't realize this course would be so difficult. This semester, I'm doing better. I have a 87.5% in the class. As the end of the year is approaching, I hope to pull an A. If I succeed, I will have a estimated UC GPA of 4.2. I really messed up freshman year b/c of that whole foster home fiasco, but the UC system doesn't count freshman grades. Thank God! Most of the kids at my school ,I have noticed, are superficial vapid spoiled bitches. With their JUULs, AirPods, MacBooks. They have had EVERYTHING handed to them on a silver platter. Meanwhile, i'm working until I collapse day and night just so that I might not fall into the cracks. They get tutoring, SAT prep, a stable home environment, supportive rich parents, they BS through classes with cheating. They take all of this for granted. It sickens me. I work double time. I do everything they're doing and all on my own: cook, clean, study, work and save money for college. I feel 45 but i'm just 15. 

I lie awake every night crying to myself. If I don't get an A in Chem, I need a 35 on the ACT to compensate. How will I possibly manage that? I have no academic support. How do I even do this on my own? I feel like i'm constantly drowning. How could I possibly afford college? Am I genuinely insane trying to be so ambitious? I have never heard of anyone ever going through something like this. I found some scholarships. One meant for foster care could take care of $100,000. I found a few more I qualify for. But still idk.

298,"Okay so I'm coming here because I just got a weird dm from one of my close cousins on Instagram and I don't know if I'm overreacting or not. 

Sorry this is gonna be very long. 

Okay, so from the beginning and why I received the dm

I was at one of my best friend's 21st dinner, let's call her Sarah, who I've known since high-school, around 7 years and all of her friends and family are Caucasian (nothing wrong with that obviously), and I am half Samoan, half white, although I look completely white, the only hint of Samoan features actually makes people mistaken me for Asian and not Samoan most of the time. 

So then Long story short, Sarah's friends (who I'd never met before as they were her university friends) wouldn't look at me and acknowledge me the whole time, despite me being part of the conversation and attempting to engage with them, which I brushed off initially. 

Then they began talking about dating, and my friend Sarah was talking about how she only wanted to date men with blonde hair and blue eyes, because she wants babies who look like her (she has blonde hair and blue eyes). To which her and her uni friends began talking about the chances of having a baby like that if she didn't marry someone who looked like her, then one of the girls chimed in jokingly ""What if you married a brown man, then you would have a brown baby with brown eyes And dark hair"" To which they began laughing, which I found very uncomfortable, as they were basically describing me and although I knew their joke wasn't coming from a hateful place and was just a result of my friend's oddly specific choice in men. But I knew they wouldn't have made that joke if I actually looked Samoan, unless they are that dumb. 

So after Sarah's friend's joke I decided I didn't like them, as they continued to ignore me and at this point it was blaringly obvious, as in I'd ask them a question when the restaurant was silent and they would look the other direction. 

I was going so say something about the joke making me uncomfortable but I couldn't find a way to do it where things wouldn't get awkward, or I wouldn't come across as attacking and didn't think it would help anyways and I was most probably being dramatic. 

So after this incident I must admit I was stupidly angry and msged a few of my close friends and this cousin I am close to, let's call her Mary. In the msgs I basically described what happened and how I felt, maybe exaggerating a bit too much just because the girls had ignored me and got on my bad side. 

After this Mary was very angry and brought it up at work (as I'm a uni student and work part time at her work, as she is 32 and has a senior position and I am 21). I described the situation again and she began a long rant about racism and white people being ignorant (she is full Samoan). 

After some time I got over it and remembered how much Sarah had supported me over the years, being one of my ride or die friends. and that I would tell her next time I saw her how I felt comfortable if it still bothered me a little. 

So... I also have a younger sister Brianna who's just turned 19 she's going through a tough time deciding what to do after Highschool, just drinks and smokes and parties with her friends being a typical rebellious lost teenager. So me and my mum have being trying to steer her away from this and to go back to university (as she completed a year of a engineering degree), after she finishes a gap year, which we agreed to. But my cousin Mary keeps encouraging it, even going out drinking and partying with her, buying her cigarettes. Everytime were together Mary trys to act 'cool' in front of Brianna, impress her, acting like her and Brianna are the same age, which I found a bit disturbing and infuriating as she is 32 and not at all being a good role model for my sister. One time they were on a weekend away with some of my family and family friends (mostly the younger family in their early 20s) and Mary was in charge of Brianne since she is the baby of the family, instead she ignores the protests of our family elders and buys Brianne a stupid amount of alcohol, getting her wasted and eventually driving home, leaving Mary all alone in the end. 

Also when I mentioned Brianne's toxic friends, who crashed her car drunk driving and left her all alone, Mary turned to me saying how could I criticise Brianne when I had racist friends? ¿, although I'd already explained how I'd talked to Sarah about it and she was sorry and didn't realise. 

There are many things Mary has done that has got on my nerves and alarmed me, to list a few because this post is way too long: 

- Obssesed with my little sisters appearance and wanting to look like her, as my sister is very mature looking for her age I.e she looks like she's in her late 20s, while Mary still gets carded. 

- Says she has transferred me money, when I shout her stuff (as I'm a uni student and pretty poor and she is 32 with a full time job) when she obviously hasn't. 

- Talks about racism against brown/black people, yet often makes racist comments again Asian people. 

and many others. So, today I was hanging out with my friend Sarah and posted a Instagram story with her, to which Mary replied this:

Mary : ew is this your racist friend? 
Me : Lol we're working on it 
Mary : 🤮🤮🤮
Me : I'm tryna educate lol
(insert what would jesus do gif) 
Mary: Good. Jesus wouldn’t be silent about people that needed Him. He didn’t allow the cult of niceness (we see today) take the front seat over His truth.
For example: Tell her to come (her house) , and allow me to show her protagonist hatred ass where to go 😂. 

I know that she is fed up with racism, to which I couldn't ever understand to the extent she does, since I look white. But the way she worded it was very odd and a very dramatic reaction to some ignorant comments, which I had already straightened out. I don't even know how to interpret what she said fully. 

Anyways, just wanted to get this off my chest, sorry my story is all over the place, but wanted to see what other people think if anyone bothered to read my dribble 😅😅. 
Please let me know if you think I'm just being nit picky and dramatic, and am in the wrong/interpreting her actions wrong or if you have any advice.",29Apr2019,0
299,"I'm losing my marbles, I'm slipping back into really bad high school habits and I'm just struggling with school again.

300,"My roommate has an addiction with Fortnite funny enough. It’s gotten so bad to the point where he will stay up until 6AM playing and loudly talking to people online. He skips class to play too so he’s always in our dorm and is always loud. It’s gotten so bad to the point where I can’t sleep or study or live in my dorm and do basic tasks.

305,"So this is gonna be a bit personal but I am at my wits end with the issue to the point of tears on multiple occasions.

Backstory: I still live with my family (Mom, little sister(Chibs), Shitty Step-Dad(SD)) and the issues have spanned a long time relating to different other issues that are to much of a hassle to get into. The bare bones long and short of it is I live with recovering addicts a small devil who might as well be mine, and mental stress out the ying yang to to my unfortunate nature to worry a stupid amount of what could go wrong. If you'd like to know the extra shitty-ness of SD I'll post an update.

My question today is what should be done about SD. He recently got put on admin leave from his post for being ARRESTED for public intoxication, and now hasnt had any money come into the house and spends the remainder of it on booze, his trips to the methadone clinic. He also during this time had a doctors visit that was quiet death defying. He has recently been doing insulin shots due to the development of Diabetes. The man's recorded blood sugar was OVER 600+. That fact alone is amazing I know. Anyway due to all these things not to mention totaling his vehicle so now he takes mine and doesnt fill the gas back to where it was. With all of this in mind, What The Fuck Should I Do?

He is claiming to be trying to get better with drinking and such, and his blood sugar has managed to drop below 200 but he still makes daily trips to the booze store with someone elses money.

I am in the bachelors of science program at my university and the deadline for major applications is coming up. I have taken a lot of basic science courses and the only ones that I look forward to attending seem to be the calculation related courses (math and physics). Thus my plan A right now is to apply for a math major.

The thing is, in calc 1 I got 69% and in calc 2 I received 71% (these scores are both above class average). I will admit that some of the homework problems have been extremely challenging for me, (even though I did eventually take the time to figure them out) and I put in a lot of effort to do well in these courses. I find that with problems I always want to know why things work the way they do. I find that pretty cool to figure out even though most of the time I need help to understand. Thus is my dilemma. Although I think I do enjoy doing math all the time, I don't think that I'm very good at it. Reading up on other posts, a lot of people who pursue math have a greater 'math affinity(?)' than the average person. I don't think I have this.

312,"I moved to a new country without speaking the language and I was really worried about finding the job. Accidentally I met an owner of a really big company, who just handed me his business card and offered a job after a short talk with me. I was offered an office position where I’m currently working my 3rd year. Here are the benefits:

* I have my own office and lots of space and freedom
* Money is good and I’m able to travel frequently (private)
* I’m working with graphic programs (self taught) and I like it
* In the meantime I’ve learned the new language from 0 until around B1 and I’m able to work on a daily basis only using the new language

However, the company’s policy is quite off. There’s never any feedback. There’s no “good job” or no evaluation (not even yearly). In my opinion (and coworkers opinion) I do the good job, it’s fast, it’s professional and I saved many people’s asses many times. I learned to work without being constantly pat on my back, and that’s ok. I work to live and not live to work! But recently there has been multiple situations where:

* The boss was clearly angry with the whole department where I work in. He claims he’s not talking about me or my work, but he’s not happy in general. However I really take it personally if someone talks with me face to face and claims that “this and this is working bad!!”
* They don’t really give me a big chance to be better at what im doing (I wanted to have new programs to learn more or the access to use them at home to learn - they said no). They also never agree with my modern designs and they want me to change them until they look like a flyer from the 90’s.
* recently the boss kept saying that I’m too skilled (uni grad) for my position and he wants me to do something more/better but the conversation in my opinion was so negative, like me literally trying to prove him that what I do is relevant for the company (it is. And I’m the only one in this position). But he was screaming and making me feel bad, even though I haven't made a single mistake in my job! 
* I never really hear that I do a good job

My colleagues say that I should view it positively because he doesn’t spend his time trying to figure out that some people are “too skilled” for their job. And that he cares, he’s just showing it in a shitty way. And that people wait for months for appointment with him and he comes to see me in my office, showing interest in my skills.

But honestly it always stresses me so much. I achieved so much, I freaking learned the language so fast that now I was able to argue with him in his native language. I’m really so flexible in my tasks, I learned a lot. But I’m not fluent enough to let's say be in a position where I would have to mail important people. I make language mistakes - but this is not a problem in my current field. I thought “ok let’s say how it goes” but something in me thinks about finding a new job - which is extremely hard to find where I live (and with B1 language and English only). Before I got this job I've sent literally around 100 CV's and got 2 answers (negative) only. Now I kept sending my CV and it's the same situation.I feel trapped. In one hand I’m like “be tough: he gives you chances to prove yourself” but in other hand it kills my vibe, my creativity and the actual will to aim high, because nothing really changes.

Graduation came and it was everything I wanted it to be. That summer was the best in my life. And then everything went downhill. 

Each day I somehow think about graduation and it just reminds me of how, I’m not sure, disappointed in myself I am? How upset I am with how my life has gone? I am so happy for the past experiences I have had, yet for some reason I just can’t let my “glory days” (which I really hope weren’t, I want the best still be to come) go. This second semester has really brought me closer to my coworkers too and I know I have some things going for me, yet I still cannot keep myself from lingering on the past. 

What do I do? I keep reminding myself of the good things from this last year and that my senior year wasn’t perfect, but I can’t help but think about how much happier I was in the past. What can I do? I can’t sleep because I think about it. 

TLDR; I’m stuck in my past, can’t enjoy the present. What can I do? Ive tried reminding myself of the good that I have.",29Apr2019,3
315,"Hi guys! I made this reddit account specifically so I could ask this question. This post will probably be long and the first and last I make. I will also be changing names.

I am a college student and I live at a dorm with 3 other girls. (There are two rooms in one suite, so two in each room) I have a roommate, Ana. So she and I aren't on the best terms. It was the start of the winter term, and I had already been living at the dorm with another suitemate, Emma and we had two other roommates but they left in the fall term and we got new roommates. So when I first came in, I had arrived late and our new suitemate, Kate, said Ana is on the phone and when she's on it she tends to be on for hours. I didn't think much of it until dinnertime and she was still on the phone and barely greeted me.

Kate and I had already hit it off and we got along right off the bat.

&amp;#x200B;

Not so much with Ana. After that it's just been awkward between us.

She is an international student, so I guess that's why she was on the phone for hours, but I mean, it was the first day, my first day back and we were going to be roommates, at least say hi? I don't know. I tried to just brush it off, thinking maybe she was just shy. Problems arose. Later on in the winter term, I began waking up to alarms she had set hours (1-2 usually, sometimes more) before she needed to wake up. It didn't really bother me at first because I usually sleep early anyway, until it started happening on weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I began to tell her ""Hey if you're not going to get up to your alarms, you should let yourself sleep in more."" She said she sets them so early because she's tired and has trouble getting up in the morning. I've even helped her get up sometimes. I told her I get that, but if she has trouble getting up in the morning, that shouldn't be my problem as well and that she should go to bed earlier. She didn't seem to care. It got so bad that it even woke up our roommates next door. I even spoke to the RA about it because it had been a week and a half when she didn't do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Note about Ana: She's a straight A student and oftentimes stays up late to do homework, study, projects, etc. She got into our school with a full (or at least mostly full) paid scholarship because of it. I found it admirable that she can and is willing stay up so late to get good grades. It's not good for your health, but we're adults here, you have the freedom to choose. Then I noticed a pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

She's not very good at time management. She often stays up late because when she's working, she watches movies and TV shows, which really slows down your work pace. Especially because she even stops working to watch that said TV show/movie. Ana also gets on the phone and talks for HOURS to her boyfriend, her friends, or her family. She's usually talking to her boyfriend and especially takes a long time when she talks to him. This would be fine and all if we didn't share a room. I can usually sleep through it though, so it's not a big deal for me, kind of annoying, but I am usually to tired to really care. Remember this: I have never asked her to leave the room if she is working late, or at least I can't remember a time where I have. We have a living room in our suite that anyone can use if working late to allow other roommates to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, they talked for 4-5 hours and it was getting late. I tried to go to bed at 10 PM or so, I needed to sleep early because I was heading home to drop some stuff off as it is nearing the end of the school year and I also was attending my cousin's graduation in the morning (I live two hours away from my college). It was almost 1 AM and clearly she wasn't getting off so when she came back from using the toilet, btw she was still video chatting with her boyfriend at this point, I asked her to turn off the lights and she didn't seem very happy. I didn't tell her to stop talking to him and when I had fallen asleep I could still hear her talking to him. Oh and by the way, I missed my cousin's name being called because I fell back asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was the breaking point. I can't sleep right now because of a combination of things: irritation and some tea I had earlier (bad decision ik, lol). So I was trying to sleep, but I couldn't sleep and Ana was in the room talking on the phone again and working. This was shortly after she hung up on the phone. I had asked her if she was going to stay up late that she move to the living room. She didn't even look at me, she glared at me with side-eye and said to me, ""I'm finished. I'm sorry, but this is my room too."" Shortly after saying that, she continues working. I was so shocked that I didn't even say anything. I became so mad because EVERYTHING she does is inconsiderate. I have no idea if she was in a bad mood to begin with and me asking that made her lash out or if she was fed up with me. This doesn't excuse her behavior though.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I did anything to her, other than to ask her to stop setting alarms early, turn down her music/movie/TV shows etc. But I am in tears over what she said. I get that I'm a pushover, I'm trying to work on it, but I'm also not trying to make things worse than they are between us I know she isn't too fond of me either. I can't tell if she doesn't understand that she is being inconsiderate or if she genuinely doesn't care. I feel like she has taken advantage of my passive nature.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to be considerate of my roommates, I leave the room and work elsewhere if I know I need to be up late for homework or projects, I leave the suite when I want to talk to my family (also because I'm weirded out by other people hearing my conversations). I've never asked her to leave the room and the one time I do, this is what I get! 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to bring this up to Emma and Kate because this is between the two of us. I don't want to make a big fuss out of this.  I don't know if it'll be worth telling the RA as I have also been to the RA when I have done it in the past with the alarms and nothing happened because our RA couldn't do anything about it. I wonder if she could even do anything about this?

319,"We are both in our upper 30s, but my sister does things that are what a kid would do. I live in a foreign country. She came to visit for the first time. Every time she tries a new food or drink and doesn't like it she squeezes her face in a look of absolute disgust like a baby and makes ""ooogh..."" noises for several seconds while shaking her head. She doesn't control any reaction, and everything is negative. I had large 2-liter size bottled water, so she took a whole bottle for herself and drank right from the bottle instead of pouring it in a glass. When we went up to the top of a hill to take in a view of the amazing mega-city below, her reaction was ""so are the people who live up here really rich?"" instead of saying how amazing things looked. She spits on the street. When I'm around her I feel I'm dealing with a 12-year old kid, because anything I say can cause her to explode in rage or burst into tears. She is incapable of making any decisions on her own. It is so tiring and frustrating. What can I do?",29Apr2019,1
321,"Is this how everyone feels?

First of all I don’t want to feel like this forever. I want to be successful and live my life to my determination. I want to be financially able, have loving relationships, and be a decent person with a good routine. 

The me who I want to be goes to the gym five times a week, studies as needed for good grades, keeps up with all their friends, excels at work, eats super healthy, has housework and washing done on time, and is really organised and tidy. 

But this isn't who I am at all . 

I try to do all of this but it becomes exhausting to me. I just feel like everyone else can, some people even more than that (children for example). When I try to do even those basic things I get so tired and I just want to cry and stay in bed. I slowly isolate myself and my performance drops incredibly. Then I fall into an awful patch and try all over again. Each time I think it won’t happen again and maybe it’s an age thing (25F). It does though; I’ll be doing really well and then I see it happening and can’t stop everything falling apart. 

The extent of my motivation is literally -  eat anything that provides fuel, do washing when you have no clothes, sleep as much as possible or you'll be tired lots, do bare minimum uni work or stressed, and text your friends once every two months, maybe. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm not very good at this life thing. 

I just want to sleep all day. It's almost a need. I feel like crying all the time because everything is too much. It's gotten worse as I've gotten older because it’s more obviously a pattern. 

I’ve done so much to try and get better at these things but it just doesn’t happen for me. It’s not a lack of organisation, it’s a lack of motivation almost. I have tried creating lists of tasks for each day but then it gets to a month of doing great and I’m an emotional wreck that needs to hide in bed. 

So does everyone feel like this?",29Apr2019,1

I have one reliable and trusted friend who lives and works in FL, not sure if that can be part of the solution?

I can't stand being around them due to the way they talk to him but if I speak up, I'll be banished from their house.

As for me, I suffer terrible anxiety and depression and they don't understand.

They resent me and resent him being with me and it's horrible! 

They take all of his money away from his pay each week and yell at him for not being able to afford bills and petrol because of this. They really are awful.

326,"For context, my relationship was ok. The guy I was with was sweet, caring and treated me like a princess. But he quickly became smothering and way too attached way too soon into our short relationship. I knew I was one of the few interesting things going on in his life, but I enjoyed the attention...
Until he groped a girl and hid it from me for months until her angry boyfriend told me about what he did. 

Anyways, so I leave him (it wasn't really a hard choice, since I was already preparing to leave him). He starts acting kind of passive aggressively and borderline stalkerish. I end up blocking him on 2 platforms, but I keep one. And on this one, I finally told him that I wanted space. 

Of course he tried to make me feel sorry for him, but I saw right through it, I'm not attending a pity party. 

He leaves me alone for a month, but then out of the blue, he forwards me one of those... I want to say it's a meme, but it's pretty much a story following a daddy x baby-girl relationship, it's stuffed with emojis, it was weird and kinda lame compared to the other ones I've seen. 
But this one ends with the girl being left dead in the trunk of a car. This is the part that has a majority of my friends concerned. It's not even a ""forward to ten people"" things, it just ends with her dead. 

Then more recently, he sent me Spotify link to a song.

I have responded to neither nor do I plan to.

I hear my friends freaking out over this, but I struggle to see him as a threat, maybe because I know that he's been abused before, because he was so soft during our relationship...and I will admit, he wasn't the brightest, as sweet as he was. 

He could either be that socially dense that he saw this shitty thing and decided to send me it as a ploy to get my attention.
Or he could honestly be subtly trying to freak me out. 
Either feels plausible to some degree.

Yesterday though she dmed me over discord telling me “We might never get to date, I might kill myself first” from what I gathered while comforting her, I’m the only person she’s told, and she begged me not o tell any adults.

My ideal gap year would be to chill at home and get some computing certifications and work on my video game. But my parents won’t support me if I don’t study, so I couldn’t live at home really. I don’t make enough to live on my own though.

339,"Oh God, where to begin with this. So a little perspective on my childhood, I lived in fear of my dad and my mom would never stand up for me when things got bad. For example. Once my dad barged in my room with a shovel and destroyed everything in it around me (reason: attempting to wear a new green hoodie I got for Christmas to church). Once I've been punished physically since the salt was knocked over on the table when my dad got home from work. Kicked my sisters out of the house at age 6 and 8. But that's the past, and my dad had made progress on controlling his random outbursts. 

  However moving on to adult me.. Not too long ago I  (m24) surprised everybody by moving back to the states. I showed up on my parent's doorstep with my suitcase a few hours before my birthday. They were in shock to find me there and I had the goal of improving my relationships with my them since my dad had settled down
. 
Fast forward to the next morning, I hit up my old hiking buddy to explain I'm back in town. He sets up a hike for us both that morning. My mom drove me to his house since she was using my car at the time because she had previously totalled hers and needed it for work. I asked my mom on the way if I should plan the evening with my dad. She told me no because he is always so tired after work. So I made plans with my best friend that night. 

Fast forward to the evening after the hike and I am at my best friend's house. I get a call from my mom saying that I need to get all my stuff off the lawn and that my dad didn't want me home (he had left work early and planned to cook dinner for us two for my birthday, but I never was told about his plans until afterwards). My friend drives me to my parent's house to collect my belongings off of the lawn. I return to my friend's house and his parents told me that I can rent out their spare bedroom. I knew they felt bad for me. 



Fast forward a little while later, my dad cools down and we start talking a little bit again but its a little awkward. Also my mom bought a new car for herself and gave mine back. So cool, I have my car again. However I keep my distance from being at the house. I kind of wanted to get on with my life, plus I never had a day off working two jobs. 


My mom is starting to get distraught that I don't come over to visit. However, every time I visit my mom, I can't even have a normal conversation with her. She always questions my faith in God (I'm atheist) she's pentecostal. I finally give in and tell her that I have my doubts. She understand that she I'm not religious at this point and shr really hasn't been the same to me since. It's been her mission to convert me again and only talks about how she never would believe that she would live to see the end times and how the rapture is coming. She keeps on trying to get me to read Revelations. I love her but, she's delirious. She also likes to talk about how badly the media treats Trump and how bad socialism is and this country is going to hell. I can't even be in the same fucking room with her anymore. She is also making me promise her that I won't end things. (My life). 


At this point my dad is starting to look like a saint. However the other day, I decided to take their dogs over to my new place and let them be outside with me while I do yard work. One of them manages to get their paws cut and I bandage him up and bring him home later that day. My parents are now mad at me for getting their dog injured. I went to go visit my dad so we could work again on a hobby we had once started before I moved out of the country. He had no interest in doing it and barley talked to me as he just watched TV that day. I have a sense he was trying to punish me for allowing the dog to get injured and was saying that he can't do the hobby with me because of the dog's paw.  It was strange because he wanted to do stuff with me earlier while I was keeping my distance. 




Fast forward the other night,  I had awoken to the voice of my friend's dad in the other room at 3 AM. I go into a panic atrack thinking he is going to try to come into my room and beat my ass (for reasons why, I don't know). Then I realize he is on the phone and is just talking loud. I began to question my sanity. Anyways this new family they are great! I have been living with my friend's family since November. I have learned how a family can function normally. I'm envious, they can have conversations, argue, laugh and do things together. There are no negative vibes in the house. I am starting to feel robbed of everything I knew growing up with my own family.


 The other day I overheard a conversation with my friend's parents. The dad was asking about that it seems that I don't want to interact with him. But he was reassured the mom that his (my) father is emotionally abusive to him growing up and he doesn't know how to have a father/son relationship. That's when the wheels really started to turn inside me. I realized how toxic my parents are to me and I don't need them in my life. 



On a side note, about my car. I bought the car from them a few years ago. Granted I paid two grand for it while it's value is around 5 grand. I also put $2,500 grand of work into it. However, being 18 when I bought the car I was too naïve to not get the title from them. Recently, I just lost both of my jobs within a week apart. I decided I needed a much needed break and what time would be better to have a road trip to get away from everything? My parents got wind of this trip I have planned for Tuesday. They are telling me not to go because it is their car and they don't want me to go. 
I have no clue when I get back but I'm parking that car in front of that God forsaken house never looking back.

 

I know down in their hearts they want the best for me and want to help me succeed in my life, but they are smothering me. I'm honestly torn right now in my thoughts with plans of abandoning them completely. I know my mom is complely depressed same as my dad. And I know this would completely ruin them. 

Anyways. Montana seems kind of nice this time of year

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence and I worried she hated me for it",29Apr2019,0

I have moved to a different province, as the resources I had called, Income Support, Family Violence, etc. Claimed that the waitlist was too long- a few days after my last post I had to contact 911 because she was driving somewhere on another ranting rave, anyways, my last few days there I was packing up and prepared to leave on April 28th, selling off all my belongings and such. I had my things ready to ship out but on April 23rd she was released from the psych ward, and she wanted me GONE. On April 24th at 2 am she claimed she had booked me a plane ticket back to my fathers (which isn't really a viable option whatsoever, as we have had issues in the past and he is a heavy alcoholic that lives in a 1 bedroom basement suite, but who am I to complain) and the plane ticket was for that same morning, so 8 hours notice, also meaning I couldn't ship my stuff out, the day before she also refused to let me ship my stuff out. I asked her if she could ship my stuff out for me that day, and that I would pay her any money back that she spends on it if she showed me a receipt, she agreed. It is now the 29th of April, and for the last 5 days I have been nonstop arguing with her to send my stuff, she now wants me to give her money for all of my stuff, and shipping on top of that. I don't trust her to actually spend the money on shipping my belongings back to me, which leaves me in a rough spot, and the only idea I have is to go to the police, which I don't see them helping much if I am out of province. She also calls me daily telling me that I am possessed and that my belongings are as well, it really wouldn't be much of an issue if they were just clothes, but I have about 2000\~ dollars worth of stuff I was trying to ship here. Do I just give up and move on, or continue trying to bargain, or go to police? please help :(

344,"Greetings my peeps!

So I am currently in a really weird situation and honestly don’t know if it would be best to just call it ends or keep talking to this chick. 

So Im 22 and have met a chick ( 23) who has a baby. I’m really statically and academically inclined, and I know that having a kid at such a you age the odds of having a rough life are pretty damn high... specially when you’re a single parent. I was really curious about why she had a baby at such a young age... I thought in my mind “ perhaps it a mistake?” But actually not at all, it was all planned, not only that, but she was married as well. She then proceeded and told me that later in the marriage ( three months) the dude came out as gay and that destroyed her in every aspect. I guess he did it to prove his family he was not gay ( stupidest thing ever honestly)

I really do like this girl, she has quite a lot of the things that I like, only thing is she has a child at such a young age... I’m really hard working person with many goals and passions in life and just thinking about the future with her for some reason I feel like it will hold me back if I become serious with her obviously I would have sacrifice lots of things.. also the her baby daddy is in the kids life which is great but then at the same time I don’t want to get emotionally attached to the kid at all because I don’t want them to think I’m trying to replace his dad...

Today they were busy asking each other about their weekends and I'm sitting there as the new one, feeling completely left out. Wouldn't it be common courtesy to involve me too?

348,"I’m a female. Late 20’s. My parents have always been really wonderful to me. I had a really good upbringing, felt loved always. 
I had a long term relationship with a guy, we had been together 2-3 years &amp; my dad offered to put a deposit down to buy us a house, luckily, before we found a house I found out he had cheated on me &amp; I broke it off with him. 
A few months later, I met a woman, I’ve been with her 3 years. 
When I first told my parents they said they was okay with me being with a woman as long as I was happy, which is what all supportive parents say. 
After a while my dad especially, started saying things like “what are your plans for your life?” “Do you not want to do better for yourself” “what about children” 
I know my parents talk to my grandma about me and my relationship a lot because my grandma keeps dropping hints that I don’t see my parents as much as I used to. 

Anyways me, my parents and my partner were out having a meal the other day and a young guy served us, when my partner and my mum went outside, I said a passing comment about the guy that served us, it was something like “he’s so slow serving the drinks” or something like that, my dad replied “are you sure you’re not just saying that because you fancy him” 

It’s really getting to me now. I’m happy. Surely that should be the only thing that matters? 

I’m fed up of the sly little digs.

**We met on a Bumble ( a dating app similar to tinder) and I've really enjoyed the past few months that we've been together.....well...sort of.**   


**See this is the thing, every time I think about our relationship, I find that I automatically just say that our time together has been great, when really, there are some parts of it that haven't been.**   


**For the most part though, we're pretty good together.**   


***The positive attributes of our relationship are:***   


\- We both laugh together pretty much constantly and love being silly together.   
\- Our sex life is pretty great for the most part (HOWEVER our chemistry has somewhat declined)

\- We have many mutual friends even though we met online (HOWEVER we don't really see our friends any more)

\- We live extremely close together by coincidence (a 5 minute drive down the street).   
\- We both have shared interests, and can talk about almost anything.  

\- We support each other and help each other when our mental health or stress gets the best of us (HOWEVER..her mental health is quite a lot worse than mine). 

\- She gets along very well with my family, and I with hers.   


**So as you can see, we're doing pretty good.**   


**But there are also a lot of  HOWEVER's lodged in among the good things, which takes us into the not so great things about our relationship and the way I'm feeling at the moment.**  


***The not so great:***  


\-  Her mental health is quite bad at the moment, and she's dealing with a lot of sadness, depression and anxiety.   


\- She often cries for no reason, not usually around me, but often calls me and is either slightly sad or crying and I have to calm her down.   


\- There have been a few instances where her anxiety has detracted from her desire to meet or partake in social events with my friends

&amp;#x200B;

\- I feel as though her mental health is starting to bring me down, yet when she asks if we're all okay, I just say that ""Everything is fine! I'm always here for you if you need to talk"" which is true, but lately its been a bit much.   


\- I feel like we're losing that spark, and that things are slowly starting to fizzle out, and that it would just be best to end things now.   


\- I feel like I have limited time for a relationship at the moment. I'm at university with an almost full time study schedule and I also work around 25 hours a week.

During the party, as we were gearing up to leave, my ex told our daughter to pose, so he could ""take a picture for Mommy."" Everything that I think goes across my face, and I am pretty sure he saw my distaste for that, as he quickly clarified ""Mommy-Jane"" to my daughter. 

Last fall/winter, I spent three months in the hospital and almost died a number of times, during which my ex and his girlfriend took on sole custody roles, against my wishes. My ex said that he didn't want to bother my fiancè with the custody schedule, but my parents were willing and able (a year and a half prior, I had spent 6 months travelling out of state every other week for work and they would watch my daughter, so they are familiar with her schedule and her school is familiar with them) and my ex said it was ""inconvenient"" for him to share custody with my parents. Now that I am on the mend (and in therapy with my daughter - he lied to her about my condition, which she did not appreciate), it really feels like he was hoping I would die so they could move her away from my town and be a family. I think that is why this ""Mommy"" business really *bothers* me. I've been up all night mulling over this and all I've gotten is more angry.

So, how do I approach this? Do I talk to him first? Both of them? Do I bring it up to my daughter in therapy? I mean... My fiancè and I don't have my daughter calling him ""dad"" or anything because I feel like that is super disrespectful to my ex, and whether I like my ex or not, he is her father, her only father.

361,"Sorry this is long so but I have to get this off my chest, thanks in advance if you read this and reply. 

I'm 34 now but tell everyone I'm 30, so I've been taking 4 years off my real age since 2009.

The lie started when I went to college, I was 24 and had spent a few years working after high school so when I got to first year of college I was older than everyone.

In first year there were a few random times when I was asked my age and I told the truth but I remember one person saying ""wow you're so old, I didn't know you were that old!"" and it was in a bad way. I didn't feel good about it. I felt so embarrassed and decided to start lying about my age. BIGGEST REGRET OF MY LIFE. STUPID I KNOW! 

Anyway, I didn't have any past friends from high school because my public school friends had a falling out, so I was kind of a loner so midway through high school I started hanging out with the wrong crowd who were into drugs, I was never into drugs and just aimlessly tagged along because I didn't have anyone else for friends. I never did drugs so I was happy to no longer be in contact with them after high school ended. Lucky for me but unfortunately enabled me to lie about my age because there's no one around that would know.

So I made most of my current friends and connections in college and since college, problem is I've been lying about my age since then so I have friends for 10 years now who still think I'm younger than I am.

It hurts because these people are my good friends and I have this horrible lie and it's really kinda altered the way I live my life. 

Whenever the subject of traveling has come up I always decline because I'm afraid someone might want to see my passport and if that happened they'd see my age it and it would be the end, they will hate me and I will be shunned from all of my friends.

Only my family know my real age so I never have any situations when my friends and family could meet. Which sucks both ways because my family has never met any of my friends or girlfriends and vice versa. 

This has stressed me out because I always have to be aware of situations when my age might come up, say if people are planning to go out to the bar, I'll have to either show up late so if I get ID'd I won't get caught, or if we're in line as a group (which I try to avoid) I will stand at the back of the line and hope that the bouncer doesn't say something like ""oh you're the oldest one here!"" or something to give away my age. It kind of made me into a more reclusive lifestyle because of that fear.

Lastly, dating. This is the biggest burden on my conscience, it feels bad enough that I'm lying to my guy friends but lying to the women I've dated hurts and it has really stressed me out. I haven't dated that many women in my life (10 max.) but in every relationship I of course lied about my age. I couldn't tell them the truth because they might say something to my friends and I get outed. It's a really messed up situation I've gotten myself into. So relationships usually have lasted 3-6 months I think partly because my fear of getting caught and also the girls I've dated never meeting my family or even my friends that much, I've also never met parents of anyone I've dated.

The longest relationship with a woman was 1 year. She was 24 and I was 28 (actually 32). We eventually broke up but she never met my parents and I knew she was upset about that, I could sense she was feeling like I was embarrassed of her or something but really it was just me and my dumb lie being afraid of getting caught.

Now, here I am dating another woman who honestly I feel like is the love of my life. She's 26 and I'm 30 (actually 34) and I don't know what to do. I want to tell her but I'm so deep-rooted in this lie, if I tell her I would expect her to break up with me (which is fair I understand I'm in the wrong here) and potentially tell my friends. It's so incredibly dumb, I'm an idiot. I feel horrible about it because she doesn't deserve a liar so I'm already contemplating an eventual breakup for the fact that I've lied about my age since college and have to keep the lie up.

It was never my intent to lie about my age to take advantage of anyone, this was me being a coward and embarrassed of my age so I just kept going along with the lie. Now I've dug myself into this horrible situation. I've seriously considered starting a new life and moving across the country so I could start fresh and tell people my real age.

I honestly don't know how I can ever reveal my real age at this point and how fucked up it would be for everyone to find this out after so long.

I feel stress both ways, stress of being caught so always having to be aware and ready. And the stress of being a liar to my friends and girlfriend that I've been lying about my age to them.

I've often googled ""is it ok to lie about your age"" or ""how to confess your real age"" and most of the results are about dating. Comments usually say ""If he's lying about his age, what else is he lying about?"" which is fair, or ""if someone lies their age you can't trust them"" it's a fair point and I can't argue with it. I'm in the wrong. But in my situation it's because I was an idiot in college and I've been keeping up this lie for 10 years now. I just don't know what to do.

What do you think I should do?

- Come clean and hope for the best?

- Continue to lie? 

- Move away and start fresh?",29Apr2019,6
363,"So I’ve been working at my current job for 2 years now, it was a decent job to start, nice group of people, friendly atmosphere - customers were still as awful but that was the only major downfall I could think of (and let’s be honest they’re awful everywhere) although over the past year/18 months things have just kept going downhill. A lot of the nicer people that I got on with at the start have left now and most have been replaced with people who just can’t be bothered. Hours have been cut so there are less staff on shift even though the store is constantly getting busier. Customers are getting worse and more aggressive (may be something to do with the fact they have to be kept waiting over an hour for service as there are only 2 staff on shift). Rules are changing in ways that I morally disagree with (too specific to really get into). Staff are being forced to do jobs off-site that are not mentioned ANYWHERE in a contract, handbook etc. Managers taking more holiday from colleagues than is being booked (i.e. booking a colleague off for 2 weeks on the system, and making them work one of them) so holiday gets used up quicker, all behind the colleagues backs I might add.

Now my big dilemma is the only reason I haven’t already left is that any job I’d like to try and get into isn’t within walking distance and I don’t currently have a license (working on it but it will take a few more months at least).

It is affecting me mentally, emotionally, it is putting me under a great deal of stress to the point where I am losing sleep, losing weight, suffering with frequent migraines and often left wondering if there’s any point in life as a whole.

I desperately want to leave, it’s all I think about, but my  main worry is trying to get a new job and them asking the question in the interview ‘why did you leave your last job without a plan? why do you have x amount of time with no job??’

I just responded with a simple ""its not funny"" I felt bad when I sent it because we always deal with hardships with humor, but this time I really wasn't in the headspace to comprehend humor at all. They said that they knew it wasn't funny and now aren't talking to me at all. I don't know if I made them uncomfortable or not. I know they don't deal with things well when it comes to mental health issues, but we've both added to each others conversations in the past, or at least validated the other. 

I feel really bad and I tried redeeming our conversation by sending them a few funny pictures of my own after 10 minutes, and giving them a bit of funny banter. They still haven't replied and I feel like I fucked up.

She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then talked upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s.

Last time she cleaned was because she invited her cousin to visit without notice and the house wasn’t presentable at all, but only cleaned because I made a big deal out of it. She’s generally kind of messy and unorganized, and whenever I try to talk to her about anything she never handles it well, so I’ve kinda stopped getting on her about either leaving stuff around, paying bills, whatever. We also never have sex because she never initiates it, and I’m tired of initiating it.

373,"I am currently 23 and am over stressed with the fact that I want to go back to school to get a Game Development degree, but the job I work is currently suffocating me it feels. I make more money at this job than I would be able to make anywhere else without having a degree. It is decent money for my age, I am not well off but I am able to pay all my bills and have a good amount of money for leisure. I still live with my parents and I have a very active social life for a little background.

I am and always have been a gamer since I could remember, ever since my Dad bought me a PlayStation 1 way back when, when they first came out, and ever since then upgrading consoles and then about 2 years ago I went all out and got a $2,000 gaming pc and haven’t stopped gaming. So you could say gaming is a very large part of my life. There is nothing more that I want in my life than to work for a company that makes games or even make my own one day. Hence why I am going to go to school for Game Development. 

But my current problem is I work 40 hours a week, have been at the same place for 3 years, and this place is my least favorite thing in the world, I work at a tire factory and it is very simple work but it is a lot of work. I hate every single person in this place of about 1000+ workers except for like two people. But anyways, I used to go to school full time and work full time at a coffee shop and I could barely handle both and maintain a social life. And to top it off my father was dying of cancer at the time. After two years and withdrawing from all classes in all four semesters because my grades weren’t where I wanted them because I was unable to focus. I eventually lost my Dad in 2014, and have been out of school since then, I don’t blame him for the reason I wasn’t doing good in school, if I was just more aware of life and what was going on I would’ve been fine, but that isn’t the case.

So know I am faced with the situation of work 7am-3pm Mon-Fri and if I am to go to school more than likely have classes Mon, Wed, Fri after work on those days, which isn’t too bad, but the reason I am writing all this and asking for advice is because the amount of stress this job puts on me is unhealthy, and to add schooling on top of it just makes me have panic attacks just thinking about it and I’m not even back in school yet. I have recently asked for a raise because I am well deserving of one but apparently the people that sleep on the job and run other employees out of here are more deserving of the money. If I didn’t need the money for my bills I would leave but then it makes me feel like I would be starting all over, again! It’s almost to a point though that if I were to quit and get a less stressful, less paying job, that I would be making a huge mistake. But I don’t know anymore, I wake up every morning hating my life more than I ever had until 3pm when I leave this place. And then to come from here and go to school just terrifies me. I’m scared that all this stress is going to either make me snap or have mental issues. I assume by after maybe one more year of working here and schooling if be able to get a base IT job or something in the field of Computer Programming and then would be able to leave this place but that year alone, gives me mini panic attacks. My current daily schedule consists of going to work, going home and working out, then playing games until about 10pm and then going to bed and repeating the process unless some of my friends want to hang out. So if I’m not gaming with my friends I’m hanging out with other friends, and I’m afraid I might lose that with going to school and working as well.

I just don’t know what to do or how to feel in this situation, I feel stuck but I don’t know if I am. 90% of me tells me it is going to be the worst thing in the world and the other 10% tells me it’s only a couple years. But a lot can happen in a couple years. I’m just so stuck in my head that I don’t know who to even talk to about it anymore.",29Apr2019,1
374,"I’ve been pretty lonely lately, and I’m finally over my last relationship. I don’t rely on a boyfriend to make my life better, but have g one dies help, and I could definitely use some help. 

There are two guys I’m crushing on right now. Both potentially like me. I need to choose one, and i need to choose right. Right now I like them pretty equally, but I’m afraid I’ll get I to a relationship and wish I was the other one, and that wouldn’t be fair. I’m hoping to at least ask someone out by the end of this week. Here are my options:


One  (A) is someone I’ve gotten a lot closer to recently. Our personalities are a lot alike and I love being around him. We have a really good connection. We would probably last longer. He’s a total sweetheart, and I know that if he’d do anything for me even if he isn’t into me too. Not my usual type, but I still find him really cute. Downsides are that he’s younger than me (not in the creepy or illegal way) and he’s not very confident. 


The other (D) one is just my usual type, and I love his personality. We’re very different. He’s very loud and always talking to everyone, and I’m quiet around people I don’t know. But being around him just makes me so happy, and he makes me giddy, which I’ve never had happen before. We know each other from work. He’s hilarious, too. He gives great massages. A downside is that a lot of people dislike him because they find him annoying since he’s from another country, but I just love mostly everything about him. 

Who should I ask?",29Apr2019,1
375,"TL;DR— neighbour starts insulting me and calling me a liar for the 4th or 5th time- do I cut her loose completely or maintain a civil distance given that we live so close together?

Ok— before I begin, I’m pretty sure I’m not being a dick, I just want a bit of advice about how to move forward, I think. But all sensible comments are welcome, obviously. 

My neighbour (next door flat but one— I’m at no.1, she’s at no. 3, there’s a flat between us) sent me a really crisp message/accusation yesterday about her WiFi.  It seems she’d been away all week and had a message from her provider saying she’d breached her broadband allowance. She immediately accused me of hopping onto her WiFi. Now, because we spent a lot of time in each other’s flats, we did have each other’s passwords for a while but over time they’ve been updated etc. So I am openly saying that yes, I *used* to have her password, but not any more. I know for a fact that I’m not using her router — I have a smart home and I’m self employed and based at home so need a lot of bandwidth. The signal through the walls is weak as well, because it’s an old converted Manor House and the walls between flats are poured concrete (this is in the U.K.), so reception is sketchy between flats— we had passwords so that we could just pop onto a better signal when we were at each other’s places for what’s app messages etc, no biggie. 
The point is, my WiFi is much stronger and faster in my home and I have no reason to have used her WiFi at all this week. Further, I don’t have the password any more (due to aforementioned upgrades/changes etc), *and* I was out for most of the week because an old uni friend I hadn’t seen in 20 years was in town, so we were out a lot. So I was fairly confused when she came after me for this. As an aside, she gave the neighbour between us (flat 2) the password, though she’s now saying that she didn’t. (I witnessed it, she did)
After having a go at me, and everything escalating, and me saying repeatedly ‘I’ve not been on your WiFi: I have my own WiFi: I’ve not even been in much this week’, she lets it slip that she unplugged her WiFi whilst she was away. 

She’s 63 and low-level tech capable, like she can get onto WiFi but not change a ringtone, that kind of level. But it’s pretty elementary that an electrical device like a router needs to be plugged in to work; she won’t believe me and keeps calling me a liar. I don’t know if it was actually plugged in and someone hopped on, or whether it was unplugged and something happened, all I know is that it had nothing to do with me. 

This isn’t the first time she’s flown off the handle utterly irrationally (she once asked me to drive her to the cats protection league with a stray she found then when we got there screamed at me that I wanted to euthanise the cat. It was so bad that she was screaming at me from down the road and the staff asked if I wanted them to call the police and whether I felt safe getting into a car with her to drive home. I ended up taking flowers in to them the following week because they shouldn’t need to be exposed to that crap). I’d say this is at least the 4th or 5th time she’s done something like this but I’ve always allowed the bridge to be mended because we live so close together. 

This time, she went on a full character assassination, saying how I can’t handle stress (I am a depressive, medicated and completely levelled out and have been for years, though I am going through a stressful period with my physical health) and that I only keep people around me when I can get something from them, and that I’m a liar.  She also said that a neighbour had said that when she was in hospital a few years ago I’d told him that ‘I couldn’t handle her ‘— I checked and he confirmed that this is untrue, and I’m inclined to believe him based on past experience with this woman; I’ve caught her in lies before, which I’ve just always blamed on her being a bit scatty, though now I’m thinking it’s just spite, maybe. 

So; I know I’m not in the wrong, I definitely wasn’t on her WiFi (yes, I double checked all devices and connections), and if it was unplugged, I couldn’t be anyway— is it worth biting my tongue yet again for the sake of avoiding hostility in the building ( we live a matter of feet apart), or do I just shag this off even if she apologises? I’m often too forgiving because I think there’s always an underlying issue— understand the root, you understand the flower and all that— but it feels like this is just a bridge too far, the personal attack was too huge this time from someone who, 4 days ago, was fine with me.  Is it time to cut the cord, for keeps?",29Apr2019,1

However,

Facebook— nothing
Google—nothing
Classmates— yes ,  picture
Public Tax record—I find an address from that name, but it’s not current occupants
Data verified- exact name and possible age but different city and state from origin high school

After these minor surface digging I’m stuck, but I’m curious to know more and possibly seek a current picture or maybe even met in the future.

Has anyone gone down this path?

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

386,"I work in the Marketing department at a small/medium sized business. Naturally we have a pretty small department - it’s just me, my colleague (we’ll call her Becky)  and our manager (we’ll call her Jane)

Becky and I both work full-time, however Jane can only work part time as she has two children, one of which is disabled. This means that throughout the week it is often just me and Becky, and while we use a management productivity platform to prioritise, keep organised and stay updated, and we also talk in a WhatsApp group about work, it’s not the same as having a manager in full time.

We’re all really close, like a little family, and on a personal level we really get on well, however lately Becky and I have felt very demotivated due to Jane not being around (we never look forward to coming into work, and feel like we have no drive). Last week I saw her for 15 minutes! 

When Jane is in for the full time she’s supposed to be (9:30 - 2), we’re all super motivated and do loads of work and love the job. When she’s not here when she’s supposed to be it feels the exact opposite. I understand it’s not her fault - she struggles as a single mum with child care - but I think it is affecting my career and day-to-day life and it’s getting to the point where I need to speak to her about it. 

It’s a hard situation because we all get on really well, but I feel like we need a full time manager or else we (and probably future employees) won’t stay in the job. But if Becky and I left then there wouldn’t be a marketing department, and it would undercut all the work we have done to build one. 

How can I bring this up in my 121 meeting with her? Should I let her know how I feel about a different manager (and risk humiliating and hurting her)?

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend and I have been dating 5.5 years and really get along well. We have spoken a lot about getting engaged recently, (mainly she has), but I somehow feel my age is too young to do so.

To explain, I really love her and we get along very well. I can't imagine myself being with anyone else, (and I know she feels the same), however, when the talk of getting engaged comes up, the only thing preventing me from committing, is the fact that I'm 24. I don't feel like I'll be with anyone else per ce, but also feel my age is slightly young for this. My parents were 28 when they got married, so maybe that is why. That said, she is 26 and of good age to get engaged in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Is 24 too young to get engaged? I would be ready if I were maybe a year or two older, but who knows....maybe in a year or two I'll still not feel \*ready\* per ce. Maybe I'm just scared? I don't know.

A bit of background if it makes any difference. I have known her for about 2 years prior to moving in. We are not in any sort of relationship other then friends and I'd like to keep it there. She is very overweight (not trying to fat shame but unsure if that could be a contributing factor) She tends to shower only every 3-4 days.  


Any help would be greatly appreciated I have tried purchasing scented candles and air fresheners but they only due so much.",29Apr2019,1
398,"Hey everyone hope your having a good day. I'm in need for a range if advice as I have a situation bugging me the past days. I've liked this girl for about 2 months now and shes in year 12 as I am in year 11 and we catch the same bus and live in the same area. Shes not popular or anything but seems heaps quite on the bus and I sit with my mate and chat away. We've only talked once as I served her at my local supermarket at the registers.  We've have caught the bus for a few years but have never had a long conversation. She recently added me on snapchat but we've never texted etc. I haven't messaged her or anything as she doesn't talk to anyone and it'll seem very suspicious if I randomly start talking to her out of nowhere and dont want to risk her getting suspicious especially when we catch the afternoon bus almost every day and dont wanna make things heaps awkward.
I'm not scared to taking to girls as I have many friends that are female and have dated a few but I just dont know a right approach to her.
I like this girl and she seems very quite and keeps to herself. I'm in need of some advice from you people to what I can do to start a conversation or something. Like what are some approaches I can do so it won't seem like I just wanna smash cause I think if it goes well I can potentially date her.

402,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice. I currently have a Bachelor degree in Computer Science with 2 years of Marketing under my belt and 2 years of IT System Administration. I am miserable in my position and looking for a completely new career change. I currently live in the Chicago suburbs but I am not opposed to moving either, in fact I welcome it.

I am an extremely creative person. I enjoy writing, playing piano, guitar, painting etc. I have always been obsessed with music and the entertainment industry and think I would be great at scouting out new talent. I'm not particular in which position I want but I know I would like to be able to come to the table with new ideas and be immersed in projects. I also wouldn't mind something where I could contribute writing content, but I'm not sure what position that would even be. I don't know how to go about any of this since I have no experience. Should I be looking at A&amp;R positions?

&amp;#x200B;

My issue here is money. I need to be taking a position that would pay no less than $55k a year and that's bare minimum. Which seems unrealistic for an entry level in the music industry. Should I be looking for part time A&amp;R positions and then attempt to work a full time IT job with more flexible hours? I was thinking something I would be able to remote in from. What would you do in this situation? It's just me on my own and I don't have financial help.

405,"Honestly, I know this is one of the stupidest things a person could post for on here in comparison to what other people are posting about but I need to talk about this. I have been waiting for the movie for years, even before infinity war because I knew it would be the end to the saga. Naturally after infinity war the hype built up even more and after a point when the movie was only a week away I stumbled upon the Marvel Studios Spoilers sub that had a bunch of spoilers for the movie. It all started there. I read those spoilers (based off leaked footage) and already knew that the movie was going to be great which basically planted a bug into me that made me want to know more. So I started visiting the sub daily, wanting more and eventually after the premiere of the movie and around 15 hours before my show the complete summary for the movie was posted and how much ever I hesitated I gave in and read it. I watched the movie two times in the same day and loved it, it was glorious. But obviously since I read the summary I already knew what was coming. 6 days later and the fact that I spoiled the movie for myself has been slowly eating away at me, more and more everyday while I see people online still avoiding spoilers and posting reactions to scenes they had seen first hand. Obviously I didn't get the full force of those scenes since I kinda knew they were coming and it's bothering me. What do I do to deal with this feeling? I know it may go in sometime but I just need a more positive way to look at this situation and deal with it..",29Apr2019,1

All of them are lazy, they don't study or do anything. I do all the group exercises and presentations alone.

Lately I like a girl in the group, we flirt, I have confessed but she ignored me. then she has bf.

407,"Okay, I am not sure where to post this but maybe asking other parents or people who reside in a profession similar to this could help on how I should or maybe should not bring this up to the parents I nanny/babysit for could be helpful. 

I babysit two kids from my church during the school year and I also used to nanny for them for the past two summers. Now normally I used to love babysitting for these kids and it was honestly the highlight of my week, but lately, I am extremely worried for the oldest kid I babysit for. Now, this boy and sister are both incredibly smart, by age two he was already speaking at the level of a four-year-old and now as a four-year-old himself you would think you're talking to a 7-year-old. I have been taking care of him since he was one and he's always been a demanding kid and when he wants something he used to throw awful and I mean BAD tantrums to get what he wanted. Yet lately he's changed how he wants something.

  As I mentioned he has a little sister and shes two years younger than him. She's also very advanced for her age but she is still pretty normal and just an absolute joy too be around. I normally let them watch a movie when I go over and babysit because their parents let me and it's the only time of the week their parents let them watch t.v. Now I used to let the boy pick out the movie all the time because his sister was too little to tell me what she wanted. Now that she has an advanced vocabulary I started to give her the option to pick the movie and this has made her brother go off. When it's her turn to pick the movie he will begin to say that every movie she picks is too ""scary"" for him. Even if it's a movie we have already watched together and a movie he has picked out before he still starts crying saying it's ""scary"". When I play the movie he starts crying saying ""scary"" and will scream and act scared until I change the movie to another movie he wants. Funny enough he will pick a movie his sister tried to pick earlier but said it was too ""scary"" so we didn't watch it. Once I gave him control to pick the movie he was just fine watching that movie. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the only instance he has done this to replace the movie with food and he will say that food his sister picked makes him sick and want to throw up. Yet, once I give control to pick food he is fine with picking a food his sister had already picked out. With board games, if sister picks one out he will say it's too hard and when he picks the exact same game he is fine. The interesting thing is that he will tell his sister that she also finds the movies she picks scary. The Food she picks will also make her sick and the board games she picks as hard for her too. If she doesn't agree he starts to get extremely aggressive and starts to push and hit her and this is where I get really scared and have to draw the line. This really confuses his sister and I am at a lost here because he will manipulate his sister into thinking the same things too.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently studying child psychology and my fire alarms are going off because he is showing signs of manipulation so young. Now I want to say this is a phase and he will grow out of it, yet I have noticed his mom has a bunch of books on ""how to handle your hard child"", etc. I want to bring up my experience with her son and the potential idea of taking her son to maybe seeing a child psychologist/therapist. I really do care about her kids and their family as a whole but I don't want to offend them or come across as I am trying to tell her how to raise her kids but I do want what is best.

I work in the entertainment business. I am a table games dealer for a local casino. I deal everything from Blackjack to Hold’em Poker to Midi Baccarat. The only games I don’t have in our house are Craps and Pai Gow Tiles, so I’m doing fairly well. I deal most of my games decently, my strongest games are the 3 listed.  

I am probably one of the most socially awkward people you could ever meet. I don’t interact with other people very well. I don’t know how to maintain small talk or create meaningful conversations, with anyone really. Both patrons and co-workers. It’s not that I don’t want to interact with others it’s just I don’t know how to do so properly and I don’t want to gain a poor reputation for speaking out of order or saying the wrong thing. 

There’s been times that I’ve had good conversations with customers before, I’m not saying I’ve never connected with a patron. I just want to do it more. My spouse is also a dealer at the same house and he’s just so much more entertaining. He just doesn’t care and it’s fun. He’s fun to be around. He’s a great dealer. 

Texas Hold’em Poker has really help me I feel. It’s definitely a step in the right direction for me. I connect to a larger percent of the clientele that play that game so I’m able to talk easier with them but I’m still awkward. 

I don’t know how to just let go and have fun. And be entertaining. I want to be able to make my table laugh and enjoy their time at the casino. 

The house I currently work for is amazing and I have fallen in love with this career path. I intend to stay in this business for the rest of my life. I want to become the best dealer I can and then eventually supervisor and onward. 

Ultimately this doesn’t just impact my career but my regular life as well. My awkwardness knows no bounds. A co-worker of mine has invited me to beers and I’m terrified because of my incapability to talk about anything. I kill literally every conversation. I’m so scared I’d say the wrong thing.

412,"Obligatory background paragraph for those not in the know: After spending five years in college to get a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice, I failed to get a job in that field due to: 1. Not enough references, and 2. Not being physically fit enough. Ergo, after struggling for two years with anxiety and (possibly) depression, I finally landed a job thanks to a job prep program. However, that's when the real troubles began. My first manager was a bitch who kept demanding that I pick up the pace. Even after this manager left during my first year, I still struggled with anxiety and stress. I even tried applying to other places, without success. In 2017, things got so bad that I ended up calling the suicide hotline three times. I tried calling a fourth time a year later, but they booted me off before I could be connected to an operator, forcing me to suffer in silence that night.

Fast-forward to the present year: Recently, I decided that I hated my job so much that I came up with a plan: I'm going to apply for a part-time job, quit the one I have and go back to college to study computer science. I've been in love with computers ever since the early 90s, and I can still remember reading a *Windows For Dummies* book even before I entered first grade. The way I see it, I'm such a natural at computers that I figure I can make a good living working with them. Only one obstacle stands in my way: money. To be precise, I still have student loans to pay off, and I have to worry about health insurance. I know I can apply for an educational deferment, and I know that my state offers two years of free community college. However, after looking it up, it appears that those two free years are only available to people who have just graduated high school.

Keeping all of this in mind, I ask you: should I go through with my plan of getting a part-time job, quitting my unsatisfying minimum wage corporate job and studying computer science? If not, I'm open to alternatives because quite frankly, the idea of hurting myself or - God forbid - others just because of job dissatisfaction is appalling to me.",29Apr2019,0

Dad's been a smoker since forever, our parents aren't very strict but I've no idea how they'd react.
I've never drank or smoked, he's apparently started for whatever reason; I think it might be to fit in (he's the more 'popular' of the two of us) but I've no idea, I did throw a couple insults his way (Kinda serious kinda jokingly, sibling relations you know how it is) and he told me it was just his group of friends. I said I was just disappointed and he said he was too. He says he's started recently but I've been hearing rumors since like summer last year.


Should I tell our parents? He's not a *bad* guy per say, just apparently went a bit off road, and I keep secrets like all hell and am ready to do the same thing for him, but is it the right thing to do?


He's the type of person to try and fit in with the others, popular phone, popular shoes, whatever; but I feel like it'll bounce quite hard against his head when he gets to a later point in life and it fucks him over.

417,"Obligatory throwaway account.

I've always felt like I am a pretty good person. However, I would not say I'm the most attractive. Regardless, I decided to put myself out there on Tinder and Bumble and just see what happens (as a side note, I've never been in a relationship or anything). Because I'm not the best looking, I haven't gotten too many matches, and literally 1 could have led to something but I really just wasn't interested... that is, until the other day.

&amp;#x200B;

On Bumble, this cute girl (I'd say a solid 8) messaged me saying that my pic is cute, to which I responded that she meant my dog. She didn't message me back until the next day and says that she'd love to meet me (Cue red flag #1, which could just be because of my insecurity). I say that'd be nice and ask when she'd want to meet me. She messaged me back (after a day) saying we should get to know each other first and her number, which happens to be a number that is on the other side of the country from where I live (Cue red flags #2 and #3). Keep in mind that we've exchanged like 5 messages over the course of two days at this point. I haven't done anything yet besides just google the number to see what came up, because I'm just paranoid about this. I checked her account, and all of the pictures (about 20 or so) are definitely of the same girl (she has a more pronounced collarbone, and in the pictures that it is visible, it's definitely the same) but her account hasn't been verified, which just makes me suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want this to be real, and I hope it's a chance for me to make something interesting happen in my life for once, but I just don't trust it. Every time that I've started to get happy, something bad has happened that's forced me to humility, and it is almost like I don't allow myself to be happy because of that.

423,"So this is a long and sort of complicated story. Also didnt know if I should put this in r/sex or here.

Last summer one of my roommates (let's call him Billy) started hanging out with this girl (let's call her Kelly). At the time Kelly was about 3 or 4 months pregnant and the baby daddy lives in another state. After a while Billy and Kelly become FWB and everything seems good. Kelly ends up having her kid, and decides that she will have to eventually move back closer to the baby daddy so he can see his kid and help support it. Billy eventually ends up getting feelings for her even though he knows it wont work out, and Kelly keeps telling him they need to be just FWB and nothing more.

Now about a week ago I broke up with my GF and gave everyone the news. Turns out Kelly is also planning on moving back in a couple weeks. Friday morning Billy started asking me about having a 3some with Kelly, and that it was her idea but he was fine with it. I knew he had feelings for her but figured if he was asking me then he must be fine with it. I agree to the 3some and we plan on doing it that night. That night comes around and we have the 3some but both of us had anxiety or something and it doesnt quite work out like we planned so we just laugh it off and move on. 

Yesterday Kelly asks me if I wanted to try again next weekend and I said yes. We start talking about all the details and the she tells me Billy wont be joining us. I was a little confused so I texted Billy asking him if he knew about this and if it was fine to him. Billy says that at this point he doesnt care anymore, which isnt a very straightforward answer to me.

Some of my friends have told me that since they were never a thing, and never will be since she is moving that he shouldnt have feelings for her or should move on from them. The only way I could think of doing it is if I did it without him knowing, and that just makes it feel even more wrong. What should I do?

Well, I met a friend at a coffee shop on Friday morning, and I haven't seen this friend in 7-8 months. Well, creepy guy was there at a prayer group/devo type of thing with his son, a few other kids from the youth group, and the youth minister. Kinda weird that he and the youth minister were the only adults with half a dozen 13yo boys, but not too weird. Well, as soon as I walked in, creepy guy kept staring at me; I noticed it and my friend noticed it, too.

I've talked to 2 people who have worked with him and they've both said that he just doesn't seem to understand bound and what's appropriate behavior and what's not.

I know I may be a little bit too sensitive, but I've gone through enough people trying to hurt me and enough creeps trying their hardest to be inappropriate with me that I will not allow that to happen any more. This guy has acted quite predatory towards me and it just doesn't make me feel safe. He has literally almost chased me into a gas station before. I don't know if I wasn't being clear enough for him, but after 3 months of me not responding to his texts at all, and trying to get away from him when he tried his bullshit at the gas station, he still got a little bit upset/frustrated when I blocked him on Facebook (he tried adding me as a friend) and texted him asking him to leave me alone.

427,"I’m trying to decide between two apartments to lease, and I’m having an extremely difficult time! Let me tell you details and maybe you’ll have some feedback?

First off, both of these buildings are on the same street, a block away from each other. So distance to work is no different. Apartment 1 is $30/month cheaper, so not significant, but I’d be 17th in line in the wait for a parking spot in the lot. Apartment 2 is $30 more but I’d be 2nd on the wait list for the parking lot.

Apartment 1 - in a bit of a funny old brownstone (I love brownstones!). The windows are tall and narrow. It’s a classic old brownstone, so inside there are nice built-ins with dark wood, and this particular apartment has a ton of storage. There is a huge closet in living room, a walk-in closet across from the bedroom (the bedroom itself doesn’t have a closet). The bathroom is tiny, but there is a claw foot tub (a plus) and it’s connected to it is a long “dressing area” with a window at the end. The bedroom has a window. The kitchen is old, and very narrow and long (I don’t spend a lot of time in the kitchen so its fine). The living room is large and bare, and a separate room. Think...walking in the front door into the “dining room”. The entrance to the kitchen is straight ahead, and the bedroom door is the left of that. To the right of the front door is a large built-in cupboard, and moving forward and to the right, you walk into the living room. 

Positives:
• Lots of storage (I don’t have tons of “things” but I am a girl and I do have quite a lot of clothing”).
• claw foot tub
• built-in cupboards that I find charming.

Negatives:
• a more closed layout than what I prefer
• uninspiring space
• dark built-ins seem to make the space feel darker. 

Apartment 2 - located on the first floor of a historic row house (one that I’ve loved since moving to the city in a middle section (so no windows on the sides, only on the back of the apartment and the front. It’s an unusual shape, with the front door opening to a large living room, with white walls, large front windows, a fireplace, and lots of room. There is a funny little pseudo “room” that separates the living room from the dining room. This space is tiny (would fit my full-size bed and that’s about it) and has a large pocket door that opens to the living room. The other entry to the room faces the little hall that leads to the dining room, and there is a large, highly-places cutaway “window” to the dining room. The dining room is spacious, with a floor-to-ceiling built-in bookcase (which I love) and a large window. To the left, there is a doorway that leads to a large open kitchen, with lots of cupboards and space. From there, the back door leads down stairs to the parking lot. There are two narrow closets in the dining room with shelves that were formerly dumbwaiters. There is another closet next to the bathroom that is small and low, with a rack for hanging clothing. And that’s it, as far as storage goes. 

Positives:
• an inspiring space, large and bright
• a fireplace
• a lot of charm, with the floor-to-ceiling bookcase (a dream to a reader like myself), and touches like the dumbwaiter-turned-closet
• having a back door as well as a front door
• large kitchen (could store cleaning supplies there)

Negatives:
• very, very little storage. The most that I have are clothing and there is very little hanging space. 
• no defined “bedroom” space - the current tenants use the dining room as the bedroom, while the manager who showed the apartment to me said that usually the living room is used as the bedroom. Currently, the funny little room that I’d use as a bedroom is an art space. The living room is huge, so I thought I’d put my double-sized bed into the funny little room and could keep the pocket door open much of the time.
• no claw foot tub

So. I’m in a conundrum. I love Apartment 2 for its charm and history and the inspiring space. It feels good to be in there. The layout is unusual, but I think that adds to the romance of it. The only reason I’m holding back is that there is little storage for clothes. Apartment 1 is less inspiring and I like it less, although the storage wouldn’t be a problem and it would likely be and “easier” space to live in (a defined bedroom).

So. Romance or practicality?? Which would you pick? The romantic side of me says Apartment 2, but the rational side of me is screaming that I should be practical. I just want to do the smart thing.",29Apr2019,1

432,"My parents have been strict my whole life. My pyjama parties in school weren't fun because of that but I was used to it. We were very close, I told them everything and I spent much time with them. I am currently going to university and because of high rents I still live with them. A year ago I met my boyfriend and I changed since then. He also lives at his parents place, but they aren't nearly as strict as mine. We spent most of our time together at his place and now that I know a ""free"" life I can't cope with my stuff at home.
Here are a few examples:
On weekends I am not allowed to get up before them. 
I had to fight for taking a pee at night and being allowed to stay up later than them. If I now want to stay up later I have to stay in my room but mustn't speak.
I am not allowed to cook or bake.
I am not allowed to change simple things in my room.
They come in my room when they want even if I don't want that, on weekends they open my door to wake me up.

If I don't do as they want they get angry, shout at me and there are endless discussions. In between, sometimes they are nice to me and help me with things, say they love me etc. If I ""behave"" this can go on for a longer time. But then some stupid thing comes up and another fight emerges. They are unpredictable. I told them I will find an apartment for me so we don't have to live together anymore, but money is tight so there aren't many options and I'm currently searching. Currently I am staying at my boyfriends home, I left when they started a fight again and got really respectless. Now I don't know how to proceed. I have to go to my parents place soon because I need clothes but I don't want to life there anymore. I don't feel secure in my room and I hope that the relationship with my parents gets better when I don't live with them anymore. My boyfriends parents told me I could stay at their home as long as I wanted and they help me with finding a place for me. 
I would also like this better. I don't know what to tell my parents when I get my clothes at home. I don't want them to hate everyone involved, and they also got much of my money. 
Should I lie to them and play as everything was okay again, then say that I will just stay with BF and don't tell them for how long? Or should I tell them the truth? Or is there another possibility?",29Apr2019,2
433,"I've been having issues this year, again. Last year a psychologist helped me a lot but now I'm scared of going to her again, mainly cause my current issues are caused by me.

435,"Cross-posting this from r/JustNoSO...I really need advice.

First some background.

My SO is normally great, however, one thing he does more than anyone else I've known is ""change his mind"" about things. Usually that wouldn't bother me much, it happens. But it seems like recently almost anything he says, he'll later change his mind and do the direct opposite. An example was yesterday, he normally drives us everywhere (I don't know why, I guess he just prefers it to me driving), but he promised to let me drive all day. It wasn't a lot of driving, maybe an hour and fifteen minutes round trip, and I had offered to drive his car because he's told me before that he feels more comfortable in his car than mine. He agreed and off we went. Well halfway back home we had to stop by his work and he looks over to me and tells me I'm not allowed to drive anymore today because I had scared him earlier. I had parked backwards into my grandmother's driveway using his backup camera, and I parked closer to their yard than the middle of the parking spot. My grandfather's truck was in the other side of the drive way and if I had parked in the middle of the spot, someones' car would have taken a hit from the other's door (I know this from experience). Well apparently parking so close to the yard made me close to their rosebushes and in turn, the corner of their house. I was eight inches away from the rosebushes and seventeen inches from the corner of the house. That apparently scared him so I wasn't allowed to drive us home after we got to his work. When I reminded him that he promised I could, he got angry and said he had changed his mind. I tried to let it go because it was his car but it's always small things like that. Promising I/we can do something, and when we get into an argument because he refuses to go or complains about letting me go, in the middle of the argument he'll yell out that he changed his mind and that should be the end of it.

Well this morning we got into another fight. He told me to wake him up at 7:30am, if he sleeps in then he won't get up for another half hour. (If he wakes up at 7:30am and takes a thirty minute shower, he will be ready to leave the house by 8:30am, which means he'll get to work just before 9:00am. If he gets up at 8:00am he will be late and he's been late way too often recently because he stays up late and wakes up at 8:00am.) So this morning, 7:30am rolls around and I tell him to get up. He says that he wants to wake up at 8:00am and rolls back over. I tell him no, you said 7:30am and pull the covers off of him. He starts to get mad but I'm still trying to get him up. Finally I push his legs off the bed and he gets up. He starts screaming at me saying that he had changed his mind and that I should have let him sleep in. I yelled right back that he changes his mind to much and that he told me 7:30am and that's when I was going to get him up. He yelled back saying that I change my mind all the time and his example was that I said I would pay off my defensive driving as soon as I got my speeding ticket but I hadn't. That I clearly should have been able to and that I didn't even try because I thought it was originally one price but recently they had lowered it. That set me off. I told him to get in the shower and that I was done with his shit for this morning.

I left while he was in the shower and got to work an hour early. His comments about my financial situation really upset me. Yes I had said I wanted to pay it off and be done with it, but I didn't have the money at the time... I have been living paycheck to paycheck for my last five paychecks because what extra money I should have left over goes to extra groceries for him and going out to eat because he doesn't want to eat in. He never pays for groceries, and rarely pays for his snacks or eating out, but I know it's not just all on him. It's my fault too because I can't say no to him... But it really just hurt to have him throw that in my face. He tried calling me but I sent him to voicemail and sent him a text that read ""Going after my financial situation like you did was a low blow. Especially because half of the reason it was there was because of you. You will not hear from me nor will you see me until you give an apology that I feel is truthful when I am ready for that apology. You have hurt me today SO. Badly. And I'm not standing for it. Be safe today."" I have not gotten a reply and now I'm worried that I just over-reacted... I'm open to any advice.",29Apr2019,1

So here’s the story...
Now 27, I worked for 5 years at one of the largest sales companies in America and did very well for myself. I won trips across country, lived in penthouses, and made a good amount of money. But I was young and dumb and really only saved money in 401k and bought a nice house. The house is becoming to much a stress with the payment of 1800 And I have about 10k in total other than house. I grew up Poor and didn’t know how to handle money but was always happier with less. I’m at crossroads of just wanting sell my house take out some money from my 401k which totals 60k. Pay off my debts and travel the world for a bit. 
A lot has gone it to this. Ive been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few years. A lot of was through work. After 5 years in that same role, they cut that position and made me go back to a position working 80 hours after being able to work from home. After about 3 months of that I had to take a medical leave because my mental health got to the point of me wanting to just hurt myself everyday. This was after having to go the er last year And I am about to return from the leave May 1 and the feelings are coming back and it scares me. My goal was always to retire early but I want to enjoy life. I don’t know if selling the house and taking money out of my 401k to travel the world, pay off all debts  and then come back to pursue a career in golf makes sense or if it’s just me running from my issues. Just didn’t know if people have made this leap before. How to adjust from making a 100k a year to 15 a hour. Will that be more. There’s so many options and I don’t want to make the wrong decision. 

Thank you for your help in advance. Sorry about the jumbled thoughts. 

Summary: worked 80 hours a week for 5 years. Starting to hate job and life as result. Money was my only goal and know doesn’t seem as important. Don’t know if I should try and just figure a way to make it work or just sell everything travel and hope it works out",29Apr2019,1

We use protection every single time. 

We're very open with eachother and I have never felt like I had a reason not to trust him until now. I was on his phone (not snooping) and clicked on his Facebook messenger. I saw some unopened messages. I see the name and instantly recognize it. The girl he had the one night stand with. I keep scrolling and begin to realize that they are talking about their child.

Now, as I get some results, my friend and family started asking me topics about personal finance and business, and I love to help because I believe I am actually learning when helping, also I feel happy when someone needed my help.

For example one of my friend I've been telling him that he should start saving and invest in some funds, but till today he still spend on meaningless shit, have almost no savings in his bank account, and borrow money from me that I later found out he spend on materialistic stuff again.

So seeing where this was going i immidietaly asked her if we know each other from uni, to which she replied no, making me creeped out and confused even more. After a few weird messages back and forth i told her that i'm not looking for new friends since i can barerly find time for my existing ones and I'm especially not looking for a relationship since i made a promise to myself that I won't get into any relationship ever after i found out in high school that I'm mentally ill, which btw. is completly true(6th year this year) to which she didn't reply anything. Fast forward to yesterday and she is starting to write to me that she loves me and so on even though we have never talked in person. I didn't reply or blocked her yet because of 2 factors:

&amp;#x200B;

\-She is more crazy than i am and thats something. As much as a part of me would want to tell her to back off, never write to me again i know what crazy people are capable of(since i'm not the only one in the family) and i don't want to deal with something nasty when i least suspect it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-My looks are a strong 3/10, maybe even 4, and this poor girl is the ugliest woman i ever laid my eyes on even though it was only a photo on facebook, strong -10/10. I can only imagine what she must feel being less feminine than her brother and how everybody looks down on her because of how she was punished in genetic lottery. I know what rejection feels like very well and i wouldn't wish her that.

&amp;#x200B;

So i need to take a diplomatic aproach to this but hard enough so she doesn't write me anymore, and since i didn't have to reject anybody yet(i was only on the other side) I'm having a brain grinder on how to do this right. Should i just straight up tell her to back off, or try to explain to her that that's not how relationships work and i have to take into account that she is crazy as well so nobody knows what she is thinking.

So in the tenancy agreement it states that we are responsible for paying all  bills relating to the house. (this is important for later)

Now i am in charge of the actual process of paying the bills. I pay them each month on time.

One of my house mates in particularly irked by this (this is my house mate who loves to argue with everyone over everything) is demanding i pay 1/5 of the bill, despite using 0 gas or electric in over 5 weeks.

455," 

I  have a masters degree in computer engineering (not to be confused with  computer science) and a bachelors degree in electrical engineering.  Growing up I was always told it is a good field and one of the more  higher paying fields to be in and I enjoy what I do. I also went to  school with a lot of smart people, almost all of whom have very quickly  surpassed me career wise.

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

Student  A: Graduated at the same time with our bachelors: He's now a Vice  President/Senior Software Analyst at a bank. He's 1 month younger than  me. Just bought a nice house and is engaged.

Student  B: Graduated 2 years ahead of me: He ended up at Facebook doing  software and is now head of software development at a startup in CA,  making over 4x my salary, with better benefits. Just got engaged.

Student  C: 2 Graduated 2 years after me and instantly got a job at google  making double my salary with better benefits. Just got accepted to MIT  and is quitting to go do his master's in Computer Science at MIT.  (Chances are he'll get hired back to Google, making 1.5-2x what he made,  but who knows).

&amp;#x200B;

I can easily add another 2-3 accounts of friends with similar success like the above.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile,  I graduated, got a shit first job as an engineer at a shit company in  Connecticut, making just over $30/hr with shitty benefits, no bonus or  stock and minimum raise (1-1.5%). I quit after 1.5 years and went back  for my masters in computer engineering in hopes of 1) opening up  possibility for more job opportunities, 2) higher salary, 3) alot of  jobs would like a masters in engineering. I did that in 3 semesters,  worked my ass off, got a really good gpa. Felt good about myself and my  path.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward  to today: I've been at this job for almost 2 years. I make roughly  $32/hr. I have better benefits, i.e. stock and bonus. The company  overall is much better. The people are nice. The work has been mostly  uninteresting due to the nature of it at times, but still I've learned  and grown.... But I rent a room from my sister. I'm not engaged, shit I  dont even have a gf (not that it matters honeslty cuz I dont have the  time). My salary isnt much better. My life hasnt changed much. Typing  this out, I realize that I've made *some* progress, but comparatively? Its almost like i've gone nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  debating my life choices. Should I have even gone into computer  engineering because the pay doesnt seem to be that great? Should I have  even bothered getting my master's degree because the end result was just  barely more compensation? Should I have moved states (currently in NY,  but i think I would've been much more successful in CA due to the  massive amount of tech companies out there). Should I have gone and  tried to work in technical side of finance like some of my friends  (finance is one of if not the biggest job markets in NYC and pays very  very handsomely)? Should I quit and go do a bootcamp to become a  software engineer? **Am I smart enough? Am I GOOD enough?** I'm not sure anymore and i can feel it mentally weighing on me.

&amp;#x200B;

I  dont want to accept that this is it. I dont want to accept that I'm  going to have a mediocre life and career. I want to enjoy my life while  I'm still young, not when I retire in my 60s.

456,"I live in a house with 5 rooms. We had an empty room after one of our housemates moved out a couple of weeks ago. The agency doesn't tell us when someone new moves in.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago one of my housemates got home at around 3am and noticed the light on the empty room was on. A different housemate got home at 5am and saw the light on as well. The next night they checked again and it was still on. But  no one has seen anyone new, or heard this new housemate leave the room to use the bathroom or the kitchen (the house has thin walls so we always hear the toilet flushing or the microwave going offf). 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night two housemates knocked on the door to see if anyone was there but there was no reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today a housemate and I tried knocking again. We were curious if there as anyone there of if someone had left the lights on or just to check if the new person was alright.  There was no reply. I tried openning the door but it was locked. We didn't hear anything inside.

&amp;#x200B;

My housemate is worried that this person might have hurt themselves and thats why the light is still on, doors locked, and there is no movement. There used to be no lock in that room (as with all the other rooms in the house) but now its locked/blocked.

457,"Each year I try to take a 1-2 week adventure to another part of the world. And each year, when I get back to work, I find myself in conversations where coworkers genuinely want to hear about the trip. 

The problem is that I tell the stories of the trip over and over and over again, to the point where I hear myself become incredibly bored with them and I never want to think about the trip again. I want to save my excitement in retelling stories for my friends and family.

I’ve tried waiting until everyone is in a large group, but that’s hard to manage. I’ve also tried telling a single story to each person, but there are always follow up questions about the other parts.

My next idea is to keep it vague and be honest with people about my feelings. Tell a few stories, but then cut it off when I don’t want to talk anymore.

464,"Our break up was incredibly messy. I would have done pretty much anything to get her back after she left me for someone else (within a month of being gone for school).
 I had no confidence at the time, and it took me about 8 months to realize that despite the fact she would say sweet things that were wildly promising, I was nothing more than a back up plan. 
Eventually, this lead to her coming home and kissing me only to tell me she knew it would help her get over me and that I should move on. 

There were plenty of times when I told her ""hey, what you're doing is hurting me"" and she admitted so the fact that she knew it hurt me, which of course made me wonder a lot about what my value was in her eyes. 

The morning after we kissed, I felt disgusting about myself and a little bit violated. I started recounting other things said throughout the 8 months, and there were times when she'd say really rude and offensive things that I didnt even catch in the moment. 

I'll admit, I should have just walked away when she left me, but when you're an idiot in love you do stupid things. 

With all this stated, I have had her blocked for about 2 months now. I miss her a lot sometimes, but I've been working really hard to get things turned around and the more confident I become in myself and in my new relationship (I know that sounds quick, but the truth is I've been single for 9-10 months)  and the more I actually disassociate from that time, the more distant it all feels. 

I still suffer a lot from my own action of blocking and understanding that I may have potentially destroyed our entire relationship and hurt her, but I also understand the way that I felt at the time and had to do what I had to do. 

I blocked her without warning, and about 2 days after I heard from a mutual friend that she was back with her SO (who i was told was not going back to her school) but that she still wanted to be with me. 

It frustrated me so much, hurt me more than anything and the worst part is that even though I had her blocked the call logs were showing that was she was calling multiple times a day on a daily basis.

She emailed me the first week of the block and told me she had messaged me on fb, and she was demanding an explanation. 

I told her not to contact me at the time, and that's all I wrote. 

Not too long ago, her birthday rolled in and I did not reach out at all despite the fact that I wanted to. She called me first thing in the morning that day (as recorded on call logs) and then another call came in about a week ago. 

She comes home in may for the summer and we live very close to one another. I work about 10 mins from her town and have to pass her street twice a day M-F. We also met at a local shop in that town that I love popping into and hanging out with the friends I still have there, but I feel like that would be a huge risk of running into them.. 

I dont want to sacrafice my schedule to just avoiding them constantly, but I cant imagine the reaction of seeing them again after everything to be even remotely healthy or beneficial to my progress. 


I guess my questions are this: 

Why is she still calling, and what do I do about it? 

I feel like if I unblock her and call just her to give her an explanation as to why i left it would hurt like hell and be really stupid. Why would I call someone just to tell them to stop calling, esp after I've already stated I dont want to be in contact at this time. 

If she says she still wants to be with me, why did she go back to her SO so quickly and tell me to move on? 

Also, what do I do if I run into them as the likeliness of it happening is like 70-80% judging by proximity? 

And lastly, what on earth do I do to stop letting all of this hurt me anymore than it already has?",29Apr2019,1
465,"**I met this girl, let's call her** ***Lily*****, about two years ago**. I am a man, 27 years old and she is 23. When I met her she was recovering from anorexia, and she was a mess. But I saw something in her and I am proud to say I was a big part in her healing process. Now she's fully healthy. 

About a month ago things started to feel a bit weird. We got colder to each other, didn't have sex... didn't talk that much.  It was probably both's fault, at the time I thought it was mostly mine. She confronted me about this once and said we need to do something about it. She cried of the thought of breaking up with me. We forgave each other and moved on. The relationship was now getting stronger, and I loved her so , so much. We talked almost daily about the future, about our kids, about getting married.

**Then one night she went out with her friend, let's call her** ***Emily***. I was happy about this because she moved to a new city because of me and I really wanted her to meet new friends. 

She didn't pick up her phone or answer texts, and I started to get a bit nervous. I wasn't even thinking about cheating. I was more worried that she was mad at me or something happened. 

She came home at 3am, and we had an argument. The morning after we continued arguing. She mentioned to me she had thought of getting a place of her own. It would be ""beneficial for our relationship to get some distance"". It felt awful. She even said she had already contacted a few ads. 

Then she sent me a text during the day saying she wanted to be by herself for a while. She asked me to go home to my parent's house. It didn't feel right, but I did. 

**I couldn't sleep. I felt like something was wrong...** so I texted her the day after saying I really want to talk to her. I want to do anything to make it better. She responded that she wanted the best for our relationship and that she loved me... but she couldn't see me that night because she was going to se *Emily*. I got angry, but I wanted to be good so I told her ""ofc, go see your friend. it's important you get some perspective on things and not only talk to me all the time"".

But I felt something was up. So I went back to our apartment to wait for her to come back so I could talk to her. I have NEVER read any texts of hers, looked at any of her stuff because I have trusted her completely all this time. But now I found her diary... and I opened it.

&amp;#x200B;

**She first mentioned Emily about three months ago.** She said it felt weird to be attracted to a girl all of a sudden. Then she kept writing, day by day, of how she longed for her. She said ""but I love my boyfriend... he is the one... right? And she has a girlfriend. But why can't I stop thinking about her?""

She went on about how they met and how they both said it felt like a date. How she wanted to tell *Emily* how she felt but she couldn't... Eventually she told her, and it was mutual. This went on up until the day before I read it. She never wrote that they kissed, only that she really wanted to. And that they would have to find a way, because both were in relationships.

I was devastated reading this, it hurt so bad I didn't think I would survive. When she came back I told her about it, and said she's got 24 hours to pack her bags and get out of the apartment. At first she said I was an asshole for reading her diary. Then she said it was only things she wrote to get things out of her mind, and that the reason they were seeing each other tonight was to find a way to end it. I didn't believe her.

 I left and went to my parents' place. She sent me a text a few hours later saying ""All my things are out, and so am I."" I didn't respond, and haven't heard from her since. That was yesterday. I haven't gone out of bed, I am at the bottom and I feel like shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Was I right to kick her out?** What should I do now? Any advice whatsoever on how I can get over this? Because at the moment, I can't see the light. I can't eat or sleep. Im in shock. How could I not have seen this? She's so cold. I gave her everything I had. I feel so stupid and lonely, hence this post. How can she not at least try to call me and say she's sorry. I get nothing!?

According to him she's been a complete ass lately and it's been painful to live under her influence lately. Thankfully he can live with his dad, but he complained to me about her wanting to throw a graduation party for him, but she's inviting a bunch of people he doesn't know, and the food is all her choice and the party is basically for her, not him. He wanted my advice on whether he should go or not because she has threatened to cut all his funding before, and that she's said multiple times that he's emotional, irrational, and not ready for college.

So a few weeks ago a friend of mine, “Ben,” was on Grindr and found a pic of my friend “Jarvis” and his profile. Ben is openly gay but Jarvis is not.

Jarvis does not know that I know and only thinks my friend knows.

Jarvis is a very close friend of mine and I don’t care that he’s gay at all, but I want him to feel comfortable and be himself. He’s currently in a “thing” with a female, but said female has reported that Jarvis kinda pushes away her sexual advances, although they have made out and such before.

474,"It all started in the beginning of March when I had serious insomnia (sleeplessness) and frequently applied sick leaves at school.

One day I decided to skip school for 3 consecutive days (+2 for weekends) for no reason at all (maybe for more rest? Didn't really think of it back then). Everyday I woke up in afternoon, eat some random food and play video games for the whole day.

After that week, I felt like I was having a better time playing video games than going to school, and also a bit afraid that I can't catch up, so I decided to have another week off. After than week it was the term test. My parents helped me to explain to school and skipped the two test weeks.

Then things started getting serious. Ive already had a habit of waking up late and playing video games. I'm too afraid too go to school. Idk what my classmates think of me and I'm too scared to face it. I also missed out chapters of content so if I go to school, I'll have absolutely no idea what they're learning. Everyday I just can't stop imagining how everything in school have changed since I left. Maybe when I go back, the school is already not what I remember. 

I also have another problem, which is that I'm super sensitive to noise and is easily annoyed. Even a little kid crying next to me makes me wanna smash his face (sorry). The school is hell for me, tens of annoying sons of bitches screaming between lessons or during breaks. They just won't ever stop making noises. School is more like a place of torment than a place of learning for me. Everyday I'm just learn useless shits like calculus, literature that I'm definitely not gonna need in the future, all while being screamed at by those damn annoying classmates. 

This made me skipped even more school days, until this week, the school made clear that if I'm still not going to school, I will not be able to take part in the final exam (basically, I have to study the whole year again).

Yesterday I tried to get up to school but my mind is messed up.  I don't wanna give up my current degenerate live (gaming, eating junk, waking up late...) but the school won't allow that. Without the chance to study at school, I definitely can't keep this shitty lifestyle (since I don't make money, I relied on my parents) I don't know what should I do.

So there’s this friend of hers who copies her. Like actually does everything like her. From the way she dresses, the way her hair and body look, her attitude, her everything! I decided to talk to my friend and tell her that it’s not healthy for neither of them and of course she agreed but on her bday I unconsciously started talking to the girl that copies her. I’m not gonna lie, the girl is nice but the way that she completely tries to rip off one of my closest friends pissed me off.
Second: my friend had been bullied for a couple of months from a guy and a girl who thought that my friend was lying and dating the girl’s ex. Which actually was me. I was dating the person that my friend was accused of dating. I know, this is confusing.
Other than that I made and said some rather contradicting things regarding her..

So back to what happened. I broke up with the person I was dating and my friend completely exploded. She was mad at both me and the other person. I asked her to be next to me. And on the next day she came up to me ( she was completely ignoring me through the day) and she started telling me that “she knew everything”, saying that I’ve shittalked her all summer while she was away even though I was the only person that defended her throughout the whole situation that had happened, that she can’t get over the fact that I broke up with my ex, that I was not reliable ( talked about how hypocritical I was for talking and being extremely nice to the girl that copied her every move) etc. 
She then stopped completely talking to me.
The thing that pisses me off is that I looked up to her, had so much respect for this person and loved her like a sister and now I learn from my OWN friends that she has been talking complete and utter bullshit behind my back, is now best buddies with the two guys that bullied her for like 4 months, she’s trying to turn everyone against me and the thing is that I just can’t stop thinking about this. I EVEN DREAM ABOUT IT. When I do something I always get reminded of the situation that I’m in and it affects my health so badly. I’m feeling sorry and guilty because I’ve realised what I did wrong.

I've been talking to my cousin late at night to catch up and play video games and recently he made a joke about his older sister being a pedophile because she likes to date younger guys. For some reason it made me remember that she was the one who took naked pictures of my little brother as a kid. I was watching a NigaHiga video on her laptop and started randomly clicking folders on her desktop when I stumbled on a folder filled with my little brother's nude photos. Being a tatted, stocky guy with a generally stern face, I really spooked my cousin because I started crying over the video call and hung up. 


My cousin's sister now lives on the other side of the U.S. and doesn't really keep in contact with the rest of us. I still remember the color and general look of the laptop. When I asked her about the photos back then, she told me to be quiet about it in a really serious voice and took me to go buy some Legos. I quickly forgot about that incident and continued my life as an elementary schooler. 


I'm really unsure of how to approach this. I don't want to be called a liar by the rest of the family because the only proof I have is in my memory. I want to find the laptop because then I could be reassured about the whole thing. I remember seeing it in a box that might have shipped to the Phillipines or went with my cousin to Japan. If it's in Japan I can ask him to bring it when he comes over for the summer but if not then I'm not sure what to do. I'm scared to approach my brother about it because he's a highschooler who's going through that whole ""don't talk to me"" phase and don't want to seem paranoid to him.


I know it happened. I just feel trapped with how I can approach this. All my cousin's sister has to do is deny it and I'll look dumb and paranoid. It should also be mentioned that my family as a whole doesn't like to talk about anything negative. At all. One time I asked if my younger cousin (who has now passed away) was doing okay in the hospital and they told me not to be so nosy or negative.


Any advice on how to approach the situation would be great.",29Apr2019,4

490,"Hey guys,

so after reading a lot of these threads my problem seems kind of small and unimportant but it matters a lot to me.

I should start this up by saying that I got into contact with a girl last september and we started dating soon and until the beginning of this year everything seemed to be really good. But with the beginning of the new year we fought more often and often over little things and some bigger things aswell and we were unsure if we should stay together around february but we got through that. I kind of had some problems with myself (i have some mental issues once in a while) and i said that i needed some time for myself and also blamed my problems on her and that I started to lose my feelings for her - and we kind of broke up for two weeks and in those weeks i started talking to other girls, like my ex, and after those two weeks I realized that I was really dumb and we talked a while and decided we should stick it out together and so we were back together. when she found out I talked to my ex during that time - and i didn't tell her before - she was really angry. i understand that, it maybe looked bad but i didn't want to get back with her, i just wanted to talk to her because of unsolved problems i had with her in the past. but we got through that but since then she has trust issues. and we had some other smaller problems but those obviously became worse because of those trust issues.

we also got through those but the last time we had a fight she said that she can't stay strong for us forever and she is really hurt.

here comes the problem i am facing right now. while we didn't spend time together I downloaded tinder. i didn't really use it at all and deleted it shortly after because I knew I couldn't find someone like my s/o on there. 
And she doesn't know I ever downloaded the app but my consciousness tells me that she would be pretty mad if she knew and that kind of fills me with guilt even though I learned from it and I am sure that I would never do it ever again.

The thing is - I realized over the last two months that she is something very special to me and I love her. When we are apart I can not stop thinking about being with her again. And that I have downloaded that stupid app doesn't affect our relationship at all. 

So should I tell her that I did it? I am really scared of losing her, and I can see her making a big deal out of it. I really have never had someone in my life like her and I don't want to hurt her more than I already did. I just don't know what to do right now and I feel really lost because of that.

492,"I struggle with Anxiety, Depression, Body Dysmorphia and Hoarding. I also dealt with years of emotional abuse from my mum, unable to get away from it due to my anxiety keeping me prisoner within my room. Along with the mindset she gave me that I was simply a burden, unable to be housed by anyone else (I could go into crazy detail about the abuse and control but that's not why I'm here).

I've been told that Hoarding is linked to both Depression and Anxiety but I don't understand how and want to help my mum understand it, too. She believes I'm simply lazy and used excuses to live in filth. I've since moved away from the emotional abuse I endured with her and haven't felt a need to hoard once.

493,"Forgive me, but I'm not too sure if ""depressed"" would be the right term to describe what state I'm in. If you think there's a better term to use, please do let me know!

Now, I would say that I think I am depressed because I insanely lose self-esteem and interest into things that I love such as videogames, memes and sports over small little things. Like seeing my girlfriend happy with other boys would have me constantly overthinking thst she would be happier with that guy and even the thought of doing what I love would tell me ""Nah, that wont cheer ya up. Sorry."" I'd also be constantly thinking of how happy others would be if I ended my life, because I thought that being in my depressed or sad state would ruin other's positive and good vibes. 

The sad part about this is that I actually have noone to talk about this with. I don't have any actual ""Best and trusted"" friends I could talk to this about, I simply am just to have the ""Casual get-along Friends"" sort of guy. 

It's the constant thought that bothers me wherein I dont want to ruin other people's good mood, so I push them away, or so until atleast I come back into a good mood after overthinking things to bring me to a conclusion and make me stable again. 

Whenever something makes me feel off, or triggers something inside of my mind that resorts on making me sad, it always leads to me overthinking at random times. 

Any help on how to prevent myself from being easily let down and focus on being on the more positive side of life again? I absolutely hate being in this state.",29Apr2019,2

Before we started dating I was looking at moving cities. The job I was in was beyond boring, and I figured I can do a boring job anywhere, may as well be closer to friends/family. But then we started dating and I had a reason to stay. She pushed me to apply for a new job in my current city. It’s a good job, but there’s no element of it that I truly enjoy.

502,"Okay, I’m 26F and I’m in my last semester before rotations start.

There was this really hard class tha is different from other classes where we have a patient case and have work up the case in order to answer questions (10-15) orally in a 15 minute timespan. the questions can be anything, and can have multiple parts, and can lead into the next question they ask. Basically, you have to prepare for any scenario they throw at you, so I would write like 25 pages of information each that would take about 14 hours to complete.

The thing is, I think I failed the last one. That means, I’d have to do an in class case where I would only have a couple hours to make a plan. The case will be “complex,” which, by looking at the past few, may be impossible for me to do bc I just don’t have the skills to do it.

If I fail that, I’m done. I’d have to wait an entire year to redo the class, which I would NOT do. Which means I’d be a year behind, can’t graduate with my friends, and start my life. I’d have to live with myself for the rest of my life, being hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, never be able to pay it back, and won’t have anything to show for it.

I will have completely ruined my life, disappointed my family, etc.

We saw each other 2 days later at another bar, and then again 2 days after that (when we hooked up in his car). He has been sending me good morning/night texts every day after our 1st date. He told me I was ""special"" during our 2nd date. It's honestly all been moving really fast and I really thought we were headed towards a relationship. Last Tuesday we made plans to possibly go to NYC together yesterday, but by Thursday he had to cancel due to work (he works Saturdays and sometimes Sundays). Then all of a sudden yesterday he didn't text me.

I eventually texted him, and asked him what the status of our relationship was. He said he has been having a great time with me and that he really liked me, but once I questioned him further he gave me these vague responses suggesting he was too busy to date. He co-owns a construction company and works 70-80 hours per week, and will work even more hours in the coming months. So, I get it, he doesn't have much free time. I told him that I'd be happy seeing him 1-2x/week, and asked him if he actually wanted to date me, and he replied that he wants to but doesn't think he can with his current schedule.

I had no doubts of a bright future for the two of us (in friendly terms). We hung out and were really on good terms with one another. I felt a premonition rising about two weeks ago.

Today I confronted him about it via Facebook (we leave a fairly long distance from each other) and he was avoiding the questions all together. So I begged him to talk to me. I asked him what I had done to deserve such treatment from him and what can I do to patch things up.

Him: ""Come to the gym with me.""

Me: ""Ok, where are we going?""

Him: ""Actually, you know what? Forget about it.""

Me: ""Why?""

Him: ""Just give me 10 bucks and we'll be good."" (It's the way we jest with one another in our group. It's not meant to be taken seriously.)

Me: ""Haha, sure.""

Him: ""No, you know what? We'll never have a good relationship.""

Me: ""If it's not a good relationship, what is it then?""

Him: ""It's complicated, on the other hand, it's not even a relationship.""

Me: ""Are you trying to say we aren't friends at all?""

Bob gets slightly bigger room. same width as others, ~1 meter longer). Bob also has a small en suite bathroom and use of the only parking space.

We have a graveyard on top of our fridge, and believe me, my parents would not be happy to see that. I had a lot to clean up, no one else was home, so I was rushing around and quickly decided I would stash the 6 bottles (it's not much of a graveyard, we don't drink much) in my roommate's room cuz I figured no one would go in there. In all the confusion and hullabaloo, I forgot I put the bottles there. I spent the day with my parents and subsequently forgot about those bottles. The very next morning, my roommate sits me down and explains that he was quite upset I put those bottles in his room without asking, which I apologized for immediately because I realized I should have sent him a quick text saying so, and he furthered on saying I did not bother ever bringing it up for 24 hours, and he was waiting to see if I ever would. I am a very forgetful person, and I told him I honestly just forgot about it and he should have reminded me and I would have taken care of it immediately. He brushes all that aside, saying he realized this is a ""difference of personalities"" and that it's changed his view of who I am. We are all in the same friend group, so he said he did not want drama but he is ""less than thrilled"" to be hanging out with me again. I am very confused at this point, and all I said was I understand because I wasn't sure what to say to that. To me, it sounded like he just broke a friendship over a bag of bottles in his room.

I don't have or use tinder anymore.

So for the past two years or so my parents have been slowly putting pressure on me to get engaged/married. Now its getting to a tipping point almost. There's this girl they're asking me to meet and see if I like her pretty much. It's like a supervised date with my parents and her parents almost. It sounds pretty strange but I guess it's the way of the culture, nothings forced at least for either of us. I'm not against meeting this girl, I'd actually like to talk to her but it's the circumstances I think that I find awkward and hard to engage with her. Especially when our parents are there. I haven't met this girl before but I know her Instagram account from my mom showing me her photo lol. So what would you guys suggest or do in my spot? I'm kind of tempted to go through with ""supervised date"" but I'm pretty sure it'll be super awkward between us because of our parents over us or maybe my anxiety is just through the roof. Do I go out on a limb and add her? She doesn't know who I am so I wouldn't even know how to start the conversation without it being weird because she doesn't know who I am either.",29Apr2019,1
522,"I live in a very strict house. My parents have set up cameras to be able to monitor us 24/7 and regularly checks them. I don't exactly have a good relationship with them either. We fight a lot, and most of the time when we talk, they yell at me for something. They believe that their children have no right for privacy hence why I am writing this since they have started to track me. I did nothing to warrant this, and even though they said it was for safety, I know it is complete bullshit since they did this right after I started driving alone. So that begs the question, how do I tell my parents that I feel like I am always being watched, and it doesn't feel good. I want them to be able to let me live without me having to have an eye on me at all times. I have no idea what to say though, and I am honestly somewhat scared that they will be more intrusive on me. They aren't abusive or anything, they are just way too untrusting to the point where it is affecting me mentally, which I don't really want to get into. Any advice helps",29Apr2019,2
523,"I want to visit the house I grew up in but there is someone who lives there now. My family moved out of that house about 13 years ago. I am now 23. My dad recently told me that the house was completely remodeled (he found out online). Before, once in a blue moon, we would drive to the house just to pass by it because of the memories and everything. That house was legit my childhood. I was small and innocent and full of life. I remember laying on the driveway looking at the sky wondering how planes are able to stay in the sky even though they are so heavy. I remember making mud pies, learning how to ride a bike and getting stung by a bee for the first time. We had so many family barbecues and just really warm memories before life got crazy. I would really love to be able to see the inside and just step into the house that I grew up in and feel it (I know it sounds weird) but I want to feel the memories and just relive it for a brief second. Going to say all of this, obviously I can't do that because that is now someone else's home now. Do you think I could ask the person who lives there now if I could visit and if, how can I do that respectfully??? Thank you.",29Apr2019,19

526,"I recently got a new coworker at work that is sharing my office. She is extremely fragrant. Granted, I am sensitive to smells but she reeks of perfume, hair spray/conditioner, and all other kinds of beauty smells, however I have never had this problem with any other person I've worked with before, even considering my situation I think she's an outlier. She just recently started and was put in to share my office, which is very small.

It's gotten to the point where I am breathing through my shirt for part of the day because I find the smell so overwhelming, it's absolutely distracting from my work.

I don't see how there's any way to bring this up or discuss it without it being at least somewhat awkward. We have empty offices in the building where I work, and instead of asking her to move out, she has decorated her half with a lot of things, I'm more than happy to move to an empty office or even give up an office and take a desk if it comes to that.

I want to ask my boss if I can move to an empty office or just a desk, because I really don't want to share the space with her anymore. I feel like this is better than just asking her to stop wearing perfume, but I really don't know if there's any way to properly do this or not and I don't feel like there's anything that I can say to my boss other than it's really not working out for me, and explain that her perfume makes me feel nauseous, gives me headaches, etc.

I also don't want to be made into the office asshole/pariah for this, but again, I really don't think I can deal with this for much longer.",29Apr2019,3

528,"I basically told off the mother that I can't keep (for example) visiting, or even driving her back and forth to do grocery (she's stubborn and never want to get back into driving) but she does help, I wouldn't be able to have good food sometimes. But it's the same deal with the dad and the other family members too, yes, it's great to hang out. It's great to get to know them, but at this stage of my early adult life, it feels like I could learn better or I could grow better and larger from other people. 

I've had the feeling of resentment to both parents (due to many instances in my younger life) and sometimes I see more of their douchebag side, of course, I thank them dearly for the good side. But sometimes, when things are getting tough on my end and I get into an argument, especially with mother whose just quite traditional, never wanting to look from my perspective (can't we just talk like two normal adults? Can I have my turn to speak?) it makes me want to say that I didn't choose to be born.

I have to make something for myself now, yes I would probably struggle more if it wasn't for her cooking, and sometimes his dinner outing + random allowance (my parents have been divorced btw) but I have to keep distance. Even though they're not that far apart. Would I feel worse if I was 500 miles away? Why do I feel so empty? I feel like I am just apart. I got into an argument because of this that I basically just disowned myself to them, I've got to grow too. We're all adults now, so if I say I'm sorry, if I'm the one who steps forward (again) maybe this feeling of emptiness will be gone? Has anyone felt the same way?",29Apr2019,1
529,"Everything started around 2 years ago. I was working and also in final year on college - a lot of stress going on for around a year.

530,"This story is going to be one hell of a ride, I’m going to summarize it as much as I can. It’s been some of the most stressful times of my life.

I met my fiancé 2 1/2 years ago. We were inseparable. He proposed to me, I said yes. We soon moved in together. Things were fantastic. The first time it happened was my 21st birthday night. He was 20 years old at the time. We went to a club at the beach with his aunt and uncle. I bought him his under 21 wristband so he could enjoy the live music, just not drink. We pregamed so we were already drunk when we got there. Well he kept disappearing most of the night into like the bathroom or the corner somewhere by himself on his phone. I was getting hit on by random people and I kept looking around for him so he could tell them to leave me alone after I had already tried, but he was nowhere in sight. He grabbed my drink at one point and took a sip, and they tossed him out for underage drinking. We drunkenly walked back to our hotel. 
He was acting strange. I asked him to watch a movie with me in our room but he said no, and played fortnite on his gaming laptop that he’d brought instead. He was also on and off his phone. I went downstairs to get something out of the car, and when I came back he was on his phone again. I’d had enough of him being weird and I looked to see what he was doing, and it blew my mind. He was on a secret Instagram account he created with the username of “koala21214” (not the real username, i changed it for privacy reasons.) He was messaging his ex girlfriend. “Koala” was her pet name and 2-12-14 was the day they got together. I was so confused.. and embarrassed. There were only about 4 messages between them, as he just started messaging her. (Her asking why he was doing that, and that he’s crazy.) When I asked him what the fuck he was doing, he went crazy. He punched a hole in the wall and smashed his phone into pieces. 

It was a whirlwind of bullshit, and I was at loss for words on what to say or how to comprehend or even why he would do something like that, especially on my 21st birthday. I ended up forgiving him, I reasoned it with he was drunk and being immature, we had also just moved in together and I wanted to keep my commitment to him as he’d been great otherwise.

I had a hard time getting over it, I had anxiety in the relationship after that. I always thought he was doing something behind my back, and it was very hard to get over it. I eventually started trusting him again, and then he went to his nursing school orientation 7 months later. 
He met this blonde girl (I will call her Jenny.) He scoured Facebook for her name but couldn’t find her. I started feeling anxious again and he told me there wasn’t anything to worry about he just wanted to see if he knew her because he told me he thinks they went to high school together.
His first day of school comes around, and he goes to class. I find out Jenny has a serious boyfriend and I feel so much relief. I was so wrong.
They ended up flirting, getting close, not to my knowledge. He started going to class super early, and Bringing cologne, his toothbrush and toothpaste, and dry shampoo to school. when I asked him why he’d do that, he told me he wants to be clean for his patients. It was so fucking weird, I knew something was up. 
Rent and our electric was due soon, so I checked his bank account to see if it was already paid. I noticed charges to food places that were way more expensive than just food for one. When I confronted him, he called me controlling and crazy. I knew he was full of shit. He eventually turned off his text notifications and changed his phone password, and blocked all of his nursing school contacts. I KNEW he was lying at this point. One night, the last night I’d ever have at MY apartment, I told him something wasn’t right and I just wanted the truth. He didn’t give me the truth, instead he told me to get out by the morning, he told me that he was tired of ME hounding him. Then, he slept peacefully beside me.
I was fucking shattered. How could he just force me out of my own apartment? The next morning he didn’t give a shit while I packed all of my stuff and took my Decour off the walls carefully. I begged him to not do this to me but he didn’t care. He watched me cry and leave my apartment complex for the last time. Then the very next night my neighbor calls me and tells me that she just saw them at a fancy restaurant together and they went back to the apartment. I was shattered as I sat back at my parents house at loss for words, how could this have happened to me? Jenny had a boyfriend at the time as well, did he know?
I texted him that he was a piece of shit liar and that our neighbor saw them together. He said that they didn’t do anything except study and go get something to eat.  I knew he was lying but my heart was broken.
The next two months were filled with him manipulating me and using me for sex because I was so hurt and desperate to repair our relationship again, while he was also hanging out with Jenny everyday and hiding it from me. 
I messaged jenny on Facebook and asked her if anything was going on between them and she denied it, so I believed he was serious about changing and repairing the pain he’d caused. Eventually I got an Instagram message from jenny about one month later. She told me everything and apologized for hurting me the way that she did, she told me that they had fucked three times she had slept over she sent me pictures of them doing all of the things that we used to do. She told me she doesn’t talk to him anymore because he started talking to her best friend and they fooled around and hung out, he even slept in her bed one night and who knows what happened there. There were also three other girls that I knew about that he was hanging out with and messaging asking to go to dinner with, these girls told me this because they thought we were still engaged and they wanted me to know. 
I was shocked to say the least, I can’t comprehend why somebody would do this and lied so much. He came back around again and told me that he has changed and he’s truly sorry and wants a serious relationship with me again and I feel so weak at this moment and it seems like he’s trying to worm himself back into my life, I still have those feelings for him despite everything he’s done and I don’t know what to do next he came back around again and told me that he has changed and he’s truly sorry and wants a serious relationship with me again and I feel so weak at this moment and it seems like he’s trying to worm himself back into my life, I still have those feelings for him despite everything he’s done and I don’t know what to do next. I truly don’t know how I feel. He has sent me gifts and told me I can go through his phone at anytime, he has begged for me back. He told me the grass was never greener on the other side and that he broke up with me because he wanted to be single and lost feelings for me, but he realized he loved me. 
He lost feelings for me but kept me around for sex and other manipulation. 
Can anyone help me make any sense of this? I can’t sleep at night and I’ve lost so much.",29Apr2019,1

532,"Hey all, 

I'm a 28yr old female with a long history of being involved in the medical field. But for as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to get into the creative field, specifically video games/animations or creative content in general. 

Obviously, I'm not fresh out of undergrad nor have I taken all the necessary tech/animation courses that some video game-related positions ""prefer"", but I have been trying to learn Blender and even been trying to make my own content through the Dreams PS4 game. It's hard as hell but damn do I feel good about working hard on something that genuinely excites me. I've also been super passionate about music and video game music since forever and for the past year or so, learned Logic Pro X by myself and made a couple small bits here and there. Definitely not enough for a portfolio but something I try to do here and there at home when I'm feeling creative. 

I currently work as a freelance, self-employed tutor and it's not only unstable, but also not at all where I currently want to be. For a while, I was thinking about entering med school (due to pressures of finding a ""real job"") but I believe that my heart is happiest when I'm doing something creative and inspiring. I know I'm a bit old but I don't want to believe that my aspirations are just pipe dreams anymore. I think with my head in the right direction and a lot of patience and commitment, I can achieve what I've dreamt about for so long. For you guys out there:

How should I get started? Are there programs I should learn to make myself a more competent applicant for jobs in the video game/animation/creative field?  Should I just apply to entry level jobs in those fields and try to bang out a bomb cover letter? Should I start building a portfolio? Should I just post my stuff online and see what happens there? 

ANY advice would be so greatly appreciated. Seriously!",29Apr2019,2

534,"Hi, 
This is my first time here. I have to admit I feel a little silly putting this out into the void, but maybe there is a chance that something positive will come back to me and will give me some perspective. 
I will try to keep the post short and to the point. I am married to a very loving, very kind and funny man. He is accomplished and thoughtful and most importantly loves me very much. Our relationship is probably pretty great compared to many. We are 99% of the time harmonious, with the occasional argument that is usually pretty silly, to begin with. We have been together for 8 years. I supported him through his undergrad and grad school (mentally and financially) and he is supporting me through my undergrad currently, which is almost completed. 
Here is where the problem lies and there are certainly more depths that this can go into but here is the basis of what's happening in my head. 
I love him. But over the past two years, I felt myself change and I just don't feel -in love- with him.
 He is perfect in many ways. So while I have nothing really to complain about, in my heart, I feel like to leave him, I would be giving up on the good to explore something more that could either be better or worse.
 I guess I feel like I am settling for a ""good"" thing and it scares me. And maybe its purely the fact that while he is loving and caring, he doesn't excite me. I've shared this ""lack of excitement feeling"" with him and he said that's what happens with couples. He said, your relationship will evolve and become more routine than in the beginning. 
But, I want to feel the excitement, have great conversation and feel the passion. And I don't. Does anyone else understand this feeling? Would I be stupid to give up on someone that loves me, that I trust and love in return, all for the ""excitement"" factor? Like I said before, there are more things to consider, but when it all boils down, I think this is the root of my problem.",29Apr2019,2

The poor cat gets no love or attention, has no toys, and is constantly bored and hungry. Every time I open my bedroom door she runs to come in and hang out with me and my cat in my room and hides under the bed if I try to take her back out.

540,"This is going to be quite long so I apologize and sorry for formatting I’m on a mobile 


So my friend (I’ll call her J) and I have been friends for about 8 or 9 ish years now and we’ve always been very close. I admit in the beginning of our friendship when I was very young I was a little bratty and bitchy but I grew out of that real quick as we got older. Her and I didn’t talk for a couple months around summer of 2016 and then again last summer. We’ve always been best friends we just didn’t talk as much during those times I’m not sure why but we never had any problems and we still kept in touch. Fast forward to the beginning of this year around like September we’ve been very consistent with hanging out and talking which was great. In December she actually got hired at my job (worst thing I ever recommended to her) I only told her to come to my job because she was very desperate and in NEED of a job and I felt bad so I was like fuck it my jobs hiring and i have such an amazing job. However, in the past month I’ve been realizing how much of a bitch she is and it’s stressing me. She was dating my friend in December through January and she treated him so poorly and degraded him in front of his friends, family, and me. It was very sad to watch but I would just say “hey J maybe you should be a little less mean” and she would just bitch at me and claim that he’s a loser. (Which he kind of was but he was kind to her and still have her everything she wanted). Anyways after that I didn’t try to hook her up with anymore of my friends because now him and I don’t talk anymore and it’s sad :(.  However here’s some of the things that really do bother me about her and I can’t shake them


Nowadays I constantly question whether I want her in my life or not due to her bitchy attitude. She’s very judgmental over people who smoke weed and smoke cigarettes. I don’t smoke cigs but personally I don’t care if someone does and I do smoke weed so I get bothered sometimes. She will make faces and say “that’s disgusting” to people who smoke anything. But when it comes to me she’ll say oh girl you’re fine but how can you judge others and not me? (Let’s keep in mind that this girl literally used to smoke everyday with me like 3 ish months ago). 


 She constantly texts me randomly about stupid and useless shit that doesn’t need to be said. She goes on about positivity and being happy but then she’ll find reasons to get mad and text me about them for example someone we used to be friends with posted about autism awareness month and she got super mad and was like “It bothers me so much that he tries to be a good person and pretend he’s doing stuff for others” but like who the fuck cares? Seriously you’re just finding reasons to be mad!! That dude and I are no longer friends because she hooked up with him, went psycho on his ass and he left :( 



She’s never adventurous and any friends I bring her around really dislike her. The other day my friend, boyfriend, J, and I went to this smoke spot that J and I used to go to as a kid. It has a little slope type hill that we used to go up ALL THE TIME but this time she made a huge deal about how she can’t go up it because she has anxiety then proceeded to go this difficult ass way up it instead and we all asked her if she wanted help and she just said “no leave me alone” like what the fuck


She’s very bratty and asks better then everyone around her. She constantly puts on this nice person facade but then when they leave she talks up a storm about them and it drives me nuts. She’s very judgmental towards people and if she doesn’t like it then it isn’t the right way and it makes me feel like I’m judged too even though when it comes to me her judgements suddenly “don’t matter because it’s you”. Like and if anyone disagrees with her or she’s wrong she won’t admit that shit. She’s always “right”  


She’s very superficial and always does things that I do. I understand as friends we’ll pick up each others lingo and we’re very alike that’s why we’re friends but this girl will literally mimic things I do exactly and buy things I buy and change her style if I do. 


She constantly points out that she eats great food (she’s not exactly the most fit so it’s evident she doesn’t) and that she’s helping the environment and she does all these great things but behind doors it isn’t like that and it’s very annoying 


If we are hanging and she says “I want McDonald’s” and I reply with “I’m not in the mood for that rn” she’ll get upset and be like “fine then I don’t want it either” and she does this with everything. If I don’t do something that she wants to do then she will not do it either and I never understood that ever. The other day at work I took off this whistle we bought together because it wasn’t working the way I thought it would then she walked in with hers and saw I wasn’t wearing mine and proceeded to call me a trader and took hers off. 


The last thing she does that annoys me is she always pulls up old videos and photos of me when we were younger like I get friends do that but she pulls out stuff that she knows I don’t want anyone seeing and I’ve had a rough past so it feels like she’s kind of doing it on purpose. This one is a little stupid for me to say but it’s something that just adds on to all this bullshit. She has this sarcastic attitude and she says things that are supposed to be jokes but they’re not and they definitely have some truth in them. We went to Walmart once (this is the only example I remember) but her ex man was like “wow why are the pretty flowers more expensive then the ugly ones” or something like that and J says something along the lines of like “it’s always the pretty ones” and looked at me with some type of death stare and then laughed in some sweet innocent laugh but I didn’t even get that at all I was just like ok??? She says more I just don’t remember them.  She constantly sings (she has a great voice) and she sings like petty songs and points at me or like her ex when they were together



Anyways I want to talk to her but I’ve just been ignoring her because idk what to say anymore. This girl means a lot to me but I’m a peace loving hippie kind of gal and she’s a stuck up judgmental gal and idk what to do. We’re like opposites nowadays like I don’t even know who she is. And I don’t know what to do. I just need some advice because I don’t want to lose her but I’m not sure I can deal with her anymore. I don’t know if I’m just paranoid or if she’s really not the friend for me anymore.",29Apr2019,0
542,"I recently got intimate with a man who made me feel weird about the experience by projecting his fears/ insecurities onto me and I’m really unsure if I should reach out to him to clear the air. This guy is my coworkers roommate and I would really hate for things to be weird between us. 
 
I just got out of a nine year relationship that has been a dead bedroom for the last 4. My ex and ended things on Thursday and I hooked up with this guy, let’s call him K, Friday. I know I moved incredibly fast to be intimate with someone( we didn’t have sex, just fooled around), but I have been starved for affection and passion for a really long time and it was really nice to feel wanted and be touched. Anyways drinks were involved since we were at a party and I ended up messing around with him. The problem is I hadn’t told anyone my bf and I had broken up since it was my friends bday and I wanted to keep the mood light. I did tell K before we kissed that I had broken up with my bf, since I’m not a cheater and didn’t want him to be “that guy”. The problem is he flat out didn’t believe me, but still kept messing around with me. Which is what I’m so confused about, I know K was cheated on 10 years ago and hasn’t dated seriously since so he is very sensitive to cheaters, but for him to project that onto me was a little much. We were both drunk and he spent the whole night trying to get me to slip up and admit I was cheating, which I wasn’t. 

Despite the fact K projected his weird cheating thing onto me, we had a really good time and I slept over at his place. Reflecting on the situation though, I feel really insulted and frustrated that I was made out to be something I wasn’t and feel like I should send him a text and reaffirm I’m not a terrible cheating “harlot”. I honestly feel sad for him and don’t want him to feel like he is some home wrecker. 

TL:DR Just got out of a 9 year relationship. Hooked up with someone the next day. Guy I messed around with thinks I’m a cheater. Not sure if I should clear the air.",29Apr2019,3

546,"Hi all, hopefully this is the right sub to be asking this question, not totally sure where else to go. 

So, a bit of background. I’m 23F and I work as a kindergarten teacher. My current FWB is 30M. After recent success with a FFM threesome, we’ve been interested in having another male join us for some fun. Since I found the girl last time, I told him to select a guy. This week, he lets me know that he found a guy who is open to joining, but that this guy is married (open relationship type of thing). Personally, I’m not opposed to that, so I agreed to see some photos. When my FWB sent the pictures (including a nude), I was pretty weirded out to see that this guy was one of the parents of a student at my school. Even worse, my FWB had sent along some photos of me and nudes as well. So now the parent of one of my students has not only seen me naked, but knows that I am engaging in threesomes. 

I told my FWB immediately, but he seemed confused, as this guy (the dad) said he was down to have the threesome and excited after seeing my pics. I can’t imagine he doesn’t know it’s me, especially since I see him several times a week, but I also can’t imagine he would want to have a threesome with his sons teacher? 

Part of me is super uncomfortable about this, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little intrigued? After reviewing my staff handbook, it seems like something like this wouldn’t get me in any technical trouble, per say....but is it a bad idea overall?

Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.",29Apr2019,8

548,"Hey Reddit. Stressed and depressed teen here. I am in dire need of advice and comforting words. 

So, I'm in a senior in highschool, and I only have one more month until I graduate. And I'm supposed to be happy about that - and I would be, if I knew what college I'm going to. You see, I applied to college, got into my top choice, but the reality is, I can't afford it. And that just makes me feel all kinds of depressed - I'm so unbelievably frustrated that I got into the school that I wanted, but I'm too poor to even attend it. My parents suggested for me to go to community college either in NYC or Philadelphia, but at this point, I'm scared that it's too late. I consulted with my college counselor, and she said if I apply for CC now, I'll have to go for the spring semester. 

On top of that, I'm pretty much failing most of my classes. I was able to keep them up for my Term one and two semesters, back where colleges were looking at the grades - but I just want to give up. I'm so tired of highschool, and I'm fed up with everything. Not to mention, apparently, I can't afford therapy anymore, so that's just fan-fucking-tastic. 

That's what's happening in my crap-tastic life right now. Do you guys think it's falling apart? Or is there still hope for me? What should I do?? I feel so lost and scared, and I honestly don't know what's going to happen with my life.",29Apr2019,2

550,"Hey, this is my first post on here, and I really could use some advice. 

So my SO and I have been engaged for about 5 months now. I proposed to her, and I will admit that it wasn't the most romantic situation, but she did say yes. If I had a time machine, I would go back and redo it, but I don't, and I can't. 

Let me just start with how it went down. 

She had been dropping hints for a while. I knew what ring she wanted and what size her finger was. So I figured I would get the ring and come up with a plan later. The day the box arrived, I opened it and I couldn't contain myself. I was so excited to make her my wife, and I was overcome with my own feelings. I panicked. I had to give it to her there and then. So i hid the ring in the freezer and made some stupid excuse for her to go open it. She saw it there, picked it up, and I went on some cheesy babbling rant about how much I loved her. Honestly I was so anxious that I don't even remember what I said. But she said yes, and I was the happiest I have ever felt in my life. I thought that was that. 

Cut to last night, 5 months after the proposal. 

Out of nowhere, she decides to tell me that my proposal was a huge disappointment. Not in those exact words, but that was basically the point she was making. She said that it wasn't the proposal she wanted, which would have been a huge spectical surrounded by family and friends. She tells me that she wants me to redo it and really make a show of how much I love her. She wants to be able to have an amazing story and pictures to share with our kids and grandkids. 

I'm really not sure what to do here. She wants this big thing with her family around and she wants me to show how much I love her, but this is difficult for several reasons. Mostly, her family already knows we are engaged, and I would be mortified trying to explain the situation to them, plus it would ruin the surprise factor that I think she is hoping for. Also, I'm going to have a difficult time just forgetting that I already proposed to her, and I can't just pretend that never happened. My redo wouldn't be very genuine of it felt forced. I love her more than anything and it kills me that I let her down so badly the first time, but I'm just really not sure how to handle the situation. 

TLDR: I proposed to my girlfriend in a lame way 5 months ago, but she said yes. Everyone already knows we are engaged. Now, 5 months later, she wants me to redo it in a grand way so we have a better story to tell our future friends and family and basically forget about the first time. I am at a loss.

So, the problem at hand.
Basically, I was supposed to go pick a piece of furniture up today in the nearest city. My father said he would pay for it. My bank account was at $29.55. I have terrible spending habits which I am working on fixing. (Still in highschool). He deposited $200 to pay for the furniture. I The issue, is that I already texted the person I was going to pick the furniture up from, that I can't make it today, (because of my money but they don't know that) but they said I can pick it up in a few weeks. I don't know what to tell my dad right now. I really need the money (so I can pass a background check for a job) and gas in general. I know if I work hard enough for these next weeks if I get a job, I can pay for it on my own.


My current thoughts are that I should figure out a way to tell him that I can't pick it up today because the seller said that or something. 

I don't know what to tell my dad.
It's a weird spot because I want and need to keep the $200 but the $200 is for the furniture but I also don't really want to drive down there and get it, I rather work now and get it later. :/ I

553,"I've never posted anything like this before but I literally have no one else to talk to, please no trolls. 

I've spent over a year becoming good friends with a woman who happens to be a lesbian. We have grown close enough that I have compete trust in her and have told her many things that I've never spoken to anyone about. After a messy breakup with her girlfriend we went out to have a few drinks so she could vent and relax, during this time she asked me if I liked her. Not one to lie to someone trust, i told her the truth. That I did in fact, but I knew her feelings and that I wouldn't ever let that impose on our friendship.

The next day she gets back together with her ex, and the ex wanted to know everything that we talked about that night. My friend told her. Her ex flips her shit, demanding that we can't be friends anymore. (She is the only friend I have here)

A few days later we all have to go work the same event, during down time I sit down with the ex to smooth things over. We talk for an hour and a half and I tell her. ""Look I've liked her for about 7 months, has it ever seemed like I've hit on her? Have I ever made a move or done anything at all to make you think I'm trying to take her from you?"" She said no it never seemed like that, I said ""Yeah that's because my friendship is more important than any feelings I may have, we both know she doesn't like men."" After our whole talk I ask her if we are cool and she said we are good.

Now before all this I had already asked my friend if she would come with me when I go check to see if I have cancer. She said ""Yeah man, of course I got you."" (I have a golf ball sized lump In my throat and it's been there for a while)

Apparently things with me and the ex weren't good at all. Any time we have to work together she constantly texts my friend threatening to break up or starting fights. It got to the point where if I texted or called I was ignored to save them from fighting. The few times I seen my friend at work she reassured me that she was still going to the hospital with me. 

 Just yesterday they broke up again and the ex asked me to pick up my friend, on my way there they make up and asked me to just go back home. Through all this my friend has begged me to just be nice to her girlfriend and I haven't said a word.

Cut to the next day, today, 2 days before we are supposed to go. Things go smoothly through the morning until her ex starts texting. Suddenly she stops talking to me, still having banter with other co workers. After we are off the clock I ask if everything's good, she tells me that they broke up 3 times yesterday and that once her ex had found out we where working together ( she has other co workers watch us) she started another fight that morning. Then tells me that she has to stop talking to me. I ask if she is still going to come with me to the hospital. She replied "" Yeah I'll still go"" 10 seconds of uncomfortable silence go by "" if that changes, I'll let you know"".

567,"Hello! 

Since I really am looking for advice this might be a bit of a mess of a post. So I am a young woman (18) in my first real relationship. I understand that I will see many more in my future but for right now I really want to do everything I can to make this one mature and transparent, my partner also feels the same way about this as we have similar morals and values and have both seen our parents marriages suffer for years. 
So, we have been dating for almost a year and almost everything has been really great. If someone asked me honestly to complain about him/the relationship there aren’t many things I would really say. 
Except my relationship with his sister. She is two years younger (15 going on 16) and they have a relatively close relationship. Which is all fine by me, I do not have a close relationship with my siblings who are 12 and 7 years OLDER than me, so I am glad he has some good family connections. I just feel uncomfortable sometimes about their relationship. Me and my partner both value alone time but him admittedly more than me, but I do understand his desire for it and if he seems overwhelmed I’ll tell him I will talk to him later or if he asks for some alone time during the day I will gladly obliged. We are both still in school though, approaching college. So we have a lot on our plates as young adults. We had a discussion before committing to our relationship saying both of us want to try the college long distance relationship (only a couple hours away) and that we didn’t want to just give up immediately even if it becomes hard. So I really value our last few months together before September roles around when I’ll only see him a couple times a month, and maybe even less in the beginning.

Now that I have the background and context out of the way here is some of my feelings about his sister. I am in no way jealous of them spending time together it is just how they go about it that makes me feel uncomfortable and weird. For awhile I even felt ashamed that I was uncomfortable. But to be clear I do not think anything unnatural is going on at all.
His sister has always been a really touchy subject and he says it’s because he has gotten incest jokes in the past and he gets really upset. But I find that his sister is showing some jealous behavior that makes me uncomfortable and he gets very very upset whenever she is mad at him and I mean he has full on sobbed before. I’ve caught myself saying in my head that I feel like he overreacts and I’ve tried to stop that because I felt that it was mean of me. I feel like I have to track how much time we have spent together because she has sent him texts saying “you never hang out with me anymore” and “I just sat in my room and cried” etc. and I just find it frustrating because 1. They live together and 2. We only ever spend Saturdays together and usually one week day together because we are both busy. But he gets super upset about it! And it makes me feel clingy and like I shouldn’t want to be with him as much as I do. Another confusing thing to me is that I’ve never met a guy who cares so much about what his younger sister thinks when he’s in a new relationship. This is his first real relationship too and wouldn’t he want to spend time with me regardless? 
To end off this long long post (sorry!) I’ll give an example of something that happened last week that has had me uneasy since.

We were at his house and just finished having dinner with the family. We went up into his room which is right next to his sisters and we were having a serious discussion together. It was not a fight but just a private thing. I was getting ready to leave as it was getting late and we open up the door and she is laying on the floor in front of the door which was super weird. She doesn’t say anything at first so we just walk past her and then she awkwardly goes “sorry! Looks like I’m hogging up the walkway!” And everything about that was weird she was acting as if she had gotten caught doing something. I tried to brush that off, but we went to the front door which is right in eye sight of a balcony that leads to the room we just came out of so anyone who is on that balcony will see the front door. He is kissing me and saying goodbye and I look up and she is borderline glaring at me over her shoulder through the balcony watching us. When we make eye contact she gets up and runs inside of her room. I have felt extremely off and uneasy about how to approach any of this since then! Please help!

572,"Hi, I'm using a throwaway account as I'm pretty much a lurker on reddit, sorry if I make any mistakes in posting, and english isn't my native language so sorry if I make any mistakes, now to the point.  


I live in Spain, here's some info about how education works, skip this paragraph if you already know (or you are just lazy reading I guess):  
After Secondary School (ESO) (12-16yo study, its 4 years) people have mainly 3 options, 1. Just go out and work, this is stupid in Spain in my opinion, as you wont get far with this education as even university students can struggle finding a job, honestly i don't know anybody who would expect even finding something with only ESO. then we have option 2. FP, ""Formacion profesional"" or ""professional formation?"" if I'm not mistaken, its equivalent to a Vocational education, it focuses more on specific jobs, and many people don't realize that after finishing ""FP superior"" you can go straight to the 3rd year of university of related educations, if you studied about computers in FP, you can go to study in a university about computers as if you are in 3rd year, then we've got the most popular option, 3. bachiller, 2 years of hell and straight to university, yeah, like this way a 17yo can get to university, its really intense, in my actual bachiller literally almost everyone of the second year just dropped out. before going to any university, they STRONGLY recommend taking a gap year, specially after 2nd year of bachiller  


This is my situation, I failed the first year of bachiller, this is my second year (I'm still in the ""first"" year, just that I'm doing it again as I, well, failed) I get up at 6:30; and and get home at 15:30, I really just have 6 hours of school, but I need to get there and come back, this takes off 9 hours of every day of my life in pretty much me just sitting in a desk/car losing my time (which with 8 hours of sleep, out of 24 hours a day, only 7 I am truly ""free"") in all my years at school, I never really learned much, literally I've just passed studying by myself at home, or just with 5's because I know about the subject already some way or other, going to school and sitting watching someone talk its just really not my style of learning, I swear I have been trying everything to learn at school these last 2 years, giving up in my hobbies focusing in studying, and I just couldn't. and my mental health has suffered for a long time already (since 3rd ESO year), it never did get to a dangerous point like self-harm or suicidal thoughts, but still I sometimes feel like I'm going insane sitting there.  


where I live we just came back from a 2 week break, I spent these vacations studying by my own computer stuff (python for those who know), I've made a few shitty (but working) small projects or software like 3 working ""prototypes"" of games, a discord bot, etc. and I do have access to Udemy courses, specially about what I'm Interested in, I am willing to get up at 6:30 to study this stuff, I did these 2 weeks (not everyday, but I'm trying my best to fix productivity problems) I know I can learn this, but I'm not sure how to get money from it yet, but I will. Studying by my own is hard, but really satisfying, I'm right now studying accounting and finance as I think I will need it.  


So right now I'm at a tough spot, yeah, MAYBE I'm able to finish this first year of bachiller, but I KNOW I won't pass the second year of bachiller I KNOW I CAN'T, I'm not giving up, I didn't for almost 2 years, I can't if i tried, I feel like I would be playing with my mental health if I tried anyway tbh, and I refuse to lose another year of my life on ""trying"". I have only a month and a half left and will attend until I finish (for now)  


So, my plan is taking a ""gap"" year, yeah, I am supposed to do after finishing 2nd year and I am in 1st year, but I don't even know if I'm able to finish it so yeah, in this gap year (starting 1 of july 2019) I will get my car license (my parents were planning to this year), probably get some way of certificating english as my second language (I know I need to study a little), and I will be studying and trying my darn best to learn computer programming, and other subjects that I feel like I need (finance or GNU/Linux for example) main problem, I'm asking a teenager to study by himself for a year, as I said, I'll try my darn best, and I did study relatively well for these 2 weeks, but I don't know how I could manage a year, I think I can, but I never did something like this, I'm honestly scared, depending on the responses I get I'm thinking to talk with ""orientación"" in my school, idk the equivalent, but basically they help you decide what to do with your studies and education, and at next week I will talk with my parents about all this, I fear they will just hear ""I don't like going to school, its boring, I rather stay in my computer living in a bubble where I believe I can make money via smashing a keyboard for a really long time"" My parents do know I can live out of computers, In fact my parents expect me to go to a university in Cartagena that I already visited, but I don't believe they'll like the idea of me staying home for a year.  


I'm really sorry for such a long post, pretty sure if there was a rule I already broke it, but I've been thinking about this for a long time and It's really important for me, what should I do?, I really feel like just wasting my time in bachiller isn't an option anymore, maybe I can come back to it after this gap year as I won't be as burned out as I am right now, or I can do a FP after the gap year, should I even take this gap year? what do you think I should do?

To say he loves himself is an understatement, I know of one incident in their relationship when he pushed her over... I need a clean criminal record for my work, or I would have beat the shit out of him then, and id beat the shit out of him now if I could.

So about 6 months ago she split up with him and it was great. She ended up dating someone who may have been a lot less attractive physically than her, but was a steady away guy who would have been good for her. He didn't drink, was completely bespotted with her and was treating her very well, which was nice...

Then her ex, now current boyfriend, contacts her, swearing to change and all that. She went back to him. Around December she was suicidal, and mad several attempts to overdose. She's on anti depressants and when with this boyfriend, they both drink heavily. I'm a mental health worker so know this is stupid on anti depressants.

To every one publicly their relationship seemed to be ok now, both making an effort with each other.

Then Saturday I woke up and saw I had a missed call and voicemail from her, from 4.30am in the morning. I listened to the voicemail and it was like an accidental call but went on for 10 minutes. It was clear they were having a blazing drunken row, I could hear her accusing him of having sex with other women, and then him shouting back.. 

So just a drunken row?

She came into work today with really bad cuts up her face, she said she ""fell up the stairs"". As someone who has worked in child protection,  I know there are parts of the body that you don't really injure accidentally. But when I quizzed her, she got really angry and defensive. Myself and her friends advise her to leave him, she just doesn't listen.

What can I do in this situation?",29Apr2019,1
577,"Hi, so I just finished school last year and had the plan of taking a gap year this year to figure out what I want to do just like many others my age. I was quite good at sport at school (hockey and soccer first team captain) and I have always enjoyed sport in general, so I told my parents I want to study Sport Science. They are 100% supportive and that's my plan but that's for next year (2020). 

Right at the beginning of January this year my very good friend got me a job working at a supermarket in the town we went to school in. My position is HR Clerk and when he offered it to me I thought it was great and took the job without thinking everything through completely. Now I'm about 4 months in and I REALLY don't like this job. I work 7 - 5, and most days I'm required to work much later than 5, and the job is just not what I want to do at all. I find it stressful and don't find enjoyment in any of the activities of the job. 

Now I know that quitting is the obvious solution, but that's why I came to r/advice. You see my friend of 9 years got me the job and what's worse is his girlfriend's mom is my boss, the HR manager. So they think I'm enjoying it and all talk to me about it and to each other about it. Plus I don't have a plan B so I wouldn't actually have a reason to leave other than the fact that I don't enjoy the job. Also it feels like I would let a lot of other people at work down if I just left.

Been struggling with this situation for a while now and any advice would be helpful and motivating. 

Thanks

578,"Hi, just a little info on the backround. I am a 19 y/o student and in my country, that is the time for graduation. One thing I discovered about myself is, that most of the mistakes I do are not factual or born from the lack of knowledge, but rather the indability to either read the text carefully or just straight up NOT seeing an obvious mistake or the think I need to find on the question itself. That happens even in the abstract cases,where I completely don't see an easy connection in my mind and I just miss it that easily.

Examples being negatively formulated questions (what does NOT include,etc.), having to pick words or mistakes from a wall of text,etc. (Anything, that needs focused perception)

So, kind, warm souls of this Redditorium, do you know any tips as to how to increse this type of perception or any practices/rituals you do to not miss a wall that is right in front of your face ?

I’m moving even farther away, about 2 hours, in a year so I’d like to try to get a little closer before then.

My mom still and will always treat me like I'm a kid. Even though I don't live with my parents anymore, my mom still tells what to do and what not to do. I don't always listen but I wish I could be open with her about what I do. Our relationship has always been very toxic and horrible growing up. I've always wanted that picture perfect family but since I've moved out we've actually finally become closer. I went to the very south end of Mexico with my boyfriend last year (because he used to live there) and she still doesn't know but I one time brought it up if she would be okay with that and she had a complete break down. She would assume the worst to happen to me and was upset for a few days for even suggesting that. So to this day she doesn't know I actually went without telling her as well as 3 other places I went to.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that she thinks every country is unsafe, she just doesn't like the idea of me going without my parents. I've lived in Europe and Asia that I've been to many countries, just with my parents. When I slowly try to approach the idea of going out the country for a trip, then she says I'm too immature and to just save my money. I was lucky to get the job I have because even though I moved out I'm able to pay for my schooling, where I live, and put money aside while still traveling. So I think I'm responsible handling my own money. I've had to lie around her when she would ask me to make plans with her and my family. I don't want to keep lying because I've always wanted a close bond with my mom and talk to her openly about what I do. I already booked plans to go on a trip in August, October, December and I don't know how to bring it up. She's very strict and very traditional. I don't go alone also, I either go with my boyfriend or with friends. I live in the US currently and the furthest she says I can go is just neighboring states, but not anywhere else.

592,"I’m using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have been very close to my neighbors for years. They have 7 kids between 9-18. They are homeschooled via an online school.

 I know this is pretty common now and I applaud parents that have the ability to homeschool their kids.  However, everything relies on the online teachers. The parents are NOT involved at all. The kids do not pass yet they are automatically advanced to the next grade. One child in 3rd grade still cannot read.  The parents go to work instead of sitting with the younger children.   At one point it was the 16 year old in charge overnight .

The youngest child has not started a curriculum. She can barely count to ten and usually can’t do it.  She knows the alphabet song but can’t identify letters or own name.  She should be in 2nd grade. 

Chores are more important than school.  They have them come unload the car when they get home from work while  class is going on or have them assist in car repairs during class. 

All the children are considered “special ed” but it is from a lack of education not determination or special needs.  

If I call CPS I worry what would happen to them.  I have always been who the kids stay with during emergencies and even non emergencies. At one point the children lived with me.  I did their student teacher meetings . They do have another son  who is 22 that lives with them.  Would CPS be able to give the adult child custody if she lives with the parents?  

They also receive a lot of state funds. The mother purposely didn’t marry the father (same dad for all kids) and says he isn’t in the picture for WIC and CHIP benefits.   Yes, I realize the issue with this but the kids will be the only one hurt if they break them up.  But I can’t bare to see them not getting the basic necessity of an education. 
I also fear for my safety if they found out i anonymously called. 

I have looked at the laws for my state and they clearly are not following it for home school children.

I recently got my license, and was planning on getting a job, but I'm waiting to get a job until after I move to Texas. We're moving at the beginning of June. Big problem is that I am needing to rent a place that will allow my 5 animals. Amy (My new stepmom) already has 5 animals in her own house, and she's not going to take in any more. And we bought these animals with the intention of staying in this house for at least a year or two.

Some Background: I am a recent college graduate (December) and I studied Music Education and Multimedia Art Technology. I found I don't enjoy teaching in the classroom, but thankfully I love private lessons, performing, and audio tech jobs. I was immediately employed post-graduation at a small business as their full-time Audio-Editor and Music Curator.  It pays well, but I am SO BORED every single day. I'm talking 4 hours of actual work in an 8.5 hour day; sometimes more, sometimes less. The rest of the time I'm twirling my thumbs, scanning Reddit/Facebook and reading online comics, but I'm over it. I've struggled with depression and anxiety the past few years and was doing quite well until the past month or so, which I strongly put on my job. I am thankful that I give music lessons, work at my church, and occasionally gig, but that isn't enough money for rent, loans, plus fun.

  
What are my options? I've expressed to my manager that I feel I have too much ""down"" time, and she hasn't been much help. I was considering speaking to the bosses above her about possibly having more responsibility or fewer hours, but it makes me nervous. The work I'm doing now isn't very fulfilling so I'm not sure more busy work is what i'm looking for anyways.

599,"This guy used to be one of my favorite friends growing up. I know he was raised by good people, and he’s been dependable throughout my life in friend matters. 

We recently linked up via twitter and had a conversation. He was talking about how he wanted to get out of his city cause he wants to just stack money and pursue his acting career. (He’s been taking actual classes so I know he’s serious). I have a home in another city with an open room, so naturally, I offered him the place to stay. Cheaper rent, good friend, perfect.

He quickly accepted, started applying to jobs in my area, and a few days later came over to talk. This is where my perception has changed. 

He revealed he sold his truck, and he will “figure out” how he will be driving to work. Over the phone he offered to pay the rent up front, and in person, he told me he needed to get some money together. 

I don’t know if I’m being an asshole because I’m cautious, but I’m not completely comfortable with him staying here after our interaction. I am a cynical person so that could be influencing my perception of him. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Throwaway because I don't want people I know to see this  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Lately I've been feeling lonely. I have relatively a lot of friends and I'm very extroverted but whether I'm with them or not I just feel very lonely. I also feel like a burden to everyone (including my mum, teachers and friends) because they always complain about how I talk too much, I'm too loud, I'm annoying etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have a specific close friend group in my tutor class who one of them (N) and I are probably only friends by association since we don't talk much and have nothing in common, the other (T) and I are slowly drifting apart and argue a lot (N and T are very close) and the other (H) who I'm relatively close with, have amazing conversations with and used to share personal problems with but its clear they prefers the other two. I think I'm only 'close' with NTH because I am not really *friends* with the other people in my tutor class (more like acquaintances), we've gone through ~~shi~~ stuff together we are in most classes together and we sometimes have fun and we are around each other.  
&gt;  
&gt;A while ago, I had a thought that my all friends (including NTH) only talked to me when I go up to them first (I'd noticed that I'm usually the person to initiate the conversation) and considered not talking to anyone first to see what would happen with my friends and to try and be the 'quiet kid' so I wouldn't bother everyone but I couldn't go through with it...until today...  
&gt;  
&gt;After feeling quite self-pitiful 2 days ago, I somehow managed to convince myself to do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;At first it was fine. I'd asked N where the other two were and she replied in a seemingly cold, unbothered way (idk I might have read them wrong). After a few minutes I just started feeling sad (not because of N) and as the day went on, the less I talked, the worse I felt (I only responded to people with short answers). Throughout the day, quite a few people (both friends and acquaintances) asked if I was okay because 'I'm usually lively' and it was clear through my face. They tried to start conversations with me - even the people in my tutor group constantly asked and seemed genuinely concerned (one of them even gave me a HUG which is crazy to people who know us) but I just kinda replied with ""I'm fine, thanks"" This all made me fell a little better because I realised that all these people genuinely enjoyed being around me which I hadn't known before, however, I still just felt really sad (idrk how to explain it, sad is the only word that I feel works).  
&gt;  
&gt;Sounds all good right? Wrong.  
&gt;  
&gt;NTH who I believed were my closest friends, who I thought would care even if no one else did, did not care at all . Apart from that short interaction, N did not speak to me. T did not speak to me at all throughout the day and H asked me a couple of questions about something we were both involved in but that's about it. No ""are you okay?"" or ""what's wrong?"", simply just walked past me in the corridors (hallways) / sat next to me (facing away) chatting away within each other. I know they noticed that there was something off with me because they know me the most and my acquaintances even noticed. Even the people in my tutor group started wondering if I'd gotten into an argument with them or something. I always felt like an 'extra' in the group but this kinda confirmed it.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't wanna seem narcissistic or that I want everyone to love me, it's just very tiring when it feels like your constantly the one holding up an unbalanced friendship and always worried about if the friendship is forced and you're just oblivious to it. I also wanted to try and be the 'quiet kid' to stop the complaints and the mini arguments I have with people but I don't think it's for me.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not upset about it but I still feel that 'sad' feeling I had before which is just really weird.  
&gt;  
&gt;Idk what to do because if i decide to end the friendship then I will have no friends / no one to talk to in my tutor class (we have a lot of classes together as a tutor group) and idk if I could be close friends with my other friends in other tutor classes because they tend to be close with others in their classes plus I would't have my favourite conversations I usually have with H but if I keep the friendship I fear I may continue to be left out and maybe pushed further and further away and I really don't know which feels worse.  
&gt;  
&gt;Weird thing is that I kinda wanna just do the same thing tomorrow (idk why - not for attention though) even though I hated the feeling and felt bad for my friends who really just wanted to talk to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, does anyone understand this 'sad' feeling I have / has felt it before?  
&gt;  
&gt;TL;DR I stayed quiet all day and now I don't know if I should end my friendship with my closest friends who I think don't care about me. Also I feel like ~~shi~~ rubbish.",29Apr2019,1
602,"I am currently a 19 year old male who is away at college, and I just received news today that my 15 year-old sister is pregnant with the baby of her 15 year-old boyfriend. Right now I feel like I've failed as an older brother to be there for my sister and to steer her onto the right path of life. I can't stop thinking about how I should have sat down and talked with her more and tried to give her more advice as she's navigating her first year of high school. Me and my mom found out my sister was having sex a few months ago and we both tried to talk to her about the importance of birth control but I guess we both failed cause here we are. Due to an eviction, potential legal issues, and due to her going to a high-end tech school that only accepts kids who live inside the county my sister does not currently live with my mother. She currently lives with her grandparents so that she can stay in the county and keep going to her accelerated progression school. Turns out this was a big fucking mistake because I just found out her grandparents and her boyfriend's parents, who live in the same town as her, have been celebrating this event and may have even been encouraging the kids to go through with it before the pregnancy even happened.. 

Her grandparents and her boyfriend's parents are all treating this event like some kinda fun and exciting game that going to bond their two families closer together and make for a beautiful coming together. None of them seem to be considering the gravity of the situation or the fact that this could fundamentally alter the rest of my sisters life and restrict her from having any semblance of a normal teenage life and will put an undue amount of child raising stress onto a little 15 year old girl. Furthermore I simply don't think my sister is anywhere near ready to raise a child, she has tried keeping pets before and has ended up getting bored of all of them, demanding that they be given away to someone else as she doesn't want to be hassled with the responsibility. The most recent instance of this happening occurred just one year ago when she was 14. This whole situation, and the fact that the families are acting so happy-go-lucky about it makes me completely sick to my stomach.

Honestly I have no idea what I should do, I'm just stuck here paralyzed with feelings of guilt. I feel like I should have commuted to college so that way I could have stayed closer to my sister to help her out and guide her away from situation such as this. I just feel like I've failed her and that I haven't done my part in making sure that she enjoyed a normal and happy childhood. I'm also consumed by this rampant hate for my step grandparents and for her boyfriend's parents for not taking this situation seriously and deciding to treat the entire debacle as if its just another instance of the miracle of life. I just despise them so fucking much. To be clear though, I don't hate my sister for this outcome. I do think her decision is incredibly stupid, but I want to be able to support her anyway that I can so that she doesn't end up completely destroying her life. Currently my biggest fear is that my step grandparents and her boyfriend's family are going to try and talk her into dropping out of high school to take car of the baby, and if that happens I'm scared that its just going to spiral into worse and worse outcomes for her. 

Any advice at all would be helpful, as I am completely at a loss for what to even begin to do right now.

I've lived in care homes since I was 6 and never had a good relationship with my parents or family and I've never been to school which constantly means that I have never really had any friends. I've always been a shy kid with low self-esteem but when I turned 15 (I'm 16 now) I decided I want to try and fix all of that so I started going to the gym and got a home tutor and be more social and I started to feel great I past my maths exams and was in good shape  and had friends for the first time ever and was happy being me but in the past month it's all fallen apart I've not being accepted for college even though I have all the grade I need and I've lost all of my friends as they spend all there time with there girlfriends so we don't really speak anymore and then the most important person in my life has left without even saying goodbye and blamed me for them leaving (which I know is not true but it still hurts) and now I'm under constant pressure to get a job by the care home I live in, I have just lost all motivation for everything because I put all of that effort in and it ends like this so I've starred getting drunk every day (I know that's not the answer but it helps) and if got no money and just feel depressed all the time and I could just be in a shop and start feeling sad because it bring up memories of that person that left and recently I've been suicidal (was taken to the hospital for trying to slit my wrists) and don't know what to do everything just feels pointless and is falling apart.

616,"TL;DR at bottom. 

I work for a retail company who is quickly expanding all over the US. I agreed to join a team to help put together a new store that is scheduled to open on a specific date. I was given the dates I would be gone and and was also warned that sometimes things don’t go according to plan and to “prepare for that.” 

I am flying in along with 8 other people from all over the country to help set this store. When we arrived they told us they haven’t passed inspections and that we won’t be allowed in the building until then....... it’s now been a week and they don’t think we will be allowed inside until “maybe tomorrow.” 

The past week we have been receiving product for the store and processing it outside in the hot Texas sun with pop up tents and pop up tables and then putting the products in shipping containers outside. The idea of having to do this for another week drives me insane. This isn’t what they presented it to be when I agreed. 

Saturday was my 1 year wedding anniversary and I spent it away from my husband so that I could “further my career” but I feel like I’ve been demoted. I’m spending more money than I’m making out here and my daily allowance for food is only $30 a day. It’s very hard to stick to that in Austin. 

We were asked the very first day if we could stay on another week and I sheepishly said yes because I didn’t want to be blacklisted. They took all the names down of those who said no and I knew they wouldn’t allow those people to do anything bigger than their current role because they aren’t “team players.” Aka they don’t just take shit and eat it like I do. 

Now that I’ve spent a week outside my mind has changed and I want out. If they tell me tomorrow that it’s another week outside or another waiting game with the inspector I think I’ll have a panic attack. I’ve already had 2 since I’ve been here. I don’t think my company has sympathy for my situation or the fact that I make $15 an hour to do this. I feel as though if I’m going to be outside working like this I need a raise. This is not at all what I do in my home store for my salary. 

If you can’t tell I’m definitely thinking about quitting. And not just the set team but my job as a whole. I don’t see the point in working for a company I’ve been blacklisted from. I can work retail anywhere for my same salary. 

I know I need to at least get more information tomorrow but I need unbiased advice about how to stay positive or if I’m being unreasonable. Should I throw in the towel? And if so, what’s the most professional way of doing so? 

TLDR:
Company sends me to an unfinished work site where I’m forced to work in unsafe working conditions and I want to quit. Am I being a lil bitch? Should I quit?",29Apr2019,3
617,"

Yesterday, my mom was talking about hi her cutting board was so expensive for the cost(it was one of those bamboo ones with grooves along the side). So I replied with saying that in my old school (I transferred mid year) if I stayed longer I would’ve been able to make one in my wood shop class for 10$.

I then added that I know this because my friend did the same. Coincidentally, my mom had previously asked that friends mom to buy a bamboo cutting from a store. We didn’t have a car so my mom asked them for a favour to buy one when it was half off.(my mom would repay them, obviously)

They said they had something to do so that cutting board business was over.

But when I brought up that my friend made in one wood shop, my mom said that his mom was selfish because she didn’t buy a cutting board for us but “stole” her idea and told my friend to make one. My mom went on and off about how it’s her right to have the cutting board and that they should give her the board.

I,naturally tried to tell my mom what I thought and that it’s a good deed we did, if my friends mom got the cutting board idea from us. We didn’t lose anything and they gained. 

Well, after pointlessly arguing for a few minutes my mom tried to laugh off as a joke, she said she wanted something to do so she started a pointless banter. 

She, in no way, gave off the vibe that this whole thing was a joke. She then blamed me for ruining the mood and not being able to tell a joke. 

What should I do in the situation in the future? Was so right to step in and argue?",29Apr2019,1
618,"So long story short, when I moved into the apartment with this person, I knew they were smoking inside the apartment. I also smoked occasionally, but very rarely. I've since stopped and haven't had a smoke in almost 4 months. He doesn't want to smoke, and has tried to quit numerous times to no avail. He smoked outside the apartment for some time this year, which was great, it didn't stink up the place, but he has for some reason moved back inside (it's winter here and it's getting cold outside, and perhaps he's just lazy). The smell is so unpleasant, and he smokes a lot (like 20 - 30 a day), so you can imagine the smell. I keep my room shut and my bathroom, but I can't really leave my room without coughing and getting a throat sore. The smoke and smell is really affecting my health and my fitness. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is we're friends and he's more established in his job, and so he has given me some discount on the rent, so I'm not paying as much as he is. It's not a drastic difference, but it is a difference. I'm also using his bed. Does this give me a right to confront him about the smoking and tell him to do it outside (or at least ask politely)? Problem is I know him, I'm scared he is going to get an attitude about it bring this passive aggressive vibe into the apartment, and I don't want to deal with that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: he is moving out next month, and then I'm free of the smoke. Should I just stick it out, or confront the situation?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Person I share the apartment with smokes a lot inside the apartment (20 - 30 a day), and it's affecting my health. He is moving out next month, should I wait it out or confront him about it? He is giving me some discount on the rent, and I'm scared if I confront him it will be a bad month with passive aggressive tension from his side for having to go outside.",29Apr2019,1

621,"I moved into a house in March with 3 other girls who I didn't know. Most of them are fine, but one of them is a terror. I found out later that TWO housemates (including the girl whose place in the house I took) moved out due to her antics.

  
I have to constantly remind her to clean up after herself and her friends and she has broken multiple things while drunk including our front door handle rendering it unusable.  What is really stressing me out though is in the past week there have been TWO situations where I come downstairs at early hours of the morning (I'm a night owl) and doors are unlocked OR OPEN (!!!) and her friends (I'm assuming, as they are strangers to me) are coming in &amp; out/meandering about the house while she is passed out drunk. I sent her a LONG text detailing how dangerous this was &amp; how uncomfortable it made me feel and she apologized (once by text, twice in person) only to DO IT AGAIN FOUR DAYS LATER!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I live on the third floor so I don't have to deal with her noise too often, but my other two roommates do and they've just taken to staying with their partners (one of my roommates has even gone so far as to ask the nightmare roommate not to speak to her).

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried to be really kind and supportive as I understand the struggles of alcoholism, while also being firm (I don't believe in being passive) but NOTHING is working. I called a house meeting, I drafted up a roommate agreement, I text her when there's an issue and we talk about it the next day... It's like it all goes in one ear and out the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is that she's not even a bad person and I actually enjoy her perspective on things/don't mind interacting with her - she's just a TERRIBLE housemate.

624,"For a little background information, my sister is getting a divorce, and this has been going on longer than anticipated. A judge decided that it would be in my nephew’s best interest that he stay with me because I am the only uncle he has. Just to emphasize what kind of divorce this is, it is an angry and bitter type of divorce. I have 4 gun safes, 3 of which are in my “hidden” (hidden to my nephew at least) basement while the other one, which is my largest safe, is in my office.

My nephew had to transfer to a nearby school and he was less than pleased, he made that very clear to me and his mother. From the day he moved in to now, he has always been a brick wall to talk to and almost always stays in his room, sometimes I won’t see him the whole weekend. I wouldn’t describe him as an angry or dare-I-say an “edgy” kid, he is just indifferent to the rest of his surroundings. However, about 3 weeks ago he has expressed increasing interest in going to the gun range with me whenever I go to the gun range on the weekends. Before he expressed interest, he would stay home, which he is more than old enough to stay home alone. When he started asking me if he could come, I thought nothing of it because I was the same way when I was his age.

A week ago, I noticed that the tumbler on the safe was always in a different position every time I came home from work (My nephew gets home before I do). I felt a little crazy for taking a picture of the tumbler before I left for work but when I came home, it was definitely in a different position. I asked my nephew if he touched the safe and he said no. He responded rather quickly to my question and I had my doubts about his response at first, but I convinced myself that I must have moved it and just didn’t remember doing that, so I moved on for the rest of the day. After I asked him that question, I stopped finding the safe’s tumbler in different positions. Last Friday I called into work and told my boss I was sick, but I left the house the same time my nephew got on the school bus. I drove around the block and waited for the school bus to leave the area and came back to my house. I normally wouldn’t violate a teenager’s privacy by searching their room, but I did exactly that. I found a notebook with a list of combinations that matched the set of possible combinations of my safe. Around 150 combinations were crossed off and yes, I did spot the correct combination on this list of his.

I put the notebook back where I found it and left the house and waited until my nephew returned to come home as if I really did go to work that day. Since that day I took inventory of the guns and ammo in the safe and I have been checking it every day. And before you ask why I didn’t just take the notebook away, it’s because I don’t want to wake up with a knife in my chest. Or why didn’t I just lock the tumbler from moving, it’s because I can’t, the safe is very old (I inherited it from my parents) and it was made before they started putting locks on the safe tumblers. The 3 safes in the basement have these locks but not the one in my office. I’m very freaked out by this and have no idea what to do about this. The other 3 safes are full and cannot hold anymore guns or ammo and I have no one that I can trust to give these guns to while my nephew is living with me. And no, I cannot move the safe in my office to the basement because it is too large to fit through the door that goes into the basement.

If there’s anything you think could help stop my nephew, or maybe figure out why he wants to get into that safe, please tell me because I’ve never dealt with something like this.",29Apr2019,19
625,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Saturday evening my (M,25) girlfriend (F,22) (I'll call her 'S')  went out for a drink with her friend (who I'll call 'D'). Her friends boyfriend ('J') and some of his friends are also out. 

As the evening goes on, my girlfriend gets a bit drunk, she catches the bracelet I bought her for christmas and breaks it, understandably she gets quite upset about it and has a cry. As a result her makeup now looks like it's been applied by shotgun so her friend suggests they go back to her house and carry on drinking there. So the three of them, plus one of J's friends ('B') head back to D's house. 

This is where shit gets a bit shady. After about half an hour chilling at D's house, everyone's at least a little drunk and D &amp; J bugger off upstairs to have sex. My girlfriend walks into the living room to grab her phone to call a taxi home. B follows her in the room and grabs her ass so she turns around and has a go at him  ""What the fuck do you think you're doing"". B replies ""Get your arse out for me"". ""Fuck off"" She replies. 
B then tells her he really wants to kiss her, she tells him no, and not to bother, at which point he grabs her by the neck, pushes her onto the sofa and forcibly kisses her. She tells him to ""Get the fuck off"" and starts screaming at him, he stops what he's doing, seemingly a bit shocked that his advances have been rejected. 

The guys upstairs hear this and come running down, S goes to the toilet to throw up and by the time she comes out B has left. D and J tell my girlfriend off for making B feel like he's done something wrong by trying it on with her. S gets a taxi home and tells me all about it. 


Now we're in slight disagreement about how to handle the situation.
Going from everything she's told me this sounds like straight up sexual assault to me. Definitely not the worst case by far, but worth reporting because what if he tries it on with someone else who's much more intoxicated and can't say no? I don't think the guy should be put behind bars but at least needs a warning. 

While S says it was a really uncomfortable situation for her, she doesn't think it needs reporting because ""People have done worse things to me before"" and she doesn't want to ruin the guys life over drunken advances that ultimately went nowhere, and the fact that he did stop when she screamed at him. Perhaps he thought she was playing hard to get? 


I'd like some advice on this, I've wrote as much as I know but ultimately I wasn't there to witness the whole thing. I'll answer any questions as best I can. 


A couple of points:
- My girlfriend isn't a big drinker, she rarely goes out, so when she does it doesn't take much to get her drunk. She's also very honest, doubt she'd be lying about any of it.

- I wasn't out with them because I don't get on with D, she's a horribly toxic person but I'd never stop S from her seeing her as I'm not a control freak. I can choose whether or not I want to be around her though.

- Usually she'd be ringing me to pick her up instead of taxis but my car is in the garage at the minute.

632,"This is going to be a long story so ill add chapters to it:

Chapter I- When it was all good

So this all starts a year ago and this was when I would go to college and would get separated from my old classmates. I was good friends with a girl (lets call her M) so me and M were good friends and i even had kind of a crush on her. We knew that we would go to the same college. Another important person in this story is C, he is an old friend from when I was a kid. When the summer holiday came I introduced M to C and we started all going out (more people were in our group i will introduce them later on..). Another person that was in our group is A (my best friend that i consider him to be my brother). We would all hang outside, go to parties and have fun.

Chapter II- Old friends

So in the middle of the summer, in our city there is a big music festival and we all decided to go and have fun. C asked if he could bring a friend, E ( really funny guy, and was pretty depresive) and we agreed. The thing is that one day I was talking to A about M and I realised i did not really have a crush on her as she rejected me once, and that a girl (lets call her L) was kinda cute. A asked me if i liked L and i said yes. I knew that L was hanging out with some old friends from 1st grade and I tought I would hit them up so we can hang out and I could talk to L. So me and A started meeting up with my old friends and less with C and M and the other guys. And M would call me everyday and ask me if we would go outside for a coffee or anything and I would say no and feel really guilty untill she got mad and stopped talking to me.

Chapter III- Everything is falling apart

The festival finally came and M was still mad and C was still good friends with me. While at the festival M wouldnt even make eye contact with me and A which made me feel pretty bad that I neglected her. While at the festival me and E became really good friends and he tried helping me with L and give me advice about talking to her and things. After the festival I had just gotten to know L and thing started to get better with M and me and A would still hang out more with L and her friends but the thing is that L friends (who most of them were old classmates from 1st grade) would have a better attitude to A than to me and after about a month they wouldn't even call me to hang out, I would have to ask A to ask them if I could come.

Chapter IV- Lost my friends

So at this point C started questioning our friendship as I did not speak to him for so much time and I was going out with those old friends but we would still hang out from time to time. One day I was out with A and we met up with the old friends (this was when they would not even call me) and this guy( lets call him T) told me and A a rumor that M had blowed a guy at the festival and after some time me and A left and walked home. On our way home we met up with a good friend of mine (and  of M, lets call him Ed) and we were heading the same way when I asked A if he tought what T said was true. Ed overhears us and tells M everything. She gets mad and we argue (even though I didn say to no one that the rumor was true).At this point me and A were dead to M and she hated us.

Chapter V- Fuck my life

So after me and M argued, everybody came by her side and my last friends were E and A and C was distancing himself from me day by day and A started just hanging out with the old friends (who started making fun of me and just giving me a bad time).
At this point E was my only true friend and as i wouldnt hang out with the old friends me and L were history. The thing is that i was so scared i would be lonely I chose to go on a 6 day trip with the old class in home they might rethink about calling me to hang out. That was the worst idea ever as I got teased and they would keep pranking me to the point i started praying for it to end. When the trip ended i came to the conclusion that i finally came tot he conclusion that E was my only true friend left. Me and E are very good friends and we hang out with some of his friends. E keeps in touch with C and M but M hated me and C just barely talks to me.

Chapter VI- These days

These days i started feeling lonely and depressive, M is mad at me, C is no longer my friend and E was invited to one of C's party that is in 3 days and everyone of my old friends would go but me. E tried convincing C to invite me but he said no without questioning it. Im still thinking how happy I was when i was with M C A E and the other guys. I just cant believe that a rumor can break so many friendships so fast and that some people can change in just a few months. 

I need help, I really like E and his few friends and enjoy hanging out with them, but i feel lonely and just cant stand the fact that I lost my friends. Please help me",29Apr2019,1

I need advice on how to approach this very sensitive topic with my husband, preferably in a way that leads him to getting some help.

She didn't give the ideal response, I was practically on the verge of tears and told her I was scared of people finding out but she was just kinda like ""ohhh i guessed at one point you were"" I decided to not get too worked up, I know I shouldn't  expect people to always give the exact response I want and at the end of the day it was an accepting response. 

So yesterday we were sitting at lunch, and because of my shitty memory I don't remember exactly what she said, but basically she said that it could be useful blackmail, and she wouldn't mine telling people if she ""needed""

This obviously has me scared, and I just kinda tried to forget about it, but I don't really think she was joking. 

Though, my friend has always shown to be accepting of it, even joking about how a lot of her favorite celebrities are gay. Has she been lying or something?

636,"I want to be a composer/audio engineer. I would probably take various jobs, such as writing and/or producing music for ads, movies, television, video games, etc. My ultimate dream is to write pop songs for the top billboard artists.


I told all this to my advisor at college and he told me I should be a “commercial music” major. 


Turns out, all we’ve been learning in all of my classes is JAZZ. Literally nothing but jazz music. Jazz theory, Jazz arranging, jazz piano, jazz improv, jazz history, everything jazz. I’ve never really cared much for jazz music. Just not my thing, I guess. But I thought we would move on to other styles of music and composition, so I didn’t say anything. 


My professors said we will also work on “pop tunes” and “commercial music” as well. I thought that those would be closer to what I want to do for a living. Turns out, “pop” and “commercial” are just fucking subgenres of JAZZ. It’s as if my professors legitimately have no idea that jazz is no longer the most popular genre of music. If I didn’t really care for jazz before, now I actively hate it since learning way too much about it.


I’m even starting to fall behind in many of my classes because I simply just can’t bring myself to care about all the intricate details about jazz. I have no passion for it, like I do with pop music.

637,"TL;DR at the bottom.

So basically, I'm pretty young (19M) and I've had a pretty shit life. Not point in getting into that. I was never an outgoing person but I had no problems forming deep relationships. Due to my shit parents I've always lacked love and affection and so I sought it all in relationships with my friends. There was a point in my life when I was really dependent on my ex-girlfriend. Shit happend, we broke up. It was a really bad time for me. I was one step away from a suicide. And no one helped me. None of my friends cared. Not even the person I loved.

The years passed, my life went even more shit. But I'm actually a really happy person right now. I mean, I have nothing, I have to fight every step in my life, but I managed to just be happy no matter the cricumstances. I'm a happy-go-lucky person. Sometimes life is tough and I just laugh it all of. But in the 3 years I've had pretty much no relationships with people. The fact that I have became happy because I toughened up and worked harder and harder all on my own made it so that I just dont feel any deep connection with anyone. Sure, I do have a few friends. Maybe 6. But they're just people I know. And it sometimes hits me. Sometimes I feel really alone. I have literally no one to talk about my feelings. And so I realised that It'll end badly for me if I continue to live like that. I conctacted my ex (Which I still love, it's weird), and talked with her. She's cool, helped me a bit. And I've come to acknowledge that I need to make connections with people around me deeper. But I can't. Back in the days, when I had no problem with that, I formed deep connections by talking about my problems, hearing about problems of other people, giving advice and getting advice. But right now when I do it, I feel nothing. I can talk all about my shit life, hear about the stories of others. But I still remain cold. And I rarely even do so. I get maybe one message from friends per week.

TL;DR - I've had a shit life. Sought attention in my friends. Had a hard time, no one helped me. Now I'm happy but unable to form deep relationships with other people.

So yeah, people of reddit, what do I do to form deeper connections with my friends? And how do I even start new ones?",29Apr2019,1

I've already talked to her multiple times and admitted that sometimes I will ignore the text because I struggle with depression/anxiety issues and if I'm happy, I know she's going to bring my mood back down.

she was in an abusive

drawn to me and we began texting all day everyday...  a few weeks later her boyfriend broke up with her... partly because he knew she was texting someone else, and he had enough.. it was official, because she moved out and got her own place.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my godmother is having a special birthday this year and wants to mark it by going on a special holiday. It was brought up to me that they'd like me to join them since her daughter will also be going and would love me to be there for company (me and her daughter are very close childhood friends).

When I was 'asked' I didn't confirm yes or no simply because I didn't have a job and was kind of under the impression if I did go they'd pay for me since they knew I wasn't working (talks about paying half or not worrying about paying were floating around). 

One evening, my godmother called my house and asked to speak to me - she wanted to confirm my DOB and name as it appeared on my passport and said they're booking now and they really wanted me to come. I gave it to her and she texted me to tell me it was done and that when I got a job I could tell them that I've booked a holiday.

I am now employed and I'm wondering if I should offer to pay for this holiday out of courtesy since I can actually afford it (even though its expensive!!!) and because they might actually expect me to pay?

My thoughts are:

1) Even though i'm now working and I can afford it, I probably wouldn't have spent the money to go

2) Technically I was kinda 'forced' into going and didn't have much choice because I was booked and told they really want me to come. 

3) Do I mention costs/money at all and if I do how do I mention it to avoid having to pay lol?

Since then hes been on antidepressants. 

Recently hes been helping about the house, redoing the bathroom, repainting the walls, gardening, etc. But other than that I don't think he does much.

646,"(Do not forgive the English, I have been learning it ever since I was able to walk.)

Just to make things clear, the reason I call her a ’baby sister’ instead of a ’little sister’ is because she is six years younger to me. When this incident happened, it was four months before her birthday, so she was a ten-year-old. 

And this happens in the South Asian country of India, where public health is free and good. I live in a suburb of Mumbai, which is the financial capital of the country. I also am from an affluent family, which explains the domestic help. 

I live in a three-floor bungalow (four storeys for the Americans), and our ground floor has only one room and a compound (or a concrete front yard. Honestly, we park bicycles over there and chill on cool evenings or with guests so I don’t know what exactly is it.) This house has belonged to my family ever since my grandfather built it when my father was a child. 

So, about a year ago, in July, I returned home from school to find our grandmother and maid in a panic situation. My sister was inside our house, crying. 

Our grandmother told me that when my sister and the maid were returning home, a female ginger kitten followed them into the house from the bus stop. When they entered, the maid did not close the gate properly, and my sister was too focused on the adorable ginger to focus on anything else. 

A local stray, a black dog who was thought to be a polite boy entered the compound and grabbed the little kitten by the back, breaking it and nearly mauling her to death in front of my sister. A neighbour of ours helped it out from the arsehole dog’s mouth and told his adult child to take the little ginger to the animal hospital (which is government-sponsored i.e. free).

My sister suffered from nightmares and flashbacks from the incident, while our parents tried to contact the helpful man so that we could visit the little ginger. I kept insisting our mother get her therapy, since, as a victim of bullying during my middle school days, I could not bear to see her pain, which you could feel. We finally got contact and me, my sister, and our mother went to the animal hospital, where our little ginger was in the care of an adoptive mother cat and the vets. Her belly was swollen, possibly from worms. She started meowing when she heard my sister’s voice. 
The cat vet told us that she was one of the youngest kittens they had got and that they were trying to get her to poop so that her tummy would be less swollen.

A few days later, our mother lies to us by telling us that she died from stomach worms when the truth was that she died from a broken back. 
Me, being me, told her to get my sister some therapy, which she promptly refused. I asked her several times before giving up on the idea. 

Recently, she's been plagued with flashbacks and nightmares, and she cries often at night. 

I think that this dog is pure evil, from the way he was wagging his tail and sticking his perverted tongue when I was unloading groceries from the car caused me to feel uneasy and ask the car driver to shoo him away. I even tell the neighbours to be careful around him, as our father told us that this dog has bitten many residents of our colony.

Last year I began reflecting more on my financial situation and though I've been able to increase my yearly income every year since starting my careers (8 years now), I still making significantlt less than I would like to. The area I live in is very expensive and I'm starting to feel like within the next 5 years or so, if I am not able to start making a lot more money I'm going to have to leave the area.

Ive been feeling extremely unhappy and havn't been using my Instagram for the last 2 weeks, which only makes me feel guilty and more  stressed out.

655,"  

My best friend is going out with the girl I like.

For a bit of context, I’ve had this crush on a gorgeous girl (she converted me from a boob man to an ass man) for ages now but haven’t really done anything about it mainly due to a lack of self-confidence and testicles. I don’t really talk about it to anybody except my closest friend who has been a far better friend to me than I have been to him, just an all-round great guy.

So naturally I talk to my friend who isn’t exactly knowledgeable when It comes to the Ladies, but he certainly knows much more than me and has a few female friends. He just tells me to try and start a conversation with her outside of school and crack a few jokes since looks aren’t really on my side. I never really texted her and talked outside of school because I’m terrible at carrying a conversation. Anyway, we talk in class and turns out we have a few things in common and to my surprise a similar sense of humour. My friend also happens to sit at our table and since he also has the same sense of humour as me and easy to talk she also got along with him, to the point that I start raising an eyebrow.

I asked him if he liked her because to me it looked they really clicked (more than me and this girl anyway despite my numerous attempts). He convinced me that he didn’t because at the time he was kind of talking to somebody. I believed him to an extent because If he said he did it would get more awkward than it already was. At this point I knew that he wasn’t lying exactly but not really telling me the full story.

The closest I ever got to going out with this girl was when I went to the cinema and another friend cancelled so I had a spare ticket and said fuck it and asked her out. She came but It wasn’t much of a date as there were two of my other friends there.

This Girl eventually stopped coming to school which meant we stopped talking. I was curious but didn’t ask because I felt as If she wanted people to know she would’ve told somebody and I didn’t want to come off as somebody just trying to stick my nose in somebody’s business. Later I found out through another friend that it was because she had severe anxiety or something. 

Anyway, some time goes by the School Prom is coming up. I don’t really make a big deal of it but realise that this could be a good chance and that I should grow a pair and ask her out. The day that I wanted to talk to my friend about it in Lunch period I over heard somebody congratulating him on how he was going with this girl I was planning on asking.

Didn’t really know how to feel, I was happy for him because he’s a nice guy and I could tell they liked each other but couldn’t help feeling a bit betrayed as he knew how much I liked this Girl. I asked him about it and he said he didn’t want to tell me as he knew that I’d feel back stabbed. 

I don’t know what to feel or do, on the one hand I want to punch him, but I don’t think it’s worth wasting a good friendship over.

How do I tell him I’m pissed off, but I don’t want to break the two of them up?

667,"Hey all.

So, I had my first time visit with a new doctor since I've moved.

Each time I go to a medical setting, I get viscerally anxious. I've had bad experiences at doctors, doctors that won't listen, etc., and I am pretty sure this predisposes me to anxiety, combined with nervousness at the fast pace of the appointments and having a hard time speaking up for myself, especially when a doctor seems rushed.

The thing is, my anxiety so dramatically affects me that it raises my blood pressure by 20 points. Every time I go to the doctor I am rated as having high blood pressure or borderline, where my measurements anywhere else read completely normal. I am bigger female, (5'10, 215 lb) and working on losing weight to be healthy (Down 15 lbs so far). I work out at the gym 1.5 hours a time for 3 times a week, walk everywhere I can (averaging over 10,000 steps a day) and eat healthy 90% of the week.

668,"There is this national event which happens every year. I don't participate in it. They have a whole press dept. to cover it properly (reporters, photographers, designers). I'm into photography but never had the guts to try out for press as I usually cover small events and this would freak me out. Also because we have girls school and a boys school and I cover girls school events. I've never been around boys and I get uncomfortable around anyone new, esp boys. 
The press has two heads, one boy and one girl.
My bestfriend and few childhood classmates  are on the deciding committee for press head. We are the senior most so this is the last time I'll be there for the event( I don't attend it ). 
There are no good candidates for girl press head this time (1 was there but she won't be In town that time )  and my bestf  just wants to give it to me. The deciding committee is nominating people and some of my   classmates and the authority in charge agreed upon me as a good nominee. I, in no shape or form , deserve it at all. Plus I wouldn't know what to do at all. My best friend says she'd help me  but I know shell be super busy during the event.  She tells me I'll only need to work with the photographers cause I'm not into writing /reporting etc. The boy press head can handle all that. I know of him as he is someone's brother. He's apparently very chill but I am extremely socially anxious and this has prevented me from accepting  many opportunities , or even having a social life at all.

To begin, I'm a 19 year old male. I've been in a relationship for well over a year now, and we've been living together for about a month. Last week I quit my job where I was making a lot of money because a.) I didn't enjoy it and b.) My supervisor was sexually harrassing me everyday for the last 6 months to the point where I just couldn't bear the idea of coming into work. I quit on the spot and went job hunting, but was only able to secure a part time job in a tobacco shop because my old boss gave me horrible references due to me quitting on the spot. (fuck how I got employee of the month 2 months in a row and was able to get 2 raises in 6 months, right?) I got pulled over that day for running a red light and received a nearly $200 ticket, came home and my girlfriend kicked me out. I've been living in my Jeep since, and I don't know what to do. Feels like a dead end, I've never sunk this low in my life.

Parents are out of the picture. What do you suggest I do so I can move on and progress with my life?

676,"It started my freshman year when my band director and drum instructor targeted me with harassment, exclusion, name calling, the works. Regardless of the fact that I was an exceptional musician and was able to keep up with the band, I was forced to sit out, called names, and generally excluded from band opportunities. My AP English teacher targeted me and my friend based on our looks and struggles with reader aloud despite our abilities in english. (We both passed with straight As). Our school hands out awards for exceptional behavior and leadership. Despite the fact that I've only gotten one detention note all 4 years of high school for being late to school and being described as a leader by my friends, colleagues, and teachers that bonded with me, I am one of the few students who never received any recognition. Everyone who fits the criteria has been recognized at least once except for me. Teachers by default would assume the worst about me without ever having met me and would place priority on other students when providing assistance, advice, and important opportunities. I am rank 15 out of 120 students with a 3.732 GPA out of 4.0 with a very clean record dating back to elementary school. I am now a senior graduating with 18 college credits completed as well as a good academic record. I applied for many scholarships and received none. I received no awards either. Every senior in the top 25 received an award and or multiple scholarships excluding me. 

I do not believe myself to be paranoid or perceiving reality for what it might not be. My parents, grandparents, friends, and even another teacher have recognized this as well with no ideas. 

The only thing that could possibly explain this ridiculous treatment is my personality. I am kind and respectful, however I am very different. My school consists mainly of conservative and ""redneck"" individuals. I have no problem with any of this. I am very much into things my peers are not, such as writing music and playing different instruments, nature, studying eastern culture and philosophy, and alternative things not often practiced in my area. I don't believe or act like any of this makes me superior. I'm also very independent and do not allow my creativity to be over ruled when I can. I'm known to disagree openly with teachers and adults even if I'm the only one. I'm open minded but firm in most of my beliefs. I don't push these beliefs on anyone. I honestly cannot find a reason that would validate this kind of treatment.

If any of you could give me some advice one how I can handle this or do something about, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",29Apr2019,1
677,"I have a degree, and have worked in the hospitality industry for years. I live in Vegas, so it's not unreasonable to have it grow into a career and has shown to be very lucrative. In the past few weeks, the company that I'm working for, perhaps one of the most well-known and reputable corporations in hospitality, has decided to make millions of dollars in mostly job cuts. Where my job is still intact (for now), there has been a tremendous loss of work and what I once thought was a consistent financial income is now not there, and it seems as though the directors AND our union have partnered together and turned against us (another story in it's own).

I see the other tutors and they are so on to it and give good, clear and constructive explanations. I have to teach them how to self-edit (""what do you think could make this sentence flow better?"") and one of the main aims is being enthusiastic and making them feel confident.

I have an exchange student living with my family this year, and she’s from Norway. She’s my age, and quite beautiful, with a fantastic personality. And, being me, I developed a strong feeling of love toward her. 

She seems to enjoy my company, and we drive together often, with some interesting talks. It hasn’t gotten serious between us, but there seems to be some tension. That or I’m making up any tension up. 

The largest dilemmas are these. 

She leaves in just a few months, so if we do get serious, it could be ripped away as soon as it happened. 

I doubt my parents would approve, and they would most likely notice and find a way to stop it. 

If she turns me down, anything we do together will be really awkward, as we’re together often.

A. It works out perfectly, but we have to separate in a few month’s time.

687,"My grandmothers are neighbors in a really small town. I’m currently living with my Moms mom (Becky) while I finish college. My Dads mom (Lee) lives next door, or at least she used too. About 7-8 years ago, Lee had a bad fall and needed surgery which forced her to move in with my Aunt, about 3 hours away. No one else lived in Lee’s house so it has essentially been empty for 8 years but she still pays all the utilities. 

One more thing I should add is that she’s a hoarder; has been my entire life. I’m talking Hoarders on A&amp;E level clutter. In 2002, my Grandfather passed in his sleep and in removing his body, the paramedics dropped him because they couldn’t walk through the house. Well I believe that all of this clutter remaining essentially stagnant for 8 years has caused my other grandmother, Becky, to have a mouse problem.

I figured I would go ahead and write this after an event that occurred this morning; I awoke to fire trucks which Theresa had called to her place of residence because she believed she smelled gas. The fireman proceeded to tell her that the smell was in fact a dead mouse.

691,"Hi all! This is my first post here, so sorry if there's a more specific sub for my situation, but I could use some advice on a minor issue at work. I'm honestly just looking for some light-hearted advice and/or petty brainstorming, so have some fun with it!

Basically, I manage a group at work, and we are based out of an office with one main area and several adjacent rooms for myself and the other group leaders. There is a small round table near the entrance in the main area, and people who aren't in our group but have access to the floor keep using it. They are not supposed to do so without permission, as it is our space, but their bosses have told them that it's okay (despite knowing that it's not) because they don't have as much space. We sometimes need the entire main area for meetings because our group is extremely large, so in order to stop a habit from forming, I always tell non-group members to leave if I see them there. They can be stubborn about leaving even when informed that they are not allowed to be there, so I can only imagine what would happen if I let the habit form and then tried to kick them out only when necessary. But this happens like every week, and I'm getting sick of it.

I don't think asking their bosses to stop this is the answer, because they are the ones pushing this despite knowing they shouldn't (they actually went to the administration about a year ago to try to get them to make our main area ""public,"" at least to them, but the administration took the position that the space is fully my group's due to our comparative size and, relatedly, our space needs).

So I need another way to deal with this. Thoughts? I was thinking about decorating the table with a clear signal that it's OURS, but I could use some ideas on that too. (A giant centerpiece? A big decal?)",29Apr2019,1

* legal name change. i want to give myself a brand new name of my choosing so that i'm less easily traceable and can completely dedicate myself to a new identity 

* new phone/change phone number. maybe use a burner for awhile. i have an iphone and am not completely savvy to all of the ways in which it could be traced/still connected to icloud even if i were to do a factory reset and change the number
* withdraw all cash from bank account OR get new bank account
* pay off student loans (a few thousand right now)
* get a gun license (i'm a 23 year old girl who will be traveling alone, might be a good idea to get some protection)
* sort out how to continue to get prescribed my essential medication (an SNRI and the levothyroxine i take for hypothyroidism).

So, the title, lemme explain, for my whole life (it hasn't been that long) I've always tried to make myself ""funnier"" or humorous so that people, presumably, can like me more. Though doing this, actually puts a strain on me more than help me. Though this does help me at times to be able to carry conversations with fellow students (yes, students, it's 99% cuzza school), but when there's light, there's dark (I actually felt self-conscious writing that, heh, is that a symptom of this whole thing, help on that too please, if that's alright), meaning, that when its bad, (I feel) its really bad, whenever I try to tell a joke at these times I feel like holding myself back, and when I do tell said joke, their reaction usually leaves me feeling bad about myself and re-thinking everything I've ever taught myself (Yeah, so, I watch the channel ""Charisma on Command"" to try and better myself charismatically and mentally ((Peace of mind and stuff))). All this leads me to become more nervous for upcoming social situations (**schoooool**), and actually, recently all this has *prevented* me from going to school, oh and plus the fact that I'm losing my house soon, like, tomorrow? hope not tho... It leads me to miss two weeks plus today of school, one time I even faked a panic attack once cause I didn't have a gumshield for rugby, my thoughts were: *what if they think I'm poor, oh the pity comments I'd get from the teachers and the students...* And honestly, yeah, we are financially troubled right now (me, mom, dad) they've also had a lotta arguments here and there, but they're overall positive parents, and I love them dearly. Oh, and that's also been a problem... Back to the school part for a bit, my school has good people none have really harmed me at all, just, small insults stick, insecurities ya know... To parents now... They have a loophole going on where one tries to be positive, the others angry because in the past *that* parent was angry and when it fails (ok, right now, they're fighting, annoys the hell outta me, Ima continue tho)

I'm a male senior in high school and there is this girl I've known since middle school that started to hangout with me and my friends outside of school (I don't know why, but I didn't care) after a while this girl slowly started showing signs of liking me. She would text me everyday (even with things as little as ""what's your favorite color""), put her head on my shoulder and act like she was asleep, she would say things like ""we're getting married"" (which sounds weird but I just took it as a joke since that's her personality), and grab my hand when I sat next to her. I even talked with her 1 time on the phone/FaceTime for a couple hours and she asked me questions like ""what do you look for in a girl"".

I went with her to a school dance and after the dance we went to in n out and she started texting me and apologizeing for being touchy (we were with other friends and she was sitting across from me) at the dance. I said it was ok and asked if she liked me and she responded with random letters like ""gshsiabeceh"" I just took it as a no and went on with the night. In the car she noticed I wasn't too happy and kept saying ""what's wrong?"" And I said ""you didn't answer my question"". She responded with ""say it out loud right now or I'm not answering."" Again, we were with friends so I didn't want to say it out loud.

After that night I never texted her again until one day she was at one of my female friends house and facetimed me asking why I never texted her after the dance. I never did because I thought she rejected me. After that she came over, and continued to show signs. She also said ""I don't consider you my friend""

One time she texted me out of nowhere and said ""I have a for real question"" and continued to ask ""do you like me?"" ""But don't tell me, tell someone else"". I didn't tell her or anyone else.

Later on I started texting her again and she would read it but never respond, sometimes apologize for it the next day. So, I once again stopped texting her and she continued to ask why I don't text her. I just tell her that she never responds.

One of my friends later tell me that she is dating another guy, which was game over for me so, I was ready to move on.

It turns out that she lied to my friend and wasn't really dating this guy (she just liked him). she started texting me about this guy and wanted my advice on him, I didn't give her any and told her to ask someone else. But, I also asked about myself since she never answered before and she said ""Idk"". And I kept trying to dig the answer out until she said ""I don't want to risk our friendship"". She also denied the fact the she said ""I don't consider you my friend"" earlier during the week.

She later found out that this guy that she was into was doing some hardcore drugs and that made her sad and depressed. She texted me saying that she was sad and depressed and that she wants to hangout. I had friends over so I told her to come over but she didn't want to since I had people over, but I eventually convinced her to.

That was the last time I hung out with her. She asked my friends and I multiple times to hangout but none of them wanna be around her anymore so she stopped asking.

Recently, I was walking with my friend and she was walking the opposite direction. I didn't see her but she grabbed my shoulder and dragged her hand all the way my arm to my hand and said ""why don't you love me anymore"" and kept walking. Because of her personality, I'm not gonna take that litterally.

If you've made it this far thank you for taking the time to read all of it, I know it's a lot but it's also very complicated for me. All of these events happened from January to now. February was the most depressing month for me but since then I've been better. The more this girl is in my life, the more I like her and I want it to stop.

TL;DR: this girl I've known for awhile is showing signs of liking me but also signs of not liking me.

708,"I(19F) moved out of my parents house a year ago now into a flat on my own. I actually ended up having my boyfriend move in with me a couple months later. We hadn't actually been together for long. We got together after I moved out.
I now really miss being at my parents house. Or more I miss the area I lived in and room I had. I've lived in about 9 different houses since we moved around a lot throughout my life and this was the first time I had a decorated room. And a nice garden to sit in and i enjoyed my walks to the beach nearby.
I kind of really want to go back, but with my boyfriend since our relationships actually really good. I also want to move back for money reasons. It's hard being 19 and paying for so much... I have aspirations to do with music that require me to be able to fund a lot of equipment. Which I can't save up for because of bills...

710,"I (21M) am extremely shy and I like this girl (21F) in my class who seems a little bit shy too. I’ve talked to her only a few times during class. She mostly talks to the same group of people in class, who I have also become friends with. We are all the same major btw. Last week, I went with them to get food off campus after class. This is the third time I’ve gone with them, but this is the first time she went with us when I was there too. Me and her both got a ride together with another friend. While in the car, all three of us were talking about whatever the entire ride. I’ve noticed that she’s pretty talkative with them in class, but this time she was unusually quiet (and so was I). We were sitting directly across from each other and being the extremely shy guy I am, I was avoiding eye contact with her so I wouldn’t end up staring at her the entire time (even though I wanted to cause she is just so beautiful oml). When we were all done eating, everyone else had to go home/work. Except me and her still had class later in the day (different classes), so they dropped me and her back off at school. Again, while in the car, we were all talking the entire time. When we got back to campus, we went to the student center to work on homework for the class we had together for about an hour and a half until it was time to leave. During that time, we were sitting right next to each other, but we were both extremely quiet and barely talked unfortunately.

I get to see her again on Tuesday and I plan to ask her to hangout after class again and I will try my best to actually talk to her and get to know her and stuff.

Does any of this mean anything? Is she just shy or is it possible that she may like me? Am I overthinking?

712,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

When I was around 10 years old, I was caught touching my cousin. I think she was one or two years younger than me, but it was consensual. It was mostly just kissing and ""rubbing fronts"" fully clothed, and it was a game we would play as we hid in the closet. After playing that game several times, I was caught by my grandfather's gf. She scolded me and eventually told all family members except my mom, which lead to many relatives isolating my mother and I, wanting to keep me away from their children. I had stopped engaging in secretive sexual play since then.

One or two years later, my mother confronted me about it when my aunt told her about the whole situation. Because I thought I would've gone to jail, I denied it. I was asked again years later when I was 16 if the girl was the one who had done something to me. I denied again that anything had happened. From then on, most family members decided to view my grandpa's gf as a liar or delusional, and I feel extremely guilty about it. 

To explain my behavior: when I was younger, I was told touching was wrong, but I never understood why until I was 13 to 14. All I knew was that it felt good, but it was taboo to the adults. I never knew that it could lead to trauma.

I had played these sexual games before with other kids when I was younger. I remember I was very much curious and had quite a sex drive. I remember coercing one or two kids when I was younger than 10, but only because I thought it was normal and ok to convince them to do so, because it was done to me by an elementary classmate. I regret all of it.

I am 19 years old. I still feel extremely guilty about it, but I know I am not attracted to children and I do not force others to engage in sexual  intercourse with me. I try not to think about what happened because I just want to move on with my life, but every time my mom brings it up, I just feel my heart sink. 

I really don't know whether to tell my family the truth,  if I should apologize to the girl herself, or what. I haven't seen her in years because her family is pretty much distant (for other reasons), but I'm so scared of what the outcome will be. 

What do I do? Am I a terrible person for this? Am I allowed to even move on for what I've done?",29Apr2019,1

Anyways, we were walking around at a track meet one night and one of my friends started walking with us. After that, they started talking through Facebook, that was a few weeks ago. Over time they started talking to each other more and more and finally, after a lot of suspension, I asked my friend if he liked her and he said yes. That was today. I also asked her if she liked him, but she wouldn't tell me if she did or not. I'm at a track meet right now and both of them are here. I've been seeing subtle signs that she is choosing him, like talking to him more than usual and sitting by him. Through out the day,he has been doing things just to piss me off.

There lies my dilemma, if I go for the sandwich course, I'm pretty sure I can succeed, it's something that highly motivates me, but I only get an expert degree.

If I go for the engineering course, I'm not 100% I could make it (I would probably need to take extra math courses on the side), but if I do, I would end up with an engineer diploma.

718,So kind of a two parter in this post. My classmates who I would class as a friend spoke to me today after we were doing work for our drama final piece. During rehearsals we were working with each other to divise a monologue this transitioned into a conversation about my classmates stage fright and I listened intently. It’s been a recent development only starting at about Christmas. The problem is I then asked related questions as the conversation drifted to in general. Bear in mind that at that point I was giving advice about stage fright and told her that she should fake it until she makes it. She then told me that she feels worried in social situations like groups of people. I want to be the best friend I can for her so how can I offer support. I already try to work with her ideas and not be dismissive as she is really smart and I’ve told her how most of the class think she’s a brilliant performer.

720,"Late one night I was walking to the train station. I saw a kid, about 14 years old, vandalizing a bike. He broke the light and took the battery.

I spoke to him sterny: ""What the hell are you doing ? Breaking somebodies property ? Didn't your parents raise you right ? "".

To my surprise the kid turns around and starts yelling at me: ""Are you talking shit about my parents ? Who the fuck are you to talk about my parents that way ! ""

... And I was stumped. This scrawny kid was a foot shorter than me, I'm a big guy. My first instinct was to smack him but jesus, you can't hit a kid just like that. 

So I held back and said, rather angily: ""You... are very impolite"".

The kid is not impressed at all and starts rambling about his parents some more. I grumble something like: ""I don't think there are any parents under the stone you crawled from underneath"" ( yeah yeah I know, not a very dignified comeback ) and I give up. I had a train to catch and I walk away. The damn kid is still yelling about his parents in the distance.

723,"I’m just thinking about it because to be honest I don’t know how to classify morality anymore. Maybe I’m seeing things in just black and white, but I’ve been trying to remind myself that everything is gray and morality is man made. Like for example, we have issues with the correlations between God, tragedies such as the Holocaust or slavery, and religion’s concepts. 

A person who I share a hopefully mutual bond with is friends with people who are morally out of the social norm, and is okay with any wrongdoings if they were judged because he benefits from them somehow (he finds them funny). And it made me realize that it applies to our current times. We have a lot of celebrities doing things that, if affected someone close to us that we care about, we would seek revenge in some form. But those celebrities get away with it because of the things they provide, especially if it’s an art form that can be consumed.

Meanwhile I have another friend who has stated he knows of people who kill other people for fun. To live a lifestyle like that, as in to be involved with people like those mentioned, I think you would have to be careful with that. It’s hard to describe but it’s similar to close but not too close.

I get anxious thinking about if people who have done wrongdoings deserve to be accepted by the world. I feel that people with certain negative traits are not to be accepted, but because they are human, they get a pass. But by being friends with or associating with people like that, unless you’ve bonded with them only for beneficial purposes, puts the person in the wrong with them. If Person A harms Person B, and Person C finds out what Person A did and is still friends with them, that would be just like enabling Person A. It’s like those cases of frat guys who rape people on college campuses.

But the issue is when you’re a person who’s done a wrongdoing and “passing off” as normal to everyone else. And that is something that deserves to be accepted with love and forgiveness, but that is also weakness taking form.

It’s difficult because people who have done wrong were people before what happened. There are multiple lifestyles to choose from and all of them have their thoughts and opinions. If a person abuses an animal, do they have a right to advocate against it in the future? Them advocating against it won’t change the fact that they’re as bad a person as the people whose side they aren’t on. It negatively impacts victims of certain scenarios. It’s like a snowball that starts from enabling and becomes something else. 

People are temporary but it’s emotionally confusing. I don’t know if eye for an eye is justifiable. It’s like a weird thing but this is all from the scenario of a “secret” abuser being romantically attached to an actual abuser. Meanwhile for everything I’ve just stated, there are people who send love letters to rapists and murderers in prison. I’m honestly surprised I’m not dead yet",29Apr2019,3

737,"Hi! For notes, I'm a fifteen year old male, never had an official job, only paid favors for family in a sense, and I finally have an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

So after about a month and a half of handing out resumes to every place in my city, Sunday evening, I got a call back from a place; Subway.

&amp;#x200B;

So I told my mom, got all the information I needed from this manager, date and time of interview, location, basically everything you would need to know for an interview, basic stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I bought a dress shirt, similar to Big Smoke's shirt from ""Grand Theft Auto; San Andreas"" except a light blue colour, I plan on wearing jeans, and showering, shaving, combing my hair etc. before my interview as I have a hour of preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest all the same, I have horrific anxiety about how this interview may head. I have no idea what kind of questions to expect, and have a general idea of how to act, in a professional, non joking and serious matter of course to display that I am very interested and wishing to get the job and being able to work part-time for Subway.

&amp;#x200B;

Now another problem is, a friend of mine has also been called into this place for an interview, thirty minutes before mine, and I plan on being about five to ten minutes early so I seem prepared for a job in real time, in the sense of showing up early rather than late.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is unprepared for the job, because when I was looking and showing him a different job somewhere else, a month ago, he thought the hours were crazy. It was a shop, opened two times a week, purely on the weekend, for six hours, and he thought if he worked full hours both days it would be crazy in a sense. He felt it would destroy his education by having no time to study, even with full weekdays, and it would destroy his social life all together, and feels he needs more of a rest in a sense than to have a 'break'.

&amp;#x200B;

Now in no means am I attempting to attack my friend for this whatsoever, I am more so worried where he has references such as political leaders where we live, and his naturalistic charming in a sense personality, where I desperately need a job, in order to pay my family a debt I owe them for a trip I will be going on in a little over a year.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have to ask for two different pieces of advice here; 

1) What can I expect for this job interview, where I am willing to work all hours available for minimum wage where I am still in school, what do I say, how can I improve my chances.

2) After my friends interview, how should I interact with him before my interview, but after his, or should I not acknowledge him? And how can I show that I am a better choice to for this place, even after his interview, without spoiling his name?",29Apr2019,1

And well life got busy and I didn’t always reply, I’d be late by a few days or sometimes for a week or so as our convo would be pretty slow anyway. So anyway fast forward a few years and she went travelling, and she was real late replying to me one time and then I kinda did the same to her as well it was exam time and I too was busy with my own thing. And she got really mad over it, didn’t speak to me for ages and ignored me completely, and then 2 months later wrote me a huge message saying I always took really long to reply and apparently if only call on her when needed,(not true)  etc and she just wanted to end the friendship there and then via text

So we talked it out in person and said ok we’ll move on, but now a few months later it’s kind of just difficult with her, I feel like she relies on me all the time for convo, and it’s pretty much just literal small talk never anything substantial.

And I really feel like I want to say something about it as I’ve felt like this for a few months. At the moment it’s exam time though and I’m not sure if it’s okay to bring up how I’m feeling at all at a stressful time for her, how should I address the whole thing. I’m in need of advice",29Apr2019,1
744,"I recently took a final exam, and the exam that I used to study was unknowingly the exact copy of the final. There was a TA the semester previous who had sent out the final to a classmate, who then shared it with me. I went over it with one of my other classmates; I knew the all answers. I was shocked when the exam I took was the exact same. 

The final exam will have little affect on my final grade, as I didn't need to do well on it to get an A in the class. I still feel guilty. My friends who had shared the exams were relying pretty heavily on the exam in order to do well.

Ethically, I feel terrible. I know the exam existed outside of my social group. I'm not sure what to do. The professor is not one to keep exams the same, so it came as a shock to everyone who had the old exam. I know looking at old exams when they are not given to you by the professor is considered cheating, but this just feels wrong on another level.  

I don't want to tell the professor, as that will most likely drop my grade to an A- and hurt a lot of other people. I need advice, or maybe somebody to objectively look at this scenario. Thanks.",29Apr2019,0

Since then our sex life has been very hit or miss where sometimes it will be awesome but other times we have to stop because something will happen  that will take me out of it: like I'll get tired from going too fast and changing positions quickly, or I'll start to worry about whether or not I can satisfy her and make her cum. 

Its gotten to a point now where shes actively has to suppress her sex drive because I cant keep up. This has caused me to put pressure on myself to satisfy her which only causes me to get in my head more and take myself out it altogether. It sucks because as we initiate sex she gets turned on and I do too but as things progress I just start to lose the drive and take myself out of the moment.

My Gf 19f has a heart of gold, she may get mad at me over the things i do but she typically forgives me. I really don’t deserve her and wish I could let her really know how much i love her. 

Recently I made a 2nd reddit to snoop on my gf as when she gets depressed she tends to open up more on here than she will with people she knows. I initially made it with the pure intent of finding out what bothers her and what I could do to make her feel better. 

Well, she recently told me about a guy she met her on reddit that lives in the same state(me and her have a long distance relationship) and is from the same previous state, today I had the wonderful idea of messaging her and giving her some words of encouragement to help make her day better, and her response surprised me, she mentioned that she recently met a guy that’s a “potential love interest” and how he’s been boosting her confidence a lot recently. Naturally I got upset and extremely defensive. 

I worked up the courage to call her and talk to her about it and she better explained things to me. She told me while yes, she feels she has a crush on the guy, she’s only known him a short period, and the whole experience is “new and exciting” because they have a lot in common. and isn’t ready to let go of “us” she let me know she told him she has a bf and that he actually had a gf and she was intially just planning on making friends with him.

I don't really know where or how to start this but I will give it a go. 

I am a 24 year old female in the midst of a subtle yet ongoing quarter life crisis. I have no idea what I want to do in life, I have a bachelor's degree in Spanish but am not fluent, I am working with an insurance company (a great company, I just am not happy with my specific job), I have no clue what I am good at or how to turn what I think I may be good at into a job. I just feel lost and sad. I had dreams of traveling abroad and teaching English, which I have my certification for but I just don't know where to start and I have a serious SO without a bachelor's degree that will make it harder to go the TEFL route so I am just one lost soul. 

One of the things that I have always wanted and have been somewhat passionate about was becoming fluent in a foreign language (specifically Spanish), or many languages. Which is why I wanted to travel and immerse myself in cultures and languages for months and years at a time, and THEN maybe come back and settle down.

I keeping wondering and asking myself how successful people were so driven and passionate and I keep trying to figure that out for myself BUT I have yet to come up with anything.

765,"The title explains most of it. She said she needed closure and had been feeling this way for some time now, but also understood if I didn't want to talk. For each of us, it was our longest relationship (3 years) and we lived together for almost 2 years of it. During which time I got to know  her family and became close with them as well as her being my best friend in many regards.

We had irreconcilable differences when we had gotten together (issues of her past promiscuity and lying to me about it, messaging ex's/other men and deleting said messages, not willing to establish firm boundaries within inappropriate friendships etc etc) and it culminated in my gradual total despising of her for quite some time. A few months after getting together I went as far as breaking up with her and kicking her out of my family home where I had lived at the time. I, stupidly, folded and tried to make things work, but only to my eventual, personal folly when the pressures of constantly propping her up and having to now be on my own made me lose appreciation for the genuine sincerity that did exist within the feelings we had for one another. I couldn't ever trust her word and somedays I felt I was just waiting to be cheated on as most people who had known her told me was likely to happen. 

I wanted closure after our last fight. I wanted closure after I saw her receipts from the bar she didn't tell me she had been going to. I wanted closure after I'd found out about her kissing Michael, after she still had the audacity to ask me to be her valentine after doing so, after she used me for free meals and sex while actively looking for my replacement.

770," 

Hi! For notes, I'm a fifteen year old male, never had an official job, only paid favors for family in a sense, and I finally have an interview.

So after about a month and a half of handing out resumes to every place in my city, Sunday evening, I got a call back from a place; Subway.

So I told my mom, got all the information I needed from this manager, date and time of interview, location, basically everything you would need to know for an interview, basic stuff.

Today, I bought a dress shirt, similar to Big Smoke's shirt from ""Grand Theft Auto; San Andreas"" except a light blue colour, I plan on wearing jeans, and showering, shaving, combing my hair etc. before my interview as I have a hour of preparation.

To be honest all the same, I have horrific anxiety about how this interview may head. I have no idea what kind of questions to expect, and have a general idea of how to act, in a professional, non joking and serious matter of course to display that I am very interested and wishing to get the job and being able to work part-time for Subway.

Now another problem is, a friend of mine has also been called into this place for an interview, thirty minutes before mine, and I plan on being about five to ten minutes early so I seem prepared for a job in real time, in the sense of showing up early rather than late.

My friend is unprepared for the job, because when I was looking and showing him a different job somewhere else, a month ago, he thought the hours were crazy. It was a shop, opened two times a week, purely on the weekend, for six hours, and he thought if he worked full hours both days it would be crazy in a sense. He felt it would destroy his education by having no time to study, even with full weekdays, and it would destroy his social life all together, and feels he needs more of a rest in a sense than to have a 'break'.

Now in no means am I attempting to attack my friend for this whatsoever, I am more so worried where he has references such as political leaders where we live, and his naturalistic charming in a sense personality, where I desperately need a job, in order to pay my family a debt I owe them for a trip I will be going on in a little over a year.

So I have to ask for two different pieces of advice here;

1. What can I expect for this job interview, where I am willing to work all hours available for minimum wage where I am still in school, what do I say, how can I improve my chances.
2. After my friends interview, how should I interact with him before my interview, but after his, or should I not acknowledge him? And how can I show that I am a better choice to for this place, even after his interview, without spoiling his name?",29Apr2019,1

I've been working for 3 agencies this past year that are owned by the same person, just doing different work at each one.

They didn't fire me, I just didn't have a client. 

So now the other agency I'm working at, my supervisor hears and at one point she mentions she heard what happened and we can just play things by ear. Prior to that she was planning on giving me more clients, now she's hiring more people instead.

I’ve already confronted him about making fun of my depression but he says that I need to stop being such a crybaby (I find that funny, because he’ll get annoyed and lock himself in his room if he sees something he doesn’t like on TV or I say something political). 

I also can’t bring my friends over to spend the night because most of my friends are gay or don’t fit the cookie-cutter mold he likes. I also think it’s really unfair, because my sister disagrees with him ALL the time, rebels, and openly makes fun of him and all he does is shrug and move on. God forbid I say one thing he doesn’t agree with and he yells at me and then tries to have a “serious” conversation with me. 

I can only talk to my friends online and at school about my opinions. I really wish I had an adult to talk to. My dad takes me to a Catholic therapist and all the other adults in my life have the same opinions as my father. I don’t want to talk to my teachers because I don’t trust them/know them too well to dive into a personal convo. 

What should I do? I’m sick of him treating me like an adult and forcing me into political conversations and then act like a baby when I disagree with him.",29Apr2019,1

783,"I (18F) applied for about 6 colleges, 2 of them were prestigious (one was Ivy League, the other wasn't but was just as prestigious). I got into every college except those two. For some reason I'm still very upset about this, even though the college that I ultimately chose is a very good state school, even if it's not prestigious. I think this all stems from a desire to be special and elite. However, I know that I can become special in other ways, and that going to a prestigious college is no guarantee for success, and that prestige ultimately doesn't matter when it comes to job applications.

785,"So, 'loves a strong word' - yes I am fully aware, but I have reason to feel this way. I am 16. Yes, once again I am aware of the typical ""you're too young to fall in love"" and I've got to a point mentally where if you can really prove that to me after reading this, show me how its all just a figment of my immagination and that these feelings are false - then fuck me I wouldn't know how to thank you, as what I have been feeling for the past months is fucking empty and alone (but I'm not depressed dw, I'm sure).

So I met this girl at the beginning of Secondary School, and even at 11 my little mind was going 'please let me sit next to a fit bird in a lesson'. No luck in any, apart from this one - where this girl chose to blank me in any possible way, for probably a coupla months, and even when we were asked to work in pairs she would choose to face the opposite direction and leave me stranded alone (as it was an even numbered table and i was on the edge). 

Well, long story short it came to a point where we sat opposite each other in another subject and even after being moved in the first subject we were put together again. Now she was a mean girl, she really was, she stuck to her friends and in her mind wanted everyone else to hate her coz' she didn't care what anyone else thought - but like em all its just a wall and couldn't be any more false. After a lot of hard work, and I'd say about a year of knowing her, I climbed that wall - to a degree, and learn a lot about why she was this way. When I say she is one of the strongest women I believe I will ever meet I am not joking, coz from the descriptions I had been given - she had not been dealt a fair set of cards in life.

I'd say over the next year our bond became even stronger, I'd had love interests in that time - but only pathetic 12yr old-like relationships (shit didnt even have my first kiss till i was 15). In this time however I was hurt a few times, which made me start to build a wall, and as i got further over hers - mine became bigger I guess. Until one day I'd had enough, felt I couldnt show any more love for her, be there for her anymore than I could, and we stopped - completely. *side note - we shared a best friend, a girl, and rebounds exist even at 14, I learnt that no matter how close you was, girl + girl &gt; girl + boy ... I feel thats enough to say, and would explain to you why she then hated my guts for a good, good time - 6months infact.

Well, we both kinda moved on, both had found ourselves in relationships, mine lasted roughly 2 weeks as 'my mind wasnt in it' (i gave a better explanation dont worry), hers was more like 9months - but he was a cunt (sorry) physically and mentally... Well in this time she was hospitalised for two weeks *side note - she had had depression for the past 1-2years*, coincidentally i was also out of school at the time so was unaware of it all. When we were both back in school we were 15, and had been sat next to each other in a subject (first time in the same subject for a year i'd say). Funnily enough that other girl was also there. Long story short we started to rebuild a friendship, and when she finally told me what had happened to her i think i cried for a solid 30minutes in my bed that night (might not mean much to many, but im a lad who doesnt cry much, yet I am very emotionally intuned with people, due to certain circumstances, so this is extremely unusual).

Skip about a year and 3months, we've both been in relationships again, both matured. I then experinced a girl, who was her mate, who ripped me to pieces and played me like a flute. As a result the girl (i fell in love with) got pissed and stopped having any assosciation with the other (the musician xD). I think it was a couple weeks later when i sat there and first started to realise, that love i had felt for her, the admiration, from when i was 12-14 had never gone. The feelings i had felt when finding out about her bad past experiences had been strengthened by the time she told me abt that two week hospital encounter. I think it had been two months after being close with her again, being the best friends we once was that I had her on a bench in a beautiful park and told her my emotions. 

But, they wasnt reciprocated, 'too much history'. Now shes with another boy, and what hurts me the most is the love in her eyes when she looks at him. He seems nice, he will look after her and be good to her, but doesnt mean i wish it had been me. And what i missed is that i had a chance, and standin at my door i lost my keys for the first time in 3 years - took it as a sign fron the universe nit to proceed. But now i sit here of a night wishing i had made another arrangement to meet up afterwards, not just decided that i wasnt going to try and date her (btw this was in thst 3 months i previously mentioned, just before the musicianl.

So now im in the present day, and i feel fucked. Fee alone. Feel rejected. Feel worthless. Not to top that i have exams soon. I havent been with a girl for more than a year, i dont use social media to try and get girls as im a strong believer in the old way. I get told how I'm supposedly one of the best looking lads at school, one of the smartest, nicest, but no luck - didnt help me get her, just got me friendzoned. And to make it all worse (in my mind) if somehow i got the chance to be with her, i dont think i would be able to, i'd just think abiut hiw intimate her snd her bf wld have been, how when meetin the family - he wlda been doin this, i wld just be anither bf, shes done everything witj him that i wanted ti do. Does that make sense? I want to be with her, but if given the chance i dont think i could.

Idk, i think i just wanted to share what i have had cooped up for all this time. R/Advice was the only one i couls think of.

You may read this and think im pathetic, but tbh thats how i view myself atm and i no longwe want to.

790,"So I have a randomly assigned roomie who sings loudly both in his room and in the common area. When he isn't singing he's humming, yelling at the TV or just making sounds? Our other roommate got kinda pissed a few weeks ago and told him, ""can you stop making weird noises!?"" Since it never goes on too late at night I don't mind it that much. But lately, whenever I have friends over and we're just talking, he'll come out and tell us were being too loud... in the middle of the day. 

He's also constantly asking me for the food I'm eating, almost every time I cook something. He's done it to my friends/ boyfriend too, without even introducing himself first so it's super awkward. He's walked into my room a couple times without knocking or anything. If I'm in the common area reading, cooking, watching TV, ect. he'll come out and ask me a bunch of questions about what I'm doing. I don't want to be rude to him but I shouldn't have to hide in my room when I don't feel like socializing

He told me he had a headache in class (we're college students) and it hurt so much that he started mumbling violent things under his breath so the professor asked him to leave? He once opened our roommate's mail while she was gone even after I told him it's a crime and an invasion of her privacy. When she had a dog in her room, he literally tried to break in with a hair pin to play with the dog!?

It's starting to bother me a lot, especially when I have guests over and he's telling us long, weird stories or trying to get our food. My friend thinks that he's autistic because he can't read social ques. Should I just move my friends into my room the second we walk in from now on?

I was no stranger to this and started to look around grindr.

Basically it lead to me having a lot of overtly sexual chats with other older men, I liked it. But whenever I had to stop somehow and got out of the vibe I started getting this incredible feeling of disgust with myself which led to a bunch of anxiety, which wasn't helped by the fact that I kept cancelling real life meet ups with these men, (I'm Dutch where 16 is the age of consent, so they wanted to meet even when I confessed my age).

795,"Backstory:

My friend and I were pretty much each others only friend in high school. We drifted apart in college, mostly due to me figuring out how to stand up for myself and being more open. And she got more religious and met a guy pretty soon after starting college 

She's been a mess for pretty much the last years. Didnt completely graduate from college. Got married to the guy from above that no one liked (someone offered to pay off her student loans if she DIDNT marry him). Got pregnant within 6 months, didnt tell anyone (even her parents) for 6 months and then proceeded to pretty much raise the kid by herself as her husband works an off shift from her. 

About two years ago her dad was diagnosed with brain cancer and he died a year ago. Since then shes been fighting with her mother and sister because she felt they weren't supporting her enough in her grief. Shes been contacting me a lot basically trying to force me to agree with her, but I refuse to because shes 28...she should be helping her mom, not the other way around.

I just announced to her that I'm 3 months pregnant...and, despite having read the message, she hasnt responded in an entire day. 

I've long since past wanting to tell her that her mother is not her problem, she is. But I also dont want to do that when I know shes been depressive. But this pregnancy announcement has really got me upset. I made sure to tell her before I announced to everyone and shes straight up refusing to answer me. 

I feel like I should move on from this friendship, but I also feel guilty that I'm her only friend and that losing me could seriously hurt her mental state.

798,"Ok boys buckle up because this is a doozie. I don’t know if this is really the right place to post this but I’m desperate at this point.  Also, burner account for obvious reasons.  TL;DR at end.

So I’m 17, male, a junior in high school, currently living in the UK, and a virgin.  My current girlfriend is also 17 and a virgin (at least I’m pretty sure she is), but it isn’t her first time round the horn.  She is my first serious girlfriend, however.  We’ve been dating for a month and a half now and things has escalated pretty well: I’be made it to second base and am on the way to third.  I really like her, and she likes me, and I think we’re both ready to progress to the next level.  However, I’ve encountered a slight broad block...

The last three times I’ve been with her, in the middle of making out, I’ve just—and I shit you not—jizzed my pants.  Full-on, orgasm-and-all ejaculation.  The first time, it was from her grinding up against my dick while we were making out.  Mind you, it was through several layers of clothes and I really shouldn’t have been that around, but I was.  The second and third times, it happened almost as soon as we started making out.  Every time it completely ruins any possibilities of things progressing forward, as my focus is no longer on having a good time but instead on how I’m going to prevent her from realizing what happened.  Not to mention that it competitive kills any sex drive I have immediately.  I’ve managed to cover it up these first few times, although it wasn’t easy as I had to prevent her, her parents, and her two older brothers from seeing the massive jizz stain on my pants as I walked out of her house.  Needless to say, every time I left feeling miserable.

Like I said, I’m a virgin, and while this girl wasn’t my first kiss, this is the furthest I’ve gone with a girl before.  Also, the first few times we made out, despite her grinding up on me these times, I didn’t have anything close to this happen.  I’m wondering if maybe I’m getting in my head, or what.  It’s presented itself as a major problem, as it’s stopping me from going any further with her.  Beyond that, if this keeps happening, eventually someone will realize what’s going on.  I really don’t know what to do here.  My only idea is to jack off right before our dates so I won’t be as easily aroused, but I don’t want to disappoint her with a small load of things to get more sexual...

Again, any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!

802,"Redditors, I'd like your take on me (19F) &amp; my grandma (+60F) going on a trip to Israel.
My maternal grandmother called me about an offer. This offer being a fully paid trip from her to Israel on Nov. 11th - 22nd. I'd be travelling with her plus people from endtime.com a nonprofit religious organization.

The offer's much appreciated; but I'm hesitant. Geographically &amp; for my generation growing up most of my childhood on national news involved issues going on in the Middle East to good people. I'm not being discriminatory by any means just afraid given it's an entirely new area that I don't know much about other than what global news stations say. And we all know how truthful they can be at times. 😑
I've been told so long as I'm not near the border of the warzones or secluded areas that I'd be safe in populated places just fine.

With that said I'd also want to educate myself better on ettiquite/mannerisms as best I can about the area. Especially since sometimes I can come across as blunt and apathetic when I don't mean to; it's just how I was raised to either speak up or not at all.

Another thing is I'm not one for religion. I have my own beliefs and question it like rebirth I find intriguing. I don't mind what others believe in so long as they don't rudely change people to believe in what they believe in. The issue for me is I'd feel like I'm joining on something that I'd be unwanted in that another person could of had the chance to take? I'd feel even worse ruining another's chance to travel somewhere that they'd wish to go to.

I'm not sure what to think of it... The offer's greatly appreciated from my gran; but I'm not too big a fan on leaving the US given I don't leave Oregon very much to begin with... I've traveled abroad in late middle school with a family on a Caribbean trip but that was also fairly close to the states than going to Africa.
It'd be entirely out of my comfort zone. I had discussed this with my mom &amp; my boyfriend. My boyfriend is fine with me going as he knows I won't be stupid about it but has mentioned the religious group does worry him a tad as he worries about cults sometimes, my mother knows that in the end it is up to me. I know my father will be completely against it &amp; most likely get extremely livid...

Another thing too is I'm a photographer/artist. I'd like to take pictures &amp; draw sceneries as best I can but I don't want to seem... sketchy (no pun intended) taking photos of the architecture or people in markets. I'm more than fine leaving my equipment at home if it would bother the people there not to mention my fear of stupidly leaving it someplace like on a plane or getting it damaged from being a klutz. Although if possible I'd still like to do so.",29Apr2019,2
