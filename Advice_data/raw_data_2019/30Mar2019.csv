0,"I (21F) work in a pub in a small town, everyone knows everyone and gossip spreads really fast. This one guy (let's say Joe) comes in regularly and added me on Facebook, I accepted stupidly, I now realise I shouldn't have but its too late anyway. So he's a really nice guy but I'm not interested, I didn't reply to his messages until I heard that everyone knew I wasn't reply and I felt super guilty and like I had no choice but to reply. Now we message (me rarely and always trying to keep a distance) but Joe said he bought me a gift and wanted to give it to me. I said he could come in at work but he said he wanted to do it secretly. Now I feel like he's manipulating me into having no choice but to go to his house or tell him where I live (the two options he suggested) or he'll tell everyone in my town that I'm being unkind to him again. What should I do? If I tell him to back off it could seriously damage my reputation but if i give in I'm not sure I feel comfortable at his house alone...
Thank you for any advice.

1,"A year ago I (23f) got medically denied to join the military and ever since then my fiance has told me that I haven't really  been the same since.
Lately I feel as if I dont know what to do or how to deal with it and have no motivation for anything let alone put an effort in life and that leads to my irritability and causing me to get mad iver the simplest things and going from ""0 to 100"" in a matter of seconds. 
I feel as if something is off but can't put my finger on it.

2,"I am originally from Tampa but now live in the west coast of the US. I am planning a Labor Day vacation in Miami (where I went to school,) and renting a place with some of my closest college friends. Due to a restriction on my remaining vacation days, I can only take that Friday and Monday (a holiday,) off. 

Here’s the issue: how do I break it to my family that I may not be able to see them during my weekend visit? I’m torn up about it even though I’ve visited my family every year, even taking a week off last year to help my mother recover from surgery. I haven’t seen my friends in nearly five years and a girl’s weekend is badly needed as I’ve been incredibly lonely and depressed. I’ve had a very hard time making friends I can relate to where I currently live and miss my friends back home. 

At the same time, I don’t want to hurt my mom and adult sister’s feelings by not being able to see them even though I’m in the state. I know my Caribbean mom is going to be extremely offended. I’ve offered to help pay for airfare for them to come see me but they don’t seem to want to ever do that. 

Any advice? ",30Mar2019,1
3,"I’ve been dating this guy for almost a year now and before we started dating he’s dated 2 other girls that I knew separate from him, I knew both of them but they weren’t my friends per say. I know I am good girlfriend and I know he cares about me but I can’t get over the fact that he’s dated them. When we started university I started to hang out with one of his exes and we came to be very close and this whole time my boyfriend didn’t really say much about it. I don’t hang out with her much now because I knew it sort of made him uncomfortable when he would come hang out with us and other friends and because she’s just... crazy. 

I don’t know why recently I’ve felt so insecure about our relationship and I know that they’ve done “stuff” because he’s told me about one event. The way that he told me about this event really upset me, he was gonna bring it up then he said nevermind but I know he wanted me to know because he kept pushing it and saying that I shouldn’t know and that it’s not a big deal but that makes you want to know more right! Especially if it’s your boyfriend. I never have said anything about “stuff” that me and my ex have done ever nor have I ever pushed it on to him. I brought the issue up to him recently and I was expecting some reassurance about our relationship but he didn’t really say what I wanted him to say, I even texted him about it and apologized for the 3rd time about brining it and he left the message opened and I know he’s gonna change the conversation. It just upsets me that I’m so insecure about our relationship and the way that he treats the situation is so awkward that he makes me second guess myself. I felt so much. Better when I tried to talk to him about it but after 5 seconds I felt like shit because he just didn’t really say what I wanted him to say and I know im crazy for thinking like that. How do I get over this because it just bothers me so much and I constantly think about it. I just want to be comfortable with the fact that he’s been with other girls AND I want him to reassure me about our relationship. I’m his longest relationship compared to the other 2 by far so I know I’m not a bad girlfriend haha. I don’t want to keep bringing it up I hope that other night was the last time I ever bring it up but just the way he treated the conversation made me upset. I don’t want him to think that I think about his exes because I don’t. 

Sorry this was more of a ramble and I hope I explained everything right. I don’t want to fight or force him into this conversation but it just irks me, how did you get over the fact that your boyfriend has dated other people. ",30Mar2019,1
4,"Let's call the woman Kay. 

Ex #1 

Kay dated Alex, I dated Alex after Kay. I was 19, I lived with Alex and we were together three years. 

Ex #2 

James and I dated for under a year when I was 21, James and I became friends again recently. James often mentioned his ex Kay (who he dated after me, for five years) but it never occurred to me that this was the same woman. 

Ex #3 

A month ago James and I were talking about another ex, Ben (my first real boyfriend and who I lost my virginity to, I was with him when I was 16 for three years), for some reason James mentioned how he'd met him via Kay (who dated Ben after me, for a year, before then dating James) and it all suddenly dawned on me who Kay was and she'd dated three of my ex's.

I don't know but it freaks me out, two of those ex's were significant and that she's still so close to James is a bit weird to me. I see her from time to time, I wonder if she realizes we have this connect and if she thinks it's weird too.

7," I got played bad.

A girl added me on Facebook. We talked for about a week and she wanted to video call, and she wanted to get sexy. I was recently dumped, I had some drinks, and I have been having a hard time with my career lately, plus you're in this thread so you know what happened. She got video of me and she threatened to send the footage to my family and friends, sending photos of messenger with my pictures ready to be sent to my young brother. She had a list of links saved of my contacts including my grandparents.

I panicked, and I paid the ransom of $500. After having some time to learn about this I know I should have ignored and blocked from the start, but that's not what happened. Now I deactivated, privatised, and removed all forms of social media or anything my name can be found in. I filed a report on some online place that was recommended in an article. I reported and got the scammer banned from Facebook. I also told my parents, and brothers to deactivate their accounts for a week. Soon I will have to explain to them why.

I am petrified to open up my social media accounts under my name again, now that they know I am willing to pay. Should I ever open my accounts again? If they contact me again, I will ignore and not pay, but I really need advice on next steps.",30Mar2019,0
8,"So as the title says I need some help.

Because my father died some years ago and mom can't take care of my brother M\[18\], I M\[22\] must take care of his education in school, in a few months he is having a big exam at the end of highschool, I think outside my country is named ""maturity exam"". If he can pass it, he can go to college. I don't know how to make him understand how important is this exam. He lies to me constantly without any shame about studying and school(he intentionally misses some classes). Here is what I tried:

\-talking calmly with him about the importance of this exam

\-explaining to him that is not that hard to start studying(he studied very little in his life)

\-trying to motivate him with some things from the book Mini Habits

\-tried to keep a friendly relationship with him so he can see me as a brother that can talk too but I think he feares me because I m trying to make him study

\- making a study program, 3 hours daily after school(his ideea), but he didn't follow it

\-checking him a few days a week via phone

I m far from home and can't check if he is studying so recently I told him that I want him to say to me what did he studied alone for the exam but I bet he ""forgot"" it. One night when I was home, I think we had a brothers moment and I asked him nicely what is happening to him, he told me that he just can't study, don't know for sure if he is procrastinating or he doesn't want to, or both, or something else.

I need some advice on how to help him, I know that I m putting a little pressure on him, I tried leaving him alone for 2 week to see what is doing, 6/7 days every evening goes to a pub. I think this is important: I m in college, final year and my family sometimes compares him to me, look where (me) is, you can be like him and something similar.

9,"So next September I'll be going into my second year at university. For my first year, I lived on campus away from home, and its been one of the greatest experiences of my life. I've been planning on finding a place with a few friends to live for next semester, but my mom has just brought up some stuff thats left me struggling.

She's explained to me how much more the costs are when living away from home, and that it would be smarter to try and apply to a university closer to home and live there. Now this closer university is considered much worse than the current one I go to, and I have heard from people that it is a very unpleasant environment (this is more of a university that people go to to transfer to a better one). If I were to get a place, I'd most likely have to pay for a whole year, despite only being there for around 8 months. This would be a lot of money I'd have to mostly pay out of my own pocket, since student loans won't cover those costs if I'm not studying, and my parents aren't in a position to be paying for all that. I'm already getting student loans, and my mom has said how the costs of those loans would be very high by the time I have my bachelor's degree. Another reason for not wanting to live at home, is that the environment at my home can get very toxic which becomes mentally exhausting for me. Also, I'd be leaving all the new friends I've made this year, and there wouldn't be a lot of friends back home.

Overall, I understand that my mom is mostly looking out to guide me for my future, but I'm not sure if those costs are worth the experiences and friendships I'd be missing out on, and the stresses and loneliness I'd be taking on.",30Mar2019,1
10,"Long story short I met this guy checking me out at a local bar/nightclub and met up with him later and decided to hook up at his place. He seemed nice enough and we kept talking online every day and got a takeaway dinner and chocolates and I stayed the night at his watching netflix, joking around and hooking up and staying over (he lives on the other side of the city). He always kisses me hello and good bye which puts me off guard as in previous casual sex relationships never kissed the guys at all.


I have been sick with a bad cold for the past week and a half and he invited me yesterday out to his but I was in class and didn't reply. A friend contacted him to come over and he told me but sent me a screencap of him saying he was waiting to hear back from a friend who was going to come over.


Anyway, I said I'm fine either way and it's fine if he wants to hang out with his friend and he said, ""it would prob be better as he got all excited about me coming over when I was waiting on your reply""...


Don't know if it was an intentional guilt trip but I didn't like the way he worded it. I was disappointed understandably at the change of plans.


**He then said that he'd take me out for a movie and dinner at a nice restaurant and then back to his on Tues, partly to make up and partly to reward me for getting a big assignment in that day.**


I don't know if this is a date or not? Does it sound like one? Or could it just be a friends thing. I'm a bit worried because:


**A.** I have never really dated since high school so don't really know the process.

**B.** Have a fear of commitment in a way. I always worry about breaking up or the potential this person might be the one I marry/spend my life with.

**C.** Don't know if I feel that way about him. I enjoy his company as a friend but have been participating in it more as a fwb sort of situation and for fun. I do feel something for him but I don't think it's more friendship and lust. I feel a sense of security and warmth though. Is it to early to tell? I don't want to hurt anyone if I don't end up feeling that way and they do.",30Mar2019,1
11,"So abit of backstory about the cabin and farm: my dad and his family built it when he was 14-15. Right below the cabin is or was should i say a farm where we park our car  (last guy died without kids in like 1980 or something) my dad knew the people on the farm well and sometimes worked there in the summer with his brothers. 



So basicly ive been scared of the dark and stuff for all my life but less and less as i got older. And each time we park at the farm ive always been kinda scared but my dad was always calm so i didnt think much of it. Now that im old enough to go there alone ive pretty much decided not to go bcus im scared. Btw there were 3 different farms there but the houses is next to eachother. The fact that 2 people mysteriusly died there doesnt help either, and the family didnt want to talk about it doesnt help either. My dads 2 older brothers have never been there overnight alone and ive got a sneaking suspision 1 of them is scared aswell.



But what i came here for was to ask if there was anything i could do to become less scared. I have so many good memories from there and i want to bring them on to mi kids when i get older.

14,"So let me start off this story saying I used to be the type of guy r/niceguys makes fun of (to a mild extent). As I got older I started realizing that I should just be direct and stop being a pussy to get girls, and it worked really well. As soon as I hit college something just clicked. I started having a lot of meaningless sex and became the opposite side of the nice guy spectrum from where I was before (it also helped I got slightly more attractive but not by an insane amount). 

It was really fun at the beginning but as time went on I wanted a relationship more. It is also worth noting that although I became more douchey I am still a weird guy. I have the type of personality where some people like me a lot, and some people don’t. What I have noticed however, is that I grow on people a lot the more they know me. 

What typically happened in these hookups is that the girls would begin to develop feelings for me and I had zero interest in them. I was pretty good about not leading people on so I would typically end it when I got bored. Throughout this whole personality progression I started to realize that I can’t think of any girl that I like. I still wanted a relationship but I just wasn’t having the romantic feelings towards any girls the same way I was when I was younger. I also have a lot of female friends that I’m close with. Back in the day I used to like all of them but now I have no romantic interest in any of them. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I still have had crushes on people once I went through this personality change, but much less often. I have never been interested in the girl I was hooking up with. I realized I’m very much into the chase. Once I get what I want, I get over it very quickly. The girls I end up liking are always girls that I develop friendships with so I actually get to know their personality. I’m not that picky about looks but I’m very picky about personality. 

So I recently graduated college and moved to a big city. I downloaded the dating apps and have had a ton of success landing dates. The issue is that it takes a lot of time for me to develop feelings for someone and have to know them for awhile. It’s really hard for me to actually like a girl based on going on dates with them where everyone is putting up a front. I have tried seeing girls multiple times even if I’m iffy on them but I never end up developing feelings. Obviously it would make sense to ask a friend out but as I mentioned, I moved to a new city and it’s hard to make a lot of new friends. 

What can I do to improve my ability to develop feelings?",30Mar2019,1

16,"About my skills and experience: I’m 28, have my MBA, BFA and AS(not that the AS matters at all but what the hell.) I’m a designer and can basically do any type of design and can wear many hats along with having a business background.
I’m currently employed as a “social media manager” at an apparel company. My job there has become far more than that and social media is actually usually on the bottom of my priority list. Salary there is about $40k a year with healthcare. This was my first real job and I’ve been there for 2 years. The job is extremely unfulfilling because basically anything I do there in terms of product design, catalog design or development is thrown by the wayside because of the development process or lack there of. Often times I have no clue what to do for a week at a time because there isn’t anything for me to do. Management is nonexistent. Company culture is let’s see who we can rag on most behind their backs. Emails are usually never returned with important questions and it’s just a shit show. ImBut it’s 3 minutes from home and I’m paying off my student loans. I live in a very small town with almost zero social life and that’s making me hate the job more. 
Out of the blue I get an email about a job opportunity in a bigger town 40 minutes away. Job is a designer (my specific field of design I have a BFA in) plus the guy was interested in my MBA. He works with a bunch of startups and incubators so he thought I would have a dual role. 
So two weeks ago I go in for an interview. Interview is 2.5 hours and the guy talks about himself and the company and how they work more than if I would be a fit. Felt like the first quarter day in the job rather than an interview. He send me home with “homework” do that, thinks I did fine. Today, I met with him again to meet with another current employee there. Again feels like they’ve already hired he and we haven’t talked about employment at all yet. So finally after an hour and a half of walking me through their processes and listening to random phone calls, he sits me down and offers me the job for $45k a year, no benefits. I tell him I have healthcare currently through my work. He says ok I’ll pay for your healthcare. We discuss the MBA, since this is a design job. He tells me that would be part of the role if I wanted it and wouldn’t add to my pay at all. So I tell him I have to think about it over the weekend. He tries to twist my arm and get me to say yes and I told him I don’t shoot from the hip and need to weigh my options. Told him id make a decision by Monday. 
Pros ~ maybe my social life gets better, maybe my career gets much better
Cons ~ after moving or even commuting, it’s not a pay raise, the guy might be crazy, he might also be a genius, I don’t get to spend as much time on my own entrepreneurial projects, I’ll be in a new town where I have some friends but can’t depend on them.

18,"This isn't going to be very coherent, I apologize ahead of time if it's kind of all over the place. Throwaway account. Long-distance relationship. We've met in person before. I'm currently an emotional trainwreck.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating this guy for several years now, and while it was great at first, I can't help but feel like he's unhappy and just won't tell me.

We've broken up and gotten back together several times, the reason for the breakup was always the same: he wasn't happy. The reason he wanted to get back together, was also always the same: He missed me, and realized he made a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like with every subsequent breakup, he's just gotten more and more unhappy. 

Ever since the last one, I've had trouble trusting he won't do it again (he knows this), and It's been difficult for me to be as affectionate as I used to. He broke my heart, several times, but i think the last one really fucked me up. It's not that I don't love or care about him, I just... don't want to have to go through anymore breakups. Honestly, sometimes I regret taking him back the last time.

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff in his life has been going pretty garbage for him, and for the past 2 years, I've lived in constant fear that I'm going to wake up one morning and find he's killed himself. It's absolute havok on my currently incredibly fragile mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly sometimes it feels like he's a completely different person now. He's so much more insecure. He had friends who ignored him, and on several occasions when I didn't reply immediately to something he's asked if I'm ghosting him. I even woke up one morning to find my phone blasted with messages about if i was ignoring him and where i was. (sleeping, I intended to just nap a headache off but ended up going the whole night. I understand concern, but message after message asking me if I'm ignoring him?)

idk, it just feels like he doesn't trust me at all. I have some acquaintances I talk to on occasion and recently I was playing some games with one, my boyfriend started asking me about who this guy was, how I met him (not in a way that was curious either... it sounded like he was upset??) He seemed to get really discouraged about the fact that I knew this guy worked a certain job, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I just, I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells. I've asked him if he's upset about anything or if he wants to talk about anything and all I got was some cryptic shit like 'you could help but you don't know how'. Then tell me how! I can't help you if you won't let me do so!!

I'm also certain he's suffering from depression, but he refuses to seek help or talk to anyone.

idk im just

honestly im kind of in shambles, and ive been having to pretend like im fine because he's incredibly suicidal right now and I'm afraid that if I voice any of this to him he'll feel like even more of a failure than he already does. I don't know what to do, I don't know what I ***can*** do. I know I need to talk to him, but I genuinely can't right now, I'm pretty sure he's reaching the breaking point again and I'll probably have to talk him down from another suicide attempt soon.

19,"Hey everyone, first time posting on this sub so please be kind.

So my boyfriend and I have hit a crossroad in our relationship, we have been dating for 4 months now but have known each other for 4 years. He has a child by a previous girlfriend, and we don't live together, but we do try to see each other as much as we can given its a long-distance relationship. Recently he has told me he wants to join the Navy and I am unsure how to feel about this, the reason he gave me was that he wants the satisfaction of knowing that he served his country in some way and when he took the ASVAB (Military Placement Test) he scored a 91. 

The reason I do not approve however, is because my Step-Father was in the army for 21 years of service, and spent 7 of those years in it when he married my Mother. I've already seen the ups and downs of military life and I don't think my boyfriend quite understands the ramifications of his actions should he choose to sign up, however the way he talks about it makes it seem like a forgone conclusion. He'll be on about 16k at the most, less then I currently earn now, more than likely lose his child due to the sudden instability of the home, and will have to live in barracks for a year with no vehicle as he is going in as enlisted and starting off at the lowest of the low. I'm not ragging on people who do choose to serve, however I believe that this is a bad move for him and he is being too stubborn to see the truth when there are other, better alternatives to this, and I feel like my opinion is being disregarded despite the fact I do have experience within the Military. 

He told me his plan was to go in, serve for 4 years, get out, then start up a contracting business and do day-trading on the stock market. I've told him he would be better off as a Civilian Contractor, but he will not listen to me.

A lot of my family are telling me to just roll with it, then if somebody better comes along just walk away from the relationship, or concentrate on my new job and let him do his thing whilst still being together.

20,"I'm a 20-year old female from a family of three daughters. As the middle child, I have a pretty strong independent streak - I'm currently on a student exchange program in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, where I'm the only girl from my school's group. When my semester's done in the end of April, I'm going on a trip to three other cities in North America: Quebec, Montreal, and New York City. I'm heading to Quebec and Montreal with three other friends, while my NYC trip in May will be a solo one (as I'm the only one from the group with a valid US visa). 

When I told my dad that I'm going to New York City alone, he was pretty concerned of me touring the city without any companions. He'll be going on a trip to Eastern Europe close to the date of my NYC trip, so he offered to fly to NYC from there to accompany me and then fly back to Indonesia together. Although I appreciate his concerns over my safety, I feel that I am an adult first and that I can manage my trip for my own safety. Besides, TBH I feel kind of uneasy having my dad fly all the way from another country just for a 4 day 3 nights trip - it makes me feel like a spoiled rich girl, which I am not and don't want to be. 

Should I accept my dad's offer to accompany me for my NYC trip, or try to convince him that I can manage my security in NYC by myself? Also, for NYC residents, any inputs on how safe NYC would be for a female solo traveler?

21,"I dated a guy (m32) for about 6 years before I met my husband (m31). My ex's mother a absolutely loved me, she was convinced we would get married and have kids together, she used to call me the daughter she never had. At one point things soured between my ex and I, no one's fault, just happened, and we broke up. But he took it badly and would not leave me alone, constantly texting and harassing me to get back together. So I cut off all contact with him and with his family. Because I had to, for my own sake.

Years later I met another guy, my now husband, we fell in love and got pregnant. All is wonderful. 

I have now told my family the happy news and mom ran into my ex-MIL. She couldn't contain herself (She's not the malicious type) and blurted that I'm having a baby. She said my ex-MIL was a bit speechless at first but was very adamant she wants to give me a ""big gift"". Now I really love this lady, she's been nothing but good to me, but I haven't seen or heard from her in years and I think it would be weird for my husband to be put in this situation again. Plus I think it would open the gates for my ex to contact me which I really don't want. And PLUS, I've been told by common friends that my ex is now happy in a new relationship, and I think his mom giving an expensive gift to a pregnant woman who isn't my ex's girlfriend could stir up trouble between my ex and his current partner, which I also don't want.

This could happen before my sister even graduates high school. The way my mom described our situation, its seems that there is 0% chance of any miracle happening. My dad is in denial. Saying that everything will be okay, when he doesn't want to admit its all crashing down. I'm first generation- my parents don't have degrees to get comfy jobs. My mom says she's willing to take on any job she can- babysitting, grocer, etc. The thought of my mom or my dad (who's already nearing retirement age) having to go out to work backbreaking jobs while I go live my dream in NYC ABSOLUTELY breaks my heart. The magnitude of this situation is so bad I don't even know how I can help. My mom says that she has enough money saved up to allow my sister and I to attend our first 2 years of college- after that, we have to take out loans. Originally, I was so excited to go to NYC and turn my passion of designing clothes into something profitable. I'm scared now. That it might not work out. That, while my parents are working their asses off I'll be unsuccessful and lose everything I have left. My mom keeps reassuring me that it'll be okay- and all I can do is focus on my studies. I'm in an internship earning money (I don't get paid much), but it cant help alleviate any of our problems. I want to do something for my family, but I don't know what.",30Mar2019,1
23,"He said I make him feel like the boss because he can mentor me in life cause I need help. Cause I listen to him and don’t question him hardly. Cause I go with the flow with what he wants. They dated for seven years. He said he feels superior to me intelligence wise and career wise. 

He said she is too smart, too quick, and challenges him too much physically, emotionally, and intellectually. He tells her I have emotional problems and need someone there cause I’m fragile. That he’s giving me a shot and if we don’t workout (which he told her he doesn’t think we will) at least he made me a better person. He told her his life is perfect except his relationship with me causes him angst at times. 

She’s super independent and travels alone and works out and has a good job and is a fitness model in addition to being a doctor and she was a college athlete and was an honors student. I just slid by in school, hate working out, and got a job in sales.

I snooped on his phone cause she kept calling him and realized a few things after reading their convos and our talks about her in the past. 

 I think he made his ex into a dependent person and she ended up getting fed up with it and left him when she realized she could be a complete and independent person on her own.

Yeah. Apparently when they met she had just moved to their city and had no friends. She only had him to hangout with for a few years while she stayed at home and went to community college which he was embarrassed to tell people about. He wouldn’t hang with her family and made excuses to leave because they made him feel weird. They only hung with his family and she loved them so she abandoned hers for his because he never seemed excited to be with her family. She then went to a top university and found a close group of friends and he alienated himself from her. She then became a much better person and was involved in her school, picked up extra jobs (he never worked in college), did her AND his schoolwork so he could pass, and she graduated as an honors student from a top 30 university and got a job with a promising future and made more money than him. He cheated and blamed her for her being too controlling which is why he said he cheated but begged for her back when the new girl left him. He used to prevent her from leaving the house when they fought and also would stalk her location on her phone when they broke up so he could creep on what she was doing and would even secretly hide at places and watch her do stuff when she hung with her friends. She said she wishes she could record their convos because he always denied what he said previously if it didn’t currently benefit him and apologized for her feelings instead of his actions that caused those feelings. She thought all this shitty behavior was due to him being young. 

He now tells her he admires her independence and how she always tries to be her best yet says he loves how I make him feel he is the man and I don’t really fight back and I do as he says. He also says he isn’t excited about our future together but is giving me a chance. We have dated 1 year 

He once told her I can have my pick of the litter cause I am a college athlete, I have a nice car, live in a high rise, and owns a company (he works for his moms company)

Also, why won’t he date her if she’s that cool and wants to date him. She feels she ruined the relationship and learned to just submit to what he says because if not he will deny everything she says and make her feel she is crazy and is the problem so therefore she thinks she causes him to act in certain ways and if she was better he would treat her better. 

WHY WONT HE LEAVE ME IF HE THINKS SO POORLY OF ME ?

Edit: I reached out to the ex today and literally he would tell her she was so annoying and stressful and was ruining his life so she said okay bye then and he would get so mad and say why is that your default response to issues we have? And she told him it’s because he didn’t seem happy and she wasn’t going to make someone he with her. And he would get upset and ask her to not leave when he literally just told her he was miserable with her

28,"Sorry for the long post but I need some advice from you all. So I have been with my wife for almost 2 years and we have been together for 12 years, we are bother the same age mid 20's. We had recently bought a house, and things had been going well. A short while after we had gotten a puppy. After getting him I feel like we are growing apart, we have been fighting more, not just about the puppy but just in general. It feels like the puppy just demands so much out of both of us. It is putting us on edge. It feels like the dog is driving a wedge between us. I hope its just the puppy phase but  he wont nap unless he is laying on one of us.(unless he is put down for the night in his kennel) I feel like things are not like they used to be before we got him.The wife works mid nights so when she is sleeping I have to take care of him, and she has to take care of him when I am at work. I think this is the biggest problem, we cant do the things that let us relax and unwind after work. The dog just demands all of your attention. For me that is playing video games, for the most part computer games. Before we got the puppy I would get almost 4 and a half hours to do what ever I want,  I am not sure if this is just me being selfish but I need that time. I can relax after work not have to worry about anything. Is this what I have to look forward to the rest of my life? Part of me knows being an adult means having responsibilities, but I want time for myself, to be me, to be alone, and just zone out. With the puppy I have to take care of him and by the time he finally goes to sleep I am lucky to get a hour and a half to mess around on my laptop, like right now. I know the puppy phase will end and he will get more independent and I just can't wait for that time to come. This does raise another issue the idea of having kids has come up, and I don't think I am ready for that, and currently the wife has been getting some crazy baby fever and I am not sure what to say. I feel like it's a bit off the nose to say I do not want kids cuz I am lazy and don't want to deal with raising a kid. Some days like today I just feel like how easy life would be to just be alone. Live in my own place be able to be free. I love my wife but I feel like we have been drifting apart, like I said before we are fighting more, maybe I am just in a rut, but I just don't feel like myself. ",30Mar2019,1

31,I'm 17 and have been out of high school for about 4 months. During my time in school I would fake sick and smoke weed all day. I have social phobia and the school environment was quite stressful for me. To get over this I would smoke weed and never do schoolwork. I graduated with a B grade average and got into a science degree at Uni. I dropped out as science is not what I wanna do with my life. Now I am unemployed and do nothing but get high all day. I don't think i am depressed but whenever i feel sad i smoke weed. Only recently have i started feeling like i could be getting more out of life. I love music but can never be motivated enough to make it (probs because of weed). Has anyone been through something similar? I think if i manage to smoke less i could motivate myself to get a job and improve my life as i know i cant smoke weed forever.,30Mar2019,1
32,"So I've been dating this girl for a little more than a month now and just today one of her exes shows up at our hang out spot. Right off the bat, he starts acting all macho and passive aggressive towards me. I didn't really care that much because I dealt with people like this. My girlfriend got really pissed off and outright told him to fuck off. I was surprised by this but I was glad because it meant I didn't have to put effort into getting him to leave us alone. Boy was I wrong.  He came back, did the same routine. I'll be the first to admit I'm not very confrontational. I prefer to trick people into thinking they've won the argument. But he started to get sort of, passively physical. Like we were a couple of best friends who wrestled each other all the time. But I had never really talked to him before this, I knew he was a bit of a dick but not to this degree. And my girlfriend straight-up threatened him and told him if he didn't leave us alone she would put him six feet under. I have never seen her so angry. But wait, there's more. He STILL didn't take the hint. But this time he used his friends as an excuse to come over to us. My girlfriend gave him a death glare and instead of walking away as any reasonable person would, he walks over to her and tries to stroke her hair. I'm normally pretty calm and collected but that pissed me off beyond belief. She looked scared. I had known the threats were just a facade but I didn't say anything because it was working. But this time she looked scared. She yelled at him and I guess that did it because he left. Soon after this, we left. I know this isn't the first time he's done this and it most likely won't be the last time. I'm just wondering what I should do.

34,"Right so this is my first time posting here so bare with me.

I'm going to start by explaining my friendship group so you can understand the situation a little better. I'm currently a second year student, and my girlfriend a first year student at a university. She lives in halls and I stay with her often as her flatmates are our close friends.

We as a group smoke are probably considered stoners so take that as you will. On to the story at hand.

There was recently a spare room in my girlfriends halls, and a girl relocated from another flat in the same halls because of a last conflict with her old flatmates. When she moved in she seemed to be a nice person however she made it clear that she was entirely anti-drugs. Like anything, people doing them, seeing them, being associated with people using them, you get the point. I should probably include that the people we hang around with also shout out spontaneous phrases like ""DOOB"" when we think of smoking because it's like an inside joke. But we have had to like refrain entirely from saying anything related to smoking, and we never ever smoke or have smoked inside so it's not a problem for the flat.

We're pretty sure the girl thinks we're stoners because she keeps asking us about who smokes cigarettes and we're always baked af.

Shall we just come clean to her and risk her telling the managers of the halls or like keep awkwardly hiding everything. Any help will be appreciated and I apologise in advance if I've made some stupid grammatical mistakes of anything stupid has been said as I'm still BAKED af.

tldr: I'm staying at my girlfriends flat, we're stoners. She has a new flatmate who is entirely anti-drugs. We thinks she's on to us, do we tell her and risk her reporting us?

37,"This is sort of a repost to something I posted earlier. I deleted the old post because I was getting mixed opinions so I decided to just post it with a different title and see what people think.

So recently I went to the doctors. After I was done they gave me referrals to therapy (for stress I’ve been having) and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist asked me a bunch of questions about my past and such. Then he started asking me questions about mental health. The questions he asked me are as follows:

Do you get anxious?: I said yes and went into detail about me getting anxious when I’m with people, anxious when I’m alone, etc etc

Do you hear voices?: I told him I don’t hear voices but I have conversations with “myself”. The reason I say “myself” is cause these conversations are with my subconscious and a sort of “voice” (I say sort of because I don’t hear it physically it’s just in my head head, like how you’re reading this right now, that kind of voice). I have conversations about different things and it’s sort of a therapy voice. I come to it for advice, address problems, it offers support, etc.. it talks to me, sometimes it’s my own thoughts and sometimes it’s from a perspective I hadn’t thought of before.

Do you feel like somethings out to get you?: I told him yes in the sense that I’m paranoid about a lot of things. Like in my house I’m always on high alert when I’m going downstairs for a snack. Just never able to realllyy relax unless I’m in my room. Just like paranoid that something will happen. I told him it probably stems from this one occurrence that happened when I was “sleeping”. I was in the bed with my mom and her ex boyfriend came in the room trying to wake her up. I barely knew the guy so to me it was kind of traumatic having some stranger barge into your room rip off the blankets and try waking your mom up and talking inches away from you. I didn’t tell him this but I’ve had a lot of just random events occur that have kind of ruined public experiences for me. I’ve been robbed twice (one at knife point and one was two guys trying to jump myself and a friend). I’ve also gotten a knife pulled on me while I was out with family.  All of this was in public, broad daylight. Some at school and the others while out.

These were the major questions he asked me (IMO). He then went onto ask me if I knew what schizophrenia was. I told him sorta (I’ve heard about it but I didn’t know the details). He asked me if I’d be comfortable taking therapy (I already am but I didn’t tell him that cause he said it was something like “schizophrenic therapy”). I told him probably, which he followed up with asking if I’d be comfortable with taking prescribed medicine while doing the therapy.

Now I’ve been told a lot that the medicine has a lot of downsides, but I’ve also heard it has upsides. But personally I’m thinking about not taking the pills and seeing if the therapy will work. If it doesn’t then I’ll consider it. 

Do you guys have any opinions on this? Do you guys also think it’s schizophrenia? Any advice? ",30Mar2019,0
38,"Life is just not what it is cracked up to be. I spent my childhood dreaming of adulthood bc my father was so physically and emotionally abusive.

46,"so i have a good group of friends at my university. i was in student halls in first year and met this boy who i will call A. Me and A hit it off right away and became really close. I’ve met his mum and his dogs and we spent loads of time together at first. A has a best friend who he already knew before coming to university called B and in second year we all moved into a flat together. this was great as me and B became really good mates as well however into second year me and A started spending less time together and have sorta drifted.

In first year i introduced A to a girl who he’s been with ever since. Her and her mate are my really good pals who are on the same course as me and we’ve all formed a really great social group which is really supportive. 

me and A have been spending less and less time together while my friendships with the other three have grown so much. over the last year and a bit i’ve really tried to put in the effort to spend more time with him and organise stuff he likes but it hasn’t worked. 

it’s also worth noting that A and B went to the same school and have a really close knit group of ‘home’ mates who live in the city over. i’ve met them loads of time but recently they have stopped inviting me to things after i started calling them out for saying the N word and being super sexist. 

so basically the problem is that the other day was A’s birthday. his mum is paying for a trip for A and B and his girlfriend and her best mate (all four of these guys i would also consider my best friends) and all of A’s home friends.

My GF(19F) and I(21M) have been dating for almost a year now and I've never connected with someone like this before. We're practically connected by the hip from what people tell us and we've been talked about moving out of her aunt's guesthouse after my last year in community college and movement to Uni. 

GF has told me things about her past here and there but I never was able to grasp how atrocious it was until now.

A few days ago one of her ex's showed up with a group of people saying they were going to help her out of this and by this, I mean our relationship. At that time she wasn't home and the group of people referred to my GF as (subname) Brian and using male pro-nouns. After a few weird conversations I pieced together who these people were and that they were referring to my GF. I was calm and told them to come back when she gets back, they were frustrated that I said she as well as her birth name.  I found out later from my GF's aunt that these people used to be her best friends and how nutty they were. Pushing transitioning, drugs, drinking, sexual deeds, and just how they treated her leaving.  My girlfriend dropped them hard, moved to her home state, sought help for everything and eventually started dating me.

GF got back from work and then all hell broke loose. They begged her and went on yelling at each other for a long time and many of them blamed me for her leaving. Suicide was threatened and we ended up having to calling the police after they didn't want to leave. 

They've popped up every so often now and we think they're damaging our property. I'm had to scare them off a few times and every time they end up crying or yell that I'm keeping their friend hostage.

I've been married for 5 years.  I rent a house with my wife (we split the rent).  Our lease is up in October.  We make about $100k/year each. Everything we have is in our own name. I have a car and a toy payment. She has a car payment.  We don't have any kids.  Neither of us has any credit card or other debt.  If we get divorced and split the savings account, we will have about $25k each.

What's the best way to go about this? Neither of us can really afford a second rent to move out, I don't have much family in the state to stay with.

Do I choose a city I like, move, and then worry about a job? Do I find a job I want first and let the job dictate the city?  How do I calculate equivalent salary and living costs in other states?

I'm concerned about finding a job making an equivalent or better salary, and I'm also concerned about choosing a city and regretting it or not being able to find work.

Any advice at all you can give or experiential anecdotes, I'd appreciate it.

I think it’s because I find it so difficult to socialize, so friendships don’t come easily to me. I’ve tried stepping out of my comfort zone this year and met so many wonderful people, but I’m not as close as I wish I could be with them. I just lack close relationships in my life.

I get jealous of my boyfriend as he constantly hangs out with his friends. I get jealous that he has such a close relationship with so many of them, but also that they get to spend so much time together.

Even though I trust my boyfriend completely, I still get jealous when other people show romantic interest in him.

I don’t act on this jealousy, and I don’t restrict him from hanging out with his friends (because I want him to enjoy himself), but I help but to feel envious of his relationships as many of his friends are like siblings to him.

Often times when he is not talking with me, I have no one else to talk to. I don’t want to feel envious since it might make me a toxic person, but I can’t shake the feeling. Help?",30Mar2019,1
54,"(Im posted this twice on relationships but nobody seems to be seeing it so i figured ill try here)

Im 20 &amp; male, living with my parents (54m &amp; 60f) This is kinda long but im hoping someone will read and give me honnest feedback...

Now before i begin, Obviously my view is probably biased but ill try to be as non-biased as i can.

*My parents basically only treat me nice when i do chores and shut up...and only then*

This happened today:
Me and my mom went to get subway because there was no groceries in the house she told me she would buy it since there was no food...she pullrd up and told me to go in. I asked her fornthe money (since she said she would pay) and she said ""okay but i want all the change back"" as if i was gonna steal her money and keep the change....important note...I'm a very honest person to the point of a fault. I once smoked weed as a teenager and felt so guilty that i confessed about it to them and got grounded. I never lie. However she constantly treats me like im a bad guy.

I made a uncomfortable look and said to her.. ""im not gonna steal it?"" and she rumbled off some incoherent stupid thing and somehow changed the subject to me being disrespectful. Eventually i picked up my lunch and all was good however this happend practically everyday and any attempt to stand up for myself or reason with them is met with some form of the ""your disrespectful"" argument.

Later on we decided to order pizza for dinner....
we were all eating dinner and my mom started nagging me at the table about trimming my nails. (My nails were barely dirty...and it was because i had gone on a big walk/hike yesterday and hadnt gotten around to cleaning them).

Then as my mom and dad finished eating my father turned to me and said ""the dog peed on the floor can you clean it?"" Knowing how my father is i annoyingly responded with ""can i finish my dinner first?"" He was offended by my response and said ""you didnt have to be like that""... (Let it be known he never cleans pee or poo and just deligates me and my mom because of his bad back) anyways at this point him and my mom were both diner eating however i was still drinking my beer...

5 minutes go by and he says ""can you go clean that now and come back to your beer after? Its sinking into the hardwood"" Which in his defense while is a fair point. However my mom had already put a paper towel on it to soak the majority of it up and i was about 4 sips away from being finished. So i politely said ""ill do it after im almost done""

He then withour a seconds hesitation (as if he anticipated or planned this) he said ""typical you always gotta be an asshole"" he then proceeded to walk into the the other room and continue to lament nasty things making sure i heard him. Things like: ""good for nothing, asshole, selfish, you dont love us, arrogant, prick"".

I finally had enough so i snapped and said ""shut up"" he then told me to ""fuck off"" and continued lamenting aloud and said that I ""was a nasty drunk"" (because i had drank that 1 beer...keep in mind im 6ft, 270lbs...i didnt feel the beer)....

anyways I just ignored that as ive learned from the past that he gets nasty and punishs me. (He's threatened to kick me out before, hes gotten in my face and told me he was gonna kick my ass)...however this time i just ignored him and he watched tv as if nothing happened....he turned on the TV and if i interupt him and moms TV time i get yelled at....

I feel like this is toxic however they claim they are ""depressed and overwhelmed"" because of my brother (who comit suicide January 2018). Somw part of me feels bad like maybe im doing something wrong. However i cant logically make that connection. They refer to  and treat me like im a peice of shit and i dont understand why....any advice on how to escape, fix this etc, thoughts? Was i wrong?

-18 y/o male
-18 y/o girlfriend (pretend name: Megan)
-Canada

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d appreciate an outside view of the situation and any advice possible.

Ok so Megan and I have been dating since early November, 2018 (about 4 months), and throughout our relationship we have had our ups and downs like many other couples my age. 

Since we’ve met (roughly 2 years ago) she has had many serious health problems that have caused her family to basically fall apart.  Her mother constantly harasses her about the stress that Megan has “put her through” and for the four months I have been constantly trying to cheer her up and make her happy through a number of actions. 

I have offered her a spare room in one of my houses several times however she is reluctant to accept my offer as she feels that it will have an even greater negative effect on her family. 

From all of the stress that seems to be coming from her situation in life, she seems to funnel her frustrations towards myself when she is upset. She often tells me that she hates herself, as well as her life and family, and wishes to not live past 20.  She has recently (for the last 2 months) started treating me very poorly. Some examples of this include blaming me for her unhappiness, making false claims about my friends, and treating me as if I am stupid when we have class together (ie. making fun of me for not understanding something or taking a while to finish a question in calculus).

Although I completely understand why she is acting out in such a way, the past two months have made me feel quite depressed and honestly terrible inside. I’ve had past experiences with friends, and have cut them out of my life before, which has drastically improved my happiness in the past, however I’m not sure if I can break up with the person I love. It doesn’t feel right to be in a relationship with her, however with prom and graduation just around the corner, I just couldn’t fathom how broken she would be if I ended things now.

I’d like your opinion on whether I should continue my futile attempts at making her happier or if I should cut her out to improve my mental state. Maybe there’s a way I could do both?

69,"For the past couple of months, I’ve been steadily becoming more and more resentful of my coworkers, but I really don’t want to be. I’m also not sure if I’m just getting fussy over nothing or if my complaints are really legitimate. So I’m looking to get some objective opinions…

I work as a copyeditor/proofreader and sort of QC person on a team of four people. There’s me, my fellow copyeditor/proofreader associate, Alice (alias), our primary project manager, Kate (alias), and her assistant project manager, Jane (alias). Out situation is this:  

Under normal, reasonable circumstances, Kate and Jane, being the two project managers of our team, would make sure everything is staying on schedule, handle correspondence with the customer, and make sure files are getting sorted and moved properly throughout the day. Alice and I would be in charge of checking proofs and manuscripts. Every day, the customer sends us proofs with corrections. Each day, Alice and I would clean up the customer’s corrections and send them to be processed. In addition to this, any new proofs that come in, we must check before sending them to the customer. This is how the work would be divided if we had a reasonable workload and schedule. 

But the reality is that our workload is larger than it should be, and our schedule is ridiculously tight for all that needs to be done. Compared to the size of our workload, we are understaffed. Our company refuses to hire more people, so we’re essentially stuck like this. Because of this workload imbalance, Alice and I alone cannot check all of the proofs the customer sends in as well as all the new proofs that come in each day. If Alice and I alone did this, then many proofs would get to the customer late, and the two of us would have to work 12 – 14 hour days to try to keep up. 

So Kate and Jane also help us with proofs. With all four of us working together, we can get the proofs out every day, on schedule. But this basically means that Kate and Jane are technically doing work that is outside of their job descriptions. This is where the problem comes in. 

Kate and Jane are not “editorial.” That is to say, they are not experts on grammar rules or technical sentence structure. These are mine and Alice’s specialties. But processing proofs does not always require editorial knowledge. A good part of the time, it’s just making sure the customer’s marks are clear and make sense. But another good part of the time, the customer’s marks will require editorial work, such as rewriting sentences or editing a new paragraph of text that has been supplied. And all of the changes made need to be per the customer’s house style. So while Kate and Jane, for the most part, can process these proofs, a lot of the time, they have to stop and ask us about what to do in cases where the customer is asking for editorial changes. In many cases, they have to ask us what the correct house style is as well. Under the best of circumstances, this wouldn’t be an issue. It’s reasonable that we should answer Jane and Kate’s questions while they’re processing proofs. But here’s where it gets sticky. 

First off, Alice is relatively new to our team. She’s been on our team for a couple of months by this point. Because  she’s relatively new, she does not have an expert grasp on the style, yet. So Jane and Kate do not ask Alice for help with their proofs. They ask me for help with their proofs. In addition to Jane and Kate asking for help, since Alice is learning the style, she also asks me for help with her proofs. 

So, in short, I often times feel like I’m doing my coworkers’ work for them. Alice will ask me questions as she’s completing her proofs all day (literally all day; every ten minutes she has another question for me, and I have to tell her what to do, or tell her that what she’s about to do is fine). Meanwhile, Kate will, usually by the end of the day, often send me a proof or two that she was working on, and in each will usually be three or four final tasks that she could not do because they were “editorial,” so I need to do them and then I send her proofs on for processing. Jane actually hardly ever asks me any questions and hardly ever gives me her proofs to finish. She does ask me questions or gives me a proof every once in a while, but nowhere near the frequency of Kate and Alice. Sometimes I don’t see a question from Jane for days. But for Kate and Alice, it’s almost daily. 

What starts to get on my nerves is that I often feel like the questions that Kate and Alice both have are really not that hard to figure out. For example, if Kate has a proof where the customer has highlighted two of the same word and has asked for one of the words to be replaced with a synonym, Kate sends the proof to me, asking me to do it. Then this leaves me thinking: How difficult is it to look a word up in a thesaurus? Meanwhile, Alice should also be “editorial,” and, in fact, she’s been in this business ten years longer than I have. But because she’s new to the style, she is constantly asking me questions. Things that I think should be common sense, especially for someone who is a copyeditor. Or things that she should just make a judgment call on because I really don’t know the answer, either.

I feel like Kate will often feel intimidated and overwhelmed, so that will cause her to essentially panic and send her proofs to me. In fact, Kate will sometimes open a proof, just look at the number of corrections in it, then close the proof and tell me that I should do it. She won’t even look to see if it requires “editorial” work. She just sees how many corrections there are and assumes she can’t do it. Then I process that proof and find that there were no editorial tasks involved at all. In my book, this is called “cherry picking.” And when I started this career, the first thing I was taught was not to cherry pick my proofs. Whatever proof was next in the pile, that’s the proof I did, whether it was difficult or not. I did not look through the proofs and decide which one I wanted to do based on how complicated it looked. So, having been “brought up” in this business with this mindset, it irks me so much to see Kate essentially doing this very thing… Then on one occasion, she sent me a proof to do because it was “too editorial” and I processed it. Then, the customer accidentally sent the same proof corrections to us again, and, not realizing we’d already processed this proof, Kate processed it without issue and only had one question on it. So she *could* have processed that proof the first time. She just assumed she couldn’t, so handed it off to me.
 
It's things like this that are just really starting to get to me. On the one hand, I think they are relying on me too much. On the other hand, Kate is technically doing work beyond her job description. She shouldn’t be having to do any of this in the first place. And Alice is still new-ish to our team, so she’s still learning. But I still feel resentful every time Alice asks me another question with an obvious answer, or Kate sends me a proof to finish that I think she could have figured out on her own if she’d given herself enough of a chance to. 

But I don’t know if I’m just being critical. Maybe it all seems so easy because, to me, it is easy. And Kate technically shouldn’t even have to be doing this work. I should be grateful that she’s doing the work she is doing. But I feel worn out, and I feel resentful because I feel like I have to finish Kate’s work for her, and Alice’s constant stream of questions every day get tiresome. 

So then, apart from wondering if I’m making mountains out of mole hills, how do I even express any of this without sounding like a jerk? To Kate’s credit, she does push herself to figure things out. But after a certain point, I think she just gives up (or panics). And Alice is meticulous and does get a lot done, and all of us together get the workload out every day on time. But every day I get more and more resentful. Almost not a single day goes by at this point where I don’t hear a voice in my head shouting “You could have figured this out on your own! You didn’t need me to do this. Stop making me do your work for you!” I feel kind of shitty thinking that. But I can’t shake the thought, either.

70,"Right, to start I am a 24 year old male. About a year ago a coworker where I work started flirting with me and then we started dating in April. Now, we dated the first time for about a week and a half, then tried another date a week later, and and finally started dating again for a third time a week after that. That lasted for most of May. Then we broke up and went our separate ways. 
 Now, here's the thing. I still seem to have a thing for her. Which I guess normally wouldn't be a huge issue except for well, her. I came to the conclusion that she is possibly manipulative.  Additionally, most people who worked with her at my work agrees that she is not a great person. Logically I agree and know she is not someone I want to have have anything to do with. 
 While we were dating she grabbed one of friend's groin, and she seemed to have a thing for another friend. Plus she started dating one of her exes a day or two after breaking up with me. Now, the break up was mutual. I had those two reasons plus she was very clingy. This left me exhuatsed socially which was worsened by a sinus infection I had. She broke it off because she claimed i was pulling away from her. 

 However, I still have a thing for her. I heard second hand she came in tonight with her current boyfriend (I work in retail) and I have been thinking about her since being told. She hasn't came to my department to talk to me since December though. 
For the life of me I cant think of why I still like her.  She is a terrible, possibly manipulative person. 
Now I suspect my past has a little bit to do with it. I'm on the autism spectrum and am high functioning. Prior to dating her I went four years without going on a date. (This was my doing I've since realized. Kind of hard to date when you're not trying to meet anyone.) I got really depressed about it, started going down a bad path, and I can't help but think this had something to do with it. Here I was, depressed about not having had any ""luck"" with any girl (Again, this was solely because I wasn't trying) and then here comes this pretty, attractive girl who is flirting with me and seems very interested in me. This is also the only girl I've been with sexually, so I feel this also plays into it. 

So, I kind of am not sure what to do. Because I know dating her would be bad but I also know if she broke up with her current boyfriend and came in and asked if I wanted to go out with her I'd say yes. Does anyone have any thoughts? I'm kind of stuck on what to do about this. Because it's been most of a year since we split, and I haven't really talked to her much but everytime I do...

72,"So about a year ago I had a gay (male) hook up with someone I met online. It was super casual, no penetration or anything like that.

I gave him my number, but never heard back, which was cool since again it was casual and brief. Fast forward to a few months: I get a text from this person saying hi and we make plans to meet again. A few hours later I get a frantic call from the same dude saying his girlfriend has found our previous conversations and not to respond to anything else. Turns out the person who had texted me originally was the girlfriend all along. Yikes. Being that I have no desire to bring all this drama to my life, I block the numbers and decide to cut contact. I feel horrible to be involved and for my part in all of this, so removing myself from their life sounds like the best course of action.

Fast forward to a little more than a year: I get a text from someone saying hi and asking what’s up. I’m at work so don’t respond or think much of it. That same day I see someone to resembles the hook up dude at my job. I work retail so it’s pretty public and open.

This person is acting weird and I’m pretty sure it’s the dude, so I decide to trace his steps using our camera. He is only there for like 15 min and leaves. Just my luck that he happened to drop something when he came in, so I go to pick up what he dropped after I see him drive away. Surprise, surprise I see a name on a receipt that I recognized as his and a last name which I obviously don’t know.

I do a little bit of digging and confirm that this is the same guy. Also found out that he works for law enforcement. The number that texted me that morning also belongs to him.

I’m unsettled by this because I never once mentioned to him where I worked or what I did. Based on his behavior he was clearly there to look for me and once he saw me he left.

So the next day, again! The same. This time he sticks around my work area and creeps so that I can’t see him but ofcourse I can see him because we have cameras at our stations and can see everything.

So this is where I am. I have no desire to text him considering how he has started to stalk me. Does he want revenge? Does he want to make contact again? I don’t know but at this point I’m spooked.

Since he works for the police, I don’t think I can easily rely on them. Specially since I don’t have a case other than this dude patronized my work two days in a row and is being weird.

In the first few weeks of secondary school I made a few friends, though I never got very close to any. Ever since I befriended a certain individual (Let's name him Nemo) who had a bad reputation at the school, those friends that I had at the time started to distance themselves. I knew of his reputation, but I could not imagine him doing anything that they described and his situation at the time looked very much like my situation now so I could not let him be. Since then I've never really had any additional friends. I would have acquaintances and was on good terms with everyone, however I didn't really get close enough to any of them to the point of friendship. I am now nearing to my second year at university and so far I've made no friends away from my home city. I've also noticed I've gone quiet over the years, only speaking when I absolutely need to, though I am trying to overcome this. In the rare cases where I do speak to people in hopes for a friendship, I usually run out of conversation topics as I don't see myself having much in common with others. If I ever initiate a conversation with someone at uni I would ask things like ""how is uni going?"" ""what course are you doing?"" then I'd have nothing else to say. I'm out of touch in terms of music and I don't go clubbing/partying since I don't drink. I watch anime and play video games. I try my best to improve myself everyday. I try helping people whenever I could and I just want friends. Any advice?

Also despite only having 2 friends the one I called 'Nemo' before is actually becoming quite toxic and disrespectful so I feel like I need to somehow restore this friendship and if that fails then I'll be down to only one friend that I hardly contact.

I understand the possibilities of making friends online, but being raised by my parents to avoid any interaction/contact with any individual of the internet keeps me wary so I would prefer to establish 'in person' friendships.

My fear in this is if I'm asking for too much and I should be grateful for the few friends I have or if I'm appearing rude in anyway.

This has probably been asked before, but I could not find anything that could help me.

Thank you so much",30Mar2019,1
75,"The title says it all. I just found out about it yesterday. I'm more heartbroken that my friend made me look like a fool than the fact that he hooked up with someone else.

She (let's call her Jen) was the one who introduced me to him (he apparently knew me already though). She initiated a lot of things to make me happy or help us get closer. No one was going to tell me I was making a fool out of myself. The only reason my other friend (who told me about this, lets address her Dana) told me is because she thought it was wrong for her(Jen) to hook up with someone because she already has a boyfriend, not because she lead me on and messed with my emotions.

They hooked up last week the morning after she ""helped"" me with him. But I just found out yesterday. When I found out about this my heart just sank, she continued to tease me the entire day and still tried to ""help"" me. I felt like a pitiful drenched puppy that's just being given treats. It hurts a lot.

I have no emotional attachment to that guy, we aren't that close so I don't really care if he hooks up with whoever or with any of my friends. I just wished she didn't let me look like an idiot. I told some of my friends about this and I got a response that tried to justify her actions, saying maybe she just forgot. Lol. Nice it was morning and they were obviously sober. Honestly, fuck the guy he's not a big lose, my friend is the one I lost and I don't know if I have the right to be upset about this because technically there's nothing going on between me and him. Still, it really stings to look like a clown.

Mon(the friend who told me) told me not to tell anyone because Jen told her not to, I feel betrayed, belittled, and trashed by Jen and by our other friends who didn't tell me sooner. I appreciate that Mon came up to me to tell me about it. I don't know what to do, should I confront Jen which is basically throwing Mon under the bus, just stay away from the guy and just leave them alone, or am I the one who's wrong here? I feel so wronged but I don't know if I have the right to feel that way :(

I'm honestly just disappointed and upset right now. It hurts a lot.",30Mar2019,1

However the employer refuses to turn the lights off in our area, we have provided medical documentation and even made cardboard tents around the computer screens.  Today after the union has been fighting they gave theses options.  What you guys think, what can we fight back with or use, anyone else experience this? The two options are to wear sunglasses or to do a night shift.

You have provided medical information indicating that you are required to work in a dark area.  In order to accommodate your medical restriction, we have come up with two possible options that will meet your medical needs and operation needs:
 
1)      You can wear a hat/visor/sunglasses or special tinted glasses that will limit the amount of light from the led lighting and will allow you to desk share as required by operations.
2)      You can work a non-core shift, which due to fewer desks being in-use, will allow us to reduce the lighting in a specific section of the building. Once we know how many people choose this option, we will advise which of the below shifts will be available (subject to revision depending on numbers) based on operational needs and shifts will be assigned based on seniority. Note you will still be required to desk share in this dark area.

&gt;""Traffic Violation Convictions - within the past five years, have you been found responsible for, plead no contest to, paid a fine, or admitted responsibility for any traffic violation(s)?""

I got hit with ""failure to yield"" a couple months ago. I paid a fine and went to traffic school to get the violation dismissed. On the court's website they say,

&gt;""The violation will not be reported to MVD or recorded on your driving record.""

My worry is that this is the city I am applying to and perhaps they can still see the record of this violation. I was able to pull up the citation through the city's website just now as well, so why wouldn't they be able to?

In the application they also state,

&gt;""Failure to list any Traffic Violation Conviction(s) within the past five years may result in disqualification or offer of employment being rescinded.""

So, I am writing this post in place of my friend because he said it was a waste of time and that it would sound like he's just bragging about himself which i disagree with.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start this off with a little backstory as to who my friend is and how we got to where we are right now. We are a group of friends that play a lot of games competitively with and against each other, we mainly play shooter games and a few mobas. We have a lot of fun with it until it stops, and thats where the ""I need advice"" part comes in.

For as long as i can remember hes always been the best at every game we play and not just between us, he's been at a high level internationally in several games aswell. He can literally pick up any game and get so skilled in such a short amount of time that it's just ridiculous. But after around a week of playing he just quits and never returns. And after having this happening more and more over the past year or so, we've noticed in these last couple of weeks is that he doesn't play anything anymore, we barely see him online at all. We've all noticed that hes kept to himself alot lately, and we think he might be depressed. We don't know for sure, but something feels off.

So, i was wondering if anyone had any advice for him/us as to how to deal with the situation or if you've experienced anything like this before what did you do?

106,"Alright, this whole shit show that is my life has been building for a while so im just gonna let this out and let me know your thoughts.

So last year around June i broke up with my ex boyfriend (which was a very shitty, abusive, TOXIC relationship) and things from there have kinda spiraled. There are two guys afterwards who are going to be mentioned alot so im going to call them Greg and Steve.

Literally the week i broke up with the X, Greg make to visit from another country where he lives. Now I've known Greg since i was about 4 because our mums are best friends but I don't usually talk to him to often and he comes to where I live only once a year or two years. The thing about Greg is every-time he's come over when we were younger i used to always develop a 'crush' on greg and him me (which i find out from his sister). The last time was different though it was kind of more than that we stayed up talking till 6 in the morning and cuddled and all that jaz and him being there really distracted me from all my shit with the X, anyway a few weeks later Greg went home but we still talked everyday for weeks until one day he just cut it off. Out of nowhere. He started seening my messages and I didn't really hear from him. That stung. ALOT.

Spiraled down a pretty deep path after that, made stupid decisions but we won't go into those.

Steve is the main point of the this so lets just get to him. Steve was the X's friend but he always told me he hated him and knew he was a compulsive liar and after the break up was really one of the few people that was there for me and supportive. We became really close friends and hang out all the time as groups at parties with everyone and he was a big part in helping me get through all that trauma and still is. BUT. New years comes round and we are all at the beach me and my best friend, Steve and a few more good guy friends. We were all walking around the beach just having a good time, drinking, laughing , talking just all round good times. We were at the beach for two days as a group and the night before NY'S eve Steve and I made out, came kinda out of nowhere it just happened. We were really close that night, holding hands, cuddling, coupley kinda stuff but I was taken pretty off guard by this because this was just SO NOT LIKE STEVE like i was not expecting him to go for me like he was but he was and i was insanely happy about it. I was kind of denying to myself that I had feelings for him for months but now i had to accept it.

Anyway NY'S eve rolled around and we were doing the same thing we were the last night, this time our group of friends meet another group and we were all hanging out together walking down the beach. There was this random girl there who none of us knew that was part of the other group and she was with Steve. I turned around to Steve from a few feet ahead of him and I see him making out with this other girl. I don't even think its possible to express what that felt like. It was like I'd just been sucker punched in the stomach. The alcohol in me didn't help either and I immediately just started bawling my eyes out, a friend I had met came over to comfort me and told me that hes a dick and ti forget about it. Obviously it wasn't that easy.

We walked to the Wharf (all of us) and when we get there he asked what was wrong and to tell him why I was crying. Also he asked this WHILE HE HAD HIS ARM AROUND THIS RANDOM GIRL. I told him nothing and to leave me alone. He was going on about him knowing me and knowing I was upset and to tell him what was wrong. I walked away because I couldn't believe how utterly stupid he was being. Then later 12.00am came and (forgive me) we ended up making out again and idk why but i forgave him in that instant. Later we all sat in the park talking, I on his lap where we kissed more and were together and all that fun stuff. Me and my friend ended up leaving around 3am.

The next day he texted apologising for kissing that girl saying he doesn't know why he did it and he should have done something when he saw me crying. This apology put him in the good books with me for sure and we talked non stop for weeks.

NOW this is where is gets kind of shitty. Steve pulled a greg a started seeing my messages. Just went from one day talking non-stop to the next NOTHING. My heart was broken. Later I find out he was talking to my friend as well and I guess she's better than me because he cut me off and started inviting her to parties. They eventually started dating and I see them everyday.

Now this is also very important to remember. I do not see my friend in any way as backstabbing me or anything of that nature she didn't know about it and she can't help who she likes I'm still very much good goof friends with her and love her to bits. Steve, well I do love steve AS A FRIEND, we are still very good friends to this day I see him everyday we hang out at parties we are still good friends. I've come to realise I dont ""like"" him in ""that"" way as I did its more the hurt from his actions that night is still there and now I kind of cant help but think. Im really just never going to be good enough for anyone. First the horrible X, then Greg and now Steve. The whole thing has kind of left me feeling broken I guess. I feel like there is always a better option and it's like.

108,"As a kid I was always obese up until I was 15 years old. I lost about 30kg dropping down to 68kg and had some spikes that rarely got over 78kg. I managed to lose that weight quite fast however.

I‘m 18 now and basically overweight again, not as much as a kid, but unhealthily overweight and I just can‘t find the motivation to lose weight again. 

I can lose weight very fast and quite recently I dropped about 10kg, but gained six back up again afterwards. 

Today two friends of mine mentioned how I lost some weight back then and am basically fat again. It genuinely hurt my feelings.

My problem is that while I may start doing a diet, on the same day I start I just don‘t care anymore in the night and go eat a snack or a full meal sometimes.

Or I decide to eat better, but don‘t want to prepare food for me, so I eat my mom‘s cooking which is rarely good for losing weight.

I‘m boxing and I go regularly for a few years now, basically ever since I started losing my fat as a teenager and it‘s getting very hard for me to keep up. My form and technique is better than ever, but my endurance has dropped significantly. I barely cling to life after coming home from training.

Sports isn‘t my issue for losing weight, we always do high intensity after all. I want to feel good in my body again, I want to be a better sportsman, but I have this lazy, food-loving part of me that I just can‘t seem to turn off no matter how much I try.

I feel like I‘ve hit a wall and might never experience having a healthy body ever again and as Juvenal said “Sana mens in corpore sano“ - a healthy mind in a healthy body - it has taken a toll on my psyche.

It‘s just something I am fully capable of doing easily, but can‘t bring myself to do.

110,"I've posted this a few times forgive me but I'm having a hard time.

Long story short, She chose another guy over me and I stupidly went back to her a few days after they broke up. In the following months she grinded on another dude and said I should be lucky that she didn't fuck him, talked to her ex behind my back, neglected me and used my emotions against me. She broke things off, came back a few months later trying to be friends and bragged to me about a new brown boyfriend to get under my skin (I'm brown).

She did a shit ton of damage that I don't think she gives a fuck about let alone gave a fuck when doing so. I've been going to therapy where I've come to terms that she was toxic and a sadist and that I've idealized her into someone she's not. I don't know how to overcome this and come tothe fact that she wasn't special and I'll find someone like her again.

111,"(16M) So driving home tonight, I hit a corner and (going 5 under so not speeding) i hit a hydroplane and my wheel got stuck on the side of the road, i slid ahead, ended up a quarter over a creek. Called my dad, handled the situation well, and got out safely. 

We live kind of out in the country, and I've never been on my phone in the car. But my dad doesn't believe me. He's not angry (that i can tell), or dissapointed, but when i was talking through what happened he said ""no way you hydroplaned, you were distracted by something"", and I feel partially hurt. I think I hydroplaned, all i know is i was on the road and lost control, and previously mentioned happened.

112,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons) On the outside I'm just a normal 18 year olf male, but I was recently diagnosed by my psychiatrist with many mental health problems (major depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder, adhd). I've recently started to go completely numb and apathetic. The root of my problem started this morning when I was browsing 4chan (red flag I know). I was on /x/ and I started to see all of these extremely religious posts about the state of human kind and the truth beyond death etc. Although I consider myself agnostic I really began to become extremely obsessed with the said posts. I haven't been able to stop reading them and I have been hearing voices and getting in arguments with myself about God and religion. I'm sure at this point I sound like a loony but all I'm asking for is comfort and help and guidance. Any kind of advice in general would help. I won't be able to see my psychiatrist for a week because I will be out of state. I feel like I may not deserve any advice or comfort but I cant keep continuing this way or I will go crazy.

When I was younger I would constantly obsess over religion. The best way to describe it is I would constantly think things like, ""If X happens, it means X."" So I would think things like, ""If the spinner lands on green, it means I'm going to heaven."" ""If it rains tomorrow, it means God is read."" ""If the washer stops *now*, it means I'm going to hell."" etc, etc, etc. You get the idea. I would obsess over if I was saved, if I was going to hell, if I was going to heaven, and who was going where when they died. I would also struggle with opinions. If I thought to myself, ""Wow, her outfit if ugly."" I would like, ""apologize"" to God for thinking a mean thought because I thought if I didn't, something bad would happen. If something bad did happen, I would blame myself and for not apologizing enough. My relationship with God just wasn't healthy. 

I dropped religion when I was in the 7th grade and looked into other religions, or just being atheist or agnostic. 

Here's where the advice that's needed comes in:

My boyfriend believes in God. I was a little shocked when he told me this, just completely outright, ""I believe in a God."" He talked about not believing in God and ridiculed religious people and so on, so I assumed he didn't believe in God. He has different opinions of what someone should do to practice their beliefs, and he's a lot more liberal when it comes to practicing religion, if that makes sense. (Not liberal like the political view, just liberal in his practices.) 

We were talking today and he said this, ""I believe in God, right? And I don't want to try and make you believe in something if you don't want to, but I love you. If I'm right about this, and you aren't, I just don't want you to go to Hell. I don't want to force you into religion or anything, but like. I want yo to think about it at least.""

120,"Hello Reddit,

I've got a very odd and frustrating situation facing me right now, and I am in need of major advice.

I am a 19 year old guy at University right now as a sophomore and I have known this girl who I have become best friends with that I met during freshman year. When we first met, she was in a relationship with someone that went to high school with her hundreds of miles away. About a month into college, they broke up, and she was devastated. I came into the picture and helped her through her rough times of the breakup without any motives (like trying to get with her even though she is very attractive). Simply just cheering her up was all I did and was completely content with it.

At the end of my freshman year, I decided to set her up with a friend of mine who I'd went to high school with. They ended up liking eachother and are still dating to this very day. I did this at the time because I felt no feelings for her romantically, just friends.
Something about this girl; we see eachother every day, have classes together, she regularly comes over to my place for the day, and basically she is a roommate. 

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago, we were both hanging out in my room, and we were laying in bed together, to which I started to make moves on her and began seducing her. We didn't have sex, but we made out, I fingered her, and we cuddled. She eventually stopped things after a little while, saying she knew it wasn't right. Then, one week ago, we were both slightly drunk, and we were both in my room, and started messing around again. I ate her out, we basically did everything possible without formal ""sex"". All the while she provided no resistance to any of it and she mentioned she ""certainly has SOME feelings for me"". 

Bear in mind she is in a relationship, and when I questioned her about it, she said she ""wanted it to happen"" because she was really turned on. (Is this just an attention whore thing?)

The issue I have is that since then I have caught tremendous feelings for her romantically and I know she doesn't feel the same for me, but I see her every day, and every time we talk or hang out I am very conflicted inside and upset about the whole situation. It's now to the point where I am basically her male girlfriend and I'm fooling myself by thinking I have a shot with her. Basically killing me inside. My mood and motivation are suffering as a result.

I'm not even asking if I have a chance to get with her because quite frankly I'm aware that isn't happening and I don't think I'd want it to given her loyalty to her current boyfriend... but how can I either shake these feelings for her or help myself not be her emotional tampon? It seems as though I am jumping at her requests and I don't know how to get out of this situation considering that I see her every day and am constantly reminded of what happened by simply her presence. 

Any advice would be great, as this is absolutely killing me inside.

121,"My dad has always been emotionally abusive and a manipulator, but this summer he took it physical and punched me in my jaw, leaving a bad bruise. (A CPS case was opened but they said we waited to long to call 911 and that they couldn't do anything legally, I tried my best for action to be taken but all they did was tell my dad to control his anger) Talking between us completely ceased and we only communicated over text if it was completely needed. I was free to go wherever I wanted and he ""cared"" when someone was around or when it was going to benefit him.

I've been 16 for a few months now, and he's withholding some very needed privileges. I haven't been able to get my permit (most age have a license) or a bank account, even though I've had a job for over a year. This leaves me with a bunch of cash lying around and having to scramble to find different rides to work.

 I'm in jrotc, and in a staff position. I'm required to be at the school earlier then the rest and to be at certain places that I would need to drive to. Finding rides is extremely difficult, and not being able to attend these things is holding me back so much.

I try and try to talk to him in person about letting me get my permit or a bank account, and all he says is 'until you start to act right, it's a no."" And I then ask him what he wants me to do and he says stuff along the lines of ""don't be in your room so much or ""our relationship is bad, and until you fix it I'm not ready to let you drive"" 

When I'm not in my room, I get completely ignored. They don't even make enough dinner servings for me most nights. I tell him that he's the adult and he needs to initiate and try to rebuild a relationship and all he says is ""what? I'm here"" and motions to himself. 

I'm sick and tired of him acting like a child. I shouldn't be responsible for building this relationship all on my own when I don't even want it. I just want to drive and for my cash to be safely secured. I buy my most of my own food and could find a place to live if I really needed to. He doesn't pay for my phone, school supplies, clothes, shoes, female sanitary products, school trips, and things like deodorant and shampoo.

He is holding me back so much. Being on time and showing up to things is important to me, my job, and clubs I'm in. If I look unreliable, nobody is going to trust me in leadership positions.

I need to know what my options are. If there is a chance of convincing him or if I need to find a way around it. Or any advice would be greatly appreciated

128,"For a little possibly helpful backstory I'm a 19 year old girl with shitty cheap as hell insurance who is currently in university and the reason it's taken so long for me to seek medical treatment is because both my parents are pretty against medication due to bad experiences with doctors. 

So with that out of the way I've dealt with symptoms of ADHD my entire life and they've really impacted me, especially in school because I constantly forget things and my time management is basically non-existent. Today I went for a psych eval for it at the strong suggestion of my therapist because I fit every single one of the DSM-5 criteria and the lady evaluating me barely asked me about my symptoms, literally the only ADHD related questions she asked me were about my performance in school and my ability to hold down a job (for the record, as I mentioned above my school performance has been pretty shit, but I've had my job for a year and a half without issue) and the rest of the questions she asked were basically just about my criminal record and if I was ever abused both of which aren't things that apply to me. The eval was also over skype which I think could have been  an issue because since she could only see my shoulders and up she couldn't read my body language properly or see just how incapable I am at sitting still. I'm sure there are also things I just straight up forgot to tell her, but she was really quick to dismiss me and it felt weird to be like ""well actually I think you're wrong because X, Y, and Z"" and her being so quick did kind of threw me for a loop. Also she didn't seem to have my most up to date records or the info on the questionnaire I filled out in the waiting room which was another thing that seemed kind of weird to me. I know I probably sound a little like a crazy self-diagnoser, but I've done a lot of research and my therapist went through the entire DSM-5 diagnostic criteria because she thought it seemed like I had some sort of attention issues and I have literally no other way of explaining why I am the way I am. I think the type of people who diagnose themselves with like bipolar, autism, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder with no research or professional opinions are fucking idiots just so we get that squared away.  

Anyway, she ended up blaming everything on my anxiety and told me that I was too well spoken to have ADHD. Should I take her word for it because this is her job after all and I'm sure she knows how to do it or should I seek a second opinion? ",30Mar2019,1

Basically, NG and AF both play trumpet, and kinda recently (couple months), NG ""challenged"" and got a higher chair (Basically the band director compares the two player's ability blindfolded, the better player gets the chair). After that, AF has been telling everyone that he deserves the chair more, or another player should have the chair instead. This has gone to trying to ""vote"" NG out of her spot (not allowed) to calling her a jerk, a$$hole, b word, sl#t, so on. This is mostly person, around his group of friends, but somewhat via text. AF hasn't sworn on the texts, only in person, but  has been calling NG a ""disgrace"" and other less explicitly words via text. *With NG in the group chat.* What makes this worse is that almost all my other friends believe AF, so I'm alone in this more or less. This has been happening for several months, but has gotten much worse in the last week or so. I finally snap, and decided to talk to AF about it.

So I, being a nice person, text AF and tell him to stop. What do you know, 5 min later he texts the main group chat he was bulling her on ""it was obviously sarcastic"" and ""just a joke"".

Then he got to the point and told me that i actually look like a actor named ""Liam Hemsworth"". I just nodded my head without even knowing who he really is. Well i am not really a buff when it comes to knowing entertainers names. The only names i am used to memorising are the names of scientists and politicians. Anyway as i was curious i searched his name on the internet and i found out that he is almost identical to me. Not only his face structure is the same as me but his beard, height and clothing looks like me. The only minor differences are our hair and eye colors, eye shapes and hairstyle. I was always aware that i am actually attractive and i become a lot more attractive with suits so i really didn't need to try to look like anyone. What has concerned me wasn't this guy Liam but his wife ""Miley Cyrus"" who is a famous pop singer. I really didn't know much about her before and i didn't care either. All i knew was some random names and hearings from her songs like that ""Wrecking Ball"" and other stuff. But i barely even remembered her face. But seeing pictures of Hemsworth with her just started shaking my whole mind and life. This girl is so cute in her own way and she sounds so fun and talkative based on what i have seen on her real life videos and interviews. I just imagined how much fun is that guy having for being around her all the time and living in the same house and in the same room as her.

So I’m a transgender male in middle school and there’s only about three person who respects that even though everyone knows. I emailed the counselor a few months back to see if she could get my name changed in the Google system since you can’t change it yourself since I was struggling with my gender. I was too scared to ask anything else. 

The office and staff keeps calling me “girl” and putting me in pointlessly gendered groups, not to mention The kids. The kids are.. something else. I understand if they don’t understand transgenderism, but I have two other trans friends in the same friend group and they’re called by the correct name and pronouns. I’m not since I can’t fully transition due to my life at home.

141,"Okay so. Little back story.

In October of 2018 I broke up with my ex because I thought he was cheating on me.. later found out I had chlamydia so that was true. 

So I picked myself up at the end of the year and went on tinder. Matched with a guy who’s older than me, (let’s call him Mike) we hit it off. We’d talk extensively whenever we could (everyday up until the middle of March.) Only problem was that he lived 220km from me across the American border. We went on three dates, he came up the first time to Canada, I went down to his place for a couple weekends. We never did anything more than kiss.

He’d constantly tell me that he was attracted to me and did want to continue dating. Until the middle of March where out of the blue he says, in a nutshell, “Hey I think it would be better if we stayed friends (for the near future). One because of the age difference and two the distance.

I was upset because yeah I liked this dude, and it’s shitty he doesn’t wanna be something more. In about 5 days I got over that fact and said yeah, cool, we can be friends. 

Recently he asked for some space so I gave him a week and let him come back to me. Cause it’s only fair right? Then we do the “hey how are you? Good, etc.” Conversation and he leaves me on read...

So the part that f*cks with me is he says he wants to be friends. Initiates conversation, but then makes no effort, not even half as much as he did before he told me he wanted to be friends.

I want to confront him, but then that makes me look like the bad guy? 

I can’t ghost him because I feel like that’s petty and unfair, because what if somethings going on with him he’s not ready to talk about at the moment?

This whole situation is crummy because it’s just taken all my drive to even try to meet other people, if this is the outcome. 

How can you talk to somebody and basically know their life story after 2, almost 3 months and do something like this?

I do want him as a friend, and no. Not like “I want to get in his pants” friend. I really enjoyed hanging out with him and our text/video conversations are hands down some of the best I’ve probably ever had. But I don’t know what to do. I need help.

Fast forward to now, and I work in human services! All thanks to my internship, because my supervisor gave me a glowing recommendation. I'm a provisionally licensed social worker now. I really enjoy what I do, despite the low pay. I majored in polisci because my end goal was to work for a non-profit, so I'm not too far off from my goal here.

When they fail to be successful in the community, I make referrals to send them to residential facilities.

155,"TL;DR included below.

This year I turned 20. Not that big of an achievement, but when I did wake up to my birthday a few months ago I expected my parents to at least consider me an adult. 

Turns out that wasn't happening anytime soon.

A little background: I grew up a really quiet, timid kid. Had few friends, kept to myself, rarely went outside unless I had to attend important things, like group projects, seminars, etc. So for the longest time my parents see me as this...hermit. Staying home was always validated though, because I was taught to be a good girl that followed her parents, and they expected me to be there, studying, helping with the chores. I was supposed to make them proud and be the bread winner.

We live in Asia, btw. So conventional Western norms dont apply here to an extent.

Going with that, I started college last year and have achieved a significant improvement in my social life. I've been more outgoing, and I've gotten to know some really great people with similar interests. I'm in several clubs, too, if anything. 

With my friend circle growing, I see myself going out a lot more frequently on the weekends to just spend time with them outside of school. We don't go out drinking, btw. No drugs or clubbing. In short we just talk, play a few games maybe - just some generally nerdy passtimes. 

And yet whenever I try to go out (regardless if its for an actual school-related agenda or not) I'm only ever chastised for it. ""It's for a project.""?  Yeah, no, they get all defensive, calling me out by saying back in their day, they didnt have to go out almost all the time as college students. Last time I had to go out for a filming project, they got mad at me, spewing negative comments and making it seem like the 'right' thing was to stay at home and that I've become a rebel. I'm still allowed to leave, but not without feeling like a piece of shit. 

I don't know - whenever they get mad, I feel like I did something bad, like a criminal. This keeps happening every time I tell them I'm heading out. 

And trust me, it's especially bad if I just tell them I'm going to meet with some friends. They accuse me of goofing off, not giving importance to my studies at all. The ugliest of the bunch was when they accused me of doing the do with a bunch of random ass men. Knowing how up-tight I'm being with myself, it hurts to be degraded by the very people you're trying to impress.

I've started lying now because of this. The very act makes me sick to the stomach but how else am I supposed to find a little bit of leisure outside the demands of my college life? 

So....really...I'm not sure what I can do at this point. Arguing with them often ends with me becoming the bad sheep: simply talking back is like taboo and I'm usually always threatened with disownment. How can I convice them that they can trust me? That I dont do drugs or alcohol? That I value my education, even?

TL;DR: Am 20 with parents who dont trust me whenever I go out on weekends/off-days. They accuse me of getting into vices and I just want to prove to them I'm an up-right person. ",30Mar2019,1

164,"Hi! 
So I’m looking for some advice regarding my living situation.
So I live in a converted old house, that has been divided into 3 sections of apartments. I live on the middle level. My room mate and I are big into crafts and home improvements. We don’t do big projects often but we do about every three months. 
We have a downstairs neighbor, he’s very nice and we like him a lot. But he constantly complains about any noises. If we drop anything he comments on it. If we have friends over (even just for an hour for dinner) he comments on it. It is frequent for one of us to run into him in the parking lot and get a load of passive aggressive questions that eventually lead us to telling him what we did the night before that give him some sort of explanation for noise. 
When this first started we tried to appease him in every way. He used to work a night shift, we would try to do everything silently until 4 each day so we didn’t wake him. We didn’t listen to music, we wouldn’t vacuum, we wouldn’t even empty the dishwasher until 4.
Then he got a new job with day shift house but suddenly started complaining more. He asked passive questions prying to see what caused noise, he would constantly imply that we are too loud (yet he has a dog who barks all the time, which we have never said a thing about). While as a house we can get a little excited we tend to be quiet people. All of us are school teachers and are in bed by 10.
A few weeks ago my room mate was hammering a new photo into the wall at about 7:30 when he started slamming on the floor telling us to stop, which we did. He brought it up the next day, informing us that he was asleep when it happened, and also said that it sounded like a bowling ball falls everyday in our apartment. We spent weeks trying to figure out what the bowling ball sound would be. We have sticky tacked everything down so the cats can’t knock it off, so it’s not that. My room mate thinks it was her closet door I think it was things falling in the shower. Either way she padded her closet door and I changed the bathroom shelves so they are more secure. 
Since then he’s gotten yet another new job, and is now working from home and setting his own hours. 
Last week we installed a new shelf for additional storage, we drilled into the wall to put it in. We were very worried he would be upset, but we heard no reaction from it, so that was great.
Today my room mate painted a piece of wood and tried to seal the container back up. As a normal person would do she tried to hammer it closed. She even put a towel between the floor (which is carpeted) and the can and between the can and the hammer. She got 3 or 4 knocks on it before we heard him slamming on the foot and yelling “please stop that”. It was 3:15 in the afternoon on a Friday. She finished closing it outside in the snow. 
At this point we are pissed. We don’t know how to be more accommodating to him, but we still need to get stuff done around the house. Especially since I depend on a side income from crafts and it’s spring cleaning time.
The only theory I have that can sort of explain the situation is that he might have PTSD. He is ex special opps and still works in security. I know he’s seen combat a lot. I think the hammering really gets to him, at least that’s the only explanation I have. 
But I don’t know what to do! We’ve modified everything in our house that makes noise, we even put duct tape on the floor boards that really squeak so we know not to step there! We purposefully left one of the bedrooms of our house empty so that no one was living above his bedroom. We keep quiet hours after 8, but we also are starting to feel like we can’t actually have normal lives here. We spend a ridiculous amount of time literally tip toeing around. 
While all of this happens he allows his dog to poop wherever he wants in the yard, jump on people in the yard (and I am very allergic to dogs!), smoke cigarettes directly outside of our windows, and hold long loud conversations between 9pm and 12am right outside our bedroom windows, but we have never once complained. 
We want to make him comfortable, especially if this is stemming from PTSD, but we have to start living normally again! Does anyone have any advice at all? We really think he’s a great guy but we just can’t take the restrictions on our living anymore! So far all I have thought of is texting him before we hammer things to let him know. ",30Mar2019,2

171,"Names have been changed for obvious reasons. All characters are between the ages of 16 and 18. It’s worth noting that I’m female. 

So, my longtime friend Adrian and I really seem to like each other as more than just friends. I’m almost certain he likes me, and I’ve made it pretty obvious I like him, but we’re both really shy and awkward so nothing’s ever become of that. We’re both part of the same friend group, and all of our friends have noticed that we seem to act like a couple, even though we’re not. I’ve thought about asking him out many times before, but I never actually went through with it. 

Our mutual friend Jack and my sister Gracie are also both in this friend group. Jack is openly bisexual. Gracie told me that Jack is “almost positive” Adrian is gay. I don’t trust Jack’s judgment on most things, but since he’s bi, I figure he probably has a pretty decent “gaydar”, so I’m inclined to believe him here. 

I’ve always just assumed Adrian was straight, *maybe* bi, but Jack’s assessment has me second-guessing that. The thing is, though, Adrian cares a lot about what other people think of him, and for whatever reason he thinks homosexuality is a really big deal. If he *is* gay, he’d sooner stay in the closet for his entire life than date a guy. So we have no way of knowing the truth. 

Now I’m worried about the possibility of getting romantically involved with Adrian. What if I end up in a long-term relationship with him and come to find out years, maybe even decades, later that the “love of my life” was actually never sexually attracted to me? Dating a guy who’s actually gay is one of my biggest fears.

Should I trust Adrian and believe that he’s not gay? Or should I trust Jack and find someone else?",30Mar2019,1

Well I finally make new friends and he makes about 10 accounts to nonstop harass me into being friends with him again and I fall for it and he ends up stealing like 2 friends out of my group. 

Now it’s about 9 months after that happened and every now again he tries it and I ignore it, but the really annoying part is is he messed with my friends too.

So, i got a best friend that I've had for 3 plus years now. He's great. Funny guy and everyone loves him. He's not the most motivated so he doesn't do terribly well in school but he's on band leadership and isn't stupid. However, he's flaky. Not crazy flaky but consistently flaky. 

It's finally gotten to the point where I've decided I can't just let him keep flaking out on plans. I want to start basically letting him know it's bothering me and then basically ignoring him for bit to deliver the point, then drop it. If he learns that flaking on plans is damaging his friendships, maybe he'll make a mature choice and work to change it. 

It's not just me that's feeling it, my girlfriend heartily agrees he's flaky buuuut she doesn't think that he is gonna change and that me trying to make him change is bad. I'm bouta say fuck it and get a new friend. I could care less. 

What are the thoughts on this? I'm a teenage boy so I act irrationally and in anger so genuine advice would be greatly appreciated.

I had an idea that while marking my attendance I will find her full name on the sheet and then try to find her on social media. Right now however I want to confess to her and talk to her a bit but I fear rejection so I want to do it anonymously and give her a hint. From her personality it seems that she will not tell anybody about it if it is anonymous though I think she would try to respond.

I’ve always had a secret crush on her, but we’ve remained as platonic as you could possibly imagine due to work and school. Recently, she got a boyfriend. They’ve been dating for about three months now. Now, here’s the kicker, she has lately been throwing some signs my way, and as of last night, has professed her longing to sleep with me. She wants to ‘keep it just between us, and we will never have to speak on it.’

We already did a monthly budget and we've got it pretty accurate from lowest prices to the reasonably high prices. 

We plan in moving into a studio that has a rent of 750-800 (we are looking at three places). I looked up a budget sheet and filled it out with him and we look pretty good. We did add the cost of ""one time"" Or ""every few month"" items such as cleaning supplies or toiletries just to make the costs reasonable. The only thought in our mind right now is ""how much do we need saved before we try to move?

I need advice from those who are stable in their homes and possibly from those who moved out as early as I am trying to. Please don't tell me to invest in a house and such. I have been told that so many times. Right now. We are just trying to do school, work, and live together. No kids in the near future. No animals. So a small place for a few years is what we want. Oh.

184,"Hello,
So I'm in a bit of a predicament, I've known this girl for about 3 years now and ever since we met we have been pretty close. It was kind of a alright time alright place kind of thing. We had both got new boyfriends and we loved to talk about them with each other. I didn't really enjoy talking about him behind his back, but I liked the thrill and they were all good things.

She has had a best friend that goes to another school and I have been jealous of her since the day I knew about her. One day she did the same thing we used to do with our boyfriends and told her best friend about a private conversation between me and her about how I would sneak out to see my boyfriend. Her best friend threw a fit and said she hated me, which made me hate her, it's all a terrible circle.

When my boyfriend broke up with me after 2 years I was heartbroken but I would have been okay if my 'best friend' hadn't broken up with me at the exact same week. All this was very traumatic and I had to go to therapy for a few months to get back on track. However, I've recovered and we have all moved on and we were better than ever.

However, recently I started a part time course that I do part of the time I'm supposed to be at school. I've met so many wonderful people, including this boy which I've come to like. We haven't known each other that long and I only see him in class but he's so great. He's the funniest person I've ever met, his laugh cheers me up and he's smart and trustworthy. My 'best friend' is none of these things anymore. She could be smart, but she just doesn't try. I get along with this new guy so well I want to be best friends with him. We share so many interests and I can trust him to not share all my personal details which I know my 'best friend' has been doing on almost a daily basis since I met her. But until recently, I haven't had anyone else to talk with.

One thing I need to mention is that I thought I had romantic interest in this guy but I don't think I do anymore. I've definitely led my friends to believe I do and they would always egg me on. I haven't been with anyone in almost a year and I do miss that, so I assume that's why. 

So my question is, how do I tell her that I can't trust her anymore? And how do I move on? ",30Mar2019,1

186,"Me and my sister are having an argument of sorts. She’s been with her boyfriend 5 years, and I’ve been with my girlfriend for 4. (5 in November). 

She says your mans fucking you in your sleep is rape and grounds for ending a relationship, even if you’ve been together for that long or longer. I say there a sort of consensual cloud at the point, and if your S/O doesn’t want it they’d just wake up and say no and you’d know not to do it anymore.

Now personally, I’d of course warm up my girlfriend first in her sleep, then start actually having intercourse once she was awake (even though she’s consented to sleep-sex.) Because it’s more fun that way. My sister is okay with this sort of thing from her boyfriend as well, but not actual during sleep penetration. 

I can’t quite wrap my head around it, I feel like in a loving relationship that long it would be a non-issue, and even if it was an issue I feel like in a relationship you’d explain why it was a problem if your S/O did that kind of thing, and then they obv wouldn’t do it again.

188,"We are not in college. 

So i'm in a peculiar situation. Some time ago, i moved to another state with my friend to pursue career opportunities. We became roommates and began paying rent together. There's a lot of good and bad. So i hope you can read this entire thing.

At first, moving in seemed fine, but my lack of life experience and problem-solving skills quickly showed that i was not ready to be on my own and it annoyed the shit of my roommate (Lets call him John). John said I was too sensitive and i cared too much about what people think.

His way of fixing that was to make fun of me for anything he could think of (My height, my looks, my clumsiness, my lack of social skills etc.) He thought that would harden my mind into not caring about what other people think. He also tends to throw trash (literal garbage) at me because he thinks its funny, punches me whenever i flinch, then when i'm not paying attention, starts squeezing one of my legs.

One time, We got into an argument so heated (because I kept throwing his shit/medicine back at him) that he put me in Brazilian-jiu-jitsu hold and almost knocked me unconscious because i wouldn't stop fucking with him. FYI, *He is MUCH bigger and buffer than i am.* He tells me all the time to ""grow up"" and ""stop acting like a child."" He hates it whenever i touch him or bother him when he doesn't want to be bothered.

Last night, we had a physical altercation. What happened was that he wanted to spar (boxing) and i said no. So in response he kept closing my laptop and slapping me until i submitted. Then  took my phone from the dresser and put it in his pocket. He then put me in another Brazilian-jiu-jitsu hold and almost knocked me unconscious again. He then spilled my food over the table and onto the rug, poured milk onto my laptop (intentionally), bent my laptop over and sat on it, refused to clean up the food he spilled, then asked me to leave the room for 2 hours so he could have a girl over. I reached a conclusion. I want no part of him. We have known each other for almost 8 years btw. 

He is the literal definition of ""Don't dish it out if you yourself couldn't take it."" When i called John out on being a huge hypocrite, his response was......*""I know i'm a hypocrite, and I'm okay with that. Thats fine with me.""* He said that with a very serious face.

He also resorts to violence, threats and/or threats of violence over the littlest shit. One time, I saw a mosquito and picked up his water bottle *(it was the closest thing),* was about to kill it, then he threatened to punch me in the face if i used his water bottle. He even hung up his phone call to show me he was serious about punching me.

Though On the other side, he got me a job at the company he once worked at. He also said he would help pay with my share of the rent for the first couple months so i can get myself situated. Well It's gotten to the point where he hasn't paid me *(he said he will)* and my funds are running low, and i lost access to my debit/credit card. I had to set up a tab with him and pay him back when i got the cash. He has also paid for a couple movie tickets, some gas money and some dinner meals. He also told me when i'm ""mature"" enough (how ironic), that he will get me a job at his current company that pays REALLY REALLY well. I've seen the money, its real.

I feel like I'm in a tough situation (especially with finances), any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

191,"Note: In the country where I live, India, things work very differently as opposed to say America. Kids generally stay with their parents till the age of 25, or even their whole lives (This does not mean that they are dependent on their parents, they simply live in the same space). People are not expected to start working until they graduate college. There is no concept of ""jobs for minors"". I am 16, and thus cannot find a job. 

And tuition classes are not official, they are classes to help you perform better in school or help you catch up. Almost everybody takes them. All of the other students in my class take some form of extra tuition after school. It is expected of us.

4 days ago, My Dad was driving me to a tuition class. This class was recommended to me by my Vice-Principal, who noticed my falling grades and told me that I should go for it. So I did. And when I told my Dad about this, he replied positively and said that he'd pay the tuition fees. Fast forward to 4 days ago, and we're in the car, just me and him, driving to the class. Something was very off about him, and he seemed to be in a very different mood for the last couple of days. He started asking me about the class and I replied. Then he started belittling me and saying that I'm a failure and that I just think of him as a 'money bag', which I obviously don't. Then he just lost it, started yelling at me saying that I always blame him (which was a mistake I made when I was younger, but I've stopped for a year) for my mistakes. Then he said, and I quote ""Get the fuck out of my car"". 

&amp;#x200B;

And so I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the class, told them that my Dad couldn't make it due to office reasons and that he just asked for the amount of fees and that he'd pay them. They gave me the figure. It was a large amount, but honestly I know that my Dad can afford it.

I went home and my Dad was there. We didn't say a word to each other, except for me to tell him what had happened. Then I went to my room. I was exhausted and went to sleep. I woke up at 4 am, thinking about what had just happened. I was so confused. But I knew one thing : I was angry. I was angry that he had said that to me.  I kept telling myself to keep my head down, and that if I waited long enough he would calm down and pay the fees. But I don't know what came over me. 

I went to my parents' room and threw a chair to get their attention.

Yes, I know it sounds bad. It was worse. I have no clue what I was thinking, it was like my mind was on auto-pilot. I asked him  "" Get the fuck out of the car, how could you say that to me ? "" . This was the first time that I had swore in the house.

Everything after that was a blur. I remember my mom acting like a barrier between him and me. I remember him going up to my room and me following. I remember that he didn't say a word. I remember that he punched me. Hard. Twice. 

I remember me trying to fight back. I remember him choking me. I remember me saying that I was going to kill him.

I remember my mother and sister coming into the room. They stopped the fight. My mom pulled me out of there and took me out of the house. She told me to breath and to go for my classes. I left the house. 

It's very easy to pretend like it's a normal day, isn't it ? I just went to the class and told them that my Dad would take a while to get the fees ready, till the day after. They said OK.

Ashley, on the other hand, is fierce, hardworking, intelligent, etc, but she’s just not as good with people. She can be aggressive sometimes, and she’s pretty quirky. Basically, Denise is very “sane “, while Ashley is “insane “.

It’s enough to stop me from what I’m doing and phase out or leave if possible, I frankly just want to stop existing when it happens because I don’t know what to do. I get it mostly when I’m around this girl i have feelings for, and how she treats everyone better than me, how she hangs out with other guys, and how she doesn’t feel the way with me but we’re still “friends”. I frankly feels like she hates me. We see each other almost daily and I don’t really talk to her unless we’re alone because she’s too busy with the others. I don’t even know what to say to her half the time, I’m not social at all. I know it sounds stupid, all that jealousy and shit, but it won’t leave me alone, I should just find someone else but I’m not someone who can just leave something behind when no one comes to me, don’t help that I’m not an attractive person. I’m stuck with these feelings I can’t get rid of and I feel like I’m on the end of my rope here. I have thoughts of drinking, when I never have, and sometimes self harm.

208,"First off, I moved out over three years ago, somewhere between February and March of 2016. I had asked my ex to take me off the apartment lease (I recognize I should have done this, not entrusted him to do it) and he alerted me he did the next day. 

Fast forward to 2019, I apply for an apartment and have a HORRENDOUS rental reference. Over 20 late fees, $2000 in damages, numerous complaints. To make matters worse, I had only lived at this place for 4-5 months (again, years ago), and we didn’t have a single late fee or complaint in that time. I realized I hadn’t been taken off the lease.

I texted him and he’s been telling me he 100% took me off the lease, and that the apartment management was switching at the time (this was true, I remember a different woman taking over as the manager during that time, so I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt) and that there must be some misunderstanding going on. He’s been calling the office and texting me to update me, saying if possible do I have documents or mail from that time to prove my change of address. 

Unfortunately this was so long ago I have no old mail from that time.... Even my DMV address wasn’t changed immediately. I was also 19 at this point, and didn’t think it through properly to record me leaving. I have pictures of me in a different home, that’s the only way I remember the correct date of when I left the property.

I’m going in this upcoming Monday to speak to the apartment management about this issue. I can tell them 1) I moved out between Feb. 10-14th 2016, 2) from move-in(when our lease began) to my move-out date there was not one complaint/late payment, 3) they were undergoing management change between Feb/March of 2016.

Is there anything I can do in this situation? Am I screwed, completely? There’s no damages racked up on my credit report from this incident either. I think my ex moved out of this apartment within the last year or so.

(I recognize 19 yo me did not think ahead years ago. I’m just hoping there’s literally anything I can do to repair this now.)",30Mar2019,1

I thought i could hack it my self and get my self out of this depression and guilts, but it seems to continue devastating my life without hope of recovery or finding happiness again.

The thing is, I push myself but I don't know where I'm going. I'm working on a startup with my other friends and I try to come up with different projects for myself. Last week it was building a personal brand, now it's podcasting. And I become tired of it really easily because I just don't have a particular reason to do it.

228,"I live with my 26 year old brother who's been a chronic user for more than 5 years now. I've watched him turn into a distorted version of himself in the last few years because of weed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should preface by saying that he has a rocky mental health history: poor anger management, impulse control issues and chronic depression. It's never been too unmanageable, but he definitely copes by smoking pot. However, these days, his days begins and ends with pot. Outside of work, he can't go longer than a few hours without getting highly irritable or depressed unless he smokes pot. He'd become silent, unable to focus, cranky, and apathetic about everything except to smoke some more immediately. His social life has dwindled down to just me and our alcoholic neighbor. He's lost all passion for his hobbies. He just smokes and puts on Youtube videos. Everyday, he spends hours sitting at his weed station organizing, packing mokes, blowing out the bowl, cleaning his bong, and sorting through the weed. His life is just weed now. His mental health is not any better with it, and even worse off without it.

&amp;#x200B;

He's also experiencing some physical symptoms. He wakes up every morning coughing his lungs out, it's so severe sometimes that he coughs blood up. This has been happening for a good year or two now. He also experiences occasional vomiting after smoking too many in a row - which happens when he tries to ""get one more bowl in"" before either sleeping or leaving for work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've convinced him to go see a therapist and a doctor for his cough. But so far nothing is helping. His therapy sessions are once every two weeks, and the doctor said nothing of his coughing. He's able to admit that he's addicted and that he wishes to change, I can even tell that it's something he feels guilty about. However, his mental well being is so dependent on being high that he has absolutely zero plans to change his lifestyle.

&amp;#x200B;

This has all been a drain on my own mental health and I can't move out by myself for another year or two. How do I even begin to help him make small and meaningful changes to quit smoking pot? Weed is practically his only way he can cope with his mental health, and this all just seems like an insurmountable addiction.",30Mar2019,1

231,"Hi guys, I'll attempt to make this brief

&amp;#x200B;

I currently work in IT. I finished studying just under 2 years ago and my current job has me re-thinking my career choice.

I believe (If I think about it a lot) I chose IT as a job because it was the closest thing to gaming (my at the time hobby) and I needed something quick to get me out of sitting around after high-school ended.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to my current day job...This is a summary of what my specific role entails:

* I look after our server infrastructure (along side my team)
* I receive work in the form of tickets (of which the amount fluctuates heavily - Sometimes I have nothing to do)
* I basically provide level 3 support

The perks however are the following:

* I have the option of working from home. I generally do this when my ticket count is low
* As a recent example, I was able to work from home 4 days out of the week.
* I get flown overseas every now and then for projects.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm concerned about is the following:

To preface my concerns: My passion has always been centred around space and rocketry (queue goosebumps just thinking about it). I obviously need to go back to study to fulfil this. A Bachelor of Engineering, Majoring in Mechanical engineering with an eventual Masters (focusing on Rocketry) is what I've applied for.

Now, to my concerns:

In my current job, having the flexibility of large amounts of time to myself (working from home), the great salary they provide and all the benefits of that come along with having a job (peace of mind in a horrible world of trying to find work); it all allows me to focus on me...Self reflection, my mind's well-being, my body's health and my social exposure all combine to make me one of the healthiest versions of myself I feel I've ever been.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT! I hate my job. There is no ambition, it is the furthest reason of getting out of bed in the morning I have. I genuinely feel like it is sapping away my potential.

However, becoming a student will remove a lot of the aforementioned benefits of this job and will replace them with other more looming disadvantages (Less money, more stress, less time for personal development)

&amp;#x200B;

I still have the ability of living at home whilst I study (paying rent of course). However, even after saving money from my current job, I still require a part time gig to prevent myself from eating away at my savings.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do...I need insight from people other than me.

2. I give him space because of this statement (told him it was to respect his space) and our conversation becomes a bit dry as he doesn't share as much as previously. 
3. Don't speak in about a week, he puts a story up saying he's taking a break from social media (hello, what were you doing so far) which I saw but didn't open.

234,"Just some background on me. So in my life I am in a good place. I am from the UK, got a 2.1 degree in history last summer and have just started out at a fairly low paid (£18,000) a year job that is chill and semi-history related. I'm 22.

What I need guidance on is that I want to have something big to aim towards professionally or still have a dream job/aspirations, but I cannot decide what to do. I have a few ""dream jobs"" that I would like to put my efforts towards but cannot decide. These include:

- The goal of having a book published with my name on it. Originally this was going to be a history book, but I don't feel I can be good enough to become a lecturer to write a credible book. 
- An eSports Commentator/pundit. I am a fairly outgoing and confident guy who is also into eSports. It would be a gamble to invest the money to try and make it in this.
- To create/produce music. I have always liked the idea of getting the equipment and starting to attempt to create music, but again, it's a big gamble to invest that sort of money.

So they're my three big ideas. Obviously there are many steps that need to be taken before these could be a sustainable job or even achievable. But I want to have a focus otherwise I tend to just coast by on what is easy.

So my question is how do I decide on one path and stick to it? Or should I stick to more realistic goals?

240,"First let me start this off with I dont usually support ghosting. 

On to the issue, last weekend I had a possible mini stroke or something causing the same symptoms as a stroke. I let my mom know when she asked if I called my son (kiddo lives with dad for obvious health related issues) I told her no and why. 

She messaged me to see how I was feeling later and I told her how the symptoms made it hard to function. I can barely walk, can't talk without stuttering and stammering and just recently fought hard enough to remember what keys go where again on a keyboard, though I'm still slow. My right side still goes randomly numb and all around I'm awful. 

Wens I tried to call kiddo as it's out day. His dad refused to answer and told me he wouldn't allow me to call kiddo until I stopped lying to him about getting him things and called regularly. Up until a month ago I had a full time job and barely any time to run to the post. So i get why dad is being an asshole but hes being an asshole. 

So I message my mom, because shes my mom... I figured she'd at least be supportive... instead she starts going into how hes right and I just... shut her down. I told her she always chooses his side even though this is the man who was awful to me our whole marriage (cheating, abuse, gave me head trauma but I deal with him for kiddo. That's a different fucked up tale though) and she tried to tell me that I shouldn't assume what shes going to say. 

I threw it back at her informing her to look at her own track record, every time he and I had any issue she sided with him. She hasnt tried to visit me except once since I moved out of the house after a 2 week post partum stay with her, and that was to berate me about how unfair I was to jj to have a restraining order on his dad. 

But I laid here crying, setting off more of whatever is fucked in my brain pan from stress and realized that blocking her was good. Shes never had my side in anything against any of my exes, always chided me when I would seek doctors advice for health issues, state I'm too young, over reacting ect.

I realized... it might be better shes gone from my life. Shes never put me first, even growing up. My middle sister had everything she wanted. I didnt get to play sports till middle sister wanted to, never got to do dance class like I wanted, or band, or anything extracurricular unless my middle sister wanted to. 

I've honestly laid here debating blocking her phone number as well and just... forgetting shes my mom. She grew more and more distant since I announced I was in a same sex relationship and now this was the final painful straw... 

Tl;dr my mom has never put me first, continues to pick others over me, and never believes my health is as awful as it is... decided enough was enough and blocked her. ",30Mar2019,3
241,"She was physically and emotionally abusive when I was a kid and she’s extremely controlling and manipulative. About 2 weeks ago, we had a long and deep conversation about life and religion in the kitchen and I felt like something changed. The next morning, she was the same controlling person and I felt like it’ll never change but I still have a little hope. What do I do? Should I try to talk to her again or should I not bother?

243,"I am still healing from this heartbreak but it was over a year ago. I moved on I have new friends talk to different people and in a good spot in life. But when I was 15 and a sophomore in High school. I decided to start sitting with this guy who was 1 grade ahead of me and a little over 2 years older than me. He is very quiet and like I knew him for 2 years and didn't hear him talk for a while. He literally sat alone, literally at the lunch table and I thought he was an interesting person and I talked to him a little bit on Facebook, we were friends on fb, I knew of him. Thing is, like he is a borderline internet addict and that's the only way he interacts with people. Well I decided to sit with him out of an act of kindness I really felt bad just wanted to be a friend to someone. I don't want anyone to feel alone, it sucks. He seemed just to be a quiet, asocial guy who's awkward. I am awkward in my own way. I was diagnosed with autism at 4, he figured out I was autistic pretty early and he's smart. Well nothing really bad at all happened. We talked about history and school stuff. We could talk about anything. We were two young intellectual men who just talked about a lot of stuff academically. Not just stuff two typical 15 and 17 year old boys talk about. His family knew of my family as a matter of fact. His uncle was one of my father's close friends. It's a small town, everyone knows each other. Well we were in the same geometry class, he wasn't allowed to advance to the next level of math. We would talk in school, at the table, on fb messenger. Well early on he would do dumb stuff like he took nacho cheese and smeared it on my book then looked at me. I just thought he was awkward didn't know what to do. Then when I ask him what a ""dyke"" was, he asked me to ask the English teacher on lunch patrol. Because he studies English, I thought it was innocent joking but yeah. I didn't notice much but I guess I asked him if it grinds his gears that he literally helped me with geometry and everything. Yet I somehow got a much better grade than him and passed the standardized test. I had a terrible loss in my family, he was there for me for it. Early on like when we talked for a couple months, he sent my mom a Facebook friend request. She declined it not knowing who he was. Then months later he says something about her declining it, like he was surprised she declined it. Then I told him I would talk to her tell her who he was and basically explain, he's awkward and to accept it. She did, then he said when she accepted it he wanted to message her. I didn't really care, he didn't follow through never did. At the table, he openly told me he was involved in some online drama, and like he trolls people. 

Well it's fine for a year I thought he's this really nice even keeled guy. The next school year, he's a senior and I felt bad I couldn't sit with him at the table because I was in a couple college classes when I was a junior and my schedule didn't even give me a lunch period. He sat alone the WHOLE YEAR. He would always sit alone even back in middle school. Everything was fine. Then he invited me to sit with him and his family at this show at my school, I sat with them and everything. BTW, I was literally his best friend. He has all these online friends I guess. Well months go by and like towards when he was going to graduate. I tell him about a girl I met out of town. He sends her a friend request on every form of social media. She flirted with me since she met me and like tried to get my attention. She's attractive too. Well, I got a provacative shirt and he wanted to get the same exact one. He said if he wore it people would freak out, yet people encouraged me. I was interested in asking her to hangout. He was very supportive. He told me about his crush on a girl since he was in 6th grade or so. He would go around and message people, like guys she dated, her close friends and everything to dig for information and yeah. I decided to go to the gym to lose weight, eat better diet. He decides to diet. I got my driving license permit, he asked me about it and was really interested in his permit. Thing is he comes from a poor family and lives in low income housing. Has 2 older siblings. Things were good, only thing was he took me pointing stuff out like a guy who posted on fb he got a 42 on a test gets a lot of likes, like they support him. He took it as me judging him. I shortly told him about a girl I talked to when I was 14 and he immediately adds her. Next day she declines. She doesn't know him. He would ask me for people's names in geometry (girls) so he could add them. I told him a story about a girl randomly giving me her # he said I should've given it to him. Back to the point. Everything was good. We both joked about how he was like my therapist and my boy in one. Friends are great support to talk about problems with. 

Then, he graduated and all was good for like a month or two MAX. Then over the summer we started hanging out and I met his older sister who's like 9 years older than myself. Well I was contemplating reaching out to the girl I met out of town. I got my license and immediately, he wanted his permit but didn’t get it. He would say stuff like if we hung out, he would ride in my truck bed. Well he developed a weird fixation with her, like he tried following her on Instagram and he would comment compliments on her pics only to get them removed. He would talk to his sister about her like he knew her personally, used her first name and talked about her like she’s a close friend someone he knows. Then I changed my mind, well now he wants to go after her and like he has some fixation, he wanted me to message her and encourage her to message him. Right after i got my license he said he would like to ride in my truck and go to another town to go to a coffee place.He’s a creep and it’s weird I know for a fact she wants nothing to do with him. He was very aggressive about talking about graphic and sexual things. Well he has a laundry list of celeb crushes and girls/women he goes to school with. He has a laundry list of fantasies and are so filthy his mind is so perverted with them. Well, i start talking to him more in depth about this older girl I talked to when I was 14. She would flirt with me, get shy. Stare at me a lot, get red, try to talk to me any opportunity she could, get close, want selfies with me.Her friend would too and like offer me a ride, find any excuse to be around me. Parents friends and family told me she liked me clearly but I got a vibe from her and she borderline stalked and harassed me. He would listen to me talk and at first was supportive. I specified that I do not have romantic feelings for her but I do have platonic feelings for her and care about her. Then he started saying” after everything i said and he says he was helping me with killing my ego and ego death or whatever. Sounded more like he didn’t like me having self esteem and feels insecure easily and no self confidence so I am not allowed to but OK. Well then he got me into a group chat with him and his sister and all he did was criticize me about me and me ego. Didn’t say a thing in person. Then he like blackmailed me into telling his sister embarrassing stuff because I didn’t think a certain way and told him something. I guess with this girl hes crushed on since elementary school, he met up with a guy whos close to her or dated her in the past. Only to dig for information about her, nothing more he did it JUST to do that. No relationship beyond that. There are like 4 girls/women i can list off that he had weird lustful feelings for and fixations with. Like one is filthy and known for being promiscuous and is just filthy, poor hygiene. Wears revealing clothes and likes to take pics in bikinis put them on instagram. He said he wanted to reach out to her and has some weird lustful feelings for her. Whenever I spoke negatively of her said she was dirty, he could do better. Got very defensive and sensitive. Said I was judging her. Well, when I talked about my past female friend negatively, he basically blackmailed me and like wanted to repeat what I said to her younger brother. Message him to dig for information or something or get his opinion on me and his sisters relationship. I basically said no and he said “censorship”. Basically reach out to her brother on fb and message him out of nowhere when they haven’t talked in school. He said he wanted to help me reconnect with her or something along the lines of that. So me and her can be friends again but I wasn’t entirely sure about how i feel or if I actually want anything to do with her. Well he said he was going to have this taken care of and its like he was planning something. He basically said he was going to help me and he wanted to contact her eventually when she doesn’t know him and vice versa. Like he wanted to go out to eat at the restaurant she works at and I felt something was up. I just notice he got somewhat angry when speaking of her. I would tell him stuff she did and he said he wish a girl did that to him. When we talked about her he then later told me that he told his mom some unsettling things about us. So fast forward a month later I got upset and said something to his sister and it wasn’t that bad, just what I thought. Word gets back to him he’s fine. He started getting very aggresive and evidently had some anger towards me and just bring up nonsense. Well he blew up a week later over nothing sent me a bunch of rants, then blocked me when I didn’t respond or try to add fuel to the fire. Whole family removes me off facebook. We talk for another month.I ran into him in person with my mom and his family and he was shifty eyed didn’t look at me just waved. Then messages me saying he talked to his brother (who knows her) about my relationship with her. Only to tell me he said negative stuff and basically says we have nothing in common, I can’t see us being friends and why she would want anything to do with me. About a month goes by, we were talking about her  I say something negative about her like I have the self respect to walk away and not deal with her. He started blowing up started a fight then threatened to message her to tell her to block me or tell her the negative stuff. Then wanted to message her and went on and on and on. I pleaded for him not to do so. I don’t want to be known for being friends with a freak who messages random women. Then just goes on and on. Starts saying I am controlling who he talks to and forcing my feelings onto him for someone I don’t like. Well I stopped talking to him forever after that. He reached out to a guy he knows I am friends with and talked to, so he can help work it out and I just assume so he can talk to her.",30Mar2019,4

246,"Sorry for my punctuations. 

Basically, to shorting it up in a few texts I lost my grandfather last year and it really put a toll in our family. My grandmother has changed after his passing. Well, a few days back my mum was crying in the car when she picked me and my brother up from school. 

She told us that we have to move houses, and I will have to change schools. As my grandmother has gotten very toxic and rude to my mother when we leave for school. I'm just really confused and really don't know how I should handle it, we all live under the same roof but they stopped talking. 

My brother isn't good at anything, he doesn't take school seriously as he said that he is going to become a chef, I'm really just the opposite from him I love science and math but I'm afraid that if I change schools all my credits will disappear and I will lose contact with my grandma. I have 2 years left and my brother has a year left for high school. Btw I should point out that we go to an all boys private school and if we change I need to go to a public school. Well, today my mum asked me for a few stuff and once I brought it to her she was crying and eating I asked her if she wanted anything she said no and I left the room holding back my tears. My mum still wants to move and my grandmother still isn't talking to her I just really need help to understand as I don't want to lose any of them. ",30Mar2019,1

248,"Hello Reddit, this is regarding the relationship between me and my brother. I am much much (emphasis) younger than him and he is a grown man, yet we both have similar interests, which to me isn't all that abnormal; but rather for me it would be considered ""smart"", as for him it would be considered ""geeky"" in the public's perspective. We've had a rough past, lots of verbal abuse, used to threaten to hit me (never did luckily), or make fun of my childish thoughts, plus hypocritically accusing me of doing things that he does. We were going through a hard time, so I forgave him every time, but the debris of bitterness and a loss of trust still remains (Note we were best buds before this) . Now, we've gradually moved past that, although there are still signs of his ""former"" self left, but he has greatly changed. The only thing is that I have created a ""false"" personality of myself, that I had first created to evade verbal bullying. A mask almost it seems, although I don't deceive him or trick him in an unmoral way, but rather act shy and super kind. He is really nice to me now, but whenever I somehow slip out of the mask and stop being a complete ""YES Man"", he starts to act like his previous self. He sometimes gives me good advice, but most of them are opinion based and not completely true, but rather hypocritical. Such as, do good in school and you'll become like me. Which I get what he means, but he isn't all that wealthy nor lives in the best area. What gets me most, is that he really doesn't seem to focus when a person is bummed out or uninterested, and still expects them to comply with it. I really love him and usually enjoy it every time I visit him and his great family :) I really can not see myself opening up to him because it would be awkward and break his heart, which is the last thing I aim to do, but now I'll have to continue being pissed off inside. I have anxiety as any teenager would and for me he sort of mocks me, yet tries to correct me. For example, Him: why do you speak so low...... mocks me............ ""always speak with confidence""........ Me: ""Well, a high tone of voice doesn't necessarily always mean confidence, I am confident when I speak btw"". I also avoid cussing and rated R movies, and he makes fun of me for that sometimes, as to even cussing purposely in front of me while slowing down and continuing every time he cusses, almost like a preschool teacher teaching a child a new word. (I am pretty new to reddit and this is a dummy account, which I don't have the password of, so if the mods could delete this post after a few days it would be truely great, thank you). Thank you very much! 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I love my brother, but we've had problems in the past, which caused me to create a fake personality in order to avoid his verbal abuse. (Note: he has not done anything bad physically, but mentally)",30Mar2019,1
249,"So this might be a little long and my grammar may not be the best because this whole situation has worn me out. 

So basically this all started when I was scrolling on Instagram and there were comments. This girl asked for the price of an item because she was curious and this guy pitched in and began kind of harrassing her. His last comment was something along the lines of ""I could explain it to you but I don't have time to argue with you. Don't comment back."" And I kind of commented back ""well if you don't want comments then don't comment in the first place."" There were about two more comments and then I ended up posting it on my story with the caption, ""Dumb bitch energy today.😂"" I blocked out names and stuff so no one could look up his account or anything and thought that was the end of it. (Yes, I realize that I was dumb for doing this and it's not exactly the best response to things like this)

Anyway, he DMed me a little later calling me an ugly girl and to unblock his name and stuff like that. I of course ignored this and promptly just deleted the messages not thinking anything of them. 

An hour or two passes and suddenly my friend who I haven't talked to in years messaged me saying he got a message from another account pretending to be me and then another friend message me about the account and sent me a link to it. I went on the account and someone had screenshotted a good portion of the photos on my Instagram with new captions and posted them. Some of the new captions included themes suggesting I was being intimate with my father among other inappropriate comments such as ""look at my thick ass"". Then the bio said I'd made a new account and was impersonating me. 

I promptly messaged everyone who had followed and asked them to report and unfollow them. He then messages me on the account later with messages threatening that if I didn't apologise it would get much much worse along with a countdown and a goodbye. I've reported the account a few times to Instagram and nothing has been done yet. (Hopefully it will be soon.) My friends who messaged the account asking to take it down were promptly either blocked or harassed. He threatened to make fake accounts for them as well with photos that were public on their profiles. 

I'm just.... So tired. I'm pretty sure this is all just petty online drama and stuff. I know I caused this but I feel like the guy is seriously taking this too far. I'm getting scared that if he goes this far about a comment a stranger on the internet made then he might try to take it a step further and do more. Does anyone have any advice on this? I'm honestly at a loss for words and feel helpless. 

Thank you for taking the time to read. I really appreciate it. ",30Mar2019,2

I have an old friend who recently was diagnosed with cancer, I hadn’t seen him since before his diagnosis but keep in touch by messaging.

My friend asked me to hang out as we haven’t seen eachother in a long time and he’s feeling really down lately about his situation. Although it’s completely platonic and I have no attraction to this friend whatsoever, because he’s a guy I asked my bf for permission and told him I would be hanging out at my friends house. Of course he said yes, he’s been encouraging me to visit this friend since the diagnosis.

So I go to his house and we talk about our lives over the last year, just catching up on all the things we’ve missed in each others lives. We put on the tv and he seems a little emotional at the show. I put my head on his chest and tell him it will all be okay. We lie like this, him telling me about the darker parts of his life and me comforting him. We end up falling asleep this way.

It’s the next day now and I’m just curious as to whether I did anything wrong? I don’t have any attraction to this friend and just wanted to comfort him in a very dark time. And just for the record I had no intention of falling asleep with him.

Did I do anything wrong?

254,"My first impression of boyfriend’s best friend was that he was a bad influence on him. For example he introduced him to weed which to me at the time was a big deal as I come from a very anti-drugs family.

I have only met the guy once which probably doesn’t help but every time they hang out I just feel super uncomfortable.

They have been best friends for like 10 years and I know that I can’t/don’t want to stop them seeing each other but we have been together for a few years now and the feeling hasn’t gone away!

255,"Let me start my life story since i was a kid, i was smart and inteligent, i was a good kid and never did something bad. My parents used to always fight and shout, they fought each other, they fought with my grandmother and so on. They would always make little things look like huge problems. I used to suffer a lot and i used to cry all night alone in the room and in the morning i would put my happy face to make things look normal and try to fix things. I moved away from my parents when i was 14 for better education ( that was an excuse because i just wanted to run away), I finished high school with good grade and till i was 19 i had to do everything on my own, like laundry, cooking and stuff. I used to cry and the only person who told me that things were gonna be better was myself, basically i was alone. When i was 19 my parents came to my city and we lived together, i started studying civil engineering and i finished my 1st year. In the next 3 years something broke and i never attended classes or went to university. I just would go around meeting people and eating food and basically wasting my time and 3 years. During this time my mom had 2 bad surgeries removing cancer and of course i suffered. They were home and the fights and shouting never stopped so i used to go out a lot. Now im 23 and soon im gonna be 24 in summer, i have lied to my parents and everyone and they think im on my last years of getting my msc degree and i have spent all my parents money. I wanna turn my life around because its going downhill. If i continue my studies im gonna be like 27-28 when im completely done with my education and im afraid of being late.

257,"it's me again, the girl who moved back east after giving the midwest a try after hs and can't seem to get a new start.

another long post for those who have gotten this far. sorry if im rambling i am just so stressed and don't have anyone i can talk openly to.

a lot has happened in the past week, both stressful and not so much. it would take a while to go into much detail. while my boyfriend was visiting back home from college, my roommate freaked out on both of us. she made a scene over the behavior of a friend's dog we were sitting, which i cannot control. he (my boyfriend, referred to as A from here) didn't sleep all night, for many reasons. D, my roommate, woke him and i up screaming, said terrible things about him and i to our faces, basically went full on psycho which embarrassed me in front of my exhausted boyfriend who i only got to see for a limited time! 

after D exploded i went awol for the next day or so. apparently i was supposed to work, which i never work thursdays so naturally i didn't show up. D called me, my mom, my dad's home and cell, maybe even my brother, asking where i was. hypocritical bc she's always late. anyway she also sent A a message request. i begged him to just delete it, not to give into her and open it out of respect for me. like an asshole, he said 'of course i'm going to read it' and called me childish. i felt very disrespected. oh well. it was just asking him where i was, although we were just sleeping, and not together. 

long story short with the roommate episode, A's not angry with me despite what he experienced at my place. i am kind of afraid of D trying to contact A again for any reason (spread bullshit lies, ruin our relationship, manipulate, etc.) though i actually had a lovely dinner with him and his parents last night. but D kicked me out. and A apparently told his parents all about the embarrassing situation and they're rich so of course they're judgy. so i had to call in a couple favors and move all my personal affects to my dad's place. not much stuff but.

i can't stay here. i love my dad and my brothers but im 20 years old and until recently wasn't doing so well. the house is a mess. sure i can clean it up while im looking for work but that's beside the point, it's miserable here. he is disabled and depressed since he and my mom split. and my older brother has aspergers. 

i don't know what to do with my life. i have nothing. no prospects, not a dollar to my name. and i feel pathetic and sad. if you were to ask me why i don't have any money saved, rent is expensive and i work part time and you already know it's impossible for me to find a better job for some reason. my best friend goes to school hundreds of miles away in dc and doesn't even know this is happening, she's got her own stuff to go through. i do have my boyfriend who i love very much and like to think he loves me. but he flies back to school this morning and i already miss him so bad. his family is great but he is impressionable and not always the kindest to me so again i am so afraid of D doing something to our relationship. i secretly hope im pregnant with his baby, i know that doesn't always save a relationship but it would give me some hope. a baby would turn my life around for the better. it will take a few days to find out but if im not pregnant, i might attempt suicide again and see where that gets me.

but last time i did that no one offered me any help. where i used to live, i was committed twice for simply ideation. here, i actually swallow a bottle of tylenol and chug a handle of liquor, need my stomach pumped and my organs checked. then once i regain consciousness they throw me out. i came in an ambulance so i had no phone, no shoes, no purse, no money. the clothes i came in were ripped open by paramedics. i never onced spoke to a doctor or psychiatrist. no exaggeration. understandable. i dont have health insurance and i don't deserve to live. i just need help. and i don't know where to turn. why is my life like this.",30Mar2019,1

basically the only hobbies i have are playing guitar and playing hockey. while i still love hockey, it’s been extremely hard to play since last august. my stepdad of 13 years, who got me into the sport, killed himself. it wrecked me. all of us. 
the only good thing that came out of his suicide was realizing that i absolutely. cannot. kill myself. no matter how much i may want to, i can’t do that to my mom. absolutely not. i used to find comfort in the thought of ending it all, but now i know that’s not an option, i have no idea what to do. i have to convince myself every day that people care about me. it’s exhausting. being awake is exhausting. i’m so tired of being “strong. “ i want to disintegrate. i’m so dissatisfied with my life and i feel like i can’t do anything about it.

I’m pretty worried I’ll somehow get myself stuck in some form of drama so I really want to learn BJJ to keep myself safe, especially since its more centered around protecting yourself from being beat up rather than hurting the opponent.

How can I bring this up with my mum? She knows I love watching physical fights and such (mainly because they look really cool!!) and I’m worried she might think that I want to learn BJJ because I have some sort of interest in starting fights at school, which I’d never do (3.7 GPA, with high grades). I really want to do it to keep myself safe.. How should I go about it? She doesn’t really know what BJJ is 

I haven’t asked yet but I’m scared she’ll say no if I go about it the wrong way - any advice?

I have a boyfriend who i think is wonderful and attractive in every way, but I recently had an experience where I came across a very very attractive girl. I’ve talked about this a little with him.

I mean we trust each other. Anyway not the point. I really don’t even know what I’m typing anymore.

265,"Context: I'm a 16 year old (almost 17 at this point), and I left highschool and started college early because highschool was loud and chaotic.  I have autism, MDD, GAD, and possible OCD (further testing was supposed to happen but didn't) - chaos and noise are bad with autism, college is less chaotic and noisy.

I was supposed to hand in disability forms at the beginning of the term.  I got them and filled out some parts and left some that my mom had the information for but I saw she filled them out wrong; I told her but nothing has come from it yet, though now I have no idea where the forms are other than she probably has them somewhere.

I have an obsession with learning, but my personal study greatly interferes with my studies for school.  For instance, I'm going through a lot of statistics stuff on my own but cannot get myself to focus on math for school or study for the ACT that I have to take soon.

I've missed too many classes in every class, and have trouble getting myself to come in late if I must.

I recently failed a symbolic logic exam, and I've apparently missed previous exams in math and psychology.  I did pretty badly on a more recent psychology exam too, though IIRC I didn't fail only because I knew enough already.  I had to do an essay for english and probably did horribly considering that I missed drafting and peer-review, and it was hastily written.  A few weeks ago my math class moved and I haven't been able to find it - I have an exam in a few days and need to figure out where the class is before then.

I'm... Not sure what to do.",30Mar2019,2

285,"I'll try and make a long story short but I'm basically panicking that I may have been groomed and that I have suppressed any thoughts about it until now. 

When I was 13 I was bored and ended up on the chat site teenspot. I talked to lots of people and made up lots of different personas to talk to these people. I talked to one person for a long time and we ended up chatting by text. He was 23. To him I was I think maybe 19? I can't remember exactly. We chatted on the phone a lot - even though this meant me whispering so my parents didn't hear. When he first asked to text I told him I had no mobile phone to which he replied if I meet him he'll give me one.. so we can chat more. He eventually found out that I was 13 but the relationship didn't stop then. I eventually agreed to meet and he gave me the mobile phone (yeah this is obviously a red flag now.. ). At the time I thought I was super mature (and I was quite independent and mature for a 13 year old) and that he loved me. The relationship progressed to me spending weekends at his house where he would help me with homework and we would cuddle. Eventually this led to sex when I was about 14. He always acted like it wasn't the right thing to do and that it was a mutual decision. I just liked having somewhere to go that I felt cared about as my home life was really rocky at the time with my parents divorcing. 

Eventually it all ended when he cut all ties and stopped responding to me at the age of of 15. I was devastated and ended up in a state of major depression. It was like a break up. I got over it eventually but did have a string of relationships until my mid 20's where I just didn't value myself and would often sleep with people because I felt pressured into it or just thought why not because sex has no value. 

Anyway at the age of 26 I'm in a really good relationship and I told my partner what had happened. He immediately said that I was groomed and abused. Part of me thinks he's right because the man was 23 and I was 13!! But I cannot shake the feeling that I am somewhat to blame for catfishing him... Was I just completely naive and this man knew exactly what he was doing? Wha'ts weird is that he didn't lie about his family or work situation.. I knew everything about his life. Did he just fuck up and make a mistake? 

&amp;#x200B;

Warning signs for me include: 

Giving me the phone and topping it up regularly

Not allowing me to eat anything in his house because I was getting a bit fat, but made me watch him eat cake

He was 23! Really he should have thought this is gross or wrong

Buying me gifts all the time. 

Wanting me to spend time with him instead of my friends

I'm so confused. I have always thought that this was a mistake between two people but I don't know if it was something more sinister.  What do I do now?

286,"Not to sure if anyone has found themselves in this situation, be the first time I created a reddit post here but maybe a bit of back story would do nicely first, I’ll try and not sound so biased and be objective...

So me and my friend, I’ll call her Queenie, (she can be a little bit of a drama queen but then again so am I) have known each other and have been best friends for over 10 years, we met in secondary school and stayed in touch, being really close and we would always hang out

 I decided in December that with the new year coming round and me being 28 years old that I would move out of my parents home, it’s currently me, my older brother and my mom and dad that live in the house and it’s the house I grew up in, I decided to move out because it’s getting a bit cramped and I feel I’m at the age where I should find my own home.
So I started searching round until the start of this month, I feel in love with a house that had 3 bedrooms, one bathroom, with a love kitchen, living room and gardens that didn’t need a lot of work done (Unfortunately I wasn’t born with green thumbs 😂), there was also easy access for my gran whenever she comes round to visit.

So I began in the process of bidding, the house was originally £78,500 but I was able to get them down round to £73,000, now Queenie mentioned to me that she was looking at a few houses and when I showed her the ones I wanted to look at, she told me not to because she and her boyfriend, I’ll call him Kingie, we’re also looking at the same houses I was, to be fair when she told me that I did think, ‘ No way, if there’s a house I want to take a look at, I’m going to do it' plus Queenie and Kingie didn’t look at the house at that point so that’s ok.

Now some people will probably ask me what the hell were you thinking but about two weeks ago, Queenie, my other friend while we’ll name Cinnamon with another one of her friends, Coco, along with Kingie, were gathered round talking, Queenie then told me that she and Kingie were just after looking at a house that was in the same area, when I asked if she could show me a picture and she showed me the same house I was looking at, I’ll admit I did freak out in my mind
I was quiet for a bit before I decided I didn’t want to be in a bidding war with my best friend and told her I was bidding on the house.

What followed was the following conversation:

Me: Ok now don’t be mad but I’m kind of in the process of bidding for that house

Queenie: Oh...were you the one that offered £70,000 

Me: Yeah

Queenie: Didn’t that get rejected?

Me: Not really I’m still negotiating at the moment, your not mad are you, I don’t want to be in a bidding war with my best friend so I thought I’ll tell you and Kingie now just before hand

Queenie: Ah ok, that’s fine we were looking for a place near Kingie’s work anyway

Me: I’m glad, I was scared in case you were going to be mad at me, you see that house is handy for me because it’s near a bus stop where I can go to shops, it’s close to my family and I’m not far away from shops

Queenie: well what about when they come over? Where would they park? Also it would be tough for your gran to visit you it’s all those stairs

(The house is one of those areas where it’s rows behind rows of houses and they have a stair way to the front house but this one had parking at the back)

Me: Oh I’ve thought of that, there’s parking at the back

Queenie: (Looking s little surprises when I mentioned that, Kingie seemed to have caught on as well) Oh... would your gran now have problems with that?

Me: Look my gran might be in her eighties but it’s so much handier for her when she comes to visit

Queenie: Would you not rather live in a bungalow instead, would that not be handier for you?

Me: Nah, Bungalows are a little bit small and some of them are pretty expensive, it’s cheaper for me too

You can probably imagine at this point she tried to get me to change my mind but I was really set on the house but I couldn’t go any higher than £75,000, I told everyone that I planned to look at the house the next upcoming Wednesday before I make anymore decisions.
Now cut to the day before the I was set to look at the house again and hopefully seal the deal, I get a call from the estates agents saying that they received another offer and that the home owners were considering the offer unless I counter it, I was firm and said that I would make no decisions until I look at the house again, they even tried to get me to look at it on Tuesday but it didn’t suit for me because my dad is an elder and had a few funerals to go to, so it was obvious I wouldn’t be able to make it.

I also took a few days off work just so I could see this house and had an interview (not really relevant but to show that I planned to look at it in advance) 
I had to tell them that if someone else was looking to buy it then I would retract my offer because there was no way I was going over £75,000

I even sent a message to Queenie asking if she wanted to hang out, she replied back saying she wasn’t feeling too good and had an interview on the Friday, I was wondering at first if this could be linked to the house but I shrugged it off thinking no way, if my friend was bidding then she would obviously let me know before hand, wouldn’t she?

Last night she dropped s little bombshell on me, she, Kingie and Cinnamon came up to my house, they were all drinking and Queenie told me that SHE AND KINGIE bought the house, now I can take a while to fully comprehend what happened, I didn’t really say anything at first, just looked at her a bit surprised because I remember after someone else bided the house I was crying and angry for a couple of hours and my dad had to calm me down when he got back, I apologised and thought it just wasn’t meant to be to my dad for being mad.

I calmly said, ok and then started to talk to Kingie about the work that the house will need done, Queenie then went to our bathroom and cried saying she didn’t want to 'lose' me as a friend, I told her that after I heard someone else bid the house that I was upset but that I still see her as a friend, she even told me that Kingie asked if they could tell me they bought the house after they got the keys, she said no, probably a little scared to see what I think...

So she was also sick and didn’t leave the house until 2:40am with Kingie, me and dad had to run Cinnamon home, Queenie's mom came up and walked her and Kingie home, she kind of mixed drinks and spilled water in the bathroom...

I think it just hit me today and I feel livid, ok some of it was my fault but she has been my friend for 10 years, didn’t even give me a call or anything to ask if I was ok with her and Kingie bidding on the house when they knew i bidder first, and maybe sounding a little dramatic but I've felt like I’ve been stabbed in the back, I knew for sure if things were reversed then she might not have even talked to be for months on end, our longest fight was 6 months, she seemed a bit quick to blame Kingie but neither of them asked me if I was ok with them bidding, they don’t need my permission or anything but a little heads up might be nice

But who knows maybe I'm going overboard or overreacting, I think I need to give myself a bit of distance between me and her for now...if anything happens I might update on the after math ",30Mar2019,1

288,"I’m 22 and have just been diagnosed with ADHD and BPD disorder, it’s taken me all these years to finally see a psychologist and psychiatrist because I did not want to believe I had something wrong with me. 
I’ve struggled all my school life with the academic side of things and I was hyperactive and got into a lot of trouble. I’ve bounced around 4 different schools all my life (2 primary and 2 high schools), I got expelled in grade 6 due to my uncontrollable behaviours, I then transitioned into high school and struggled there again with my academics and behaviours and also hung around bad crowds. I received no help from my schools, I was just labeled as a bad kid. Although some teachers informed my parents that I could have a learning difficulty. 
I then started to study what I was interested in for 3 years, I struggled to focus at times although it was easier to concentrate due to the interest, I did well. 
I went and worked in a field I aimed to work in and expand my career there, I am still currently working there although my inability to focus and absorb information has become really bad, which is why I went to finally seek medical advice. 

These are the things I’m experiencing day to day 
- inability to time manage (I’m running late to work almost all the time and I’m never getting ready on time when it comes to going out in my personal life) 
- I can’t sit for long periods of time, only on occasion like if I’m out with my boyfriend then I’m calm, but I still need to fidget. 
- I can’t focus when I’m trying to read something (could be anything, but I can read a menu if it isn’t confusing lol) I can’t focus much when someone is talking to me, it’s like I zone out.. but then sometimes I can focus, depending on the conversation. 
- I get distracted easy, anything can grab my attention, but then sometimes my attention is good depending on what I’m looking at etc. 
- it takes me a while to finish tasks ( it’s literally taken me 2 hours just to write this post because I’m procrastinating) and at work too, I’ve fallen behind at work due to my inability to sit down and actually concentrate on my work. 
- I’m extremely forgetful. I’m talking.. really forgetful, I forget where I place my glasses, keys and any other items that I need. I sometimes forget plans and I almost always forgery conversations I’ve had with people (which affects me in my personal and work life) 
- I’m always tired and I swing through different moods everyday. (this could be due to my BPD as my psychiatrist has told me) 
- sometimes I rush through work and make minor or major mistakes and sometimes I do that in my personal life too, like I could rush decisions without thinking and then later on it’ll turn out to be a mistake. 
- My mind is constantly ticking, like I can’t really prioritise tasks I need to do, I just jump from one task to another and then eventually get lost in the amount I need to do, then I end up not doing any of the tasks. (I’ve tried managing this by timing myself doing one task at a time but it hasn’t been successful) 
- I feel like I might be impulsive? Like, for example when I’m working and I’m driving then my mind tells me “hey send that email” even though I know I’m driving and it’s unsafe but it’s like an impulse and I end up sending the email while I drive then I don’t think through the email then later realise there’s mistakes in it or then I later regret sending it the way I did.. and they’ll b times in my personal life where I’ve had impulsive moments where I can’t control and I obsess over it, speeding for instance, I know I shouldn’t but I do even tho I’ve caught speeding fines and stuff. I’m also impatient waiting in traffic, but then sometimes I’m ok? 
- I feel like sometimes my mind is constantly in overdrive and I can jump from subject to subject when I’m talking to someone and then there’s times where my mind is just flat and I don’t think about anything at all.. 

That’s all I can think of right now, which are all the main ones I go through everyday. The reason why I’m writing this today is I wanna make sure that what I do have is ADHD, even though I’m seeing a psychiatrist and he said it’s ADHD, it’s like my mind isn’t believing it? I know this is just reddit and there isn’t much real life doctors or whatever but maybe just peoples opinions? Maybe someone with ADHD or someone who knows a lot about the topic? 
I’ve done heaps of ADHD tests and they back with a high percentage and I’ve also read and watched a lot of videos on it.. 
Do I show symptoms of ADHD? 
Sorry this is so long. But would love anyone’s opinions. 
Thanks in advance. ",30Mar2019,2

290,"I know how to talk to girls, and I'm fine doing so, but there's a girl at my school that I've pretty much always had feelings for on and off, we talk a lot on the way and leaving school when on the bus but not much when we are at school, she's hangs out with some dumb dogs that annoy the shit out of me. I want to talk to her on social media but I don't want to make it sound creepy or anything that could expose my crush on her. ",30Mar2019,3
291," 

My boyfriend and I, both in our mid 20s are together for four years. There has been an issue with a female co worker of his for over two years. He hang out at her house in secret 1.5 yrs ago, I found out much later. He claims nothing happens. They still work together and text sometimes, but less frequent. He swears he won't hang out with her - she has send inappropriate texts and such.

We live together in our own house. I leave every monday morning to another city and come back tuesday morning for work issues. This means he is alone for 24 hours.

This tuesday morning 10am I got out of the bus and saw that girl walking to the bus. We live in a small craphole place, with nothing to do. We have a supermarket, a bakery, one tiny clothing store and that is it. This girl lives in another city, works in another city and studies in another city. I know she has NO friends or family in our town, because she mentioned it earlier to my boyfriend. (""You are the only one I know that wants to live in that crap place!"")

What was her reason to be there, so early in the morning? I came home and my boyfriend was in bed asleep, with the window and curtains open. He always sleeps with the window and curtains closed.

I confronted and he said she was not there and has never been to our house. Then I decided to check his internet history. Yes, fellow redditors, I know this is wrong but I do NOT want a rant about this.

So I saw that the evening before he watched some netflix on his tablet until 11PM. After that, things get weird. He watched youtube on his mobile from 11.00 to 11.19 PM. This is odd, because I am with this guy for 4 years and he NEVER watches youtube on his phone when he is inside the house. He always only does this when he is in the bus, outside or whatever. However no busses drove at that moment so that can't be true. After 23.19 there was no signs of activity anymore on his phone, tablet or computer. He set up an alarm clock at 22.59 PM.

The first next activity was next day 08.04 am when he put off his alarm clock, and then 08.30 on Whatsapp.

He has a car that he shares with his mom. Wednesday we got into the car and he said; Mom keeps asking bout the car and drives my fuel till its empty. And I said; no she didn't asked for the car for at least 2 weeks why you bring this up? He just said oh it bothers me.

He kept bringing up this girl 2 or 3 times. ""I don't think it was her, I think you saw it wrong. Probably can't be her"" blah blah.

He got angry and sad when I asked him if he cheated and he denied all and called me paranoid. Ever since, nearly a week, my boyfriend acts distant and avoids sex. When we talk he says he is disappointed in me and feels like he is together with a private detective. He asked me why I am with him if I dont trust him.",30Mar2019,6

301,"For reference, I'm an English teacher in Eastern Asia. I have a few children I tutor one-on-one, usually with higher level English due to having lived in an English speaking country for a period of time.

This 9 year old, we'll call her Grace, has been student for about 8 months, most of that meeting twice a week. She's vivacious and outgoing, super friendly, and incredibly energetic. She hates school and homework, which makes sense, because there's so much pressure here that she has time for nothing else. Even when she finishes her mandatory schoolwork, her Dad makes her do more, while her Mom works all the time in order to pay for extra lessons and save for Grace's future.

I've known none of them are super happy, due to some in-depth talks with the Mom where she overshares, since I'm friendly and a foreigner. Grace's mom is clearly dealing with a lot of stress, and beyond that, recently lost her mother to cancer.

But finally, the point: in my most recent lesson with Grace, she told me that she ""Doesn't want to live."" This definitely threw me off, but she often jumps to negativity (if I ask her about her day, she always says it was ""bad""), so I followed up, and asked why. ""Homework"" was her answer. We discussed a few things, like not having homework in the summer, or after high school, but thing is: she has homework in the summer here, and if asked about the future, she thinks it will just be more incessant work. The only thing I could bring up worth living for was our local water park, which she loves.

Regardless, it seems like Grace doesn't see an end to the stress and pressure, and I'm worried that if it's this bad at 9, it's going to be much worse in high school when the pressure increases tenfold. She's a great lil kid, and I don't want to lose her to something that her parents can help her with now.

It was rough. I've suspected she might be depressed for a while, but it's reached a point where I think I should maybe talk to her mother about it. I just don't know how! She considers us friends, and I know she's open to therapy and the like, but there's almost none where I live, as it's a very small, podunk city.

Advice on how to communicate this please? Should I at all? Maybe I'm off base, and she's just a more negative thinker? I also wasn't sure if this was the perfect place to post this, but thought it was at least a good place to start.

Tldr; A 9 year old student I tutor is exhibiting signs of depression. I need advice on how to tell her East Asian parents.",30Mar2019,1
302,"This is gonna sound crazy, I feel like maybe my fams just crazy. 

I moved in with 20somethin lil bro in Jan, thinking he's a sane and chill human, he needed a place and at the time I did as well, it was our first time living together but I assumed we're openly communicative, our schedule is opposite so we rarely see each other. 

Two weekends ago he dognapped a baby pitbull, gave it to his weed dealers, verbally harrassed the owner during this whole ordeal and almost gotmy homie arrested. 

When my homie tried to find the dog-we called him, texted. He gave us a fake address and number. So she called the police (the owner gave her permission to care for the dog initially and he was forwarned about by me multiple times verbally and through text that this would get legal). He lied to the police about everything-which almost got my homie arrested until she got the owner on the phone who verified everything. When she finally found the puppy it was at these dudes jacked up def shady house: outside in the cold, had diarrhea and was totally traumatized. 
He owed my homie money for the damages the dog caused-of course won't pay it. 

So at the end of it all cussed me out for not ""taking his side"" called me and her a snitch, a snake, and pretty much disowned me. Throughout all of this, I have only spoken to him via text and all of the negativity and shit talking was solely him. I've kept everything respectful and factual with him. 
 I contacted my family elders (aka ole black folk) to put him in his place, sent them all the info, screenshots of his irresponsible actions, his outright disrespect towards me and the other women involved and they're like ""Ahhh yall just need to work on your relationship and set boundaries.""

I spent a week not staying home and not seeing his face because by gawds I wanted to deck him in his goddamned face. This shit sickens me. 
So I told our roomies me n him are moving out by the end of April, so we are searching for separate housing. 
I have an interview this weekend for a spot that's very co-op like and they need move in Asap (DC is expensive so I'm lucky to find a place as cheap and accomadating).
I wanna be a dick and just leave him with the goddamn doubled up rent and move the fuck out now.

305,"So, my SO decided he would take our youngest, who is a little over a year old, to work with him as today is a half day for him. I didn’t think he was serious when he mentioned it last night, as he is always talking about taking the kids to meet his coworkers, but this morning he asked me to get him ready. His work place doesn’t really seem child friendly (he works with a lot of machinery in a warehouse) but he said there was a safe area for our baby to play in.  I asked him a few questions about how he plans to feed our baby and the logistics of how it would work while I was getting him ready. It annoyed my SO, because he said it made him feel like I think he’s incompetent (I DON’T think that, but he doesn’t really help out a whole bunch with our kids. He works 12 or so hours a day and, even if he doesn’t work on weekends, I still do most of the child care unless I’m in the shower - even then, half the time the baby gets brought in with me to be bathed. Often when I leave the planning of things involving the kids to him, things such as eating times or drinks, etc get overlooked).Then, as they’re getting ready to walk out the door, I asked him about nap times. He gave me an ugly look and I told him that it’s just for my peace of mind, that I knew he wouldn’t do anything dumb or dangerous like let the baby sleep in his car seat or leave him unattended. He just rolled his eyes and said that he would be letting sleep in the car seat and when I reminded him how dangerous that it and that even our child’s doctor says it’s dangerous to let him sleep in a car seat, he acted like I was making a big deal out of nothing and left. I sent him links to stories about how dangerous letting babies sleep in car seats is and now he’s mad that I can’t just “let it go”. I told him that he’s placing our baby in danger just to show him off to his coworkers and if anything happens it will 100% be his fault.  He’s never done anything like this before, but the blatant disregard of what is best for our child has me floored. It’s completely changed the way I view my SO and my trust in him has plummeted. We only have one car, and I can’t drive anyway, not to mention that his work place just moved to a new building in a new area, so I couldn’t Uber there to get our baby since I don’t have the address. I’m currently about 29 weeks pregnant and admit that I might be overreacting a little bit, but I’m panicking. I don’t think he’d be able to keep a close enough eye on our baby to make sure he’s okay, as he’s still expected to get some of his work done and I don’t know his coworkers at all, so I don’t trust them to keep an eye on our baby like he seems to think they will.

310,"So my mother and I have a pretty great relationship.  It's been strained over the years but we have finally started understanding one another and getting along much better.  She's also mellowed out quite a bit over the past decade, when I was growing up she held onto some really backwards biases.  Like she hated women with tattoos, I think because my dad cheated on her with someone with a tattoo, then tattoos became the enemy.  About 10 years ago she calls me up and asks me to get a tattoo with her.  My parents split 20 years ago so I think its being away from my father that has helped her ""see the light"".  Their divorce was really hard on me but I think they are both much better off.

Anyway, among other changes, my mom had a gastric bypass surgery.  She dropped down to a size 6 (have to admit I was a little jealous lol) and was advised that she should take it easy with drinking because her tolerance was cut in like 1/10.  I don't remember my mom ever being drunk before this time period, she was never a heavy drinker.  Now, she gets wasted off of 2 drinks.  My mom is a loud person when she's not drinking, but once she's had a few, she is very aggressive and likes to start arguments with anyone who is talking to her.  My mom is a very intelligent person, and without the alcohol, she's a great debater (she's also a lawyer, so it comes with the territory).  When she's sober, I quite enjoy the banter.  When she's drunk, it's often incoherent, she's very dismissive, and sometimes cruel.  Even when I'm not in front of her, she started an argument with me last night via text message.  She made a mountain out of a molehill, and I woke up to a wall of text about it.  I didn't even speak to her on the phone and I just know she was drunk based on the way she was speaking to me.

My sisters and I have all shared our concerns and tried talking to her about it multiple times.  She cuts back for awhile and then starts back up when the dust settles.  Her friends have come to me about it.  They have also tried an ""intervention"".  Nothing seems to stick.  I love my mother very much and I know there's a level of unhappiness there.  My father was very cruel to her and I know she misses having a partner.  I live an hour away but I try to spend as much time as I can with her but I know I can't fill the hole in her heart myself.  My mom knows that she can be aggressive when she's drunk and that her family is already concerned about her.  I don't want to drop an ultimatum with her because I know she won't respond to it but I feel like I have to do something about this because I care about her and she's not getting any younger.  I can't imagine that she's doing her body any favors by getting so intoxicated all the time, not to mention the toll it's taking on the relationships in her life.

312,"I am very much the person who wants to be the bigger person and take the high road.At the same time I do try to be strong and stand up for myself when I've been taken advantage of and screwed over.

&amp;#x200B;

Without getting into the nitty gritty of my situation (it is a LONG story) basically I was honest about myself and the guy took advantage of me. I would not have realized the enormity of lies and deception but he decided to pursue a public role and had he not been chosen for the program I would have never learned about the entirety of the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

He did not do anything illegal but at the same time it is extremely immoral. If I stand up for myself publicly I am putting myself out there to be ridiculed. It's scary to put yourself out there and the possibility of people still saying shit. My truth has since been validated by another person who was in a similar position and a director who was involved with managing the program and he was also trying to figure out how to address him because his actions were egregious and not the actions of a genuine person who should not be in that position.

&amp;#x200B;

This story could go viral due to the nature of the role he decided to pursue. He chose to be in a public spotlight (national television) regardless of us coming forth or not. it was because he chose to be on national television and his role was announced that we started discovering the truth about him. He got eliminated from the program due to things just not working out before the director could figure out how best to manage the situation. He was pissed and wanted to make an example out of him and have him called out on national tv. I am not sure how relevant it will be to still call him out since he got cut early on.

&amp;#x200B;

I think what irks me the most is that he probably thinks he did nothing wrong and everyone thinks he is a stand up guy. I tried to reach out to him to see if he would own up to his shit and he blocked me and the other girl and then reached out to the program to see which directors were talking to us. Instead of owning up to his shit or admitting he royally fucked up he is still skirting around things and digging without actually trying to make things right and own up to it.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am very much over him. I had actually moved on and forgot about him. it wasn't until his name was announced did I later find out the WHOLE truth which lead me to to where I am now. I am not upset about him but rather the complete violation of trust and lack of respect that he thought it would be ok to go to the extreme lengths to fuck with someone for fun and games and then think it is all ok and possibly receive admiration for being a part of that program

&amp;#x200B;

I am not super religious but I do believe things work themselves out and if not God, then Karma will get him. However I do want to be strong and stand up for myself and make it clear that I will not just sit back and let him think what he did was ok. It's behavior like his and mentality like mine (afraid to speak up and call out) that allow disgusting behavior to continue because they never receive any consequences for their actions.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what happened to me is no where near close to any assault victims. But on a much smaller scale I do feel similar in that I am afraid to call him out for fear of being ridiculed but at the same time the reason I am so unresolved about all of this is that his behavior was predatory and I feel so violated that he purposely sought me out and assured me he was worth trusting and giving a chance only to do all the fucked up things he did with zero remorse.

313,"I have this coworker at my new job that lives in the same building as me. We've become friends from working together and many times I have given him a ride to/from work or to our various job sites that we work at.  I have never asked him for gas money as that's just not the way that I operate. However, I needed help with installing a TV mount the other day and he is very handy and does contract work on the side so I asked him for help.  He told me that he would have to charge me $50.  When I asked why he was charging me since I give him rides all the time, he responded 'This is a side job that I have and I can't just hook people up for free or else all my friends would ask me for stuff. Plus I never ask you for rides you just give them to me'.  This really rubbed me the wrong way as I am not the kind of person to keep a ledger or to ask friends of mine for money for what I consider just the normal give and take of friendships.  I told him that if that's the way he feels about it that I would pay him, and I did.  However, now I feel like I should ask him for gas money if he wants rides.  The problem is that I would feel extremely petty doing that.  So I'm not sure what to do now- if I should just take the 'high road' and continue to offer of my car freely or if I should ask for money.

I'm what you would call a shut in. I tend to live more of my life inside around the computer or TV. Over the past 10 years I have been very introverted, but I didn't used to be this way. In fact in highschool I was very out going. But as time went on and friends moved away (and eventually I moved away from my friends) getting out just seemed harder and harder to do. 

I'm at a point in my life where I want more. The problem is I don't know how to go about getting out and doing things that will get me there. I see a lot of my friends post up about their nights out and hanging out with new friends they met and I want a slice of the same kind of life. The problem is I'm not really a bar scene kind of guy. I wanna do something new that doesn't involve getting drunk and approaching random strangers at bars.

322,"I need somebody who might give a flying foxes ear. Long story so bear with me...

I came from a very abused and neglected home as a child. My mother years ago during my childhood admitted that she lied to my father about taking birth control just so she could get pregnant with me. This was because she married my father for money (specifically my grandpa's hard earned money aka my father's dad) and not love. She already had her ""perfect"" two children (my half brother and sister), all she needed was to replace their deadbeat alcoholic dad for a ""stable"" situation. (Fun fact my dad has no addictions other than sex and money. He has herpes for christ sake) After they got married and she started thinking long-term my mom came to the realization that she had made a terrible decision by letting this man enter her and her kid's lives. my dad was more than willing to ride in and ""rescue"" everyone. She told me she lied to my dad about taking birth control so that she could get pregnant with me. I asked my father and he confirmed to his shock and dismay that I would ever know. My mom told me before they ever seperated he would beat my (she did nothing to protect them from this and she admitted that months ago) brother. He would attest to that and so would my sister. My mom admitted to watching my dad pace anxiously outside the bathroom while my sister was in it because he was certain ""she is masturbating!"" Like it was a problem or something worth mentioning. He isn't religulious at all even though his third wife is catholic. A lot of creepy worrisome shit insuded until my grandparents made the mistake of buying my dad a brand spanking new personal camcorder. Top Notch stock for circa 93 to 95 in Washington State. He got caught candidly recording my sister with it by hiding the camcorder in the laundry basket under her bed while she was in the shower, aiming it at a mirror. He was initially charged with production and possesion of child pornography. He kept his vindictive lies going by convincing my grandparents he was an innocent victim of his upbringing, his poor parenting rolemodels ( my grandfather was always away because he was in the Air Force, my grandma was the alcoholic pianist that was constantly neglecting her children to drink, cheat on grandpa, and hit her kids). Anyways I was like 4? months old at that point. They hired a better lawyer and got it appealed in order to support their little boy that they let down so long ago. Multiple custody battles regarding basically the financial obligation of me, several bouts of rat killer coursing through my sytem in 1st grade? according to my mother, (she was the one to specify her seeing arsenic posioning in my dad's computer's search engine. She said 'he pawned' the computer after supposedly threatening to kill him if he didn't stop trying to kill me. Obviously bs because I'm a mother now and I know I would turn Rogue and have to be commited if anyone intentionally hurt my child. I remember laying on the couch at my mom's meth lab boyfriends house accepting death because of how much vomiting of corrosive excretions, not being able to keep anything but milk and bread down for five minutes in that 3 week time, and neuro toxcicity that made my legs stop working on the third week, and one screening for sexual assault at 4 years old and my mom in retrospect gave my dad the free and clear to do as he wished with me every other weekend for as long as that child support rolls in. As long as I didn't say anything... 


I have had a terrible memory, manic depression, and suicidal thoughts since about 5. I was screaming at the sky why can't I die while i was in my perpetually alone state, when there wasn't rain. My sister curiously watched from her and her husband's bedroom window occasionally as I did this. We all lived together at this point including good ol ma. I remember feeling embarrassed when i noticed her. remember sitting on my aunt's couch and realizing I couldn't remember the entirety of the week prior. I always felt in a lucid dreaming state and couldn't focus on much of anything most of my life. I still struggle with this today but I forgive myself more for it because I finally accept it's not because I'm a helpless daydreaming hippie, it was that I accepted the biased pure evil judgment of me from those I love and trusted. I was a victim of rape and molestation by my father, he would drug me and feed me terribly executed lies to try to convince me he was a good person, while my mom did all the potentially leathal poisoning and wanted to pin my dad for more money and vindication, didn't realize it until after I prayed for the truth to be revealed to me when my grandpa passed, and I only thought to do that because he wascthe only person to ever show me unconditional love, and if there is an afterlife he would definately be able to see it for what it was and maybe just maybe clear up all the contradictions and confusion between what my eyes, ears, and spirit percieved. I know now all the""respect"" towards my father was pure fear, the admittedly angry and indifferent feelings towards my mom as I grew older was because she obviously didn't care to want to be my mom and chose to make me and raise me in a Sodom and Gomorrah dystopia. My nightmares of being cut into a million pieces while my father hovers over me telling my grandparents I was dreaming and to let her rest, him raping me in my own room in my own bed, waking up sobbing in that bed, waking up with my clothes off always my underwear gone, usually my shirt rolled up to my shoulders. 

At 14, after telling my mom I think I'm pregnant, she repiled ""no you're not the virgin mary."" My dad had a doctor tell me it was pcos. My mom doubled down too. Never had resources I trusted to get a pregnancy test and my mom refused. My dad promptly whisked me off to las vegas where several hours after landing and getting settled in the stratosphere i start feeling nauseous, puked a few times. my ""period"" shows up for the first time after being missing for months. Then it turned into a three day hemorrhage that I can only compare to my confirmed miscarriage I had at 21. But my miscarriage at 21 after the big hemmorage led to a light flow period that lasted 5 months straight even though ultrasound couldn't indicate a need for a d&amp;c. My dad creepily doted on me like a concerned bf during what my heart now accepts as chemical abortion he slipped me to cover himself. My dad had said I looked sick on the shuttle to our hotel before I felt anything worse than usual. He must have got me pregnant, then when they both realized this they decided. I need justice now that they are trying to take my daughter from me, and i feel that nobody cares because why would I be so close to these wretched fucks and why didn't I say anything sooner? My only answer is I finally woke up. I need help getting all my medical documents from all over washington since 1996, I spoke to a forensic pathologist specializing in arsenic poisoning a couple years back before I realized who did what and how bad was it. He told me to get this to be considered for investigation. I need Advocates on my side, maybe some wise words, justice, and peace of mind so I might be the best mom and overall person I can be with the ubringing I was given. I love my daughter, she is my purpose. My parents are trying to either use, take, gaslight, or groom my baby girl. They say it's to protect her from me and that I need help. I have been in close contact with cps since my mom called them on me. They only offered counseling at this time. I set up an appointment with my doctor to reevaluate the abilify prescription. I'm tired of being told I'm crazy as if it's bad. I earned that right damn it and I wouldn't be here to write a mini autobiography if I wasn't finally aware of my life for what it has been up until this point. Please somebody? Please don't ban me I'm helplessly lost and could really use some words that aren't from a bot only.

333,"Mobile, so sorry for formatting issues. 

Sorry my for the length on this one. 

For reference I am a 17 year old guy. My parents divorced when I was young. We lived in Waco, but after the divorce my dad moved to Dallas a couple hours away and I stayed with my mom. 

Taking care of me  and my older brother was obviously difficult for my lone mom. Especially since this was right after 9/11 so racism towards us (we are Muslims) exploded (ha ha). My mom worked many jobs with little pay and suffered a lot of discrimination. Because of this she was always hot headed and raised us in a strict fashion. 
When my dad visited he would always bring us toys and buy us fast food and be really nice to us. Of course he didn’t visit often. So in contrast to my mom, he was a lot more calm and had a sense of humor. I was young then so of course I hated my mom for yelling at me and preferred my dad for all his toys. I'm mature enough now to realize that my mom was doing all the parenting while my dad was kind of a deadbeat.

Eventually I got old enough that it wasn’t as difficult to take care of me anymore, so he started taking me t Dallas to stay with him for a weekend here and there. I even stayed an entire summer one time. This was when I was in middle school so I was probably 11 or 12 at the time. All I really did was play games and watch anime on my iPad all day when these visits would happen. He would go to work and then we’d eat out and then he’d go party and i would go back to sitting around in my iPad.

My dad was always very physically affectionate with me. He would always kiss my cheeks and stuff, but at that age it’s annoying but you kind of just deal with it. I also thought that’s just how my parents culture was. Since I was born and raised in America I really didn’t know much about our home country, though I do speak the language. His living arrangement for a while was as a roommate to one of his friends from college. That man went through a divorce and his kids all grew up so he had three bedrooms. Now you would expect that the three of us (my dad, myself, and my dads roommate) would sleep in different rooms, but my dad made me sleep in the same bed as him. I slept by my mom when I was younger but at this point I already had my own room and was accustomed to sleeping alone. I didn’t want to make him mad and take me back to my mom who yelled a lot, and I kind of just wrote off the over affection as being part of his culture so I just went with it. 

One of these visits takes a turn for the worst. All I remember is that I was sleeping in the same bed as him and I played games and watched videos on my iPad until I feel asleep. He was watching some foreign drama. When I woke up in the morning my shirt was pulled up a little bit and his hand was in my pants, touching my private parts.

When I looked at him he raised his hand and stated rubbing my stomach. I just assumed at the time that it was an accident and that he was just running my stomach out of fatherly love and accidentally went too low. Despite this, I still declined to visit him for a while. I think I was subconsciously trying to rationalize what had happened, and I didn't tell anyone. I didn't have a good relationship with my mom yet so I wouldn't feel comfortable doing so, and I was way too shy for the police.

When I was in ninth grade he remarried to a woman with two kids, one of them was the same age as me. So he invited me over (we had seen each other in between) to basically have a play date). We became friends so I started visiting more often. My dad seemed to be a responsible father. He was working at AT&amp;amp;amp;T, providing for the family. All of the things he doesn't do for me. Most importantly grew didn't seem to be showing signs of perversion near us, including the then 11-12 year old younger brother. 

Because of this I thought back to that incident. I guess he really did touch my penis on accident. I basically cleared him off all guilt in my mind.

Fast forward a while to now. A month ago I was diagnosed with cancer. Stage three Hodgkins Lymphoma to be specific. The prognosis is good and the treatment has a 99% success rate so I'm not worried smoky dying or anything. I have six months of chemo and am done with the first one.

A couple weeks after my first chemo, I develop a lot of mouth ulcers mixed with a fungal infection. The pain is incredible (9/10) and im unable to eat or drink cold drinks so im hospitalized in Dallas. My mother stays with me everyday and sleeps on the couch and my step father drives two hours here to visit me and two hours back everyday after work. At around 7 pm my stepdad gets here and at around 8 my dad gets here. At this point my dad usually stays with me while my mom and stepdad buy me dinner. It takes them anywhere between 1-2 hours to do this and they usually arrive at about 9, sometimes letter

Now for the first few days this isn't a problem. Because of the effects of the cancer my skin is really dry end itchy. The fact that I've been laying around the whole time (I'm getting 1.5 mg of morphine every hour, along with an extra 2 every 20 minutes if I choose to hit a button, though I only push it in emergency situations like if I'm in agonizing pain. The morphine still makes me really drowsy so I sleep a lot)  also makes my legs kind of weak. So my moms been rubbing oil on my back and legs and arms and has been massaging them too. My dad sees this and the nest day asks if I want him to put oil on me. I see nothing wrong with it and say ""yeah, sure."" Then he does the same with the massage.

Then one day he tried to do it without my permission. Im covered in blankets from my toes to my upper chest and laying in my hospital bed. I'm really cold so I use like three blankets. Anyways, just laying back and playing games or whatever and he asks me if I want to put oil on my legs and I say no. He comes to the right foot side of my bed (at this point it's just me and my dad). He starts touching my feet through my 3 sets of blankets and I'm a little uncomfortable. He starts lifting the blankets and I say no a little bit louder, and he says ok and goes and washes the oil off of his hands. Then he comes back and starts lifting the massage and I say ""I don't want the oil"" and he says ""this isn't oil this is a massage."" 

I get mad at this point because he's saying all this and not even looking at me while saying it, he's just looking at my feet. Im usually pretty docile and quiet but when I get angry I can raise my voice just fine. I use a voice that's loud enough to startle him but not loud enough to make the nurses check in on us and cause a serious incident. I yell ""NO, DON'T TOUCH ME,"" causing him to let go of my blankets and look at me with wide eyes like I'm the bad guy. Then he says ""okay,"" and shots back down on the chair on the other side of the room.

I choose not to tell my parents about this because they do it too, though they ask me first, and would probably just call it a misunderstanding.

Another day we're in a similar situation, just me and him in the room while my mom and step dad get dinner. At some point I wanted to send a picture to my friend to show them that I had shaved my head. I start using my iPhone 8 selfie camera and the photo isn't coming out the way I wanted it to. I remember that my dad had the new iPhone X which had for front facing portrait camera. So I ask to use and take my selfie. I go to the photos app and I send the picture to my phone.

While I'm in the photos app he goes to the bathroom and I use that as an excuse to snoop through his pictures. I find pictures of me asleep in my hospital bed. Now I'm thinking that he probably thought they were endearing and posted them on Facebook but I still think it's creepy. So I confront him about it by asking why he takes pictures of me while asleep. He couldn't seem to find the problem with it. I raise Mt voice and say something along the lines of ""Just don't fucking do it,"" and he says ""okay.""

Later, I'm covered head to toe in blanket just because I'm most comfortable in that position, and I hear the sound of a camera shutter followed by the sound of a phone hitting the ground. I throw the blankets of my head and chest and ask him with anger, ""What the fuck are you taking pictures for huh?"" He says it's a screenshot and that I was covered up so there's nothing he would've taken a picture of anyways. So I get all comfy and covered up again. Then he makes this condescending, dickish remark like ""What, are you afraid of pictures now or something."" I don't know  if it was the morphine making me emotional or if I was just really insulted but I shed a few tears.

I have been thinking about telling my mother and step father about these things since I don't really want to see my father ever again, but things attempt quite that simple. We don't have insurance. There is no way we can afford to pay for all of this treatment on our own. Since I'm basically living in Dallas now, my dad was able to file something under a ""major life change it to be able to get me in his insurance plan by April. The quotes in that phrase don't signal skepticism btw, I just don't know the exact phrasing. My parents were discussing it with him and they looked content during the discussion. If I tell my parents or the police, my dad would probably take it away.

Besides that, the cancer and chemo had taken a physical toll on me, but they are also affected by it. My mom is a forensic and had a stroke the week before I was diagnosed, not to mention that she tends to me all day everyday. This situation has been very stressful for her and I don't want to add anymore. My stepfather drives for four hours a day every to see me and bring me things and I know that can't be easy.

I'm just planning on waiting the 6 months of my chemo so that my cancer is cured and maybe a little more so that my parents' stress is relieved. 

The only problem with that is that I turn 18 in June and i don't know if that changes things legally.

**TL;DR**

I'm like 70% sure my dad is a pedophile and don't know if I should report him because my parents are stressed out due to my cancer and we need my dads insurance to be able to pay for the expensive cancer treatment.

Fine with me, I think this is important and glad the welfare of children is being looked into. 

Well, she was assigned to come every Friday for a 2 hour session. Again, great, it’s not a big deal.

343,"okay this is probably a little nsfw but here goes
basically my roomate and i have been friends all year and she’s probably my closest friend. however there’s something that’s going on that i can’t let slide. i have a bad habit of avoid confrontation until i get so resentful and angry that i snap. i can feel it building now and this is what happened 

basically we were all drunk a couple weeks ago and we both had our boyfriends over, and one extra friend. the extra friend went to sleep early in the spare room, so it was us two couples in one room so we couldn’t mess around.  then someone suggested we could just kill the lights and have sex anyways. so 5 mins into that and we realize they’re not having sex and they left the room to go to the bathroom together. so we continue 

the thing is now my roomate is publicly throwing it at me (in a kind of fake joking manner) and all of our common friends are shaming me for it. 

but what she doesn’t know is that when i was sleeping, a few days after said event, i heard her having sex with her boyfriend.  i was alone in bed kind and they woke me up. i didn’t stop them or say anything because i was so tired i felt frozen and wasn’t even sure if it was real.  but they went at it for wayy too much time. i never said anything to her.  

now i don’t know what is logical and what is me overreacting. i tend to care a little too much what people think and the fact that all our friends are saying it was a filthy thing for me to do i keep getting angry because i want to tell them what she did. i don’t only want to tell her i want to tell her publicly in front of the same people so they can see what a hypocrite she’s being. 

i also don’t want to act out of anger and ruin our relationship. i just don’t know if this is a moment for me to take the high road or be a messy bitch and say exactly what i feel
she was making fun of me and i don’t know how much of it i’m taking seriously , but she was so loud and i could hear everything from moans to slapping and she didn’t even know me and my boyfriend had actually had started because we were quiet.  

i just idk , i need to see this from an objective point of view

346,"For the past six years I’ve had feelings for my best friend. We only recently started talking again after a year of complete silence. His girlfriend, who he started dating shortly after we met, was jealous of our friendship and I can’t say I blame her. 

He and I were really close and would platonically say I love you. His mom and I got along really well too, which bothered his gf. 

So I was grateful that she made him stop talking to me because it gave me an excuse to try and move on. It didn’t work though and I still found myself looking at his insta, etc. I was also hurt though that it was so easy for him to just stop talking to me. 

A year went by and his birthday rolled around. I had a sinking feeling he and his girlfriend broke up and I was right. They were in a long distance relationship and she ended up cheating on him. So I reached out to wish him a happy birthday and be a good friend. 

He never apologized for not reaching out, but said he missed me. I was disappointed he didn’t try and explain why he never thought of texting me but I was just happy to have him in my life again. 

We started hanging out again and I really tried to keep my expectations low. I mean, he was heartbroken and he didn’t want to talk about it. Instead he would sleep with any girl he could. I can’t blame him when he was in a relationship for five years and basically thought he was going to marry her. 

Then one night we went out and got way too drunk. He kissed me. And for a second I thought I had a chance. 

After that he didn’t talk to me for three weeks. He said it was because of family matters and I dumbly forgave him on the condition that he put more effort into our friendship or at least replied when I was checking on him... he was drinking a lot at the time. 

Last night we went out with friends and the whole time he was trying to flirt and dance with this one girl. I’m not going to lie it broke my heart, but when he asked if I was mad I said no and made some excuse. 

Now I’m at the point where I don’t know what to do anymore. It hurts too much to be around him. His friendship is important to me and I’d rather not ruin it. My family is convinced he knows how I feel and simply doesn’t care. And I guess I agree but I can’t fault him for not feeling the same way. 

Here’s the kicker though. Even if there was a chance he had feelings for me, I wouldn’t want to date him. I’m at a really good place in my life and career and I feel like he has a lot of growing up to do. 

So where do I go from here? Ignoring him doesn’t work. Do I tell him how I feel and say I need space? Or do I just suck it up and accept that this is the way things are?

It was about a 15 second orgasm of cum just coming out. I laughed uncontrollably for 5 min out of pleasure. When I tried standing up, I fell to the ground because I couldn’t feel both of my legs.

349,"Long story short guys I've had a 2000 Ford Mustang for about 3 years now it was my first car. It's a really good car I've never had any mechanical problems with it the only issue is that it's not the prettiest car the paint is really worn out. I was thinking about getting it painted but instead I decided I wanted a newer model so around Christmas time I started looking for a new. I was looking for a 2013 or 2014 v6 Mustang my budget was $13,000, but I wanted to finance the car to build some credit so my down payment budget was going to be $5,000.

After looking around for a few days I found some really good deals at some car dealerships the cars were pre-owned obviously. So once I found the car that I liked I decided I was going to buy it, but then my dad told me that I should look outside of car dealerships because if I purchased a car from a dealership I would be in debt and he basically scared me and told me if I lost my job I would be in a lot of financial problems(I know he was looking out for me) and so I decided to look outside of car dealerships to see if I could find a car for a reasonable price and I did I found a 2005 Mustang for $5,000 with 90k miles and I liked it I tested the car and checked everything and I bought it. My dad told me before I purchase it that I should still look around but honestly guys I just a new wanted a car and I went ahead and purchased it and everything well it was a BIG MISTAKE.

The day I was at the DMV doing the title transfer the owner told me that the car did have one problem he said the back wheels had a noise I did notice it and he told me it was most likely the differential and said that it was really cheap to get it replaced again my dad told me to walk away and keep looking I didn't listen I told the guy it was fine again Big Mistake once all the paperwork was done I drove the car home and I was really excited but I started having problems with the car right away for one the headlights were super fucking bright. I got pulled over because apparently they were too bright. The differential keeps making some really loud noises when I'm driving and after a couple of days I noticed that the speedometer is off by like 7 to 10 miles when I drive next to a car that is going 70 my car says I'm going 80 and then the windshield wipers just literally turn themselves on and just so many problems that I'm sure I'm probably going to spend a few hundred dollars to get it fixed but anyways I've been thinking about just going back to my original plan and buy a 2013-14 Mustang and use the car I bought as a down payment what do you guys think ? I've never purchased a car from a dealership so I really don't have any knowledge of how the process is going to be. Is buying a pre-owned car from a dealership a good idea ? Will I regret it ? Will it be a risk to purchase a used car from a dealership? Should I just sell it and go back to my old car ?

 I've also been using my old car for the last couple of days because the other car shut down on the middle of road when I was at a stop light. ",30Mar2019,1

This week, my lady invited a co-worker over for drinks and she  tells me as she comes home from work that he'll be here in 15 minutes. Not much of a  notice, I didn't feel like drinking, I was with our kids all day I was tired and wanted to sleep. However, I felt forced to stay awake because I wasn't comfortable going to bed while my lady drinks with another dude by herself, in her booty shorts. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I stay awake till 3am with them, until she takes him home and I go and pass out. This dude ""Charlie"" I don't see him often, but I hear about him all the time she drops him off at his house most work nights since they work overnight together so this hangout although I didn't like, she's explained he is very much just a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later a new dude comes over, ""Rick"", and it's same time 11 PM and again no notice until about 10 minutes. I dealt with our kids all day and had a headache so I deff was not staying awake for this one but from the moment she said a friend was coming over I immediate got an attitude. They stayed up smoking and drinking until 1 or 2am I'm not really sure. I even violated her privacy the next day and snooped through her text messages with him and honestly they seem pretty mutual nothing alarming.

&amp;#x200B;

I just been acting hella extra because I don't know how to feel about this. I don't mind her bringing people over to drink, but that late at night, I'm ready for bed. At the same time, I'm the one who was unfaithful not her. She never cheated, so I don't have any  reason to be questioning her loyalty but I can't help how I feel.

They've lived together for around two years and have been fine. I introduced a four year old Husky and Retriever mix. Her name is Grace. (F) They lived with Grace for about seven months and we're fine, completely fine. Everyone got along. Then, it started happening.

Zeus would start trying to kill Apollo, literally kill him. Apollo would of course attack back, and it got so bad to the point where Apollo gashed opened Zeus' face.

I also switched school at the beginning of this year to a school pretty far away. Switching has made me really love and appriciate exactly where I live.

Jobs that I do not like as much (engineering, anything tech related) have the opportunity to make much more. Also, these jobs aren't necessarily something that I would hate with all my heart, however I would basically be in that career more for the money then for the career itself.

The next morning, he bought three packs of those cookies. My mom gave me one of those, which I haven’t eaten. She gave my sister one and the other to my brother.

Fast forward to last night. While I was at work all day, my mom decides to clean the living room. She ends up putting my pack of cookies back on the other side of the table. My mom was like “oh your sister gave you her cookies”and went upstairs. I was confused and casually said “oh but those are my cookies”. My sister goes upstairs and pretty much cries to my mom about those being her cookies in the first place. They both come back downstairs and start getting all up in my face and yelling at me. I’m trying to explain my side of the story and they keep interrupting me. At one point my mom says “I oughtta crush those cookies so nobody can eat them”, they’re both really damn annoying at this point so I grab the cookies, crush them with my fist and throw them across the room to the floor. They both proceed to finally shut up and then my mom starts yelling at me and bringing up shit from the past that is irrelevant. She keeps yelling at me to pick up the cookies while my sister is yelling at me.  I am so annoyed that among a sea of F bombs, I tell her that she’s extremely annoying, unfair, clearly has a favorite, and that I want her to leave me alone for an hour for once in my life. I also told my sister to shut up because she is yelling too. Everyone’s giving me the silent treatment today and I don’t care because I don’t want to talk to them. I move out in about a little less than two months and I honestly don’t plan on apologizing any time soon. What should I do in the mean time? They’re so fucking rude and they always pick on me for no good reason. ",30Mar2019,1

375,"Throwaway because of obligatory reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I'm 14F. Growing up, I never had a well developed relationship with my parents due to lack of communication and trust, therefore I often felt like I never fit in anywhere. I have an older brother whose in his mid 20's. When he was in high school, he messed up a lot so my parents and him fought a lot. I was in elementary so everything is really faded away but I can definitely remember the nights of them arguing. My mother has friends who are EXTREMELY religious as in their children aren't allowed to have romantic feelings for another person till the age of 16, no drinking/smoking/partying, **NOT allowed to watch Disney Chanel, CANNOT watch shows that involve the LGBT community, and the list goes on.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course there are good things of being a really strict parent but I feel like not allowing your children to watch Disney Chanel or see shows that display the LGBT community is a little extreme. Again, this is my **OPINION** and however they raise their children is none of my concern but my point is, I just never felt like I could fit in/be friends with them because I felt disconnected from them. The way I was raised is really different from them, therefore I just don't click with them. Every time my parents and I fought, they ALWAYS brought up their friends kids into the argument stating how they're doing well in school, how they don't get into ""trouble"" like me and etc.. I do agree with them but I just always felt compared to them which is also why I have low self esteem. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a freshman in high school and obviously I'm not supposed to even know my major or decide the college I want to attend ASAP because it's not my time. Yes, it's good to have an idea BUT NO IT IS NOT MY TIME TO DECIDE AND STICK WITH IT BECAUSE I WILL CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS. I CAN'T EVEN DO COLLEGE APPLICATIONS. Point is, my father would bring up how his friends kids go to Ivy League universities and their SAT score. I'm a freshman, I can't even take SAT yet or complete college applications. I always felt like he was comparing me to them and it just made me feel like I wasn't good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents care more about the lives of others, give my brother and I ""advice"" yet they don't follow it themselves, talk about being patient, but when they're driving and someone doesn't have the back of their lights on, my mother would complain and get annoyed. She constantly would complain how my brother and I are ""annoying"" but then if you knew you had this responsibility of caring for us, why'd you have kids if you knew you weren't going to like doing it? 

&amp;#x200B;

Something happened and I reported it to the local police with my mother and I just told my father what happened and he was light on me because my mother told him to be light on me. **In the end, yes, I told my mother how I felt and she still doesn't really understand. She says she does but when I try to talk about my feelings, she just kinda pushes it away. I just feel like a really big mistake honestly. I've thought about suicide but I've never actually done it because I've been scared of it.**

My brother and my dad custom built a 2000 dollar computer maybe 5 years ago, and I got it when my brother went off to college almost 2 years ago.

I was sitting at my desk with a cup of water and accidently spilled it into the computer vent since the computer was on the floor. My dad took a look at it (Hes really good with computers) and said I most definitely killed it and he'd have to take it in to a shop.

The thing is that my dad expresses himself a lot when he's angry. I dont mean to make him sound like a bad guy, he's not, but he's definitely not the kind of person to take it easy on someone when he's mad at them. So the problem that I face is when he told me that I killed it, he said that he was incredibly mad at me but he kept his composure, which is very unlike him. I'm thinking that he's having one of those moments where your so mad that it's taking time to process so you so calm, y'know? 

So he went down and turned on the TV and now I'm in my room writing this. I'm ready to take any punishment he's gonna give because I deserve it, but I'm just wondering if there's any advice I can get to keep this whole situation more controlled and calm.

(By the way I already told my brother and he doesn't really care despite it being his because he was getting a new computer for his birthday soon)

TL;DR- Spilled water on 2000 dollar computer, killed it, and now my dad is going to kill me.",30Mar2019,1
383,"I live with my mother and 12 year old (half sister). At the age of 3 1/2 my sister was sexually abused, leading to naturally having many problems. Because of such abuse, my mother, her father and our grandparents have given her everything she wants, to the point of excess. 

Sister is now 12, refused to go to school (for over a year), have been appointed a counsellor, education psychologist and support workers. All in all they haven’t made a blind bit of difference.

Sister runs the household, out mother will jump to any command. At the moment she has 20+ rabbits and numerous other exotic pets. If she doesn’t get her own way then she will tantrum and turn to violence against our mother. 

My mother has her own issues, has never had control over her own life and now has no control over my sister.  My sister refuses to visit her father and he has very little input. 

Today she told our grandmother to ‘shut the fuck up’ and talked to my mother like shit. My mother ‘grounded’ her which led to my sister hitting my mother. The father has now took her away from the situation for a few hours, but I’m afraid that one day my mother will hit her back.

I know we all have stuff planned when I come back, but how do I mentally comfort myself with this FOMO? I know it sounds dumb but I’ve only just started to have friends and I feel like I’ll lose it.

I envy my best friend because she has a boyfriend, actually has the balls to ask out her crush, and goes out and has fun! Not me! I couldn't even ask my crush because I'm socially awkward. 

My mom has tried to bribe me with new backpacks and stuff, just to join a club and has repeatedly told me that she's going to involve me into the community. Such as Special needs Olympics, art classes...just to make friends, but she's never actually gone through with doing it. 

She just doesn't understand what goes on in a person's mind who has social anxiety. 

No one at school really talks to me unless it's a compliment about my nails or hair. No guys or girls come up to me and talk...maybe it's because I'm quiet and I don't smile and am always face deep in my phone. 

No one really asks me if I'm okay unless I post something sad or depressing my Instagram or Snapchat stories. 

People don't know how much pain I'm in because I don't let that part of myself peek out into the light. Now..I don't want to kill myself even though I do think about different ways to. 

Sometimes I become blinded with an anger and think that my friends know that I'm alone and sad, but don't bother acknowledging it. I know it's not true, but no one wants to deal with someone who is depressed because they don't know how to help them. Especially when the person who is depressed constantly refuses to accept the help.

A week before Christmas I was asked to take over as interim head coach for the team I work with. The board of directors said that in the future the title 'interim' might be dropped. The only reason they hesitated to make me the head coach officially was because we have had a lot of head coach turn over recently, and I'm in college.

Still in love for sure and sometimes still get butterflies when I can forget the rest of our shit. We have Supported each other through serious illness, financial difficulties,  family dramas, school, a miscarriage, kids, careers, etc. It should be an amazing time in our life but I feel like I'm living a double life - what our friends/family see and what's actually happening.

During that time,  he has had a hard time letting go or moving past these short comings : 1) as teens I held his friends hand at a mutual friends funeral and according to the friend ""shared a blanket and flirted"" . 2) During one of our breakups in college, I attend a frat party and kissed a random frat boy. 3) and now waiting years to tell him about how our friend assaulted me on a camping trip. 

These ""betrayals"" affect our relationship almost daily.  When he is just present and happy, I question it because I feel like it's fake. Since telling him about my assault, I've had an anxiety diagnosis and a baby. 

He is perpetually unhappy with our sex life- ""not passionate enough, too in frequent, not enough foreplay, he felt weird"". It is a truth , that our sex life has changed over the years. I feel like, sex 2-3 a week with kids and adult lives is pretty good and I don't expect either times to be anything. He says he NEEDS more than that, that we are ""incomparable"" and is asking for sexual acts that I've never enjoyed....and it's become a problem for him because ""he likes them....cant I do it for him?"". 

With my assault, I told him in the middle of a fight (which was horrible of me) , but his reaction through my eyes was more about me betraying him in not telling him. He feels this betrayal is so gross that ""we should not have gotten married "". He is angry with me that the person who assaulted me was at his bachelor party etc.

Two christmases ago, it looked like we were heading towards a separation, and then things got better, we got pregnant....and now here I am wondering how many more years should I/will continue to explain those 3 events. Am i unreasonable reddit to think that these events are not horrific? Was it cruel of me not to tell him about my assault? Am I actually loosing my mind?????

Reddit,  what should a girl like me do with all of these thing? I'm nervous even to post here for a fear that he may see it and this would be yet another thing for ""the list"". I'm fearful to tell friends and family.  I dont know what to do anymore honestly.  Please give me your unaltered advice. From the eyes of reddit what is happening that I'm not seeing or understanding?

398,"I'm 30 and she is 25

To begin, our break up had started nearly a month ago.  And it was one trip hell downfall for me.

It started on one night and she said: "" I know that you love me a lot, more than any boyfriends (only 2 actually) I have ever dated. But I do not love you that much so I want us to break up"".

Everything just so sudden, I cannot believe what I heard. I know we often get in a fight and every time she always mentioned about the breakup but in the end, it will work out somehow. At that time, I thought that maybe she thinks that I am not too serious about our relationship. So the next day, I bought a proposed ring. I proposed to her, she turns me down. I accepted the truth. Before I went home, I left the proposed ring for her

Next few days, the lonely nearly drive me insane. I went to look for her. When I found her, she was testing with someone. It's her colleague.  I hate this guy since the beginning because he always flirts with my girlfriend but acted like he just wants to become a friend with her. I told her many times that I do not like him. They planned to have a date that night. So we got in the fight. This time my ex-girlfriend block all the contact with me.

Few more days later, we accidentally met on the street. We told a lot of things, maybe it was just a moment of emotion that she invited me on a trip with her. Of course, I accepted.

That day was one of the happiest day of my life. Everything just so perfect. She even unblocked me so I can contact her. Until she confessed to me that she actually has dated that jerk for nearly 2 months. Now they have broken up because that guy said that he loved her but never actually spend time for her. But she also said that she will not come back with me. The truth was like thunderbolt rumble in my ear. Thinking back, that is when I started to lose myself to blind jealousy.

I tried to tell myself that I want my girlfriend back. But everything I have done just pushes her far away from me. I looked through her phone without her permission.  Found out that they did secretly date for 2 months. To make thing worse, they started on the date that she told me: "" I did not want you to get tired by picking me up to the company every day. So I will start to go to the company on my own. And from now on, I did not like you look at my phone anymore"". She often let me do that in the past. I did not like all these sudden changes but I still listen to her.

After the day I found out the truth. I always forced her to do what I want. Try to pick up her to the company. Ask for lunch even she thought she has already declined. I would stay in front of her's rent house for hours. Because I know even though she has rejected that guy, he sometimes still pick her up in the morning, go for lunch, chat and call each other every night. Some free times they will  hang out with each other and some of my ex-girlfriend's friend

My girlfriend told me that I have become paranoid, and I freaked her out. Maybe she was right

She started to block me again, delete all my contact on her phone.

It's was very hot that day in my country, I borrow my friend phone to call her that I want to talk and I will pick her up at her company because I knew she was picked up by that guy. She declined. But I still went there. When I arrived I saw that guy passed through me on his bike. I wait there for nearly one hour but she has not yet come out. So I asked some her colleague and they said she has already gone home. I was completely lost my mind, I rushed at full speed to her's rent house, on the way to her room, I saw some unread message. It was that guy sent her message laugh at me because I was tricked by them. She went out before I arrived and will wait for that guy at another building. Like fuel to the fire, I woke her up and asked her: How could you do this to me?

She laughed at me and blame me for too stubborn for not listen.

""We have already broken up so I can go with whoever I want, date whoever I want and do whatever I want. It was you keep stuck in the past. And you did this to yourself""

I know she was right, I knew it. But at that moment the anger has consumed me, I slapped her.

""The man who loves me most. Hit me. You are a monster.""

I apologized but she does not want to listen anymore. She pushed me out of the house

And he goes to some random “dinners” or “open houses” almost every month. Doesn’t exactly tell me what they’re about, just that they’re with business people. He’s told me he wants to get into business, even though he didn’t go to school for it. And anytime I suggest going back to school for it, he says there’s a better way.

410,"So just for some background. I work for a small business with two owners. They are generally laid back, and approve time off requests as long as they are requested with ample time beforehand, and as long as all of our hours can be covered by other employees. I’m a relatively new employee, and they took a chance on hiring me as I was one of the more under qualified candidates for the position (which I really appreciate). Naturally, I pick up a lot of the less desirable shifts - for example I’ve worked 7 days a week since August - which I’m completely fine with since I enjoy my job. 

Anyway, I requested time off for the 31st (tomorrow) to the third just to go home for a bit (I work in a  different city than where My family and friends live). I requested this time off a month prior. I was able to get other employees on board within a week, and I just needed a few more hours covered by one of my bosses. I asked him, he said he’d look into it.  A week goes by. I ask again. He says he’ll look into it. It happens a few more times and it gets to the point where I’m around 10 days out from my requested time off. At this point I’ve been tracking the flight costs, and they keep climbing. So one night I mention it to him that the flights keep getting more expensive. He says “it’s ok, daddy can afford it” (he knows my dad helps out with some payments on my car and on my rent - either way, I pay for flights by myself) I laughed it off at the time. Anyway a few days later he texts me that he can cover my hours, and that in fact he was willing and able to the first time I asked but wanted to “see me sweat” 

I just started thinking about it today, and honesty it irks me that he was just willing to make me spend an extra 70 dollars (ticket increase from when I could have purchased it to when I did) for no other reason than he just felt like fucking with me. 

I’m pretty disappointed cause I like my boss, he’s a cool guy and helped me out quite a bit when I was adjusting to the new job. Anyway it makes me question if I really want to be part of a business in which a leader conducts themselves like this. What do you all think? ",30Mar2019,1
411,"In my school we had this notorious bully. Some of the shit he did was very hurtful and borderline illegal. Lighting shit on fire, throwing rocks at homeless people, killing cats, dogs, birds, etc.. Motherfucker had even forced a girl to be his girlfriend. I can't imagine what he did to her. 

Him and I were classmates, I was a very silent kid who had problems opening up to people, which resulted in me having no close friends. So the bully took advantage of this and bullied me constantly. Like every fucking day it got worse and worse.. It got to a point where I had to pay him a 'tribute' every fucking month just to make him stop... like that was gonna work. I had enough of this and had decided to stand up for myself..and that resulted in me getting beaten up by 8 guys in an alley hours before my exams..... That defeated me from the inside..it would take me years to regain my confidence after that. 

He got to me in every fucking level.. Physically he was strong, he had more charisma than I, everyone feared him so despite not have any close friends he had plenty of ""friends"", I did score better grades than he did but in the finals Motherfucker cheated his way to the top.. 

Anyway, the school finally ended and fortunately I would never see his face again right? RIGHT??!? 

WROOONG! 

Fast forward to couple of years, I am no longer shy, I have have good friends, I still struggle sometimes but I find my way around awkward conversations... Life was a little less sucky until he came back into my life... 

The guy hasn't changed a bit he's still the most Shittiest life form on earth. But I had changed..i decided I forgive him for ALLL the pain and trauma he gave me. But turns out, no matter how much you change, life still finds a way to fuck you in the ass.. 

Few days ago, my girlfriend comes to me crying and admitting that she had hooked up with my ex bully..she explained that they both were drunk and made a mistake..

All these years, I thought I changed myself.. worked hard to never ever have someone take advantage of me.. But turns out all these years has just been a shell and if you break this shell you'd still find that sad little loser kid from highschool..

I'm tired, depressed and sleep deprived.. And I really need a hug

412,"My mom has been dating her current boyfriend for about a year now and has been separated from my stepdad for about 10 months. I’ve never liked this guy starting from the fact that he started dating my mom while she was still married to my stepdad. Ever since, I’ve hated him. I’ve tried to be kind to him or at least polite but it’s always been difficult. He used to only spend weekends here, but since October, he’s been here 24/7, even when my mom isn’t home. I’m currently 18 (turned 18 in February) and this makes me extremely uncomfortable. As a teenage girl, it feels wrong to have a 60 year old man I don’t know well around without my mom home. I’ve told my mom countless times that I don’t feel comfortable with him at our house when she’s not there, but nothing came of that. Whenever I tell her anything I don’t like about him or try to compromise, she shuts down, cries, and yells at me that I’m gonna be responsible for her unhappiness if she breaks up with him. I don’t want my mom to be unhappy but I also don’t like feeling miserable in my own house. I used to walk around the house all the time and spend so much time with my mom, but now I spend all my time in my room and I can’t even feel comfortable in my own house. I have to wear different clothes for my house and my room because the clothes I previously wore aren’t appropriate around a stranger (in my mind, he will always be a stranger). My older brother (doesn’t live with me) thinks I’m overreacting and I should just get over it, but I’ve tried that for the past three months with no success. My mom’s boyfriend also thinks it’s okay to tell me what to do or give me “life lessons” that I frankly don’t need. He constantly tells me that I don’t act like a lady and that no man will want me if I continue to do so (what he considers un-ladylike is eating literally any food with your hands, even food that’s meant to be eaten with your hands). I personally consider this inappropriate and try to ignore all of his comments. My mom is totally supportive of everything he says and lets him treat me like this. Some of his other comments include that my mom “did a great job with [my brother] but fucked up with me”. I literally can’t stand him. I had plans to move across the country for college next year but I was rejected from all of those schools and am now gonna be going to a school less than an hour away, meaning my mom will constantly visit (with her boyfriend, of course). What should I do? I don’t want my mom to be unhappy, but I also don’t want to be unhappy. Any advice for these next couple of months while I’m still living with them and advice for next year? Living with my dad is not an option as he passed away when I was 2. I can’t really move out because there’s nobody I could live with. I also can’t upset my mom too much as she’s paying for my college. ",30Mar2019,2

416,"Went to help him clean out his old room at his parents house, and I stumbled across a printed email I'd written to a radio station. There were a few sheets from people who'd written to the radio station, but only mind had a title written in pencil. My name + ""beware"" written after it.

So at the time, he was interning at the radio station, I was in my first year of college. I don't have any enemies or people who would warn him of me, and we supposedly didn't know each other at the time.

We met a year later when he got a job where I worked. And eventually ended up together. I pursued him.

I'm just really confused. It would be this cute coincidence where our worlds collided - except that the thing he wrote across the top makes me think he had prior knowledge of me before he apparently knew about me. Its dumb but I felt a bit sick to my stomach like...did he know of me &amp; try to engineer being with me?


He can't remember (and to be fair, I also barely remember writing into the radio, it was almost 4 years ago). He thinks maybe someone else on his course knew me and warned him, but that doesn't make sense either because:


We were never going to meet, so there would be no reason to get ready for a meeting. And he's not the type to take stock of gossip or take someone else's word for it if he didn't know me. Prior to that point I was also a bit of a recluse, I didn't know many people, certainly not ones that would think me so bad they'd need to warn strangers about me.

418,"I’m a junior in high school graduating early. Maybe I got a little pre senioritis and although I knew my application wasn’t gonna be strong enough to compete with T20 schools I signed the papers to graduate.

Well, I didn’t get into the big schools but specifically Stanford which I have been dreaming about for 8 years. I attended two of their summer programs and have always been dreaming for admission. 

I also got into UT Dallas which has great programs but isn’t renowned. I have friends and my boyfriend going there and I feel like I could be happy. I got tuition covered. However, I have to take out a small loan (3500/yr) for housing but I can pay that off quickly. The problem with that will be explained later.

Besides my constant back and forth of whether or not undergrad really matters, it’s really hard to figure out what to do next.

I’m not sure if it’s possible yet but if I fight for it I can go back to being a junior and graduate next year on track. However, I can just move on and go to school and get everything done early.

My aunts who have been on this go to Stanford/great school journey says it’s not worth it to go to UTD even if I like it and instead go back to high school. They’re not from Texas and don’t see the point in having to take out loans for any school that is not “big”. I see their point. With my mom’s super low income I would’ve gone to Stanford or Harvard etc with everything covered in financial aid.

My home situation is not the best and stable but I could stick it out. If I did another year I could get a higher SAT score - my early grad made me rush to take the SAT and I got a 1330. I believe I could do better. And write better essays. I believe I have the ECs and Reccs otherwise.

People I know at Stanford say where I go doesn’t define me and teachers who went to local schools say I could just go for grad school but I don’t know. You can go far anywhere, you define your success but I guess I wanted to experience Stanford. And although staying won’t guarantee admission next year I feel like I didn’t apply with my best this year and it makes me feel weird about my rejection because it wasn’t all I could give.

If I stay, my rank and GPA will drop from a 4.0 to 3.7 due to current grades but with a high SAT and the same ECs I think I’ll be ok?

420,"i got raped a week ago, at least that’s what i’m being told it is. i’m not sure. all i know is that i went out to grab a drink with an old family friend and i got too drunk on an empty stomach. don’t remember much, but i remember laying down in his car and freaking out when i realized we were having sex. this is someone i would never in a million years sleep with. i kept saying no no no stop get off i don’t want this where’s * david (new boyfriend, name changed). pushed him off me, got out of the car, and david picked me up. went to get screened at the doctor, and she told me that this was rape and that she had to report it. i told her i didn’t want this, that i just wanted to dissociate from it, cut contact, and move forward. she said she still had to report it even though i’m not sure if it’s actually rape since he stopped? then the police came to my house to take their report. i gave them some info but said i don’t want an investigation and just want to forget it happened. (this person lives states away and only is in town every few years, i can cut contact extremely easy and he never has to be in my life again). 

last night i finally told my boyfriend, because he wanted to have sex and i let him know that i’m worried i got something from this event. he processed this all night, and said that this guy needs to be locked up. asked me if it’s really rape or if we just fucked. said my parents should know (i have a terrible relationship with them, this would go horribly and is the last thing i want). he said if he gets something from this guy he’s going to drive to his state and kick his ass, and that he needs to be locked up. 

i don’t even know if this is rape because he stopped. i just want to prioritize and make sure my health is good and my boyfriends health is good and move on. i’ve been involved in a police investigation before, regarding my ex, and i know how lengthy and exhausting it is and i do not have it in me to do this. i just want to forget and move on.

It was never over anything serious just little things like grades and other stuff because i wanted to fit in with the “cool kids” well i’m now in college and stopped all that when i made friends with people who actually like me for me and Jake is one of them but while we were at the bar she said a few things that made me uneasy. For example she said that she has a restraining order from little Dicky because she snuck on his tour bus and she also said that she started selling drugs in 11th grade and has saved over 30,000 in a pickle jar under her bed.  I personally know a few people who move a lot of “product” and 30,000 seems like an unreal amount considering she lives with her parents who are extremely strict.  Maybe i’m overthinking it and she probably just said that because she was kinda drunk but ya know Jakes a really good friend of mine and i kinda wanna tell him that she gives me the crazy vibe but is it my place? Because who am i to say anything because if she’s lying and it’s for the same reason I use to then I understand why she might feel the need to lie but should i message or talk to her about it or go to Jake or just keep it to myself for a little while longer until I get a better understanding of her true character?",30Mar2019,1

I have a super close friend from Japan who lived with me here in the US for several months a few years ago. This person is one of the people who I came out as gay to. This friend sent me a message that read:

""Thank you for coming out. Now I understand why you were texting a lot. I have no issues with LGBT people in general. I know a trans person with an amazing personality. Don't worry."" a lovely message that I appreciate....

**So here's the problem.** This friend is taking his country's version of the foreign service exam. I didn't know this at the time because I know nothing about that kind of work, but those people can be assigned to any country at random. 

I worry that if my friend is sent to a country where being LGBT is illegal...that this message on his phone and that conversation could cause some issues. **I get that he sent that on his own.** 

**I kind of think that my friend doesn't understand the deep anti-lgbt laws that exist in certain places.**

Yet i am not having you in my hug. Not only i can't hug you but i can't even talk to you directly and tell you all of these. This whole situation is unfair. It's pathetic. It's sad. It's destroying my life. I can't tolerate this anymore. How much longer should i wait for your response? How much more should i feel sad and depressed and cry? I am a human too. I have feelings. I want you  I need you. I deserve you. Please notice me and say something to calm me down. I'd do whatever i can to make it happen. I'd use any tool and method to bring my words to you...""

Example 2: "" Miley you are my love. My mistress. My crush. You may call it whatever you want. But i love you with any style and phase and in any condition. Unlike some other guys who would leave you just because you try to be yourself. I have a unconditional love for you. I love you more than anyone else does. Believe me that i am honest. Please wash my sandess and pain away with your attention. Please clear the tears on my face with your beautiful hands. I swear that my life is as bitter as death without you. I know that you are a sweetheart by nature. So please understand how much this love hurts when it's ignored. I love you Miley. I adore you ❤❤❤""

Example 3: "" Miley. Everyday i wake up hoping that this is the magic day that you would notice me and save me from this pain. Then i think about you all day long and play your beautiful songs to motivate myself and do whatever i can to make contact with you and talk to you but at the end i'm dissapointed... i can't concentrate on anything and anyone but you. Then i go to sleep while i am so sad, depressed and hopeless because i know that i've wasted another day without any accomplishment. I break in tears while i feel a actual pain in my heart and i sincerely wish that this painful exprience was never started but it wasn't in my control. I fell in love with you and i didn't know how much pain i have to endure because of you. I swear that i am honest about what i say. I love you and i would do whatever i can to get to you. Even being able to talk to you a bit or even a quick look or smile from you is worth all of these efforts. I am so desperate for your attention.  You have been singing about love and heartbreak for a life. Please understand my love too... people don't understand me.

I am in a group chat with a couple of friends, and it was created to share homework.(I didn't use it, I did mine on my own) One weekend, they started talking about someone that I'm friends with. The thing is nobody in the entire grade likes her. She has a brother,though, that i'm closer to and i used to like. (I don't now, but this is important later) I stayed quiet on the chat to show I'm on neutral and didn't want to talk about it. So they had talked about her maybe 2 to 3 times on the chat, and every time I said nothing. Recently, I decided that it was enough and decided to tell her brother. He was absolutely furious about it and said a lot of things like how he would ""beat them up"" and ""ignore them"". Some of us are apart of the same friend group and we eat at lunch together and have some classes together. I told him we would discuss this later on Monday cause it was at like 1 am and we were both tired. So I waited until Monday and I see him talking to our friends including them. I just was quiet and then the sister came up to me and asked if they were talking about her. I said yes and she was really sad. Apparently, they all sent her messages saying how they weren't her friend and she had no friends. I asked the brother to show her the screenshots and then she asked if they had done this before and asked if they do this often and I told her everything I knew. On Friday, the people on the chat started saying how she knew about the chat and she knew what they were saying. They all pointed towards me cause I'm the closest to her. I started panicking and haven't answered on the chat yet. Then they started to private message me calling me a coward and pathetic for not  owning up to what I did. I told the brother about this and, like his sister, started saying how he was ""going to kill them all"" and ""nobody hurts his friends."" 
Story 2: My best friend and me had an argument and we didn't talk to one another for 2 days. She got my other friends to ignore me too. So i decided to sit with the brother and I have been there for those 2 days. On Friday, they started to message me saying why I moved spots and stuff like that. I said I wanted to see how it was over there, (I actually thought it was going to be awkward between us considering we were fighting) and then they started to say ""So now you want to sit with your boyfriend"" and ""Hope you have fun being ignored by your boyfriend and talking to *in their eyes, irrelevant people*.""

I'm looking for advice with this throwaway acc... I don't want this on my main.

You see, I live in a country where people live with their parents until they're 28-30 or so since it's hard to keep up oneself in economic terms, specially while studying (careers are 5+ years here, and really expensive). 

I never had a good relationship with my family. My father is in jail (or should be, I'm not sure) and I left my mother behind a few years ago. I couldn't bear living with her and my psychologist at the time suggested that even if harder, living by myself was a better option than staying with her.

I can't regret more that decision right now. Sure, depression and anxiety went away once I left home, but I had to constantly work and study, sleeping about 3 hrs daily to just keep it up. But I did it, and I was happy.

Now, I failed a few courses. I have another year in college, and now the grant I had will no longer cover it. It's just one year. One year to get my degree... one year I can't afford. I don't know how to possibly make more money any longer. I really can't get another job. It just won't fit. 

I could try and swallow my pride, and go back to my mother's, yeah, and also go back to the hell that was living with her.

I could start working full time and leave college, to live a life of &gt;900 bucks per month (yeah, that's about the wage here, specially if you have no degree). It's still more than I'm making now, but I'm not sure I could safe enough to eventually pay off the pending year. 

I could try to see if my college will support me somehow, and I'm trying to go on monday to speak to social assistants. But I'm not too optimistic. This college is extremely cold. Once I even had a career director tell me that ""I shouldn't be working, because students only have to study, otherwise it's not the university's problem.""

I'm so angry right now. Angry with myself for failing those courses, angry with life for putting me in a shitty, failed family, and angry at my country's system for making it nearly impossible to be a fucking independent adult (I'm 24 for fucks sake) and get somewhere in life at the same time.

I'm just sitting here, already cried out of frustration. I don't know what I should really do. I'm open to any advice.

437,"I’m 15, and I was around 12-13 when I started dating him and he was a year older. We broke up because he told me he wanted to date me and my best friend. Yeah. So, he and my best friend get together but break up a week later and he’s been infatuated with me ever since. 

 He’s made inappropriate comments about my body and often talks about my ass. It’s super uncomfortable. He’ll make a sexual joke and I’ll laugh, but that doesn’t mean I like him. He talks about things he’d do if we were together. I’ve told him explicitly I’m not into him but he ‘won’t ever give up’ and ‘he loves me too much to let me go’. Creepy.
 
We do theatre together and he was stressed so I gave him a hug. He plays it up and I don’t realise he’s doing it for my attention, so I hug him before rehearsal ends and he goes into kiss me. I push him away with a ‘wtf dude’ look. He apologises over Instagram and I say it’s cool.
It’s not.

He treats me like a piece of meat, or a toy he can’t get. I know what he’s like, he’s a ‘playboy’. He only wants me because he can’t have me but I feel so uncomfortable when he talks about me and my body. It’s not just light jokes, it’s like way too personal. I feel like it’s my fault for not sticking up for myself when he touches my face or wraps his arms around my waist or just when he does something I don’t like, but I don’t want to hurt him.

So please, what do I do?",30Mar2019,1
438,I had what I would consider a video game problem not too long ago. I got rid of them all. My life's changed alot since then and now I've found myself with too much free time. On my days off from work I'm bored as hell. My roommate just plays video games all day and we rarely hang out anymore. I'm about an hour drive from 2 different touristy areas where there's alot to do but I'm getting really bored of doing things by myself. I have no one to share experiences with. I'm on tinder but I'm at a low point with it. I'm just drowning in loneliness and boredom. I played alot of video games growing up. I used them as an escape. What I'm wondering is in the opinion of random strangers do you think it would be a good idea for me to buy a Nintendo switch or something for light gaming to take some of the edge of (plz forgive this analogy) like methadone for former heroin addicts.,30Mar2019,1
439,"Hey guys, it’s 3:30am here where I am and I just received a call from my 17yo nephew and he is high on MDMA. He basically asked me why his drugs weren’t working like they were the night before. The night before was the first time (apparently, I wouldn’t know cause he’s a good liar). He told me what he was doing and what was happening, he was feeling pissed off and mad. I talked him out of it, just told him to go home with his friends and chill out. He’s okay. 

Some context: he knows about my history about partying and drug use because I’ve openly talked about it to my sister and also to him, because I wanted him to be safe and know the consequences. He’s been partying a lot and so I had to have this conversation with him. My sister is his mother, and they’re becoming more distant. She doesn’t like him going out so much and all that cause he’s still on school. You know all that mother tings. 

I’m now unsure whether I should tell my sister about it because it could potentially make the habit worse, break the trust between us and he’ll no longer feel comfortable talking to me or consolidating in me about anything in general and create tension in the household. I know that when a teen goes through that they just have to learn for themselves but also I think he needs someone like me to help him not get into it really badly. I think my sister will react in a shit way because we’ve had huge drug issues with our brothers and myself. But I was hoping that maybe she’ll let me be the one to help and that she can understand that if she talks to him about it then he’ll have no one he can trust to talk too. Cause then I’ve broken his trust by telling his mother. But I just want her to know what’s been happening and maybe understand him more with his behaviour. Like if she does try and talk to him she would’ve broken my trust and relationship with her son and he would end up in a more worse place than he is now cause then he’d have no one in his family to talk too. 

TDLR: Auntie doesn’t know whether to tell sister her (17m) child is doing drugs because it may break the relationship between either sister and/or nephew.

440,"So, there is this company I am currently seeking a job from.  The interview process is ongoing and I am patiently waiting.  My potential employer knew who I am and that I am waiting.

Potential trouble is, I keep seeing this potential employer in events. Not stalking, not purposefully, but it is quiet normal for me to keep seeing him in events every once in a while. 

I never bug him about the job or the interview during these events, I don't even bring it up. I just say hi when I have the chance, and talk about the event when I have the chance.

442,"Hi everyone, I have been debating on writing this out for awhile because I feel ashamed and a bit embarrassed that this is such a difficult task for me lately. 

My partner (28) and I (23) have been invited to his friends housewarming party (tonight) and then a theme / costume party later on in April. These friends of his trigger a lot of insecurities. My partner and I are pretty different and I have never really placed a lot of value in my looks because I just never really liked how I looked. I'm not great with makeup, I don't love fashion, and what not. Most of his friend group place a lot more value on this than I do. Generally, when I am around them I feel extremely self-conscious and anxious. I've avoided it for so long and I haven't been able to make a connection with any of them because I am nervous, not sure how to make small talk, etc.

I know how important it is for my partner to see that I am putting in an effort and I want to really badly. I have been feeling confident about tackling this situation, up until today - the day of the smaller party. I work until 9, so I will arriving later than most others and meeting my partner there. We agreed that he would come out and meet me outside so we could go in together. But I never know how to interject into conversations and get to know people. I usually just sit there and observe and listen and I feel awkward. I feel like it must look like I am extremely shy and don't want to talk to anyone. Please help! Any tips or tricks. I don't want to be the awkward, weirdo, loser at this party. I want to try and I want to show my partner that I am capable of making connections with his friends, even if they are surface level connections.

445,"My (27f) brother (24m) has been heavy his whole life. I won't go to much into the past but my mom has something wrong with her mentally, so she's been an unknowing enabler. Sneaking food etc. Now it's morphed into needing to defend him when anyone tries to talk about him constructively. My father tried for a bit when he was younger to get my mom to bring in healthier foods and it just ended in fights and more food being sneaked behind my dads back. 

My dad gave up on him after a while. He didn't/doesn't understand why he won't pick himself up and just do something. My brother (we'll call him Anthony) has never had a job, never driven a car, not even 100% sure he's ever been on a date. (He has had girlfriends) He's honestly the sweetest guy and so funny, he could do anything. But his weight is literally and figuratively holding him back. Dad doesn't understand Anthony is depressed and probably has some form of agoraphobia, definitely anxiety about people and public places. 

Well, now my Dad is in a place to start dieting himself (for his diabetes) and wants to expand that for my brother. Which is great. But just a diet change isn't enough. I'm about to have my parents come over and we are going to talk about Anthony and im going to mediate between my parents and form some kind of plan. 

I need ideas and suggestions. I know this isn't a lot of information, please ask anything you feel is relevant and ill answer as best i can. I need a way to work with them that will work FOR him. A way where he won't see this as an attack but people who love him pushing him to do better. I know my parents are a step away from just throwing him out because they don't know how else to get him to start his life. 

I'm trying desperately to give him some time to piece himself together before he leaves the nest. I know they won't make him leave if he's making progress. They just need to know he's not just eating himself to death in his room. Understandably we all just want to see him thrive. 

These are the plans/ideas I've come up with so far for my parents/brother:
- Keto diet for quick results while still being able to feel full. 
- Set up rewards. Does chores for access to privileges. (I'm questioning this cause my parents did this once and it failed as he pretended he was perfectly fine sitting in the dark with nothing, but he was a kid then....)
- (Anthony rejected this but it's still on the table) My BF and i are about to rent a house in a few months and we offered to house him under the condition he works on his condition. 
- Stripping the house of anything that's not raw food so he's forced to cook healthy meals to eat. (My dad wont sacrifice his food for my brother so this one is a dud)

I don't have much, im sorry, but I feel like its all resting on me to kick their asses into gear. I moved out and lost my weight. I want to help him too. My dad is caught up in his own inability to see my brothers suffering and my mom not being a whole functional human being doesn't help. Neither of them are equipped to help him and only i know where any of them are coming from to form a discussion instead of just yelling and pointing. 

I want to help my brother before he kills himself and wastes away his entire 20's. My dad will forever regret it and idk what my mom would even do. 

Only time my brother is motivated is when he's talking to a girl. He lost 100lbs last year cause he dated a girl for several months online. Got new clothes, he looked great, still over 300, but way better. Then she left and he gained it all right back. He has the ability to. He just doesn't. 

Any suggestion is a good suggestion. I know that he won't if he doesn't want to, but i want to push him. I can't live with myself if i don't try. It's selfish, i know. But for me, him and everyone who loves him, someone has to do something.",30Mar2019,1

After some time around those people I figure out who is on my wavelength personality wise and it’s always the ones who keep to themselves as well, never the social butterflies. Also when it comes to women, I have a very hard time approach any girl I find attractive. If she is by herself then it’s a-little easier but In a crowd or group I wouldn’t dare.

Before I could even say that it looked like a handprint she said that it did and when I asked her if she got grabbed she just said no and said she didn't know where they came from and that she noticed them the night before last.

452,"So let me start off this story saying I used to be the type of guy r/niceguys makes fun of (to a mild extent). As I got older I started realizing that I should just be direct and stop being a pussy to get girls, and it worked really well. As soon as I hit college something just clicked. I started having a lot of meaningless sex and became the opposite side of the nice guy spectrum from where I was before (it also helped I got slightly more attractive but not by an insane amount). 

It was really fun at the beginning but as time went on I wanted a relationship more. It is also worth noting that although I became more douchey I am still a weird guy. I have the type of personality where some people like me a lot, and some people don’t. What I have noticed however, is that I grow on people a lot the more they know me. 

What typically happened in these hookups is that the girls would begin to develop feelings for me and I had zero interest in them. I was pretty good about not leading people on so I would typically end it when I got bored. Throughout this whole personality progression I started to realize that I can’t think of any girl that I like. I still wanted a relationship but I just wasn’t having the romantic feelings towards any girls the same way I was when I was younger. I also have a lot of female friends that I’m close with. Back in the day I used to like all of them but now I have no romantic interest in any of them. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I still have had crushes on people once I went through this personality change, but much less often. I have never been interested in the girl I was hooking up with. I realized I’m very much into the chase. Once I get what I want, I get over it very quickly. The girls I end up liking are always girls that I develop friendships with so I actually get to know their personality. I’m not that picky about looks but I’m very picky about personality. 

So I recently graduated college and moved to a big city. I downloaded the dating apps and have had a ton of success landing dates. The issue is that it takes a lot of time for me to develop feelings for someone and have to know them for awhile. It’s really hard for me to actually like a girl based on going on dates with them where everyone is putting up a front. I have tried seeing girls multiple times even if I’m iffy on them but I never end up developing feelings. Obviously it would make sense to ask a friend out but as I mentioned, I moved to a new city and it’s hard to make a lot of new friends. 

What can I do to improve my ability to develop feelings?

I also want to note that I don’t think I’m that attractive and feel I sometimes get girls out of my league. ",30Mar2019,1

My sister (25) is the youngest of 4 and to be honest. shes had it the easiest out of all of us despite everything that has happened. When it comes to her. My dad seriously believes she can do no wrong. Hes even called me and my mom jealous of her. 


My sister is currently going through a case which involved a car accident resulting in someone's death.  My sister is 100% at fault. My dad hired the best lawyer in town and it's coming to an end soon.  My dad had to sell one of his rental houses (that she lived in rent free) to cover the lawyer costs. She now lives with my parents rent free.
She acts entitled, like everyone owes her something. Everyone is beneath her. When someone calls her out on her shit, my dad rushes to her aid and then starts demeaning the other person. She never takes responsibility for anything. 

She tells lies to derail the subject and he believes her. She said I've had 4 abortions that she paid for and that I'm a prostitute. My dad believes her.
 My mom is kind of stuck in the relationship because hes threatened to hurt her if she ever thought about leaving. The thing is, when my mom told him that she told her siblings to turn him in if anything were to happen, he laughed and said hed never get caught.  It's easy to gather where my sister got this from.


 My sister even confessed that shes only going to a therapist so it looks good for her case.  She also admitted to me that she wanted a male therapist because women hate her and that doesnt tell him everything because then he wont be on her side.
 About a few months ago she was borrowing my dads truck and she called me freaking out.  she decided to drink  and drive about an hour away from the house and she needed me to pick her up.  I suspected she was drunk but she screamed into the phone that she wasnt. When I got there, the trucks front end was so damaged. She hit someone and left. It was really dark out at the time and in a pretty rural area so there werent a lot of witnesses.  When I was driving her home, she TOLD me ""you gotta take this for me, it's going to mess up the case"". I said no and she went crazy in the truck. Breaking the bottles of wine etc.  I made her tell my dad on the way home. There was a small argument but an hour later they were cool.  My mom though....was furious. My dad got the truck fixed and it's currently hiding at one of his friends houses.

457,"Last year, before I left for college, I cancelled my gold’s gym membership. This was around August. I walked in and let them know and they told me okay.

Fast forward late february, I am charged $20 for Gold’s Gym membership and another $10 earlier in March. I know that typically you have to go in to cancel memberships, and seeing that I had one day available over spring break, I went in around halfway through March on a Sunday. I explained to the cashier that I had previously cancelled my membership last year, to which she informed me my account was put on frozen instead. I explained to her I live 4 hours away and that I honestly just want it cancelled and for my $30 to be refunded. She seemed a bit taken back that I would want my money back but told me I had to come in over the weekday and talk to the manager, but since I live four hours away she gave me the manager’s card.

I have emailed the manager multiple times and she never replies. I have also called in and the manager is never available/keep telling me I have to come in to cancel it. I already cancelled it though like I said long ago. 

The nearest Gold’s Gym to me is an hour away and I don’t have a car at college, and nonetheless I don’t think I should have to go out of my way to fix an issue that I clearly fixed way before I even left for college.

461,"I know this is a long post. I’m just lost, and I don’t know what to do, so I wanted to give all the details I could. I want to really thank anyone who reads to the end and gives me their advice. No matter what it is, I feel like it could really help.

I am an undergraduate student about to graduate college. I want to go to medical school in a year. My parents and I have never really seen eye to eye. My dad has always tried to control everything I do, ever since I was little. I didn’t realize until coming to college that it wasn’t a normal thing to do. 

My dad always wants me to be in contact with him at all times. Once when I was studying in my room and hadn’t responded to him in a few hours, he looked up my roommate’s mother, called her mother, got my roommates number, and called my roommate to ask where I was. When I was at home over the break, I told my dad I was going to go for a walk. He said no. I told him I was going anyway. I was walking for 20 minutes when I found out he called the police and reported me as a missing person. 

Every time I go home, my dad and I end up fighting. He yells as me for everything I ever do that he doesn’t like and tells me how he knows what’s best for me and how he didn’t raise me to be like this. Recently, he yelled at me for my boyfriend. My boyfriend is half middle eastern and half white, and my dad told me he was a Muslim (even though he isn’t, and I told him this multiple times). My dad told me that dating a Muslim was throwing away our family values and how I shouldn’t date him.

My mom isn’t as bad as my dad, but I feel like she goes along with him most of the time. My dad does not treat my mom well. My dad believes women should do all the housework and refuses to ever cook or clean. He tells me how my mom has mental problems, because she does not always do everything he wants. I feel like my dad has slowly made my mom start thinking like he does, and now she usually just goes along with what he says. But I really love my mom, and she’s great to talk to on her own. It’s just when my dad has weighed in on a situation that she starts to take his side.

I believed everything my dad told me for most of my life. When I got to college, I realized that other families were different and other students started telling me that my dad was emotionally abusive. But when he yells at me sometimes, I still find myself wondering if maybe he is right.

Now, as I’m nearing the end of college, my dad wants me to fly back home and stay there as I study for the MCAT (medical school entrance exam). I really don’t want to go home. I know I will just fight with my dad and I’ll be miserable, and I won’t be able to focus on my MCAT. I want to stay here, study for the MCAT with my boyfriend, spend time with my friends, have a research job for a year before medical school, and use the resources that are at my college to help me study. I have expressed this to my dad, but he says that he knows what’s best for me and he didn’t raise me this way, and that I am to come home immediately after graduation. 

The problem is, my older sister did not do what my parents wanted her to. She made decisions with her life that my parents are not happy about (my parents don’t like her husband or career choice), and my parents told me that they would never forgive my sister and refuse to speak to her again. Also, I feel like my dad brainwashes my other siblings into thinking like him, without them realizing it. My sister recently told me that she was worried I was ruining my life, because my parents told her I didn’t want to come home after graduation. After I explained the situation to her, she started to take my side. I am terrified of my parents cutting me out of their life and never talking to me again, and my siblings taking their side. I love my mom and I love my siblings and honestly, I still care about my dad. He’s paid for me growing up and he’s paid for my college and I don’t want to lose him completely. But I also don’t want to let him control me for my entire life. I really just don’t know what to do. I’d really appreciate any advice anyone could give me. Thanks again to anyone who read this far.

464,"So ... before I start I want to be clear that this isn’t a joke or made up in the slightest.  You can’t make this stuff up🤦🏻‍♂️

This is a long read but it’s worth it I promise.

So I meet this woman on tinder, she was and still is super chill, she’s Brazilian and I’m half Brazilian,half English so that’s the original link we had to start off mutual interest. There is an age gap, I’m 19 and she’s 25, I asked her straight up if that was an issue (it’s not for me) and she said that it wasn’t as long as I’m not childish (which I’m not). We talked some more and turns out we have a lot in common and at this point I’m really starting to like her. We talk some more and then she tells me she’s trans, which personally was a small shock but I decided wasn’t that big of an issue, my reasoning is that she’s been living as a girl/woman since she was a child and that an actual gay guy wouldn’t be interested in her in the slightest. I guess I’m socially a libertarian if you had to label my views/mindset. I’m happy to recognise her as a “real” woman. 

So we meet up and there’s quite a lot of chemistry, we end up finding a lot more stuff in common and at this point I’m thinking we’re good... like we kissed , hugged etc - so far so good right?

We end up seeing each other most days of that week and each time it gets better and I like her more and she’s showing every sign of liking me more too. 

We do end up talking about life, deeper stuff like her reasons why she came to Europe, her hopes and dreams etc but she does mention that she’s undocumented, she did tell me that she almost married a few dudes in other European countries simply for documentation and that they understood why, she never pretended to love them. They were willing as friends. She goes on to say that she decided against it. 

I’m secure in the knowledge that she’s not interested in me for my documentation as I’m younger and she knows I don’t intend to get married in the next decade , and she has plenty of offers , she’s very attractive and outgoing. 

Personally her situation doesn’t really bother me because as a half Brazilian myself there was a time when my mother wasn’t documented (before marrying my father) but she’s the best person I know so I don’t see undocumented people as anything less. 
Individually none of these things bother me too much and my interest for her is strong, it’s a case of “mind vs heart.” (That’s sounds goofy lol)
So I carry on seeing her and we get on so well and I like her a lot and can really see myself being with her. I’ve been in many relationships but none that I’ve liked as much as her at this stage.
Unfortunately there are still more surprises to come :/

I met up with her yesterday and we had an amazing time at the cinema, we cuddled at the back...it was really nice, to say the least. So the movie ends at like 2am and at this point we’re close to her place and really far from mine so she invited me over and in my mind I was thrilled, a chance to spend the night with her.(No in a particularly sexual way, I just like being close to her.) 

So we cuddle some more and get talking and then she’s says out of the blue “I have something to tell you, I’m not sure how you’ll take it but we’ve gotten serious and you deserve to know”
I’m really confused at this point, In my mind I’m thinking “well you’ve already come out , what more can there be to say?” 
I tell her to just say whatever it is and I’ll understand. 
She goes on to ask me if I knew what an escort was. Obviously I did and in my mind I was thinking “f**k” 

For some reason I played dumb, maybe subconsciously I was buying myself time to find the appropriate reaction while she explained.  She goes on to say that as an undocumented women she had limited options and it came down to working as a cleaner for less than minimum wage or escorting. At this point it’s clear what she chose. 

She said “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner, but it’s not something I just come out with when I meet someone new, especially when I already have to come out as trans at some point. I told you now because we’re getting serious and my roommate been telling me that it’s time to tell you, I agree” 

(For context we’ve gone out with her roommate a few times and I’m actually quite fond of her as a friend). 
I tell her that I understand and she explains to me that she never kisses them, that’s saved for me. That’s nice .... I guess.

In case you’re wondering, yes the roommate is also an escort and later that night I hear  her bringing clients (a couple) into the apartment and in to her room. Obviously me and the girl I’m seeing just stay quiet but that made it really real for me and I’ve been with a pit in my stomach ever since. I’ve got an excellent poker face and faked being okay to whole morning and now that I’m on my own I’ve got a really bad feeling. 
I still like her so much and she hasn’t wronged me in anyway, I credit her for being so honest with me because most the stories I’ve read online is the dude finding out on his own that the person he’s seeing is an escort. 

One thing that’s really got to me is a conversation I had with my mother a few weeks ago. I told her I was seeing a Brazilian girl and while she was all for it as she’s Brazilian herself, she gave me 3 warnings:

1)“You sure she was born a girl? Many Brazilians are trans” (my mum is extremely conservative due to my grandfather being extremely authoritarian, and thinks all gays/trans etc are rapists and pedophiles) etc so naturally I just ignored this comment. And decided that the girl being trans was something I’d probably leave out from the description. 

 2) she said to me is she fully Brazilian? So many are undocumented and will pretend to love you just for your passport. The girl was extremely open to me about her situation and I was clear with her that I wouldn’t be getting married in the near future so that’s not an issue.

Finally my mum told me that so many Brazilians come over and “sell their bodies” , at that point in time I had no clue about my girls profession so I was pretty outraged that my mum would even say that to me.
 
Now I feel like an idiot. My mum was worried about the girl being any single one of those things and turns out she’s all 3 and also let’s not forget the age gap. 

My mind is telling me to run for the hills but my hearts saying go give it a chance, I already like her so much and I know she likes me but it seems doomed, 

I’m particularly uncomfortable with the escorting. Any day she could get beaten, killed, trafficked etc but I know it’s not my place to ask her to stop especially since her only real alternative would be cleaning toilets for pocket change. 
I want to be with her but I’m worried about the emotional damage it could cause me. I’m also worried about when the time comes that we do become sexual, would it ‘feel’ like just another client?

Any replies are welcome, people who wanna laugh at how I managed to get myself in this situation are welcome to mock me idm I probably deserve it.

465," 

Before getting into it, let me preface this by saying there were things I could have done to avoid this mess, and many lessons have been learned so it won’t happen again. At the time I thought I had my bases covered, but I didn’t. 

To make a long story short, back in the fall I hired a contractor to build a garage. We had a contract, I checked references, his price was reasonable, great let’s do it. I paid for $20,000 in materials that ended up never being ordered, he got as far as getting the site prepped before the concrete pad when he stopped showing up. At this point materials should have been showing up (we had a fair bit of stuff that had to be custom made, so taking a few weeks for stuff to be ordered and delivered was reasonable) and after tracking down all the vendors, no one had an order for this guy. 

When this all happened, I collected everything (virtually all was in writing) and filed a report with police, at which point I find out he’s done this before and there are others who’ve filed reports against him. Police inform me that criminally, they can’t charge him for fraud because since we have a contract, and he showed up at the beginning, that shows “intent for him to complete the contract, and it’s a civil matter, not criminal.” 

In trying to stay on his good side, through more conversation he acknowledged (in writing) that he did owe me money back for the materials that were never ordered. He agreed to a repayment plan of $1000/m. I received an etransfer from his wife in Dec for $1000. Since then, he’s not followed through on Jan, Feb, or Mar, but continued to promise up, down, and sideways he would. One day in particular, he claims he’d show up cash in hand. Surprise, he didn’t. The following day he claims he stopped by but no one was home and he wasn’t leaving that amount in the mailbox - an outright lie as I happened to be home all day. At this point he quit responding, and blocked me on social media. 

Now I’m left with a decision of what to do next

1. Take him to small claims, where it will cost me $200 to file, plus the day in court. Pros: I’m dead sure I’ll win, I’ve got all the evidence I need. Cons: Winning and collecting on a judgement are two totally different things. He’s got no assets, owns nothing of value, pretty sure he’s no longer an employee of a certain large company, and I’m certain he’s in debt up to his eyeballs already. His wife also recently left him with 3 kids, so no doubt whatever he does have is going to child support. Also, going to court may end up being more difficult for me as in a few months, we’re going to have to temporarily relocate for 2-3 months to a city 4 hrs away for my child’s open heart surgery. 
2. Before blocking me on FB, I screenshotted his entire friends list. Message them..? 
3. Much as I’d like to show up at his place with some big guy friends, I can’t think of anyone who is large enough who would be willing to do it, and there is the legality of it. If it came back to me… I have a lot more to lose than he does. And as a 20’s female, I’m not very intimidating. 
4. Something else? 

It just kills me that he can just keep on getting away with it. I’m sure he’s got all sorts of fines and debts, yet it never seems to have any effect on him. After all this happened, I’ve found at least 20+ other people that he’s done this to, for various amounts, and we’re all in the same boat, and he continues to rip off more people, with seemingly no consequences.

466,"So I felt some chemistry with this girl I met like a month ago and she seemed interested so I asked her out. She immediately said yes and gave me her number.

A few hours before the date (the next day) she cancels with a lame excuse and asks if I'm going to a mutual friend's party this weekend. I say ""yeah I can make it. I'll cya there?"" and she never responds.

My general rule is if a girl flakes on me and doesn't offer a reschedule, then she probably isn't interested. Though it almost seems like she was hinting at wanting to see me again by asking if I was going to the party. She also never responded which seems like a bad sign.

I wouldn’t have to perform anything sexual on him, only him on me. This honestly sounds enticing because I could use the money but at the same time I feel like I could not allow myself to stoop that low as I do not find him attractive whatsoever and it seems akin to prostitution.

I asked her to talk about things with me and we’re meeting up next week to ‚talk‘. I was surprised she didn’t avoid it because whenever someone asks you to talk or says we need to talk, it’s usually not great news.

I’m going to cancel a trip with her, which was completely fine as a friend trip, but when I was planning it it mad me realize that my feelings were much worse than I thought, and haven’t been able to get her off my mind.

There were a lot of competing issues making this decision. First I really wanted to go on this trip because it’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while.  Second, I’ve never been able to disappoint her, and everything we’ve done together has always been great.   

What made me really change my mind about everything is that Ingas planned to go on this friend trip and then ask her for distance.  I realized this would be more assholeish. Then she invited another person along, and it made me also feel that this would end up being a painful third wheel trip for me.

What I’m going to end up doing next week is pulling out of the trip, handing over all the details so she can go, and tell her that planning the trip made me realize that I have feelings for her and need to pull back.  I can’t be a good friend when I’m hiding feelings, I really want her in my life because she’s a great friend.

I’m trying not to do a complete feelings dump because that would be too much.  I just know that she’s a wonderful person who I want in my life, but the relationship I want with her won’t work, and I want to avoid becoming a bitter person.

479," Hi everyone, I'm asking for advice for dealing with a parent; don't really know where to turn to. 

Here's the situation: 

Yesterday, my mom (bipolar, unreliable) was really late to driving me to the airport to get me home because she had a 'meeting' and so I was checked in late at the airport and had to wait four hours to get my luggage. She then blamed me for not getting in an Uber since she ""will always be unreliable"" (her words). I was already in a bad, very tired mood. My dad calls and starts grilling me about the visit with my mom and sister, asking all these questions. I get short with him (I haven't in years) after he asks me about my last dental check up and tell him I'm really not in the mood for a lecture right now. He starts going off that if I don't see a doctor every six months my gums will get ruined, and now he has to research into it and he is so so busy. I tell him sarcastically ""I'm not going to die of my gums receding and I'll go to the doctor after my show opens (I'm in a musical that opens in two weeks which is a very time consuming commitment for me)."" He goes quiet and hangs up. 

Then, he sends me this text message - 

""All I can take from our last conversation is that you are quite self centered. You have been too busy for a real relationship with me for about the last eight years. Being a father doesn’t mean being a doormat and that’s what I’ve been to you. I’ve helped create the person you are and I don’t always like what I see."" 

Keep in mind, I am a scholarship college student who works 20 hrs a week while also getting good grades and pursuing my career (theatre - 4 hour rehearsals daily) while also setting up a foundation for a future day job (marketing) through various extracurricular activities. My dad has been out of my life for years and just the past year and a half has been mending his relationship with me, which I appreciate. I feel like the text message is very dramatic. I don't feel selfish. I call him about once a week. He only sends me about $250 a month while not paying for my college tuition or covering my rent - I've been covering it myself. He spends all his money on his 25 year old girlfriend and expensive boat. I do not complain to him about that, he just started sending me money when I mentioned to him that I only eat one meal a day (I used to only make enough money to pay rent after buying all my books, etc). I am very grateful for him sending me that money but I don't think I need to be treated this way. I've been debating about cutting him out of my life completely. He consistently pulls weird stuff like this where if he does a favor for me or sends me money, he will ask for my attention in return. I think this is a very toxic relationship to establish with someone you love. 

He texted me that he wants to take me out to dinner to talk about this but I don't really want to. Does anyone have thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

So Ive been in a personal loop/bubble/stuck in a rut. Been reaching out to friends and family, and other sources. I cant seem to see any advice as useful. I mean i can see some of it is, Anyways. here we go

&amp;#x200B;

Context, ill try to keep it minimal. Alright, growing up I was bullied, starting very early, in Elementary school and spread all the way untill towards the End of highschool. As an out come of this, I had a very hard time keeping friends, realising who were true and who weren't. So yea, havnt had many friends in my social life. When I was 17, my Mother passed away as well, from alcohol abuse. So that wasnt easy either.

Anyways fast forward a few years, living with my dad and brother. They both became alcoholics too, and I put basically put up with chaos every week. Some nights are good, some nights are shit. Anyways. So thats the jist of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout all that bullshit ive been dealing with, I havnt accomplished anything. I went to school for HVAC, couldnt find a job because I dont have my drivers license.I didnt bother trying to get my license as I lived close to everything... I never bothered with a girlfriend, because i was tired of trying, but it was also a lack of trying/confidence too.

Fast forward to present, and Im currently still at my first job ive had for 12 years, at this dead end grocery store. Where I havnt moved up at all in the entire time Ive been there. Ive just been going through the motions in hopes of something. I guess the definition of insanity is doing the same ting over and over and expecting a different out come.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. I really dont know what to do. im trying to look on the bright side, and be optimistic. Amonth ago, i turned 28, and felt really sad for about a month straight. Literally a month straight. Im an advocate of cannabis, so i purchased some CBD and looked into working out. So ive been exercising and taking CBD and itsbeen helping. Making these issues less of an issue. But its stiill  the MONKEY in the room. I have to do somethning just dont know how. or what.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long rant/shpeel and I guess grammar too. But I have no idea what to do. my friends are just saying Pick someting and life will come. I just cant see any hope with that. But i am trying to keep this positivitiy ive built within the last week ( I havnt been sad the last 7 days , because i Really was getting tired of feeling like that EVERYDAY)

Just recently, especially on my birthday, on the 23rd ( month ago). I took a step beside my life , basically, and see that Im a looser almost. and I NEED TO CCHANGE this.

And again i apologise for my grammar. and thanks guys

484,"So as the title says, I'm turning 19 in a few months and I'm already noticing my hair thinning. It started with a few grey hair, nothing noticeable. Then I got 2 small bald spots. I did my research and found out that it was somewhat common for young men to experience this and it's called ""alopecia areata"". It's got something to do with the autoimmune system and it says that hair should grow back on its own in a few months. However, it's been around 3 months I'd say and I'm not noticing any hair growing back. Apart from that, my hair is a bit thinner, when standing in front of a mirror in the bathroom with strong light flashing into my head, my head is somewhat seeable, also the part around my ears and on the side is a bit thinner. Also, when I part my hair it leaves a gap. It's still nothing noticeable, I've taken pictures of my hair and you can't see my head it's only under strong light. My temple isn't going bald, I've taken pictures to check. I don't think my hairline is receding, and noone commented on my hair except for the noticeable bald spot, so it's still okay, but I guess it's going to get worse.

I'm only 18 and I really don't want to lose my hair or have a receding hairline. Grey hair weren't a big deal, there was only a few and I could take them out, I haven't had a lot of grey hair growing out. But this is starting to really worry me.

I really can't afford $100 products that I don't even know will work, my family doesn't have that much money, so if anyone knows anything or if anyone has dealt with this, please let me know before I decide to commit suicide, as I'm really starting to think about that option.

He is exactly my type, we have all of the same interests and he’s just really exciting to talk to, I’m extremely attracted to him. We text and Snapchat all day every day. 

Initially I just wanted to maybe have a fling, I haven’t been looking for a relationship... but it has become clear to me that I can’t help but be really into him, and unfortunately I don’t think he’s looking for a girlfriend.  I don’t want to be serious with him right away but I know eventually I will. I think he wants to casually date, he’s even said he’s bad with relationships. One time he told me he wants to ‘just see where things go’ which I took as him trying his hardest to say ‘I don’t want anything serious’ without saying it. 

I have never had this issue before, I’ve always had to be the one to shy away from men because they wanted too much commitment from me, but now I am that person. He is the only person I’ve ever been interested in that I have liked more than they like me. I don’t want to freak him out and I’m just trying to figure out what to do...

So,  I am beginning to think as much as I like him, maybe I shouldn’t keep talking to him (should I??). My question is, how on earth do I stop talking to this guy when I love having conversations with him every day? I don’t want to get hurt eventually when I am really into him and he doesn’t want that.

488,"I (24f) graduated from college almost 2 years ago and in that time span I feel like I've slowly lost a lot of friends. Some we mutually faded away, some actively burned bridges, and some are in that limbo that the only contact we have is saying we should hang out more but no one ever initiates a hang out.

I've been feeling really bad about it and feel like I haven't done enough to keep in touch, especially in the past few months where I felt so stuck in the past and riddled with regret and a lot of woulda/coulda/shouldas.

493,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been procrastinating since the they applications for universities in my country started, now I literally have 4 hours to apply to somewhere.   
I would have done it earlier, but the problem is, I just don't know what I am good at. I've tried to collect more information about me from my friends, teachers and I tried to come up with stuff I know about myself too.  


I studied electrical engineering and computing in HS, but I don't know if I want to do that.  
I don't think I am particulary good at anything and there isn't really anything I'll be happy to do 8 hours a day (or more) in my future job. I want to get paid a lot (obviously), but I really want for that job and my stay at university to be at least a little fun.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing I'd really like is to travel and meet with people, but I don't really think that is something I can study lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So, any advice on what should I apply to/what should I do?

Thanks.",30Mar2019,1
494,"I’ve been co-planning my friend’s bachelor party, who wanted a big trip in a summer town with around 18 friends. We booked a place after reaching out and hearing that 13 wanted to come, but five have since cancelled on us after finding out that the only available accommodations would result in each of us paying $450 for three nights (which we didn’t think was too bad considering the size of the place and the amenities included). 

It then became too expensive to split between the smaller group, so we had to cancel, which resulted in a $550 cancellation fee that at this point only myself and the other co-best man are on the line for. Neither of us can afford to pay a random $275 on top of everything else, especially when it’s not our fault. 

Is it okay to ask the other groomsman for help? See what the groom thinks we should do? Or ask the people cancelled to pay it? Or are we just fucked. My co-best man just wants to take the hit and is ok paying for it all himself, and doesn’t want me to bring it up with the groom or other groomsmen.

And we didn't say anything about it to anyone else. I don't know if this has any added value, but then was around when i became depressed. 

However, he told a friend of both me and him what i did to him. When his friend found out, he texted me, but i tried to act like an adult and told him it was private. That was at least a year ago now. Today, he texted me again. He was very mad and put me in a groupchat called ""Dick sucker"" with him, me and the friend i assaulted. He was angry, the person i assaulted didn't say anything and neither did i because i don't know what to do. I am a bad person, because i **SEXUALLY ASSAULTED** a **FRIEND** when i was **12**.

My father is getting older, and is close to retiring. He's a good man, with a great career. Moving in with him would come with the benefit of living rent free. He has told me many times that if I wanted to move in with him while I complete my schooling he'd be able to get us a two bedroom apartment close to a school in my hometown, and that he would love to have me. He wants to spend time with me.

I don't mind where I am now, and have a lot of friends here, but I cant help but wonder - if I stay where I am and only see my father on special occasions, will i regret not spending more time with him? Does anyone have a similar experience?

503," I know this is a long post. I’m just lost, and I don’t know what to do, so I wanted to give all the details I could. I want to really thank anyone who reads to the end and gives me their advice. No matter what it is, I feel like it could really help.

I am an undergraduate student about to graduate college. I want to go to medical school in a year. My parents and I have never really seen eye to eye. My dad has always tried to control everything I do, ever since I was little. I didn’t realize until coming to college that it wasn’t a normal thing to do. 

My dad always wants me to be in contact with him at all times. Once when I was studying in my room and hadn’t responded to him in a few hours, he looked up my roommate’s mother, called her mother, got my roommates number, and called my roommate to ask where I was. When I was at home over the break, I told my dad I was going to go for a walk. He said no. I told him I was going anyway. I was walking for 20 minutes when I found out he called the police and reported me as a missing person. 

Every time I go home, my dad and I end up fighting. He yells as me for everything I ever do that he doesn’t like and tells me how he knows what’s best for me and how he didn’t raise me to be like this. Recently, he yelled at me for my boyfriend. My boyfriend is half middle eastern and half white, and my dad told me he was a Muslim (even though he isn’t, and I told him this multiple times). My dad told me that dating a Muslim was throwing away our family values and how I shouldn’t date him.

My mom isn’t as bad as my dad, but I feel like she goes along with him most of the time. My dad does not treat my mom well. My dad believes women should do all the housework and refuses to ever cook or clean. He tells me how my mom has mental problems, because she does not always do everything he wants. I feel like my dad has slowly made my mom start thinking like he does, and now she usually just goes along with what he says. But I really love my mom, and she’s great to talk to on her own. It’s just when my dad has weighed in on a situation that she starts to take his side.

I believed everything my dad told me for most of my life. When I got to college, I realized that other families were different and other students started telling me that my dad was emotionally abusive. But when he yells at me sometimes, I still find myself wondering if maybe he is right.

Now, as I’m nearing the end of college, my dad wants me to fly back home and stay there as I study for the MCAT (medical school entrance exam). I really don’t want to go home. I know I will just fight with my dad and I’ll be miserable, and I won’t be able to focus on my MCAT. I want to stay here, study for the MCAT with my boyfriend, spend time with my friends, have a research job for a year before medical school, and use the resources that are at my college to help me study. I have expressed this to my dad, but he says that he knows what’s best for me and he didn’t raise me this way, and that I am to come home immediately after graduation. 

The problem is, my older sister did not do what my parents wanted her to. She made decisions with her life that my parents are not happy about (my parents don’t like her husband or career choice), and my parents told me that they would never forgive my sister and refuse to speak to her again. Also, I feel like my dad brainwashes my other siblings into thinking like him, without them realizing it. My sister recently told me that she was worried I was ruining my life, because my parents told her I didn’t want to come home after graduation. After I explained the situation to her, she started to take my side. I am terrified of my parents cutting me out of their life and never talking to me again, and my siblings taking their side. I love my mom and I love my siblings and honestly, I still care about my dad. He’s paid for me growing up and he’s paid for my college and I don’t want to lose him completely. But I also don’t want to let him control me for my entire life. I really just don’t know what to do. I’d really appreciate any advice anyone could give me. Thanks again to anyone who read this far. I know this was a really long post. It means a lot.

tl;dr: my dad is controlling and wants me to come back home after I graduate. I don't want to, but I'm scared that if I don't do what he says, he will cut me out of his life.",30Mar2019,2
504,"So 2 of my best friends since high school (we're all in our mid twenties) had a falling out this January. One we'll call Caleb, and one we'll call Noah. Caleb also has a gf, so we'll call her Ariel.

Context: Caleb and Ariel have been dating for about a year now, and back in November they told me that they offered Noah a chance to have threesome since Noah is a virgin. They had a group chat where Ariel and Noah would send nudes to each other and such. Fast forward to mid December and Caleb and Ariel back out of the threesome for reasons unspecified. Noah is kinda sad, which is understandable.

Noah's birthday is the 30th of December so me and a bunch of close acquaintances we play DND with are all drinking. Caleb and Ariel are also there but go home early. The rest of us continue to get super drunk, and eventually Noah is the drunkest I've ever seen him. He spills the beans about attempted threesome (me already knowing from Caleb and Ariel telling me) in front of about 7 other people who were still there. I don't tell him anything about me already knowing.

On New year's Eve, noah, Caleb, Caleb's gf, and I were hanging at gf's house. Noah decides to go to the bathroom and I tell Caleb and Aurora what happened the previous night. Ariel went upstairs for the night, embarrassed whish is understandable. Caleb calls the night early we all go home.

The next morning, Noah tells me that he admitted to Caleb what happened and apologizes. Idk what else was said between them, but they haven't spoken in nearly 4 months now. I've been hanging out regularly with both groups on separate occasions and Caleb doesn't want to associate with me anymore since I've still been hanging out with Noah.

Problem: I want them to work it out, which probably isn't going to happen and I don't want to lose either as a friend.

Advice would be very much appreciated as to how to handle this stressful situation.

Tldr: Friend drunkenly admitted that other friend and gf offered him threesome, now other friend and gf hate him and want nothing to do with me if I keep hanging out with him.",30Mar2019,2

507,"\*\*PREFACE\*\*: Before you choose to start reading this, \*please don't judge me\*,

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to be posting on. I saw on r/AskReddit that you were not allowed to seek ""professional advice"" but I just wanted advice in general. Maybe I can copy and paste this to that subreddit if it doesn't work out here.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 25 year old male. 5'11, obese (270) but I hide it well. I passed high school (barely), and my community college that I chose to attend to became a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

• My grandfather got cancer. He chose not to tell us because he wanted to die. It killed me.

&amp;#x200B;

• I had issues with being gay, and my first boyfriend was very emotionally abusive. Saw my school's doctor and she gave me 2MG of clonazepam to take. It worked like a charm. No single SSRI / SNRI / MAOI worked for me. No bipolar medication. Not even lithium. The only thing I haven't tried is Wellbutrin. But I'm terrified of drugs like that now.

&amp;#x200B;

• I got tonsillitis, so I went to a doctor. I was seventeen at the time. He gave me antibiotics and a large prescription of hydrocodone. I didn't know what it was, so I assumed it was a strong Tylenol. I took it as it said and then became addicted to opioids. I was sick without them. Five years later, my life became lost to them. I lost that part of my life to opiates. I don't hate the drugs themselves, but I wish I was educated on them.

&amp;#x200B;

• Next, I went to a normal doctor. Not a primary, just a general practitioner. I told her I had anxiety and back pain (from a seizure I had during work: I fractured a part of my spine and every day was pain). She wrote me a prescription for 60 2MG Xanax and 60 10MG hydrocodone. I took it as it says on the bottle, and I then became dependent. I was able to ween myself off of the benzodiazepines, but I'm sure the anxiety I have now is from the extended use of them. I was on Klonopin for quite awhile. No withdrawal symptoms from that one, but Xanax became very deadly.

&amp;#x200B;

• I didn't know what to do. I had a seizure during work and lost my license for a year (the seizure came from Xanax withdrawal),  I wanted my life back, so I tried very damn hard. \*Very damn hard\*. And here I am. Barely finished high school, and my community college marks were TERRIBLE. The worst you could imagine. I took a lot of units, because I had high hopes to become a doctor one day. But I never was able to complete more than two classes (which I received fantastic marks for).

&amp;#x200B;

• I have a terrible community college history. Lots of F's and lots of failure to withdrawal. The entire time I was severely sick. I ended up getting cancer. I beat it, but then depression hit. And it hit HARD. I had no reason to wake up in the morning. I didn't have any sort of motivation. I became lethargic. Just TERRIBLE. I had a cancer charity stream and played League of Legends at the time. I thought it would help me feel better, but in the end I had lost my little fanbase and I felt even more lonely. I still want to stream and I still want to do what I love, but first I need to get my life together.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom doesn't know how to help me very well, since she's not in my shoes, but my father and grandmother believe in me very much so.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm using THC / CBD + kratom to keep myself abstinent from drugs. I'm still going through post-acute withdrawal symptom from the pain medications. Basically, for those who don't know, my brain is going insane. I cannot find fun in anything (even my favorite games are boring and dull), and I have lost all my physical strength from sitting in bed for a year because I had cancer. My muscles (what little I had to begin with) atrophied. \*And every single day is a battle.\* No cravings, but \*\*damn I wish I could feel relaxed\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not seeking medical advice, because I think I have it down with the THC / CBD + kratom. Kratom keeps my anxiety levels low and my depression low, but I'm still lethargic. The THC / CBD almost eliminates any pain and anxiety. The biggest issue is that I live in California. Any type of job that I want to get, I have to drug test. So it's a very big pain to find a company that doesn't.

&amp;#x200B;

To add insult to injury, my interview skills have gone to complete shit. I get nervous, my mouth gets dry, I begin to shake...I haven't had a job since I was 19. And now I just turned 25. Who wants to hire someone like that?

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? Where do I begin? Today, I made myself a promise, and I \*\*SWORE\*\* that I would go to the gym every single day, that I would eat a ketogenic diet (I've lost lots of weight with this before and it helped my mental health), I would go for walks, read books, meditate. Do more self-love. I've been taking showers every day instead of feeling like shit and laying in bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea what to do. Everyone in my life is passing me and I'm still stuck here. It's almost as if I've been \*afk\* for the last five-to-six years of my life. I still have my wits, the gift of the gab, but I'm now lagging behind everyone. I have no skills. My parents are some of the most successful real estate agents in Los Angeles, but I'm a failure compared to them. Not comparing myself to them actively, but you know what I mean.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go back to school, but my local community college hates me now. Can I go to a CSUN instead of my local one and have a fresh start? Does it work like that? I have very little knowledge of the education system, but I still have my desires and goals. I want to become a general practitioner. I know so much about medications because of my addiction. I can tell you which pathways that gabapentin uses, and what calcium channel it blocks and why. I can tell you why benzodiazepines with longer half-lives are better for tapering off alcohol. I can tell you all the differences between each blood pressure medication. I didn't just self-teach myself about the ""fun"" drugs, but I genuinely began to love each and every one. It's a passion of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to be a song writer, an actor (I was in the closet for 18 years, and I acted as straight as possible. I know for a fact I can act, and do it well.) In high school, I was offered to join the debate team freshman year because of the speeches I gave during English class. I directed several music videos and learned so much about video editing. I'm not a special butterfly, but I tried. I tried very hard back then. I lost my spark, and here I am trying to use match after match to see if I can light it up again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry. This was long and unnecessary. Thank you for reading this if you've gotten this far.

&amp;#x200B;

Life hurts. Waking up gives me anxiety. Going to the grocery store gives me anxiety. I'm so very well-composed in public, but deep down it feels like I'm dying.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

(And yes, I am visiting a therapist very soon; a normal one or a CBT therapist.)

511,"This is really embarrassing. I'm almost 25 and crushing really hard on a guy in my graduate program.

I've  tried to stop myself by thinking of how ugly &amp; disgusting I am, and  how there is no way he likes me, but that just made me cry. This is  really unhealthy behavior but what else can I do??

What  makes it worse is I haven't even talked to him enough for me to feel  this way. But I feel like we'd be really good together? It's just a  fantasy though. Unfortunately, a nice comment from one of my best  friends actually made things worse. I've only seen him a few times &amp;  all of my discussions with him were pretty much along with her. At the  end of one of our conversations- she was like oh he definitely likes  you. I pretended like i was confused.. and was like there is no way lol.  but she was like how he never talks to her but went out of his way to  talk to us &amp; she felt a 'vibe'.

anyways,  i'm a really clueless person -  have never even held hands with a guy  so I felt she might have been imagining things. like , yes it was really  easy to talk to him which is why i have a crush on him. but it was easy  to talk to him because we share the same ethnicity which is really rare  in this program.  she also might have sensed that i liked him &amp; was  trying to be nice or something?

but  ever since her comment i can't stop thinking about this guy which am  sure never thinks about me or even sees me in that way because of how  ugly i am. i just want to stop this crush before i do something stupid  because honestly he could be a good friend or at least networking  contact in the future.

i want to stop  crushing on him (in a healthy way) because it's affecting the way i  interact with him. before i could say hi to him simply but now.. i saw  him yesterday from a close distance &amp; just ignored him &amp;  pretended i didn't see him because i felt so disgusting.. like i wasn't  even good enough to say hi to him/ but if i didn't have a crush on him,  regardless of how attractive a person is, i could always say hi &amp;  have normal conversations. but i get so flustered around him.. it's  pathetic at my big age of 24.  help? anyone go through something  similar?

 I was in told by the hiring manager who reached out to me that he wants to move on at the hiring process and wants to get me in for the final interview the following week when the assistant manager gets back in town from a business trip. That was the beginning of this week.

 I reached out to him Tuesday asking if he had any updates in which he responded you still waiting to hear back from the managers.

521,"He said I make him feel like the boss because he can mentor me in life cause I need help. Cause I listen to him and don’t question him hardly. Cause I go with the flow with what he wants. They dated for seven years. He said he feels superior to me intelligence wise and career wise. 

He said she is too smart, too quick, and challenges him too much physically, emotionally, and intellectually. He tells her I have emotional problems and need someone there cause I’m fragile. That he’s giving me a shot and if we don’t workout (which he told her he doesn’t think we will) at least he made me a better person. He told her his life is perfect except his relationship with me causes him angst at times. 

She’s super independent and travels alone and works out and has a good job and is a fitness model in addition to being a doctor and she was a college athlete and was an honors student. I just slid by in school, hate working out, and got a job in sales.

I snooped on his phone cause she kept calling him and realized a few things after reading their convos and our talks about her in the past. 

 I think he made his ex into a dependent person and she ended up getting fed up with it and left him when she realized she could be a complete and independent person on her own.

Yeah. Apparently when they met she had just moved to their city and had no friends. She only had him to hangout with for a few years while she stayed at home and went to community college which he was embarrassed to tell people about. He wouldn’t hang with her family and made excuses to leave because they made him feel weird. They only hung with his family and she loved them so she abandoned hers for his because he never seemed excited to be with her family. She then went to a top university and found a close group of friends and he alienated himself from her. She then became a much better person and was involved in her school, picked up extra jobs (he never worked in college), did her AND his schoolwork so he could pass, and she graduated as an honors student from a top 30 university and got a job with a promising future and made more money than him. He cheated and blamed her for her being too controlling which is why he said he cheated but begged for her back when the new girl left him. He used to prevent her from leaving the house when they fought and also would stalk her location on her phone when they broke up so he could creep on what she was doing and would even secretly hide at places and watch her do stuff when she hung with her friends. She said she wishes she could record their convos because he always denied what he said previously if it didn’t currently benefit him and apologized for her feelings instead of his actions that caused those feelings. She thought all this shitty behavior was due to him being young. 

He now tells her he admires her independence and how she always tries to be her best yet says he loves how I make him feel he is the man cause I am inferior in all ways compared to her and don’t really fight back and I do as he says. He also says he isn’t excited about our future together but is giving me a chance. We have dated 1 year 

He once told her that he can have his pick of the litter cause “i am a college athlete, I have a nice car, live in a high rise, and owns a company (he works for his moms company)”

Also, why won’t he date her if she’s that cool and wants to date him. She feels she ruined the relationship and learned to just submit to what he says because if not he will deny everything she says and make her feel she is crazy and is the problem so therefore she thinks she causes him to act in certain ways and if she was better he would treat her better. 

WHY WONT HE LEAVE ME IF HE THINKS SO POORLY OF ME ? He is so nice to my face and has never said any of this to my face. He always supports me and encourages me to be my best. But he told her I’m the only source of angst in his life. That he’s going to figure out where our relationship should go soon. That he’s not optimistic about our future, yet he told her the same damn thing about a year ago and look. We’re still dating. I think he’s just trying to prevent her from having a nervous breakdown. 

Edit: I reached out to the ex today and literally he would tell her she was so annoying and stressful and was ruining his life so she said okay bye then and he would get so mad and say why is that your default response to issues we have? And she told him it’s because he didn’t seem happy and she wasn’t going to make someone he with her. And he would get upset and ask her to not leave when he literally just told her he was miserable with her

523,"I have a lot of problems but I have no idea what to do about them. 

- My mom says a lot of hurtful things to me and about me behind my back. Seriously awful things like, no one loves you, no one would ever want to be friends with someone like you, no man would ever want to be with you etc. 

- I was bullied really badly in the past by girls I was friends with and I can’t get over it. I hate that they are living their lives peacefully while I’m still stuck on them bullying me. I’ve seen a counsellor but they offered no real advice. 

- I want to succeed academically but I’m struggling to concentrate because of the problems I’ve mentioned. 

- I experienced lots of racism here and I reported it but wasn’t believed because the people involved denied all of it and I was made to look like a liar. I’m afraid that I might experience racism again and I don’t know what to do.

I meet some people who were interested in similar subjects as K, so i decided to give them her username so they could chat. Not too long after, i recieved several messages from her basically flaming the shit out of me (calling me autistic, a retard, etc.) And honestly, it got me down in the dumps. I felt like shit. Was it wrong of me to give out her username without permission? ",30Mar2019,0
525,"Just a pre apology for the length but I really need advice. 

Okay so. Me and my friend, let’s call her T. We started being best friends in 7th grade. Did EVRYTHING together for years. Spent literally every day together, I’ve done so much for her- and been through so much together and been there with her through so much. 

Fast forward we’re now both 21. Her &amp; her boyfriend decided to move out of their aunts house and I became involved in moving in with them and finding a house together. I had doubts about moving out with them. ( no we all didn’t live together already. They lived with her boyfriends aunt. I was just gonna move out of my dads with them) but they told me it didn’t matter they were moving EITHER WAY ( this is important) SO we find a town house we all like and we get approved. We all 3 sign the lease. A month in, my car of 5 years breaks down. I have 2 jobs- both of which were 40 minutes away from where we were living. Hard as fuck to get to one job- but then I’d have to go from my morning job to my night job and it was still hard to find a ride just to my other job then of course home at the end of the night. Ubering every where every single day would be way too expensive on top of paying rent and shit and having to save for a new car. So In mybest interest, I felt like I had no other option but to move back in with my dad. ( 10 min away from work, he doesn’t work and lives w my grandma and she doesn’t work so could always give me rides ) so I could live rent free and be able to save up for a car- I’m 21- 2 jobs. I NEED a car. I didn’t leave in a bad way. I told them my situation and that I felt like I had no other option and that would be the most responsible thing. How could I live paying 700$ rent and ubering to work - how could I save up for a car??? And then when I moved out she stopped talking to me. She cut me out and just started being mean. I don’t understand honestly- yeah I’m on the lease- but I paid my rent when I was there, and they said they were moving either way. 

Now it’s been months since I moved out, probably like 7 months- when ever I post a story on Instagram asking who wants to hangout- she will post a story right after saying someone should hangout with her. I posted a tweet saying I wish I had girlfriends to go on fun trips like to ocean city with in the summer and she favorited it. I retweeted something saying no one hates on you like a bitch who used to be your friend and she favorited it. It’s petty and stupid - I know. But I miss her I really do. And is she trying to hint the same? Do I apologize and say I hope we can be friends and tel her I miss her? She was literally my best fucking friend. I’m scared for her to reject me or ignore me but I really miss her. Did I even do anything wrong? What do I do? Should I reach out to her? ",30Mar2019,4

527,"Background: I'm 17 M, Highschooler, Junior about to be Senior.

About five days ago my mother scolded me for being irresponsible, saying how I don't do anything other then just sit around and laze way. She's scolded me multiple times, for different reasons, but it was this one in particular that kept me thinking. I woke up late and rushed to get dressed and eat breakfast then my mom sat down with me and scolded me again but in a calm manner, then asked me ""What are you gonna be doing when I die?"" I froze up when she said that and I couldn't help but tear up at it. 

She then continued and started saying how she wants better for me, how she wants me to to be the one that goes to college or university and live a good life not living the way that we're currently living, being in debt all the time. She also mentioned how I should start worrying about my health and that I should start losing weight and such. After that I went to school and for the entire day I wanted to.

I hate myself for always being like this and doing nothing about it. I don't even have an excuse for being the way I am. I don't know how to change myself and be better. I've had times too were I'd ask myself why I'm like this, why don't I even bother to be productive.

529,"This is a long one! Sorry

For about two and a half years, I worked at a dog daycare. Many of you will probably be thinking you are jealous of me. It was not a fun job. It made me sick of dogs sometimes. It had its good times, and good dogs, but my boss especially made it grueling. So many rules to abide by- like no dog barking. Ever tried to make 120 dogs stop barking all day? Not fun. Ultimately, the place stressed me out, but I felt secure there and it paid well and I was friends with everyone. My boss was even very nice to me on most occasions, but I was fired.

I was fired because she claimed I was “mistreating dogs” aka abusing them. I was using tools i was taught in the 2 1/2 years I was there by mentors who had since been fired. I was never retrained, so all I knew was the crappy way they taught me to lead packs of 40 dogs that tried to fight and get too rowdy. I still stand by my word that what I did wasn’t over the top. It was clear from the video that I was irritated, but it was completely understandable. She was scared because it was on video and somebody wanted to see the footage for a completely unrelated reason. It wasn’t that she didn’t agree with my actions, it was that she didn’t want a bad rep on her business. Fair enough, I guess, but people had been doing what I did forever. And they still do now.
I was completely unaware that she saw it and pulled me into a meeting, which she made one of my very close friends (who was higher up than me, though not by much) sit in on. This is one way she treated me wrongly. She knew how close we were. He was completely uncomfortable and our friendship has since been thin. She tried to fire me, and I explained to her that although I was clearly angry the things I did weren’t wrong and I wasn’t taught any different. The meeting ended with her giving me a week to “sort out my feelings” and decide if i wanted to quit or if I wanted to try to find a way around my “anger issues” and come back for training and such. She did not want to fire me, I could tell and she even said it. She cried part of the meeting.

A week passes and I am a wreck the whole time. I have anxiety that doesn’t really spike much but for unexpected things like this (along with a whole fucking week to panic), I was completely messed up. She was actually pretty close to me and knew this about me. However, I appreciated that she gave me the chance to think about it. I went back and forth with my decision, and came to the conclusion that I was done. That place made me angry because I was forced to take on positions I didn’t like (I was actually the A+ groomer there, so I didn’t even like being outside with groups. But I often was). The last day my mother met with her therapist, and they often end up talking about me. After everything that happened that week, of course it came up. My moms therapist is a very bright woman and truly amazing at her job, but she said I was running away from the problem and recommended I try to go back. I call my boss on the 7th day and say I’ll try to come back. She tells me she changed her mind and fires me.

At this point I would like to add that my boyfriend also works here, and he is actually her right-hand man. She told him the day before I got called into the meeting that it was going to happen. He didn’t tell me, because he thought I wouldn’t be able to hide it and he’d end up in trouble too. This caused a lot of issues between us. The day I called her back, she told me she was waiting to tell me I was fired until she told my boyfriend first. Because that’s right, right?

Anyways, this happened about a year ago. I took two seasonal jobs last year and they ended in January. I’m a college student and have since been living off of tax returns and student refunds from my scholarships. I am not desperate for a job, but looking, as finances stress me out immensely and I would rather save all of my returns for the future.

A couple days ago she offered for my boyfriend to come take a look at her new business, and said I was welcome to come too. Of course, it was a no. The whole situation completely destroyed me for months. I ultimately feel she betrayed me with the whole changing her mind thing. I wish she had just fired me from the start. Today she texts me out of nowhere and offers me a one day gig with the groomer at the company to do some prep work like giving baths and such. She says she is not sure how I feel about her or the company right now but thought of me and wanted to offer. I am assuming that, since she invited me to her other company a few days ago, she is having thoughts about me and either feeling bad or regretting it. I immediately break down and cry for a half hour. The fact that this happened a year ago and still pains me this much is crazy. I talk to my mom about it and, although I could use the money, decide that it’s just not worth the emotional turmoil I would have to go through.

I text her back- and for the first time since i got fired, i tell her how bad she hurt me. On a boss/employee level, I can understand why I was fired completely. The fact that she let me go through a week of absolute suffering, got my boyfriend involved and threatens to fire him if he told me, and then changed her mind last minute is why I was and am so hurt about how it played out (also, it was completely unprofessional of her). She treated me and everyone there as more than an employee. She adored me, honestly, and we had a good relationship. She never had kids and that often reflected on her relationship with us.

Anyways, I told her that I appreciated that she thought of me and remembered how much I loved grooming, but that it wasn’t worth the emotional turmoil or being watched like a hawk by my friends or facing her. I told her I still have lots of feelings about how it all played out and most of those feelings came from the betrayal just between her and I. Unfortunately, I wanted the job and still do. But I know the day would be miserable for me, as I would be seeing all my friends (who know what happened), be watched by them and probably have to go through a whole conversation about how I will behave. Just for a one day gig. She responded with an “I understand, thank you for being honest with me and responding.” I want an apology, really. That is her only hope of me ever speaking to her again. Of course I am ashamed of what I did, even if I didn’t really know better, which is another reason I have trouble talking to her. But it is a small portion.

Ultimately, I just want to know your thoughts on this. Am I a wimp for not taking it? Is she in the wrong or am I? Do you think she’s having doubt about what she did? How do I get over this when my closest friends are still working there? And did I handle it ok?

To be clear, I wasn’t kicking or hitting dogs. It was things like shaking a loud thing in their face and poking them with it (which we were literally taught to do) to keep them from the door so they didn’t get or if the yard, or pulling a dog to me to pet her. She took it all out of proportion, and I really hope I don’t get hate on that as I have already dealt with if for a year and that’s not the purpose of the post. Thanks for reading!",30Mar2019,1

I met him a couple weeks ago, he seemed like he changed. He was just his self and spoke what had to be spoken.  


But while we met a couple days ago he purposely spoke to only the other friend. The other friend spoke to me, but the person who invited me never did and kept trying to converse only with him. I bring this up and he humiliates me.

Ok the situation is very simple, I used to have a female friend (I am a male), and we had a long fight, I begged to her to make things right I even bought her a wedding gift and she thanked me for the gift. However in the message where she thanked me for the gift. She started with the sentence ""I hope this is the last time we talk in this lifetime"" (not exactly this, but this is a translation so I'm translating the meaning and not the words, she also said she bears no grudge at me and she is breaking away from a lot of people from her past. She wished me a good life, and warned me  if I ever contacted her again she would take measures. Also this specific person has been telling common friends I've been stalking her and she was afraid, and I don't stalk her, in fact I spent years without hearing a word about her. She also accused me of involving her family in our matters, she lives with her parents and I sent her wedding gift to her since she has not another house, this isn't involving, we're both almost 30, and nobody opens my mail at my home. She isn't the ""smartest tool in the shed"" as Smash Mouth would say, and you will see it in a moment. I always tried to be her friend and help her although it wasn't reciprocal, and I'm always worrying about her. Nonetheless, after so many years I've asked her not to talk to me anymore and not to say bullshit about me to our common friends. This happened 4 months ago

&amp;#x200B;

I worry a lot about her, she is going to marry this year. Yesterday, a common acquaintance of ours came to me with alarming news, she has an account on reddit, which has the same name of an account she has in a very famous social networks, where she has more than 900 followers. But I'm not quite sure she understands the mechanics in reddit, because in the same account she is posting photos of her face (normal photos) and photos of her in panties (with no bra) or completely naked with the face blurred. These are all posted with a few comments/posts of difference and you could see it all just by looking at her profile, but I'm not quite sure she understands everybody this, I think she must be thinking the feed isn't public.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is, she stated VERY CLEARLY she wants nothing to do with me, she threatened with police and lawyers, she told horrible things about me, everybody tells me I shouldn't mess with this situation and I agree, but I don't want to see her in revenge porn, or being socially shamed, or even worse. Eventually, someone is going to put 2+2 together, and she will be harassed. Should I risk myself and tell her about this situation, knowing she will blame me (in this case she won't have a lot of trouble), should I ignore it and let it be? Or should I tell to one of our common friends? What should I do?

Partly trying to figure out if I’m an asshole, partly a dumb girl trying to weigh the pros and cons of a love triangle because it’s easier to sort through if I type it out through I DEEPLY appreciate advice on either. 

Army boy and I have clarified that we’re only romantically interested in each other and want to give things another try when he gets back. If we take romantic interest in anyone else, we’ll let the other one know. We’re completely fine with us sleeping with other people in the meantime since he’s stationed so far. He knows about my fwb. He doesn’t know that I like him because I still like him more. If I end up only wanting my fwb then I’ll let him know bc it would be weird to tell army boy and then it doesn’t work out with my fwb.

My fwb knows I intend to get back with army boy. But my fwb and I legit talk on the phone all night (he works nights so easy for him) and time passes by like it’s nothing. So of course we have feelings for each other. But he’s super unstable, like financially, somewhat emotionally, and he’s been off of opiates, weed and alcohol for a little over a month. He recognizes this but has told me that he would make me his girlfriend when his shit’s more together if I was down.

I feel like an asshole bc my fwb is having to not allow himself to be attached. “I’m an adult, I’ll get over it.” But we still talk on the phone all night and I’ll still tell him I like him occasionally. Usually when I get close to falling asleep. He knows I have stronger feelings for army boy though.

My fwb completely gets me and I could never get tired of talking to him, I adore him but he can be kind of an asshole and has A LOT of baggage right now. Army boy and I don’t operate on the same wavelength *at all* but he’s WAY more stable and we still feel drawn to each other in this weird primal way. He doesn’t get me as much though, and I don’t get him as much either I don’t think. We’d have to learn each other. Still feel strongly toward each other now though.

535,"My first year in university was good because I lived on campus so I could always hang with people. But for my second year, 3 friends and I moved off campus and they are pretty much the only people I hang out with now. Our area is pretty small, citys got a population of about 100k and the school has 8k students. So even when we want to go do something we cant really find much, even the school clubs rarely host activities, it’s pretty dead. The best I found was one club that interests me hosts a documentary night once a month. 


On the flip side, the school is really good education wise. I talked to my friends about this and they said they like how dead it is because they can focus on school. Which is valid, I have better grades now than I did throughout all of high school and profs are very accessible. 


But im also the most lonely and unhappy I’ve ever been in my whole life. I feel like moving in this house has trapped me in a box because I barely leave. For my whole second year of school I have literally only hung out with my 1 group of friends. Sometimes we go to another friends house but even then its the same thing, we just sit around and drink. 


So Im seriously considering transferring to a bigger school in a bigger city. Before I do i’ll join an intramural sports team and volunteer but if that doesnt help is it reasonable to transfer schools? Im pretty concerned tho that transferring will just make my problems worse because it will cause stress just from the logistical sense of transferring courses and actually moving, and there’s also the possibility I become even lonelier at a new school because im leaving behind the only close friends I have. But I also don’t want to suffer now and think to myself “i just need to get my degree, then I can finally move out of here” I want to be happy now. Anyone have any advice for me or share their experience transferring schools? Thanks. 


Tldr: I don’t have many friends and my area is pretty small, not much really goes on. I want to move to a larger school in a larger city but scared I will keep my problems, just be in a new city. But I also don’t want to suffer now and wait to graduate just so I can finally move.

541,"so, i didn't know what to put this as since she isn't family yet, nor is she really wanting to associate with me.



as you guessed, i'm(26)dating her son(24), and i've tried to extend olive branch after olive branch, and she has taken it, and whacked me in the face with it, time after time.


i've brought food for the family; i've always included them in every planning and they bit my head off for it. they're raising their granddaughter because their daughter(30-40) is a shit of a person. the granddaughter is spoiled and then-some. i have tried to extend an olive branch to her, too, and she does the same thing because she sees her grandparents do that to me.

my fiancé gets really defensive and upset with them(it's also his dad doing this too...), and i've been trying to get them to like me a little bit at least. anywho my question is: *what the fuck do i do?* we're trying to move out but his mom somehow has tabs on his account(which is a joint account(it's just me and him); i have a card and can see what's going on in the account to but never use my card)!? she is greedy with everything. if she includes me or not. i'll get dressed and get ready just in case she does something. i want to help her, but she's really difficult. i help out in every way i can.


recently, she has said that she doesn't want me around and my fiancé has been trying to get a place of our own. solely because of her. she can be nice, but she can be a b*tch. i have done everything in my power. i'm honestly done with even trying to get on her good side because she will turn on you anyway. i have had it with her.


she didn't even tell me that i needed to move my car(street cleaning), and i got a ticket for $73...

546,"Ok, so this has been happening a long time now, pretty much ever since I started getting older from I dunno, baby years. 

My dad is usually pretty chill but whenever he gets angry, he gets *angry*. I get verbally abused, and he guilt-trips me over how much he thinks that ""I need him"" and how I'm supposed to constantly show my affection towards him (in a familial way of course not sexual) like he wants me to constantly assure him that I love him.

About a month ago, I invited some of my friends over to my house, and being 2019, they were all gay. I thought it was going to be a good time, we hung out, ate ramen, played some video games, and all in all, I thought my dad was fine with them coming over. They are all very polite and nice people.

However, flash forward a week later, out of nowhere my dad comes at me and starts this really confrontational conversation. (D-dad M-me)
D: OP, I need to talk to you about something that has been making my heart hurt so much.
M: Me being the person with common sense, ""Ok, what is it?""
D: Are your friends gay?
M: Yeah, why?
D: I don't want you to hang out with gay people anymore.
M: Why?
D: It will give you a bad reputation. If you hang out with gay people, then other people will think you are gay.
M: Does that matter?
D: You need to stop hanging out with them. I don't want to see you driving them around or seeing them anymore. Period.
M: What's wrong with seeing my friends?
D: LISTEN I DON'T WANT YOU TO HANG OUT WITH THOSE (the derogatory f word for homosexuals) ANYMORE. I WANT YOU TO START ACTING LIKE A LADY AND WEAR DRESSES.
M: Why does it matter if the people I hang out with are gay or not. It's 2019. Literrally I have gay teachers. Their sexualities don't change the kind of person I am. (This is where I basically start breaking down because I was totally unprepared for this conversation, as I was about to go on my Spring Break vacation)

My dad keeps going on about this stuff trying to prove his point, he even says that I can't go to prom unless I get a boyfriend? (This is the most questionable part because literally I thought that my dad was supposed to be anti-relationship because thats what he has been doing for like my entire life). He then guilt trips me over how much I will break his heart like for example ""what are you going to do if I die of a heart attack because of you"" and the like. 

After this, he then said that he forgives me for some reason even though I didn't do anything wrong that time. He's all like ""I want you to grow up to be successful and have a family"" and stuff.

Every time I get in ""trouble"" I hear this same spiel with a few variations.

Today he threatened me saying ""tell me if you don't want a father."" And of course he ended up ""forgiving"" me after him yelling at me. I really don't like how this makes me feel emotionally

What should I do?

(also keep in mind that I am in high school with a perfect GPA, I don't do drugs, don't have a boyfriend, and am in challenging courses. I feel that my dad shouldn't say that I should focus on school more(threatened to take away my video games, which I use to destress from everything) even though when he was in high school, he ditched school a lot...)

We kept talking about it and said that a DNA test should be the right thing to do.
For context, my mom is light brown skin and my dad is the same. My sister and I are both light brown, but, my brother is white and has blue eyes. I know that this isn’t a big proof since we do have family on both sides that are white and some of them do have blue eyes. The thing is that since birth of him my dad was bombarded with people saying that my brother wasn’t his child but he ignored it. Now, he asked me about the DNA testing and information about it, but, he’s interested in actually do it.

552,"I went to my doctor because I had a uti. She prescribed antibiotics, but as the day progressed my symptoms grew worse before I could start the medication. I started getting blood in my urine, back pain and nausea. 

It sounded like it progressed to a kidney infection so the next day I called the doctors office and told them about the changes and asked if they would still recommend the same course of antibiotics. 

The receptionist spoke the doctor and told me that if I get worse over the weekend to go to an urgent care. And that I should come back on Monday. (My initial appointment was Thursday late afternoon.) I told them I really couldn’t afford another copay and the girl goes “so do you think you won’t be coming in then?”

The receptionist had also scheduled me for a different time then I was told over the phone for my first appointment. So when I showed up they were double booked and kind of rushed me. O saw the doctor for maybe 2 minutes. I did no urine analysis. It seems ridiculous that I would have to pay to be seen again. 

I’m torn because I LOVE this doctor. She has helped me in ways no one has been able to. 

Long story short, do you think they should still require me to pay the copay? And if I’m feeling better should I even bother going back? I just worry that I am not on a strong enough antibiotic because of all the changes I had since my intial visit and don’t want any long term complications. 

TL;DR
I went to the doctor for a uti. They did no testing and had accidentally double booked my appointment so it was a rushed visit. Before I could start the antibiotics I started having symptoms of a kidney infection. The doctor wants me to return on Monday AND pay another copay. I really like this doctor and plan on continuing using her, but do you think I should have to pay for another appointment when I called the day after my original visit for my concerns?",30Mar2019,1

Well, this is lovely.

So a good friend of mine has this friend who is all over him. Him and her got close really fast, then she admitted to having feelings for him. He (tried?) telling her he doesn't feel the same, and she ended up guilt tripping him and threatening suicide. Come later, they spend time together, and she forces a kiss off of him after physically restraining him, while continuing to flirt with him and tell him how much she likes him. After some time, my friend blocks her, but he unblocks her down the road, I don't know why. I think it is because of them seeing each other irl. She invites herself over to his house, or my friend ends up having a guest tell her about his hangout or whatever. Whenever he hangs out with his friends, she's there because they have mutual friends. Now, she forces kisses, pretends to be ""sorry"" for all she has done, forces hugs, hand holding, etc. If my friend uses force, she gets mad and upset. When people ask him if she's his gf, the girl says yes.

Oh right, about the friends. So according to him, his friends know about what happened between them---manipulation, guilt tripping, forced affection--and they still support her. The closest thing he gets is ""I think you both are equally good people and are both at fault"". So I don't think he's going to get any support from his friends. 

I asked him if he's asked her to stop kissing him, and he said yeah but she doesn't listen. She keeps giving fake apologies and stuff.

587,"Title basically says it. 

I got out of a relationship recently, for good reason. But I miss her more than anything. I've realised how shitty I treated her, and how controlling she was towards me. It hurts because I love her more than anyone in the past. It feels like losing a part of me. She was literally everything to me. 

I was fine for the last 4 weeks, and then all of a sudden today it's just hitting me like an 18 wheeler.

*before i carry on, I’m not claiming to have any mental health issues or problems, I’m just asking for advice*
-
so recently, ever since my dog put down 43 days ago, I’ve been more sad and angry. It’s not as severe as anyone else, but I’ve been crying more,  I’ve started uncontrollably crying at school, isolating myself more from others (family and friends included) and I’ve kept everything bottled up inside me, and started to feel less highly of myself. My self esteem has dropped massively, and i kinda just want to stop existing (I’m not suicidal). Also I’ve become more angry and aggressive, like I’ve been pushing my friends away, threatening people, raising my voice at people and even being physical with people; for example on Friday, i got so mad at my best friend that i slapped her hard on the arm to the point there was a dark red mark on her arm (I am not at all proud of this.) I know it’s toxic and she didn’t do anything wrong, but what should i do? Should I leave my emotions, talk to someone, see a doctor, ect?

591,"Really long post, hope you got the time.

Ok, so my family is an bunch of sociopaths and drunks, my dad and mother argue constantly, mostly because my dad thinks my mom is cheating on him. Dad worked abroad for a couple of months and at this time mom asked me numerus questions how to send sms's, how to send pictures via mms etc. And she started acting really weird recently, like using her phone for 2+ hours typing or hiding when shes checking the phone, so I knew something was up. Around this time she asked me how to check if someone saw the photo she sended, I checked it with my phone and fair enough it didnt work, so I checked her other messages to see if those pics arrived (theres √ symbol next to the pic if the other person got the message) and guess what? A boob pic, my mom's boob pic! I lost my apetite for a whole damn day after seeing that. She claimed that she wanted to send this pic to my dad but accidently sended it to her friend (she was in our house couple of times, they work together), the contact had a female name but something seemed off. 

The creppy part is that Ive asked her why would she send a nude pic, and she anwsered with a smile ""Dad wanted to remember the old times"" this might seem like nothing now but read on.

Recently there was a huge fight between my parents because they got drunk (like every weekend) and there was a moment Ive asked my mom if shes cheating on my dad, she of course acted offended etc. But she paused of a second when I said ""I mean, you type a lot recently, and its not that hard to name a contact Jessica or such while you are really typing to some guy"" at this moment I started wondering if she really does cheat on my dad. 

Around 1-2 hours ago my brother came to my room to chat, we talked for an hour or so and while we were talking about partents fighting I told him about the boob pic and that Im not buying it. We decided to steal mom's phone and check her sm's, she of course deleted it, maybe because I confronted her about cheating or because dad was checking her phone. Anyway, my brother have second number hes using for job-related stuff so we used it, we called the number (Lets call it Jessica) and suprise suprise, the voice mail wasnt Jessica, it was someone named George, he also had voice of an older guy. 

Ok, so do you remember the part about ""old times""? Mom was in a relationship with some George in her younger years but she broke up with him and married my dad. My grandma told me once that when my brother was little she spyed on her, instead going to work like she said shes going to (it was early in the morning), she saw my mom with some guy hugging and then going to restaurant, she of course said that it was work related but at this hour, and wearing a dress? 

The thing that creeps me out the most is that I dont really look like my father, and both me and my brother weren't planned so I really dont want to end up discovering that my dad is not really my dad. 

Our plan so far is this:
 Im gonna check her phone from time to time because we need evidence, my grandma knows more details about this guy so if we get the full name we can contact some of my brother's friends that work in the police. He could have a car accident or something so they might know his phone number and adress. [OK, update. We know the guy's name and the number matches, maybe we could find the adress]. The guy sounded old in voicemail so he probably has a wife, we gonna do a little spying on him and mom, get some pics and evidence and contact his wife OR blackmail him and tell him to stay away from our mom (Im not sure if my brother will keep his hands to himself but I cant blame him), while I will appoint my parents for marriage counseling to fix their shitty marriage, maybe even make them go to AA meetings. If their marriage will start improving + the lover will suddently stop replying MAYBE there will finally be peace in our little dysfuncional family :). 

Anybody have any ideas how to gather more evidence? Im open for suggestions!",30Mar2019,5

I sent a few normal funny pictures but she seemed to want something more so i sent a pic of me flexing my abs shirtless trying to impress. She too sent a pic of here face (as a normal snap with the red box you click) which i believed to make her a legit person. We kept talking and she wanted more pics of my abs which i did. Things started heating up and she suggested we share nude pictures. I stupidly followed along because I was excited never having done this kind of thing before. I sent a pic in my boxers first so not to jump the gun and she sent a close up pic of her vagina. Which i took to thinking “its my turn now”. I sent a pic of my lower half nude to which she replied “let me see your face again”. At this point i knew something fishy was going on and asked why but she just told me to send it. Me with my excitement couldnt resist (stupidly enough looking back) and she saved them in chat i think and immediately unfriended.

598,"Hey all here’s a summary I was hired out of state as an RN early February. I informed management many times I had sent for my license to be verified but the process may take up to 4 months. Management verbally said it’s fine so I relocated for this job. Fast forward to last Thursday, management calls my cell phone telling me I have to cease all work and not interact with patients. I am still allowed to clock in just not “work”. The entire team is notified. The next day, HR calls me to the office saying I’m fired effective immediately. I explain to HR how I moved states for this job, etc. HR then meets with the VP of nursing and director and hospital’s main HR. Two hours after, they tell me I’m suspended without pay until my license is verified. In the mean time, there will be an investigation launched as they’re treating this as a sentinal event. They end the meeting by saying I need to call the board of nursing confessing I practiced without a license and I need to be removed from the campus.
So now I’m here, shocked, reviewing the past 48 hours. I can’t stop thinking how much of an idiot I am for working while being processed for verification.

601,"Okay, I know the title is probably going to irritate tons of people, and I'm sorry if it does, this situation is probably really cliche but I've never really felt as affected as before.

So I met a guy, and we texted for a while. I started liking him, and we sort of got into this situation where we ""confessed"" that we liked each other. Little did I know, he never did. We were sending ""x's"" for three days, until I confronted him, because my insecurities were getting the better of me.

He said that he didn't like me, and that the only reason he said he did was to not hurt me, and to fill a hole for the previous girl who he sent ""x's"" to, basically - he led me on.

I got angry, and told him how he shouldn't have done what he did, and he apologised. We're friends now, but I still like him even after what he's done. He said he wanted to stay friends, and I didn't have the heart to block him. 

It's just, I get upset over nothing, to be honest. Like he likes a girl right now, and we were on houseparty, but he logged out for some reason - I told him to go back on but he said he wasn't bothered to log back in, but when the girl he liked started spamming him to log back in, he did it immediately. I get people do everything for their crushes, but I kind of got offended since he told me to get houseparty in the first place. 

I always wonder what it would be like if I didn't confront him, or if I just let things be. I still like him and it annoys me how I still do. I have to watch him get all gushy over a girl, and I'm always thinking ""if only I were her""

I don't know what to do, anymore. I want to be his friend but i want to get over him as well. He still wants to be friends, and we text as usual like before ( we even have the red heart on snapchat, which is apparently really hard to get, haha )

602,"So, everything begun march last year, I was 16 and living with my older sister in the big city for education (I still do), while my parents live in the country side. Well, I'm a lesbian, and I had a fling with this classmate who ended up telling her parents, who contacted my parents. My parents are almost 60 years old, they've lived in small cities in Brazil their whole life, so you can imagine how little they think of gay people.
At first I thought they'd bring me back to my hometown, they even threatened of kicking me out, but the logistics of my life didn't really change, I still study at the same posh school and even live by myself in the big city now because my sister got married and moved out. When that happened I got depressed, my grades dropped, I'd sleep through days, I'd cry for ages, most of my friends drifted away from me... I heard pretty mean things from my parents, mostly my mom who even told me that she'd rather die slowly of cancer than have a gay child. Well, when the hurricane passed, we stopped talking about it. And it was good for me because I could pretend like it never happened.
Well, I have a therapist who's being with me even before that happened, and now and then, my mom gets to talk to her. 
I feel like my mom doesn't love me anymore like she used to: her voice's different, the way she looks at me is different, she's always crying, she's always sad and miserable. Last week she went to talk to my therapist, and she (the therapist) told me (like she always does, and my mom knows), that my mom is overall ashamed of me. Today I received a text from an old childhood friend who told me that my mom ran into her mom in our hometown, and as they started to talk, my mom broke down and started to cry. 
I can't handle being the cause of my own mom's sadness anymore, the guilt is killing me! It's been a whole year! Weren't things supposed to be better now? Everyone said it would, but it's not!
My therapist doesn't help me, because as much as I appreciate her doing everything she can to help me, she's so realistic and I don't find peace in her words, only more guilt.
I'm afraid to talk about it more with the friends who are still with me, because last year I spent almost a whole semester crying in their arms, and they were basically the only people keeping me from killing myself.
My sister empathizes with my mom, and I can't find peace with her either.

609,"Sorry for the rant. Thanks to anyone who can help. 

A friend owes me $350.00 from OCTOBER. I have been fairly nice about it, and have given her two extensions, but I still haven’t received 1 cent and I am starting to feel angry (hurt). Each time I bring it up she says “oh I have rent to pay, or car tags” etc.  HEY. I have bills, too!   

&amp;#x200B;

I drive a nice car (nothing crazy) and I think she thinks because I drive this “nice car” that I must not need the money.  The reason I think this is I hear her talk about other people and how much money they have-and if they have what she thinks is a lot of money, she acts entitled to their things-even though she hasn’t worked for that lifestyle. She told me recently that she stole makeup from a girl's storage b/c the girl ""shops all the time"" and she probably won't even notice."" I think she thinks I am going to forget it altogether, bc she perceives me having money — which I don’t.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me her upstairs neighbor, who is her LANDLORD, gets packages all the time and because of this, she shouldn’t have to pay rent.  They can afford to shop and she can’t, so fuck paying rent. 📷  WHAT???  I have seen where this dude lives, trust me-the guy is far far far from rich. She is just lazy and entitled. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not going to give her $350. Not without a fight. If I owed someone, I’d be trying to pay 20 bucks a month— or something!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I also discovered that she bought drugs about a month after I loaned her this cash. She told me this. I was mostly stunned, didn’t call her out on it. Maybe I should have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t been friends w/her that long, really only since Oct. so part of me is afraid she will ghost me. 

I know where she lives, and some other personal stuff-I’ve given her a lot of rides, to her doc, to the store, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know. I am a total idiot. She was really convincing when she said she’d pay me back. I wouldn’t do this if I could go back, and I will probably never loan money again after this experience.

What can I do? If I don’t get it, is revenge OK? What would you do?

Today I went to an event and was basically forced to run errands with this cute skinny 4/10 in looks but nice nerdy personality girl so we spent a lot of time together.

She kept saying how much I remind her of a male version of herself, complimented me a lot on things I do and kept finding excuses to be near me most of the time. She opened herself a lot to me and I see she isn't usually the type of girl who gets male attention.

Now the problem is, she's taller than me, like an inch maybe, and she kept saying how short I am, not in a mocking way but just kept referencing and saying it, for example she'd say how young I look because I'm short or stuff like that.

Is she into me? How do I get over the height barrier? Is this just her way to let me know she isn't interested in anything more than friends?

621,"I'm in my last year of college, and nothing's going well. I don't know why or how, but since september I feel kinda unmotivated about everything. In college, I can't focus and study, I feel like I don't like anything, I don't know. And about my life, I feel like I don't have strengh enough to enjoy it.

And I really really want to enjoy, I want to do things that I like, I want to be productive. But I can't. Sometimes during the day I think ""I'm gonna do that, and enjoy, and bla bla bla, and it's gonna be awesome"", but then, when the time comes, I can't, it's like if I freeze and I can't do anything or enjoy, or I don't even have the strenght to do it. I don't know, I don't even know how to explain it.

And also, almost all the time, I have this weird feeling in my chest (anxiety, I guess?), and it's driving me crazy. Sometimes I just feel like crying for no reason. If anything goes wrong, even the smallest and insignificant thing, I just feel the worst and like if I can't to anything.

What is wrong with me? I'm 22, I wanna live and enjoy my life, but I feel like I'm waiting the time to pass, and like I'm losing these years where I should be having fun, because there's something in me that blocks me.

What do I do to change this? It's so frustrating.

622,"[I posted this in r/rape but I thought I’d post here as well] [i didn’t go into detail because it’s not my story to tell]

Back story: 
I met this girl in December 2018, I’ve had a massive crush on her since and she has a boyfriend, but we’ve been really good friends since we met.

On FaceTime recently she told me that when she was 7 years old, her mother’s partner’s brother used to babysit her and her sister, he was at least 30. She told me that on one occasion that he had taken her in the bathroom, told her to take her trousers down, and raped her. 
She never spoke up about it for her own reasons, and now that she’s told me (though it’s not my story or life) I feel like I want to help her come forward. She says her mother won’t believe her if she told.
What should I do to support and encourage her, and help her find closure?

627,"We are both catholic, however i am more religious than he is so to speak. He has been having issues finding God ever since his uncle passed in 2017 (his name is Paul, this is important later), but lately he speaks of finding a better relationship with God.  

I have a great relationship with God in my eyes. Even though i don’t attend church as often as i should, God is still super present in my life (i pray often, talk about saints, wear a cross necklace i never take off, etc). He knows this and he admires/loves it very much. To be honest think i have unintentionally influenced him to strengthen his bond with God in some ways. 

Easter is approaching and i tend to go over the top with gifts for holidays. It’s just how i am. 

I wasn’t going to make his Easter basket a huge deal, but i wanted to incorporate some things God related within the basket. 

I thought about maybe putting a rosary and a St Paul prayer card in the basket, since Paul was his confirmation name and also the name of his uncle. But as i was online looking for those two things, i came across a St Paul pendant that is very simple and not too in-your-face. I think it’s perfect.

When i give it to him, i was going to say something like “You don’t have to wear this right now, you don’t even have to wear this at all. But in case you are seeking God or wanting to feel protected, this reminds you that God and your uncle are with you always.” Whatever comes out of my mouth during the moment, but it would basically be around that. 

I am NOT trying to force religion on him or anything in that nature AT ALL. He knows this too. I have always been accepting of his weak relationship with God in the past, i will be now. I will be in 15 years if he doesn’t have a relationship by then and is completely atheist. However, i know how much his uncle meant to him, and i know he’s seeking a relationship with God. This would just be a little something that helps him along the way.

I was in Asia by myself for 5 months but I remember that one short moment in time. I think it's still there today. I've gotten used to it I think but for some reason it feels like something is just not right and I can't tell what it is.

I ignored him and drove along but, he threw a good few punches on my car as i drove along, anyways, i parked my car and checked that there was no damage on my car thank god.

I went to my mother and she told me that a homeless man holding a brick had punched her and ran off. 

Now at this point i was already pissed off about him punching my car and knowing that he hurt my sweet old mother made it even worse.

I rushed back to my car and drove around asking about him for a few blocks, when i found him i didnt do anything i just got behind him knowing he would threaten me again with his brick. 

As he was threatening to break my windshield again i played the victim and reached for my wallet and pulled a 50$ bill and showed it to him,he calmed down a little,i got out of my car and headbutted him pretty hard, he fell down, i got ontop of him and started beating him up pretty badly almost to near death i just couldn't control my self, when bystanders came to pull me off of him i just got in my car and drove off. 

So i dont know if I'm in some kind of trouble because I'm sure there were a lot of camera's and eyewitnesses. And i don't think beating someone till near death can be seen as self defence.

631,"Sorry for the wall of text, this got longer than I was expecting. Also, if you find anything weirdly written, it’s because English is not my first language, so sorry about possible confusions.

Summary at the bottom.

I have a friend who has been writing her own stories for almost a year. She is quite serious about it, as she hopes to be able to earn some money from it in the future.

I’ve supported her since the beginning and even helped her to edit some of her stories before she showed them around.  I’m not the only one who does this, as she has other friend who has offered to revise them, so she usually ask for help to whoever is free at the moment.

I know who this other friend is, and I’ve met her a couple times, but she and I are only acquaintances, and everything I know about her is through our friend in common.

This acquaintance is married and has been quite vocal with our friend about her disagreements with her husband, to a point where our friend has started to despise him and their relationship. She has told me several times about arguments they had and her own opinion about them, and how she doesn’t understand why they are still together. Whenever this topic arises, I remind her she doesn’t have all the picture to be so strong headed about it and that herself has told me that her friend considers herself as a happy wife.

I mean, I don’t have all the picture either, and would understand if she was worried about her friend being abused or unhappy, but nothing she has told me had anything to do with that.

She doesn’t seem to like that I don’t agree with her, so she has been avoided to tell me anything about this friend’s relationship for a couple months, something I hadn’t realise until last week, when the topic arose again, although in a different manner.

She wants to write a novel in which the main character, “inspired” on this friend, divorces her husband, pics their daughter and travels to another country, where she’ll fall in love with another man. This character would have her friend hobbies, work and habits, and would be very, very happy after leaving her husband.

And she plans to give her as a present for her birthday.

The only thing she is worried about is what would happen if the husband finds and reads the novel, because she says doesn’t want to cause a fight between them, so she is planning to write two different endings: in the original one the character would leave her husband for real, and in the second, the divorce and everything after that would be a dream.

She told me all of this laughing, as she finds it so, so funny. I told her it’s not, and I would loathe if she dared to judge my relationship in such way.

She didn’t understand why I would say that and kept repeating that she really finds it funny, because her friend likes romantic stories, and surely would love one inspired by her. I told her that she knew her friend better than me, so I couldn’t predict how she would react, but asked her to give it another thought.

Today, she told me that she did, and also that she asked her friend what would she think if she were the main character of one of her stories. Apparently, the friend told her “maybe”, and this has encouraged her even more not only  to write the story, but make sure she includes in it all the things her friend loves about romantic novels to make sure she’ll live, through the novel, what she considers her perfect love story. Again, without her husband.

This time I decided not to involve myself further, and didn’t even reply, as it’s clear she will do it anyway. Time and her friend will be the only ones who’ll tell her if it was a good idea or not.

Am I in the wrong to think it’s a horrible and disrespectful idea?

Should I try one more time to make her rethink it?

Tl,dr: My friend wants to write a story about her friend, making her the main character of the story, divorcing her from her real husband (who my friend despises) and making her fall in love with her “ideal type”. Am I overreacting if I think it is an awful idea?",30Mar2019,1
632,"A bit of context: I took the year off school due to mental health reasons and came to Korea to get psychiatric help and also be nearer to family — my siblings got married to Koreans so they now live in Korea while my parents live in the Philippines where I was born and raised. 
I’m a pretty friendly person and am pretty much an open book, so I’m comfortable with talking about my mental disorders, family, sex, etc etc (anything not everyone would be comfortable talking about maybe). I do have an occasional cutting problem, am a huge drinker, and take medication for my depression &amp; anxiety. 


I met a guy on Tinder in the US Air Force here (I’ll call him Connor) and was introduced to a lot of his closest friends in the Air Force, including the guy I’m talking about in my title (I’ll call him John). Whenever I hang out with Connor near the AF base, it usually always means John is there. Since day one that I’ve known them, I’ve been hit on/told by Connor’s friends that they like me, including John, but this isn’t a big deal to me and I let them know that they’re not my type and that I don’t see them that way. But guys can still be persistent, and that’s normal, but with John... it’s different. He’s obsessive in a way I’ve never dealt with before. It scares me because the number of times I wake up to multiple missed calls and very long text messages of him asking me why I don’t like him that way, what he needs to change to make me like him, that he wants to die because I like someone else; basically just saying things that freak me out.
I always try to calm John down, tell him there’s nothing wrong with him, that I just happen to like someone else, and I’ve even given him my psychiatrist’s phone number because I know the reason for his depression is more than just me. I want him to get help. But instead of working on himself, he’s channeling all his energy into me. He and I have this exact conversation over and over again on a weekly basis and I’m exhausted. The past month I he’s been drinking more and always tells me how much he drank since I drink a lot and he thinks I’ll be proud(?) of him, me being a big drinker and all. I’ve talked about all this with Connor and he’s tried to talk to John about it but John always lies and makes it sound like nothing is going on. I’m not sure what to do and I feel trapped. John is so toxic to me and he has realized that himself! I’m dealing with my own severe depression and anxiety, he knows that’s what I came to Korea for, yet he’s not making any effort to change. 

He’s been very toxic to me so I muted him on Messenger and other messaging apps... but the reason why I’m asking you guys about what I should do is because I saw that his most recent message to me was, “I started cutting 😓” 
I have my own cutting problem and this is stressing me out and I don’t know what to do. I just messaged Connor about it (but it’s 8:30 am on a Sunday so he hasn’t seen it yet). My best friend told me that she thinks I need to block him but I’m scared about what might happen to him, or even me because he knows the name of the building of where I live.

636,"I moved into my apartment September 2017 and always had problems with the power going off sometimes for hours. This went on for months. One night in August of 2018 my neighbor who is the nutcase knocked on my door but I did not answer because ever since the day I moved in this neighbor the Nutcase constantly is knocking on my door to ask for things. The first weekend I moved in I made the huge mistake of letting nutcase use my phone and when nutcase was done most of my apps were deleted along with my contacts. I had to take my phone back to the place I bought it so they could fix it. Also constantly wanting cigarettes and always promising to pay me back when it gets paid ( nutcase lives off the government) I never got paid back.
Nutcase left and my power goes out. I went outside and noticed neighbors with power. I went to a neighbor to find out why they had power and I did not have power.
The neighbor told me to go down to the laundry room and see if my breaker to my apartment was turned off. I never knew the breakers to everyone's apartments were even in the laundry room. My breaker was turned off. The neighbor told me nutcase is known to do that to people.  I contacted the property management and they said they would do something. It is now March 2019 and Nutcase turns my power off at least 2 times a week and everytime it happens I call the property management and nothing has been done. Recently the Apartment building was sold and we got new property management. Now when Nutcase turns off my power I have been calling the non emergency Police to document the problem. Today my power went out and went and caught the Nutcase coming back from the laundry room and confronted the Nutcase ( Nutcase has at least 1 felony I am pretty sure for Arson and 14 other arrests. This is what I googled and found for free. I am not 100 percent sure but from talking to people it sounds exactly like the Nutcase. Also the Nutcase let it slip that they have a felony ) Nutcase denied doing anything but I said I was going to call the Police anyway and Nutcase said go ahead they won't do anything. I called the non emergency Police number and told them the name of Nutcase and explained everything and while I was explaining he dispatched the Police so as soon as I hung up 3 police cars pulled in the parking lot. They came in to my apartment and I told them everything and showed them all my documentation then they asked what Nutcases apartment number was and talked to nutcase who at first would not answer the door but finally came outside to talk to the police. Since then the Nutcase has been sitting outside having a conversation with no one.

For the past few weeks my neighbor has been listening to music extremely loudly throughout the day and well into the evening.

I had no idea where she got this from because I have my own laundry detergent and I am not super high maintenance so I do not use dust brush.

Also, she has been on trips for weeks and even months. If I was going to steal anything, then wouldn't I be emptying the whole house while she was gone for that long?

645,"A bit long...  Sorry about this...

I have two part-time jobs.  One of them is pure hell....  When I accepted it, I was basically unemployed, save for my other part time job which I like a lot, but has little hours and doesn’t pay a whole lot...  I had NO IDEA how hectic it would be....

I deal with older people...  Sometimes they’re nice, some not so much....

My main grief is with the management.  They ask for your availability, yet they NEVER abide by it.  They constantly ask me to do hours that they should be aware that I’m not available for....

I ask not to travel further than 15 miles....  They ask me to fill in shifts over 20 miles away.... and no, they don’t reimburse you for gas....

But what really bothers me us how little respect they seem to have for their employees....  They will call me last minute to have me go over to a client, no matter what I’m in the middle of....   They even constantly called me and left me messages while I was on vacation, that I put in for weeks ago!!!

Worst of all, they put me clients that I am NOT qualified for....  My job description says I am NOT supposed to lift “dead weight” and I’m put with people who can’t pick themselves up and they (or relatives) get upset when I tell them I can’t pick them up myself....

Also, sometimes I’m paired with CMA Certified workers, who don’t realize I’m just a Companion, and get all pissy and attitude when I can’t do most of the things they have to do....

They also upright lie, both to me AND the clients, and don’t seem to care who they inconvenience.....   For example, the past Monday, they begged me to go out 40 minutes away in the morning and fill in a shift, but I said no, saying it cuts into my 12 noon client.  They continued to plead and talk to my noon client and work everything out, and I eventually caved in....

But I forgot that the noon client had a 9AM appointment that I was supposed to take her to...   I suddenly remembered that Monday morning, and called her to confirmed....  She ended up canceling because she was sick, but still wanted me in ASAP because she didn’t feel well...  and she was LIVID because I would be an hour late....

My job told me to go to the fill-in anyway but she was fine with me leaving early to go to my noon client.....   when I was about to leave, this fill in is surprised, having NO idea that I was leaving early.....

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard clients and/or family members say, “I was NOT informed of this!!”

The worst offense was when I was only working for them for about a month as a mere companion, and they send me to the home of a man with dementia plus PTSD... He would be triggered by the tiniest thing, and fly into rages, screaming, throwing furniture, trying to attack me....  including finding a garden rake and trying to strike me with it (no clue WHY there was a garden rake in the house....).  Nothing I did couldn’t calm him down, and I told my management this......  All they did was give me additional tips how to handle him, and some online tutorials....   But when they didn’t work, they finally sent someone else in.....

Basically, these guys give me severe stress and anxiety and I really don’t want to be with them anymore...  But the only reason I’m still with them is because I need the money.   My husband says we would be okay, and he agrees I really should quit, except I believe he just doesn’t want to argue (that’s how he usually is).  I remember during the time I was unemployed how stressful it was for him to cover everything....

Trusted family members say I should stick it out until a new job comes up (trust me, I’ve been applying!) to pay for my essentials, and I believe it’s a good idea......  but I really REALLY hate this job!!! 😫

Another thing I should mention is that my hub and I ARE expecting a bunch of money due to a lawsuit involving my former job (that in itself is a whole other story...)

So what do you all think?

Either way.... when I DO leave this job, I’m going to celebrate so hard!!! 😝",30Mar2019,1
