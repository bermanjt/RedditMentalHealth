0,"So I’m 19, me and my girlfriend just broke up 2 weeks ago after 3 years, I can go for my license whenever I choose to but I have no experience with driving really, I have to move out by April cause my mom can’t stand our house and wants to live with her boyfriend and I’m trying to find out what to do as a career but like I said I’m only 19 and I didn’t have the most amazing marks in school. I just don’t know how to go about doing all of this, which one of these is more important than the others and just how the heck do I do all of this without over stressing and having sleepless nights? I feel like my whole life is broken and it will take a lifetimes worth to fix. I smoke a lot of weed, I never workout, I can’t seem to find a girl that’s not unstable or has problems of some sort in her past, I just feel as if everything I have done up to this point is wrong and I really don’t know where to go from here",26Feb2019,1
1,I lost all motivation to keep going. I just want it to be over. I’m so tired of feeling worthless. Feeling like no one cares about me. I just want to die and be done with it. I’ve lost everyone. I have no one. I don’t think I can keep going anymore. ,26Feb2019,9

4,"So I've been trying to learn how to stick up for myself better from backhanded comments from multiple coworkers in their clique. I've just started doing this doing since my boss has been a real toxic a$$hole what few times I'd talk to her. 

I had filled in for day shift early this morning (5 am, I woke up) and worked the night before (9 pm) and tried greeting my boss when she came into work. I told her ""good morning"" and I couldn't hear her but she mumbled something in return inaudible. A few minutes went by and she asked with an unusual smile on her face, ""did you get any sleep last night (laughing)?"". 

At that point I could feel that she knows that I work evening shift and was just saying that to be condescending and cruel. I had almost slipped up and admitted that I had less than 3 hours of sleep last night due to late minute call in. 

Then later on I was doing my job when another coworker would check to see if I was doing my job correctly. She would wait until the tray would go by her space (we're basically in an assembly line) I didn't see the mistake then she would immediately point it out and repeat this over snd over again and people would smile about it. 

I work very hard and keep to myself most days. I don't gossip but instead vouch &amp; defend the people they're gossiping about when they're not present at work. 

Anyways I did that same thing again yesterday when CoworkerB started trashing on CoworkerJ's Work Reputation. I said, ""CoworkerJ does a great job and I've no problems with them"". CoworkerB grew angry &amp; looked at me last night turning around to say, ""oh you're so perfect too huh?"" and I just gave her a wide smile and ignored her comment. 

Fast forward to today and it was the last 10 minutes of my shift all my work was done and everything was taken care of we had finished our work. I went into the breakroom. I mentioned before that to my assistant boss how I felt sluggish (my aunt) due to being tired &amp; my main boss just tried convincing me to go home half hour early (she's been pushing me to leave work way before the scheduled time lately by like a half hour each time I worked in day shift). I refused and kept working on other tedious things. 

Anyways CoworkerB said ""BossC is gonna chew your ass out when they find out you're in here"". I didn't think anything of it as I had been working just slightly past my breaks and thought it was fair to sit down for the final 5-10 minutes to clock out of work after working all day. I then replied, ""if she does then she does and I'll deal with it"". I didn't exactly know at that point that she was gonna tattle on me to the bosses until I heard her what sounded like her voice in the office to my bosses. I then walked out slowly &amp; calmly out of the breakroom to see both of them walking down the hallway towards me. My aunt smiled strangely at me (as if knowing that coworkerB is being a petty toxic tattletale but had to do somethingso to not appear bias). They didn't say anything at all but I felt mistreated again at work. 

Anyways, today was a very physically demanding work day due to the lack of sleep and the shitty people to work with.

I left after clocking out and gave a smile to coworkerB so that she'd know it didn't get to me. 

Any advice ladies or gentleman? 

I've been job hunting &amp; applying to other jobs for months but haven't been interviewed once.

5,"I'm sure this is gonna be a bunch of incoherent rambling but I just need someone to listen.

I'm 15m in high school, 25lbs overweight and have no motivation to do anything. My grades have slipped considerably and I genuinely don't care and i'm not bothered by it anymore - I'm usually an A/B student. My parents are constantly berating me about school, to the point where i've been having anxiety attacks almost every other morning. I'm going to miss my orchestra's big competition that i've worked my ass off for (and got a solo in) for the past 12 weeks. I'm upset about not getting to play my solo, but as I see them moving on in rehearsals without me I no longer really care. I have no motivation to do anything.

6,"Seriously, he can’t go two seconds without ranting to me about how Trump is a racist, sexist, narcissist, transphobic, homophobic, islamaphobic, hypocrite, idiot, etc. and I’m so tired of it. It seriously just makes want to like Trump out of spite. I just want to eat dinner and enjoy my food. I don’t care. Sometimes I work up the nerve to call him out when he tells blatant lies and then he says I’m all of those things. It’s taking over my life at this point. I can’t talk about anything without him saying how it proves the Republicans and Trump are ruining society. It’s so annoying. I just want to have a normal conversation about normal things. I dread him coming home every day because it’s like walking a minefield of things that might get him ranting for fifteen minutes straight. I’ll worry about politics when I start voting.

But I have this weird fear of being judged for buying these kind of things, and so I stick to the same type of cars, clothing even now.

10,"I want to preface all of this with the fact that I have been diagnosed with anxiety, so if at any point it seems like I'm being overly worried or am overthinking things, please let me know.

I've posted about this on a different throwaway here, and well at this point I'm 99% sure my roommate who lives downstairs in my NYC apartment is cooking meth or some other kind of drugs.

Suspicious things I've noticed so far:

- No job other than being the building super
- Spends a lot of time in his car with other people parked on our street.
- Purchased a motion activated web cam to set up in his space downstairs
- Lots of weird smells in the apartment recently ranging from burnt plastic to strong cleaning chemicals. One day where the smell was very strong I heard him running what seemed like powerful fans and he's had the windows upstairs open.
- His windows downstairs have black plastic covering them.
- A bunch of random people came over one night last week apparently just to try the food he was cooking (his food was trash)
- He has purchased multiple broken phones claiming that he repairs them and sells them.

I could go on and on but I think it's pretty clear this guy is up to some pretty sketchy shit. Knowing the dangers of Meth labs, I haven't been staying in the apartment after I first noticed the smells/strange behavior. My other roommates haven't seemed to notice at all.

Anyways, I had planned on moving out soon anyway and had already put a deposit down on a place. Unfortunately before I noticed all of this  I was being friendly with this guy one night and told him I was moving and told him where.

Now just today I told both him and my other roommate that I was moving out tomorrow because the utilities are in my name and they would need to put them in their name. My sketchy roommate immediately asked why I was moving out and was very persistent on wanting to help me move out because ""He is a mover and has done it for years"". He literally wouldn't accept no as an answer except after repeating myself like 5 times.

So I'm just moving my stuff into storage tomorrow to hopefully prevent it from getting contaminated, but now I'm afraid that the guy is going to try and help me again tomorrow or follow me to see where I'm dropping off my stuff. I'm afraid if he finds out that I'm just putting stuff in storage he'll try to stop me or threaten me out of paranoia that I know what he's doing. I've hired 2 movers from a moving company and my plan is to not enter the apartment without them. But at this point, I'm wondering if even that is safe, and if I'll even be safe moving into my new apartment.

I may seem calm and collected in my writing here, but deep inside I'm honestly scared for my life. I'm not from the city; I come from a small town. Honestly all I want more than anything is to just GTFO, quit my job and move back to my hometown where I've always felt safe. I did not ask for any of this. I was just trying to live a somewhat normal life in NYC and not get into any trouble. I have a girlfriend of three years who lives here and if I move back home we'll basically have to break up because she has a strict family and she wouldn't be able to move with me, nor does she want to. When I had an anxiety attack this last weekend I had been dead set on moving back home, but she begged me and begged me and made me feel guilty so I decided to give staying another try, but I honestly don't think I can do it. If I stay I'll constantly live in fear of this guy stalking me, or just ending up in a similar situation because I don't make enough money to live alone or in non-crappy neighborhoods. Maybe it seems like I've already made up my mind... idk. I just feel trapped in a shitty situation and I feel like my life could be endanger if I even try to go get the rest of my stuff tomorrow. I'm just really fucking scared.


You may be asking why I haven't immediately contacted the police. If this were just one of my neighbors, I absolutely would. When I noticed these suspicious activities I thought maybe I was wrong but at the same time it was probably a good idea to get out. Also, this guy knows me personally. I don't know if he's in a gang or anything, but I've seen news stories about gangs attacking people to get revenge, and he knows where my new apartment is. I think at this point if I called the police it would be very obvious that it was me and I really don't want to make myself a target. I just want to be out and have no part in this, and I want to get my stuff out as I have a lot of expensive things.

I'm turning 25 in a few months, I've been working with a firm for 2 1/2 years but hate my job (very very boring, no growth, and not competitive pay). Luckily i was able to be transferred to a new city with this job, but i hate it worse at this new office. I spend countless hours online researching nonsense and how to find happiness within. I have had many failed job attempts within this past month, and it puts me in moods where I don't want to do anything. I can get away with not doing work which drives me crazy (i want growth) but i also know i just moved to a new city and i shouldn't expect anything right away. I really want to make a career change but i feel like my head is not in the right spot yet (i.e i -have close to no friends out here, i don't really know what makes me happy besides working out, i don't have hobbies i enjoy, i smoke pot regularly to help enjoy my free time). My questions is, when is it okay to take it easy? I've known i havent wanted to stay at my job but really am lost at where i am in life.

12,"It’s the second semester. It started out kind of rough but got better, and now it’s rough again. Most of the “friends” I had last semester were in my classes or were kind of fake friends, and they’ve all moved on from me. I have one person who I’ll eat with maybe once a week, and they’ve started hanging out with the people they’re rooming with next year, so I feel like a third wheel. I don’t have anyone to room with, and it makes me feel like a total loser.

I’m still involved with clubs and groups, but I don’t think people like me. I’ve always been the type of person where people tell me I’m “too nice” and that I say sorry too much. I’ve tried to get away from this, but I feel like I act like an accidental asshole instead. I joke a lot with people in a way that sounds mean, and I make passive aggressive comments sometimes that I don’t realize until after I’ve said them.

I had the excuse first semester of not having many friends. People were still getting settled, and a lot of the friend groups I’d see were superficial. People have solidified those friend groups now, and I don‘t have one. I spend a ton of time in my room and feel judged if I try to go do something alone. I just want to go home, but I can’t for a few more weeks. All of this just makes me scared for when I eventually graduate. I don’t think I’m ready for the real world.

16,"Me (16F) and my SO (16M) are a bunch of dumbasses - we are both under the impression that I may be pregnant. 

A bit of a backstory: we’ve been dating for a year and are serious about our relationship. Before anything ever occurred, we both agree on having consent on sex. 

We both believed that this could have started on Valentines Day. On Valentines Day, we spent the day together and both of us were enjoying the time together. Next thing we knew, we were both performing oral sex on each other. We did not release at all either. 

From there, I proceeded to get on back and he started grinding against me. We are not wearing clothes at this point. Now this part is important: 

It did not go in. However, we both suspect that there could have been precum on the tip of his dick. He did not release nor did I. 

Afterward, I change my underwear but did not shower since I fell asleep. Everything has been fine until Saturday. On Saturday, I realized that the sight of food has been making me nauseous. Yet, I have been having cravings as well. My period is irregular since I first menstruated in fourth grade however for the past three months, it has been regular falling on the last week of each month (late 20s or early week of the month). My period would come about twice of year before the three months. Today, when I wiped after peeing, j noticed brown discharge. I searched up (yes, googled that shit) and the result said something along the lines of occurring at the beginning of a pregnancy. I’ve also been getting headaches. I know it’s a small slim chance pre cum caused me to possibly be pregnant, but it’s not entirely impossible

On Saturday, I talked about this with my cousin who is an adult (19F) and I confided in her about this. She agreed to take me to a clinic soon, most likely this Friday (03/01) or next Friday (03/08) to run some tests on the possibility of being pregnant. 

This is where is gets tricky; 

I am 16 years old, I am Hispanic and I am not sure if I even have Medicaid or any insurance. My parents income is less than 30,000$ (we live in California) and I have no idea if I need parents permission for anything. 

Me and my SO both agreed on aborting the baby. We are not prepared on raising a baby and we are both planning to go to college then med school. We both know that with our situation, we will not be able to support our baby well. We do not want to involve our parents into this either. 

If it comes to an abortion, I decided on having to abort it with the pill. 

We’re both worried and paranoid. Are we over thinking this and I may not be pregnant ? If I am, what do I do ? What are my options ? The pill for abortion is expensive and I don’t know how I will pay for it. I know my cousin may be able to give a hundred or two. Any advice on this situation ?

TLDR: I may be pregnant and I don’t know how I can deal with my situation if I am. 

Any and all advice or information will be greatly appreciated. ",26Feb2019,2

19,"My parents love me, they have given everything to me. But there are some things that just make me angry at them.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I will talk about my father first. Due to work, I barely see him. The most I see him is three months a year. We used to all live together but his company needed managing in China. When I was 5 my parents decided that we all live in China to be together and me and my brother can discover our culture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know when I started remembering this but my father became a drinker due to peer pressure and stress from business. He is terrifying when he is drunk and shouts. Despite that, he has never hit anyone when he is drunk, or sober. However he does shout and curse (not at anyone specifically) and when things get worse throws things. 

Recently I went to China to see him and all I wanted was that he didn't get drunk, however they had a college reunion and again, due to mob mentality and peer pressure, they all got drunk as fuck. (Chinese drinking culture doesn't help). He came into the room shouting and woke me up in the middle of the night. I was PISSED. I had enough and I screamed at him and told him that I am his son, and I just want to spend quality time with him and I was scared that he would drink himself to death before me and my brother get situated in life and make families. I just want my father to be happy and to be with my mother, who he had become distant from over the years. Even still, I KNOW that neither of them would ever do something like cheating on each other. They love each other but they can never express it. Anyways, in my rage I left the hotel and ran for miles. I got a cab and went back in the morning, and he was sorry as fuck. However I was still extremely pissed, I called my mom and started chewing my father out in front of her, and told her that I never wanted to see him again. At the time I felt traumatized and angry. Anyways, like most fights we did make amends. However ever since that day I never saw my father the same again. When I used to think of him I would see a hero, someone that protected me. Now all I see when I think of him is him in his drunk state. Sometimes even when he is tired and talks like he may be drunk, I feel uneasy. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for my mother. She is an absolute angel. She raised me and my brother while my father had to make a living for us in China. She put up with all of our bullshit for years and I feel so sorry about it. However sometimes I just LOSE IT. I always blame things on her even though she couldn't control it. I feel like, no, I KNOW I am an absolute piece of shit. I love her but I can't bring myself to say sorry, or even tell her that I love her. I want to note that when I argue with her it's never about me wanting to buy something or anything like that. It's usually about my future and other shit not directly involved with money. Anyways, something that my mother has continuously done was send photos of me to her wechat and her friends. Who I don't know. There are times I specifically asked her not to post something and she would do it anyway. Last night, we went out to eat with some friends and their families. The parents got a group photo of us and she immediately sent it to my family back in China. I LOST IT. I don't know why, it wasn't a bad picture, but I felt betrayed after promise and promise that she would never do it without telling me again. We just had an argument and I made it clear I felt like she betrayed my trust and I deleted the photos. And she looked so sad. I know she loves me and wanted to show me off to her friends and our family. But I am just such a cunt and I can't, I just can't control myself sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I did pretty good in high school and I got into quite a few good colleges. However due to financial and personal reasons, I enlisted in the military. I made it clear to my parents that if they wanted me to apply for college I will, but just to prove to them I am capable of going to good universities. We agreed to that after MANY arguments. I ship out in less than 20 days. And still I feel so alone in this. My parents constantly guilt trip me and say shit like I'm giving up such a good path, etc. etc. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to make them proud. I want to forge my own path and have my father retire and come back to America. I want him and my mother to get close again, that is part of the reason I'm joining. I promised them that they would not spend a dime on my college tuition, since my brother's is over 40k a year already. (NOTE: please keep in mind that they can afford it, I am going into the military mainly because of personal reasons.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is confusing as fuck. It is. It's just that so much shit has been going on in my life I can't even put it together. I need some advice, anything. My parents are good people, I just can't adjust. ",26Feb2019,1
20,"To keep it brief and vague, basically I am in this society that has an inductance process similar to a frat, but isn't a frat. For several weeks the candidates train and are inducted at the end with a nickname/callsign.

The nickname/callsign is based off of something funny/stupid they did during that period. This is where the incident happened. Under pressure, one of them used air quotes that resembled Dr. Evil in this gif---

[https://media.giphy.com/media/qs6ev2pm8g9dS/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/qs6ev2pm8g9dS/giphy.gif)

I posted it in the group chat thinking Dr. Evil would be a good nickname idea. Some people liked the gif, however this week one girl started complaining that it was offensive and inappropriate, and acted as if it was a personal attack on the individual instead of a typical nickname origin. Since then everyone has unliked the gif and is acting like I'm just the worst.

I feel like this is a pretty typical way nicknames have been discovered, and it definitely wasn't an attack on that individuals character, just a funny thing they did that we could all have a giggle at after they are inducted.

23,"I’ve (26F) been single for 2.5 years now. I’ve dated a lot in that time, but haven’t had any luck. 

Keep in mind I’m not unattractive. I put a lot of effort into my appearance. I’m curvy, but not obese. I’m short, long brown hair, green eyes. I work a good job (creative position) in a respected agency. I’m well read and independent (recently taking a two week solo vacation overseas). I pride myself on being articulate and try to read as much as possible. I take things like night classes to learn another language, see movies at the documentary theatre and take boxercising classes. I have friends and a social circle. 

Whether it’s been meeting people at the wrong time in their life, dealing with commitment phones (after casually dating a few months), being ghosted, not meeting ‘partner quality’ people (I don’t mean financially/looks - I mean communication/emotionally) or, the big one, a situation arises that triggers some of my past relationship trauma and I ruin it and/or push the person away (which I’m currently in therapy working on, getting better but not 100% there yet). I’m not rude/hurtful (intentionally) when I do this, just standoffish, and quick to cut things off. I take responsibility for this direct to the person and apologize, always. I’m honest about it, that I’m flawed, I made a mistake, tell them what’s going on, why I behaved the way I did - but it’s never benefited me. It has only been met with judgement, and used as a catalyst to reject me/disappear. 

So, how do I adjust to this new life? I don’t trust someone will see romantic value in me again. It seems I can’t find what I’m looking for, or when I do I seem to fuck it up even when I’m trying hard not to. 

How do I adjust to being alone long term, if not potentially forever? Does anyone have advice on how to cope with being lonely? I’m content with my own company, and enjoy it, but it doesn’t fill every void, and I don’t want to sleep with strangers as a bandaid. I understand doing that isn’t fair to myself, or the other person.

25,"This is a little crazy and I probably won't do it, but it's been on my mind all day... I [21 M] was at work and a friend [18 F] came in to talk to me. I don't know why she was so quick to bring it up, but she asked me if I wanted to see a picture of a girl she's been talking to. I didn't know she was experimenting with girls, so this was a pleasant surprise, and so was the girl she's been talking to. It's also worth noting that my friend is super hot too. She proceeded to tell me that the girl she's been talking to was asking for a three-way with her and the guy she's been sleeping around with. Turns out she's not talking to him anymore and isn't seeing anybody. She isn't wanting anything serious and is only looking to hook up for a while, which is why I'm even considering it. If so, how do I even bring it up? ""Hey, you remember when you told me your friend wants a three-way, but you're not seeing anyone?"" Then proceed to get naked... I know it would be weird, but I don't think opportunities for a fucking threesome come very often, especially with two hot girls.
Some concerns I have are she knows I'm not very experienced (less than 10 times with two girls) and am definitely not the dominant type. 

They're both at least 8.5s and I'm a 5 at most, probably less if I'm being transparent. I'm not fat or super skinny, but I don't have naturally good looking facial features or a body. 

I don't think she's ever thought of me sexually, but maybe she'll be willing to do a friendly favor? Like it's a three way, that's the best thing you could get a guy. Jk but that would be nice, wouldn't it?

I'm kind of a shy guy, and as bad as I don't want to be awkward about it, it's more likely than not that I'll mess it up (both the asking for it, and performing in said act)

Things that I think will help me are that I've got an apartment so I've got the place to do it

I'm more than willing to go down for a long time (more because I'm afraid of cumming too fast)

In the past there has been no issue in having male friends, I think because I've always had a boyfriend, friends have just been friends and I've never had to worry about them coming onto me. Right from the start they've thought of me purely as a friend and not a potential date or fuck, they tend to take a 'big brother' role as friends. 

But now I'm single I'm finding things are very different, too often I think I'm making a new friend but then it becomes clear they're only trying to get in my pants. It's heartbreaking, but also it means putting a lot of effort into trying to make a friend just for them to ghost when I show no romantic or sexual interest. I'm not sure how to let guys know it's only friendship on the table, without lying to them about having a boyfriend. ",26Feb2019,1
28,"Last December, my husband and I were visiting relatives in PA (we live in NY) when we were rear-ended while stopped at a traffic light by an uninsured motorist. The police were called and a report filed. As a result, we were forced to file a claim under our insurance and use the uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to pay for the damages to our car, including a rental and the replacement of our daughter's car seat. Thankfully there were no injuries. Our insurance company told us that they will attempt to go after the other driver for the cost of the claim to include the out of pocket deductible we had to pay, but there's no guarantee. 

We were seriously pissed a out the situation, mostly because of the fact that our 5yo was sleeping in the back when it happened and it scared the ever-loving shit out of me. I was shaken up for the next several hours. In the end, however, us able to walk away from the accident and having to pay $200 was not so bad compared to the fact that the other driver very likely lost his license and possibly his job that day in addition to having his car being totalled and the massive ticket he got. We figured if the worst for us was $200, we weren't going to pursue it any further.

Fast forward to last week, we got a letter from our insurance stating that they were refusing to renew our policy because of the number of claims we've had to file in the last 18 months. (1st was a 2mph slide on ice which kissed the bumper of the car in front of us. The 2nd, sadly, was my fault which resulted in a small-ish damage claim and no injuries). I had a long conversation with the underwriters who said that it didn't matter that the last claim wasn't our fault, it was the fact that we filed at all. That's a lomg story so I won't go on. The short version is that the 3rd claim is what caused our insurance to terminate.

Now I am wondering if we should, in fact, pursue the other driver for damages. Not to mention that now we can never ever sell this car because it has too many accidents. It's a good thing we do love the car because we are resigned to drive it into the ground! 

Tl;Dr Uninsured motorists are usually uninsured because they have no money to pay for insurance....... what are the odds we could get him to pay for the damages he caused in an accident that was his fault? Even if we won the case we can't afford the legal fees if he can't actually pay up.

29,"I’ve been absolute best friends with this person for all of high school but they’ve always been very controlling. I’ve always been the follower and they the leader, not because I want to be a sheep but because if I try to take any charge in our dynamic, they shoot me down. One (lame) example is when we were staying at a hotel. I was going to open the door so I had my card out but they told me “stop flashing your card and put it back I’m opening the door not you.” They also stare at my face and squint really noticeably and point out all my acne like I don’t already know I have it. And they know I’m sensitive about my skin because I stress about it all the time. They said my skin condition was “sad.” They also tell me I have no friends or social skills and that they’re my only friend. They’re not entirely joking and I have come to wonder whether they have some sort of superiority complex over me.

They have slapped me in front of our friends for no reason and have NEVER apologized. I play it off as a joke because I have no idea what else to do. They also yell at me over the most trivial things. For instance, my other friend (Y) didn’t have an appetite so friend X was trying to get them to eat dinner. We just had a really filling drink two hours ago so I wasn’t hungry either and I said, “X, if she doesn’t want to eat you shouldn’t make her.” There was no mal intent as I know friend X just wanted Y to eat dinner. But X said, “there is a wall between me and my anger and you are about to cross it,” then proceeded to call me a bitch. Then after a pause, they laughed and said “You know I’m just kidding, I love you.”

My problem is, I’ve gone through this for 3 years because they’re my best friend and these have been aspects of their personality I’ve simply learned to overlook, but I’m really tired. I opened up to two mutual friends over this but none of them really empathize with me, so I’ve begun to think that maybe I’m just victimizing myself. But I’m still not over any of the examples mentioned, and I’ve become really depressed whenever I’m with them. All our mutual friends see her controlling demeanor as endearing because she has struggled with friendships and bullying in the past. I get it, but when you’re the target for all the mean behavior,  you feel like shit. There’s no way I can stop being friends with them, and I’ll probably move on eventually so I just want to know what I should do. One friend just said, “That sucks” and changed the topic. The other didn’t see my perspective and today was talking about how they were the nicest person they knew and how big their heart was. I don’t know. Am I really just overreacting? I avoid confronting them because they say I’m too sensitive or get really defensive and justify their actions and it just makes me more upset. I also tend to push my friends away when I’m upset over these things because I overthink everything they say or do to me and I need space but then the friend gets mad at me for being unresponsive. This was really messy and unorganized but I just cried lol and I really need advice.",26Feb2019,1

  Im Only 19 years old and next month is my 20th birthday. The last 3 or 4 years have been weighting on me heavy but luckily i dont get stressed out at all. I've been just hoping to some how get a millions dollars and find a way to make it last  all my life. I have a lot of ideas that i just cant seem to make happen idk what to do. I have so many ideas that if they come to light i would no doubt be a visionary. I feel like i see the world different then most and  i have a deep understanding of how this life thing works. If i can bring the world together just by using one of my ideas then, I can drop dead knowing that someone is helped and also really understands what Im trying to say. I want to basically build an empire around the word relate or relate-able this also have to do with nostalgia. 
We are all here for a reason but like everyone else we will most likely experience the same or exact feelings and I think this is a untapped market of entertainment. I already fucked up my chances of college and all that so idk how i can start or where Im a 90s kid with a great idea on how to change the world i just dont have the info or the knowledge how. Im afraid that by the time Im 30 it will be too late cause i wouldn't have the age factor with me anymore and ill have to live in regret for the rest of my live. I want to make movies and music  and take amazing set pieces that even tho they are just a picture of one thing they can speak 1000's of words and really connect to that person soul and shows them that we both went through the same shit and still came out on top.

32,"We've been friends for like 3 years, but recently, we moved in together.  He was trying to get away from his alcoholic and abusive stepdad, so I rushed into things and poured a bunch of money into making sure he was able to reach stability.  I won't get into the details - they're unimportant - but long story short, I poured about $1200 of my money, which was already in short supply, into the effort.

He's stable now and paying his own portion of the rent.  But now that we're locked into a year-long lease agreement, I'm discovering some interpersonal issues.  

1.  I resent him whenever he spends money on frivolous nothings.  All I can think of when he buys macdons or wastes money on shoes is how I'll be the one to absorb the cost if he finds himself unable to pay the bills again.  I've set a precedent with my previous actions but now I'm tired of being his bank.  He'd never admit to himself my money is the reason he feels he can be frivolous with his, but it is.

2.  He eats all my food.  Again, I set a precedent - when he was getting on his feet, I offered to make him food so he didn't have to buy his own - but it's become a dynamic in the friendship. Lately, he's been struggling, after a few weeks of working less than usual, and instead of buying food for himself, he bought a pair of shoes.  I made a dope egg bake this morning FOR MYSELF and didn't have the heart to refuse when he asked for half.  He would have gone hungry otherwise.  I see the flaw in this, but I'm terrified of losing the friendship if I withdraw this support.

3.  I do most/all the housework.  He has a very high tolerance for grime.  The kitchen gets nasty, the floors get nasty, the rugs get nasty.  He says he's depressed.  Maybe that's true, but he's also a goddamned adult who lives with another adult.  He kept his space clean when he lived with his stepdad - I saw it.  I didn't expect him to stop.

4.  I need alone time and he doesn't grant it.  Yes, we're close friends, but he doesn't seem to understand that sometimes all I want to do is sit for hours and surf the web.  On days I'm home, he sometimes calls in to work over little to nothing, and I'm convinced it's because he wants to hang out with me.  It's nice, but I'm starting to get desperate.  I look so forward to my free time, and I just hate it when he comes to tell me he's called in YET AGAIN and I have to hang out with him all day.  And it's not like I have the option of just hiding in my room - he follows me in, and if I tell him I want to be alone, he gets really concerned and tells me my mental health is declining.  Sometimes I believe him.  After all, if I don't want to hang out with friends, I must be getting depressed, right?  Maybe he is right.  But I've always enjoyed private computer browsing - I've just never shared this fact with him before we moved in together, and since it's a deviation from my social side, it must be WRONG.

He has the same desire, he just doesn't need to escape from me - I actually respect his space.  When he wants to go to his room and watch porn or sports or whatever, I don't bother him about it.  He gets all the space he needs from me.  I just don't get any from him.  

5.  He wants me to back him up on everything he does.  If I don't think his actions are for the best, he pesters me until I relent.  If my finances weren't tied around his, I wouldn't care if he thought I approved of his buying things he *really needed,"" but they are, and I do.  

I don't want to bring any of these things up, because 1) they'll make him feel really shitty (he's already guessed there were issues between us, but I assured him I was working on my reactions to some things), and 2) he'll probably tell me my mental health is going down the drain, that I'm becoming a grumpus, or that I never used to be this way - and it'll make me second guess myself, because maybe he'd be right.  I can't deal with that idea right now.

Maybe I need a kick in the pants.  I definitely need to change something.",26Feb2019,1
34,"So, I'm planning on going to the open casting call for Dear Evan Hansen. I really need help on this. I've never been to an open call before.

36,"I am (14f), currently in middle school and still living with my parents, obviously. I love my parents a whole lot, they provide almost everything I need for me and are in no way negligent. We mantain a mostly good relationship. Please don't bash their beliefs in the comments, as much as I disagree with them they are my parents and I love them no matter what.

I'm currently a pesketarian/vegetarian (I eat eggs and fish occasionally). I only started eating fish and eggs when I was around ten or so. Lately, I've noticed I'm unreasonably tired, my nails are very brittle, and it's really easy for me to gain weight. Despite maintaining a proper BMI and exercising it's harder for me to run without feeling like I'm about turn into an animated corpse on the spot. My whole life has been like this, however it is only recently I've realized that it probably isn't normal for a fourteen year old to be passed out on the couch as soon as they return from school. I don't know what is wrong with me, I do know I've felt like this my whole life, however. I feel like this might be a cause of dieting. Children shouldn't diet like this, it isn't healthy and I don't think it's right personally. If anyone had any other ideas on why this is happening I would be glad to here. I've heard it's hard to mantain iron when you are on a meat free diet, and I'm worried this might be the case. 

My parents are belivers in something call ""vedism"", they are Russian/Ukrianian and while defiently not popular over there, it's not unheard of so they have family friends with similar beliefs whose kids are also vegetarian. I think it's Orthodox Hindu or something like that. Anyways, a part of this religion means that you are not to eat meat. This would be great, I'm okay with whatever religious practices they want to do. I was also subjected to their choices, as I have never eaten meat in my entire life. However their three children are involved in it. My youngest brother is incredibly skinny and active at all, I'm a bit more chubby and not active. My middle brother is incredibly active and does well with sports however he eats meat without my parents permission at school. I'm not sure if I could do that, I would feel guilty. Anyways, anytime I try bringing my issues up with them and saying it could be the fault of not enough iron/protein they get very angry. I get the usual ""PETA"" propeganda of some unethical third world slaughtering of a cow and talk about karma and all that jazz. They say meat is the cause of cancer/depression whatever they come up with and say they would be very disappointed if I ate meat. 

They took me to a natural clinic doctor to figure out why the hell I slept for so long and all the time. The doctor, a fairly nice woman, says maybe I should try eating a little bit of red meat. My mother was actually onboard with the idea... Until my dad forbid me even trying to get help. I was very upset on how selfish he could be to not allow me to have a good quality of life based on his beliefs. Next time my mom took me there, she sort of urged to put me on a gluten/dairy/soy/egg whatever free diet where I pretty much had nothing to eat but the occasional fish, fruits and vegetables and replacement stuff for those items. That was hellish, did that for six months and honestly I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy. The headaches were bad. They claimed it worked because I was feeling ""better"", not really, I started it in late Feburary of last year so I was obviously way happier as I have mundane but noticeable seasonal depression and I cannot stand the short days, obviously spring made me happy. 

Here's the situation - my parents are very against me even trying a diet with meat. When I try to argue, they guilt trip me into even suggesting such ideas. I feel very powerless. This is a negative effect on my energy and mental capability, which I feel will ruin my educational potential and the last years of my childhood. I have no way to escape this until I turn eighteen, I've been eating this way my entire life. I feel as though I've been given a disadvantage in life and a disadvantage that can easily be overcome. I've tried time and time again to just let my parents try, just see if I can get better. They won't budge and it all ends in me being very angry and unhappy. I'm losing hope. Have any of you guys ever had an experience like this? Am I crazy? Could it be a separate issue and most importantly how do I express concerns without hurting our relationship?

38,"I'm 24, live in the US, and in particular I live in a state/county known for a very high cost of living.
I was pressured to go to college after high school, but being that my family is not at all well-off, I had to take out student loans to attend school. I was enrolled in a private college (not a state school) that had, imo, a pretty hefty price tag.
After completing some schooling, my mother (who had been fighting cancer) was declining in health. So I took a break from school to be home more and take care of her, and work more to help out at home.
The next thing I know, my college files for bankruptcy and shuts down, leaving me in a boatload of debt with no degree to show for it.
Couldn't afford to pay the amounts my privatized loan provider was asking for, they eventually all defaulted, it's been deatroying my credit and gaining interest.
I still work for the same company over the years, and though I've advanced slightly in position I don't make enough to meet my expenses and also save enough money to pay off my loans. And it's a struggle to find a better job with no completed advanced education.

41,"For some background, my mom immigrated from Vietnam to the US in the 80s and has pretty traditional Vietnamese values and morals (parents are most important, pre-marital sex is out of the question, living with someone of the opposite sex before marriage is out of the question, etc.) 

So I'm 25F with a well-paying job and I have the means to live on my own but I live with my parents since my job requires a lot of travel and my parents want me to stay home anyways until I'm married. I didn't mind living at home with my parents until I got into a relationship that my mom is against and for extremely petty reasons. 

1. My mom has always wanted me to date a boy who's from the same ethnicity and believes in the same religious beliefs as she does and now I am, but because he doesn't speak the language very well, she doesn't consider him as part of our same ethnicity.
2. He's studying a health profession field, and because of that he will graduate with some debt, so she says I shouldn't date him because he has debt. (My previous relationship was with someone without debt and she told me at the time that money doesn't matter and that I should be with someone who matches me, so that's contradictory)
3. I tell her that I really like him because he's compassionate, kind, and clicks with me in ways no one else has, but she discredits all this and says that it's all a facade and once I marry him and live with him, that's when he'll ""show his true nature"" and I'll be miserable and fight with him all the time. 
4. She picks the most random things to be upset with him about - his hair, his mouth shape - and says I should leave him because of them.
5. She thinks that he'll leave me once he finds out I'm not a virgin and that all men base a woman's worth on their virginity. This is so dumb and is absolutely not the case since my bf and I are sexually active and he's a very fair and open-minded person and doesn't follow those traditional values.

All the reasons that she tells me to leave him are ridiculous and she always has side comments like, ""I can't tell you what to do so you'll have to live with your own mistakes"" whenever I disagree with her and it's so condescending. I think she's projecting what happened to her with my dad to me and my current relationship, but I don't want any surprises like she had - I want to be completely open with my partner and communicate with him to work things out, which is something she doesn't do. I want a healthy relationship where I learn who my partner is in his entirety before committing to him in marriage and I want him to do the same for me, but she doesn't believe that's possible and is against me spending a lot of time with him. I don't know how else I can learn more about him if I can't spend time with him, and every time she tells me to leave him, it triggers me and makes me immediately want to cry and I get angry with her. She makes me want to move out but says that if I do, I can forget about coming home and calling her my mom. 

My brother says she acts this way because she's lonely and has a bad way of expressing it. I don't know what to do. It's so hard to spend time with her when 75% of the time is spent by her getting angry at me with things I've done in the past or berating me about how ""horrible"" my partner is. I want to move out so I can have some space, but she won't allow that without burning bridges.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just so frustrated and at a loss for what to do. Does anyone else have a relationship like this with their mom? Or do you have any advice on how to work this out? I'm okay with talking about it through DMs too, I just really need some advice on how to make everyone happy, if that's even possible. Thanks for reading.",26Feb2019,1

After my first suicide attempt it really changed my perspective on things for a few weeks.

44,"About a year and a half ago, I vented on here about breaking up with an ex girlfriend of 4 years and how abusive I was in the relationship. Since then, a lot has happened with this ex, and especially recently that has me concerned about a few things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up trying out a few things for things to be safe, but it only ended up making things more problematic. I tried keeping my distance while still trying to appease her, that didn't work out. Ended up stepping on some toes that way, but I digress. We'd have this cycle of stepping on each other's toes, block each other, live for a few weeks to a month or two without each other, she tries to contact me, I'm initially stubborn until I just want it to stop and bring her back. It's stayed this way for about a year, more or less. Despite knowing this, I'm not sure when I noticed the signs of her maybe being obsessed, but I do know that it's been like this for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

Around June last year, I attended an anime convention with a few friends and stayed in the city it was hosted in for a few nights. I remember that she messaged me one night I was at the con, the first night actually. That night, she got somewhat emotional in the messages, saying stuff how I'm one of the good things to come out of my hometown. It was out of nowhere, and I didn't really know why it was mentioned. Let's go to October, where the cycle happened again. I had said a comment that was out of line, I tried to apologize, she got extremely upset with me and it ended in me blocking her for the rest of the year. Come the week of New Year's Eve, and I hear from some friends that she's crying over me nonstop. During our ""breaks"", she'd usually still think of me, and I believe at times she'd cry over me. The primary reason why she cried over me during the week of New Year's Eve was because my birthday was coming up (January 4th) and she would always think of me during this time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I go to check her Twitter during that week, which was a mistake. There was a string of tweets talking about me vaguely, how abusive I was in the relationship, etc. The mistake here isn't just going to her Twitter, the mistake is retweeting a picture I liked that she retweeted (iirc, it was some art of Joker from P5). Next thing I know, I wake up to several messages on my phone on Facebook messenger (the one place I forgot about). I think to myself ""I'll just leave her on read, I'm not dealing with this today."" This went on for a few days. She kept messaging me on Messenger, I'd leave her on read, rinse and repeat. It got to a point where one of my friends was in a private call with her on Discord and she was uncontrollably crying over me. I know the wise decision would be to block her there, too, but I'd always get this awful feeling from blocking someone that I didn't want to deal with at that time. Come the day of my birthday, and I had enough. I talked as calmly as I did, and that part of the cycle finished. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago or so, she had told me that she still loved me, but she told me she'd never act on the feelings as she's soon getting engaged to her current boyfriend. I had to tell her straight up that even if she did act on her feelings, I'd turn her away as I didn't love her anymore. As far as how today goes, she cries over me still, even though we don't fight. It's more so out of concern now because I've recently tried to take up some alternatives to weight loss with intermittent fasting and she keeps telling me not to do it because to her, it's basically the same as starving myself. She had even gone to ask someone who's an inspiration to me for advice on talking me out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So with all this being said, is it just me? I hope it's just me because I don't want to seem like I'm getting the wrong idea. She even recently told me that it's not really love that she feels for me, but more like just nostalgic feelings from our relationship whenever she sees something I'm into such as a game or an anime.",26Feb2019,1

Here's a bit of background. Me and these particular two friends (Lewis and Peter) attend the same school (the three of us are male) and we're all rather close. We've all slept in the same bed together at one point or another, were honest about our problems, we hang out all the time, etc. Basically, we're all very good friends. Lewis hosted a party a few days ago which I didn't end up attending because I was extremely tired. I was messaged later by Peter asking if I'd ""heard anything interesting"" about the after-party. I said no and asked why he'd brought it up, but he never got around to responding. I then asked Lewis about it, and he said he would tell me the next time we were in class together.

Fast forward to this week, and I asked him about what had happened. Basically, the long and the short of it was that they had ""sword fought"" in the bathroom together. I interpreted this as just being a funny dare or something to that effect, and it wasn't spoken of any further. Later on that day, though, Peter told me a little bit more. It turned out that they were legitimately dating, and someone it hadn't gotten through my thick skull. I was caught off guard by this, as I'd known them both previously to be VERY straight, and now they suddenly were bi and dating. I thought the weird feeling in my stomach was just mild shock and it would go away eventually, but it hasn't. I don't know what my problem is. I have quite a few gay friends, and I've not even felt uncomfortable thinking about their relationships before. It's not an issue of me being jealous or grossed out by the revelation of me having slept in the same bed as two bi guys, but something is definitely making me uncomfortable.

Am I just an asshole? I'm obviously still going to be their friend and do things with them, this whole situation to me just feels very unnatural. I suppose it's hard to judge that without knowing them, but they would be two of the last people I expected to get together. I'm not sure how to proceed. If anyone has had a similar experience or anything at all to offer, I'd appreciate it.",26Feb2019,0
47,"So, I've been dating this girl for about a month and I REALLLLLYYY like her I mean like holy shit I love her. Last night at like 9 or 10 I texted her back something and she hadn't answered by 12 or 1230. Normally we're up texting til 1 or 2 but it was a schoolnight (I'm in college, first year, she's a senior in high school) so I decided I was gonna go to bed early. I wasn't sure if she was asleep so I texted her goodnight have a good day tomorrow etc with some smiley faces. Was gonna wait a sec to see if she answered and if not was gonna spam some hearts :) so, she answered and said her phone woke her up when I texted her and I was like omg I'm so sorry I hope you get back to sleep super quick and have a great day tmrw with a bunch of hearts. She texted me no no don't worry you're fine with a bunch of hearts and said text you in the morning cutie. So she doesn't text me all day so I figure at night I'll text her and ask her how her day went. I do, and she says she couldn't get back to sleep last night (basically from 12am to 8am) and I felt soo bad. I texted her omg I'm so sorry I feel awful I'll never text you gn if you might be asleep again!
Is this like a potential relationship ruining thing or what? I feel so bad, what should I do?

48,"So I’ve been working at my job for just more than 2 months. The pay is okay as a regular worker but the supervisors obviously make a descent amount more. I try my best to work as hard and focused as I can every time I’m here. Apparently one of my supervisors has been taking note of how much I’ve been exceeding expectations. Now keep in mind there has been people who have had their job here for about a year(some been there longer). He recently told me that he’s considering making me a supervisor.  He really leveled with me so I knew he was serious about this. The place is ran very lax by the managers.  I guess  I don’t really know how to feel about this situation. The only thing that looms over me is that, like shouldn’t  there be someone who is better fit for the position than me? I’m not really a type of worker that tells people “go do this” or “go do that for me”.. I’m simply just a foot soldier who works his tail off and nothing more really. I haven’t even learned every aspect this job entails. Like I know about 80-90% but that’s about it. I guess I just need some advice on how to handle a situation like this because it kinda makes me feel a little weird that there’s more people who’ve been there forever and I’m kinda JUST getting good at my job. 

Any advice or feedback would be appreciated. Thanks",26Feb2019,2

I took the video on vacation, and didn't feel like messing with it, so I told him to go ahead if he wanted the karma. He uploaded it to youtube and posted to r/videos. The actual post didn't do anything spectacular, less than 400 upvotes. But the youtube video has almost 20,000 views. My friend was contacted by a representative from ViralHog with a potential monetary option. My friend told me all of this via Messenger, and said I had two options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I could either reach out to the ViralHog rep directly (I have the email), or 

2. I can sign the rights of the video over to my friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am assuming I would not make any money doing the second option. So I wondering why my friend even offered. Is there some sort of benefit to taking the second option? The only one I see is it is potentially less work. I am not sure how much of my time the ViralHog thing would take. It's been up for about 3 days and it's gotten like 20,000 views.

I have a cycle. I feel inspired and I want to make something. I grab and pencil, I sit down and I try to draw what I can see onto the paper. But as more and more of the image develops onto the paper the more I realize just how ugly it turns out. Then I get frustrated and I start loathing myself for making something so crappy and I get depressed and I just spend an hour like that untill I give up again.

I'm nervous sometimes going to school.
I'm nervous meeting new people.
I'm occasionally nervous even going outside my house.
I'm nervous going to my piano lessons.
I'm nervous when I'm alone in a public (and sometimes private) place.

53,"So I've never thought I'd ever be asking an advice about this. Just by looking at me (a woman in my twenties' if that matters), you would never say I have a problem talking to people. From what I can gather, most of the people think I am friendly and communicative but very hard to get to know. From my side, I've started noticing that bonding with people is becoming harder and harder. 
Talking to people is becoming impossible. I feel stuck in a whirlpool of smalltalk, which I hate, without being able to talk about anything else because I always assume that the other person won't be interested in what I have to say or doesn't need to know what I have to say. This leads to shallow conversations and awkward pauses, which makes me feel ever more self conscious. 
The thing is snowballing quite hard, and I am starting to feel that now, whenever I know that I have to meet people / network in any way, it makes me nervous and makes me always think about the mechanics of the conversation which shouldn't happen. You shouldn't have to think about breathing in order to breathe.
The question ""ok what do we talk about now?"" completely blocks my mind, and I say even less. This makes me think that people find me boring. 
I'd like talking to people and really connecting to them to become natural again and hate to be realising that I'm building barriers in my head. I'll appreciate any advice on how to get rid of them. Thanks!",26Feb2019,1

56,"For some background, my mom immigrated from Vietnam to the US in the 80s and has pretty traditional Vietnamese values and morals (parents are most important, pre-marital sex is out of the question, living with someone of the opposite sex before marriage is out of the question, etc.)

So I'm 25F with a well-paying job and I have the means to live on my own but I live with my parents since my job requires a lot of travel and my parents want me to stay home anyways until I'm married. I didn't mind living at home with my parents until I got into a relationship that my mom is against and for extremely petty reasons.

1. My mom has always wanted me to date a boy who's from the same ethnicity and believes in the same religious beliefs as she does and now I am, but because he doesn't speak the language very well, she doesn't consider him as part of our same ethnicity.
2. He's studying a health profession field, and because of that he will graduate with some debt, so she says I shouldn't date him because he has debt. (My previous relationship was with someone without debt and she told me at the time that money doesn't matter and that I should be with someone who matches me, so that's contradictory)
3. I tell her that I really like him because he's compassionate, kind, and clicks with me in ways no one else has, but she discredits all this and says that it's all a facade and once I marry him and live with him, that's when he'll ""show his true nature"" and I'll be miserable and fight with him all the time.
4. She picks the most random things to be upset with him about - his hair, his mouth shape - and says I should leave him because of them.
5. She thinks that he'll leave me once he finds out I'm not a virgin and that all men base a woman's worth on their virginity. This is so dumb and is absolutely not the case since my bf and I are sexually active and he's a very fair and open-minded person and doesn't follow those traditional values.
6. Whenever she finds out I'm hanging out with him, she tells me I need to be home by 8PM and constantly spams my phone when I'm out late. The curfew keeps getting earlier and earlier, from 10, to 9, to 8. 

All the reasons that she tells me to leave him are ridiculous and she always has side comments like, ""I can't tell you what to do so you'll have to live with your own mistakes"" whenever I disagree with her and it's so condescending. I think she's projecting what happened to her with my dad to me and my current relationship, but I don't want any surprises like she had - I want to be completely open with my partner and communicate with him to work things out, which is something she doesn't do. I want a healthy relationship where I learn who my partner is in his entirety before committing to him in marriage and I want him to do the same for me, but she doesn't believe that's possible and is against me spending a lot of time with him. I don't know how else I can learn more about him if I can't spend time with him, and every time she tells me to leave him, it triggers me and makes me immediately want to cry and I get angry with her. She makes me want to move out but says that if I do, I can forget about coming home and calling her my mom.

My brother says she acts this way because she's lonely and has a bad way of expressing it. I don't know what to do. It's so hard to spend time with her when 75% of the time is spent by her getting angry at me with things I've done in the past or berating me about how ""horrible"" my partner is. I want to move out so I can have some space, but she won't allow that without burning bridges.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just so frustrated and at a loss for what to do. Living with her has become so hard. Does anyone else have a relationship like this with their mom? Or do you have any advice on how to work this out? I'm okay with talking about it through DMs too, I just really need some advice on how to make everyone happy, if that's even possible.

70,"I have a friend who I know from church. We hang out at events maybe 2 or 3 times a week, always with a group and never really 1-on-1. He works a full-time (9-5) job instead of attending college, like me, so our schedules are sorta weird. The friend lives about 50 minutes out of town where he works.

The issue is that when we have events in the evening for our church or if a group is hanging out, he will call me asking to hang out before the group. The way he words it, though, is that he ""*needs something to do*."" He will never text me asking; it is **always** a direct phone call asking what I'm doing from x-o'clock to y-o'clock. He needs something to do because he lives too far away to go home and come back in time for the event to start.

Being a nice guy, I chose to spend time with him one time before an event. We went to a coffee shop for about an hour (I got coffee, he did not). He did not engage in any meaningful conversation and simply sat on his phone. This left a bad taste in my mouth, obviously, so every time he asks me to spend time with him before something, I always make an excuse, because I know he really doesn't want to hang, he just doesn't want to be bored alone.

Should I say something to him about this behavior? I'm positive I am not the only one of his friends who he calls when put in this situation, so it might be annoying to those other people, too.

So me being a genius I've lead my life to an interesting crossroads. This is obviously an alt for privacy issues. 

(Skip to end for the question)

Let's have some background on yours truly

Born in the charming suburbs near a place that rhymes with Tort Tagg our protagonist lived in a small but charming home. Life was good for a period of seven years. Dad would go off for work and Mom would be home with me. I behaved in school and got ""grades"" that didn't disappoint. Being the oblivious kid I was, I was happy. I played with the neighbor's kid from across the street often. 

Well apparently my grace period ended, my parents got divorced because due to my Dad's work he was gone for awhile. At this point my Dad let my mom have the house and moved to an apartment roughly ten minutes away. I would visit on the weekends and we would play videogames and go to Boston Market. Life was okay at this point in time. 

My mom met my now Stepfather, I didn't really understand the relationship at the time so I didn't think much of it. My Dad was never angry or raised his voice but my Mom would lose her temper and then go into a fit of crying once the argument would end.

Skipping three years I've moved to Texas as my Stepdad got out of the Air Force and went to work for Boeing and Dad moved back to the house In North Carolina. Texas was a smooth period, I did good in school and lived on a literal side of a hill so flat ground was lacking which annoyed 11 year old me at the time. 

Anyways, lo and behold another promotion so I was in the suburbs in San Antonio, and went back to normal life for me. I made friends and we would play Halo and we would have two people on top of my bunk bed and two on bottom with a blanket separating the two team's views. 

I also had the opportunity to visit my Dad at this time by flying to North Carolina. Suprisingly my old friend still lived there and we enjoyed catching up while also enjoying time with my Dad and his girlfriend. They had this German Shepherd named Sahara that always followed me around the house and slept in the room I was in. When I left my Dad told me she would go looking for me. She died years later. 

I moved two weeks later.

From here I moved out to Missouri and spent one and roughly half a year in a medium sized town without events worth mentioning. I turned 13 and had just made a fairly nice group of friends.

I moved in a year. 

So a large chapter of my life finally begins. I lived in a small touristy winery town. Had its beautifil parts and kind of shady parts but I loved it. I did good in school and got suspended twice for ""fighting"". This was sixth grade by the way so it really wasn't serious. Nothing much happened besides me joining the cross country team in seventh and eigth grade while doing track in the summer. 

After eighth grade obviously I went into High School had my shares of troubles with just normal stuff. Oh did I mention I have two brothers now? Both were seven and eight at this time. Yeah I got shoved into a wall for asking one of them to clean up an area of the room I was tidying up. I was quote, ""not the boss of anything.""  There were small incidents like this sporadically. 

I was never the extreme athlete, I did okay in sports but never played football against my Stepad's encouragment. 

(I would learn later his high school team always went to state and he played football in college.)

I was a Varsity hurdler and was the best shooter on the High School trap team and life was good besides a C+ in Geometry. 

Here comes the big hit.

I ran a meme page on instagram at the time, I was proud of myself as it had around 3.5k followers and was growing. Well my friend was asking me about some text he wanted for a meme so I sent it to him. Now I was an edge lord and liked sll the edgy and dark humor I could think of. Well for some reason he posted it on his snapchat story and we both caught suspensions for 1 1/2 weeks and talks with the police.

(Yeah we were genius idiots)

Anyways, on the way home I got punched in the face by my Stepdad. Surprisingly, he's good at multitasking because he didn't even swerve. Anyways we got home and I was told to go into basement of our house where we kept firearms in hard cases and I was told to secure all ammunition and firearms and bring them to the safe. Sounds dumb right? I thought about shooting myself right then and there out of shame for my actions. I didn't so we have this ""amazing"" story. Afterwards my room was cleaned out spare my bed and desk. This went on for two months at home.

I came back and kicked off of the trap team obviously. I had a certain stigma surrounding me with some teachers but most understood I just had a fucked sense of humor and it was found out under unfortunate circumstances. 

Anyways I saw my dad again during the summer but he lived in New Mexico. I was there for a week and it was probably one of the best times of my life. I never wanted to leave but, alas I had to fly back to Missouri and spend time getting lost in Atlanta trying to find the right gate. 

So our brave protagonist returns, ecstatic and as happy as he's been in months. His grand ride to retun home he was given grave news.

I was told we were moving roughly a month after this fun escapade. So I made the most of my summer break after school ended. Parties and other random bullshit me and my friends did because I was leaving. 

Maybe my fuckup was the motivation for the move but my stepdad was still moving up in the world. 

So I'm in West Virginia now. 

(Here comes the Country Roads joke)

I was stuck in a hotel for a month for my opening of sophomore year at a new school. 

My grades started slipping. 

My GPA went from 3.5 to 3.0 fast. Math and Spanish challenged me now. I was competent at all my other classes. I managed to pass my Math and Spanish classes for first semester. 

So here we are in 2019 with my second semester here. Grades are already bad in math but spanish is improving. 

Now here's the interactive part of the presentation ladies and gentlemen. 

What should our favorite screwup do now?




So here's the real question

Remain in West Virginia or move to New Mexico?

Recently, my car was totaled (in a not at fault accident). I drove a 2010 Toyota Prius, 126,000 miles. I now have to replace it. Sad face. 

I’ve always wanted a good looking car, and to me, it makes sense to me to buy it now that I’m young, unmarried, and have no kids. I’m still sort of in a dilemma though. 

There is a 2009 BMW 3 Series, with 76,000 miles on it, for 7,995$. 

There is a  2010 Toyota Prius, 113,000 miles, for 7995$.

I drive 480 miles total each week, with a commute to and from work. 

I definitely know my gas cost is gonna go up, and the maintenance is 2x more, but which would be the better car for this given mileage and longevity? I want the BMW because it looks nice and has all the toys I’ve wanted (Bluetooth, Moonroof, Backup Camera, Heated Seats, Leather and wood interior). I could also see the Toyota, though, because of the gas mileage and because Toyota’s are generally long lived cars (also has Bluetooth and Backup camera).

Help meeee. I’ve looked at and driven both cars, I just need some swaying either way. ",26Feb2019,0
79,"Hello. This would be a relatively short post. I turn to this forum to ask for advice. I have a friend who is currently studying in a different city from where she was born and where her family and friends are. The career she chose to study is available in our city, but there is a problem: it's likely that a transfer to the local university is not possible anymore and, therefore, my friend would end up losing a year of study if she decided to come back. However, even when to stop studying for a whole year is a piece of advice that I wouldn't give to anyone, she is suffering there: she feels lost, alone and often sad and, based on my best judgment, I consider that to miss a full year of study is worth it if it implies a better mental and emotional state for her. I am one of those who believe that individual wellbeing is placed above everything else, but I really don't know how I should act in this situation. I don't want to pressure her to take any alternative, because to see her ""losing"" a year is painful. But it's more painful to watch her suffer, to listen to her frustrations and her sadness. I'll be there for her, but I want to see her shining and happy. In the end it's her decision, but I'd like to be able to act in the best way possible to help her reach the option that best suits her needs and idea of happiness. What should I do?",26Feb2019,2

At this point I'm just at my wits end and I'm tired of it beyond any point than I have been before. Today I did something I never have before during an argument, I tried to talk to my parents.  Separately and individually I tried talking to them about how I felt in general and about the current situation, what imo was the best course of action, and slightly touched on the other's views to each other. 

It fell entirely flat of course. I tried but they both seemed to get what I was saying but also interpreted it entirely differently than intended and took it in a much more negative way than I intended. My dad even came back at the end after a bit to tell me he's glad I spoke up but at the same time I have my own stuff to deal with, my messy room. 

So basically now I feel defeated. And like what I did was 100% useless and just a waste of time. I just feel like shit basically. And I'm tired of it. I'm sick of crying now. Sick of the nausea and headaches. The anxiety. I'm just, over it.

I had felt like she was going to be infatuated for the first few months and then discard the dog when it began to get big or exhibit behavioral problems.

Boy was I spot on. In fear of the dog being around the younger kids, the dog is kept in a small crate all day every day with a blanket over it. The dog is only let out maybe 2-3 times a day for a 5 min bathroom break. 

Every time I try and play with the dog, I physically can’t. It jumps all over me and ties my feet together when running around me. Now whenever I come to the house, the dog cries for me because I’m the only person who had given her proper exercise in the past few months.

I just feel so sad and stuck. I ask my boyfriend to take the dog out and exercise her since he lives there. He always tells me it’s not his responsibility and that he shouldn’t have to take care of her.

89,"So this is pretty minor, but I need some advice. On Friday I’m celebrating my 21st birthday by having (at most) 14 friends over. The thing is, I live in an apartment building with lots of neighbors. I don’t plan on it being rowdy at all, but my friends tend to get pretty loud and can make a LOT of noise. 

My friends on the other side of the apartment complex have parties all the time and nobody seems to mind, but I’m worried my direct neighbors won’t be as tolerant. The last party my friends had, there were about 100 people there in the little tiny apartment and they got 16 noise complaints and shut down by the cops. I’ve never thrown a party here before and I’m worried they’ll get annoyed and file a noise complaint even if it’s a small one. 

So what I’m thinking of doing, is writing a letter to each of my direct neighbors (above, on either side, across the hall etc) to let them know I’m planning on having a party on Friday and we’re going to do our best to keep the volume down, and apologize ahead of time if we get too loud. However, my neighbor did this before his 100-person party, and one of the neighbors just stuck the note back on his door. I’m also thinking I could go the extra mile and tell them they’re welcome to join us, because they may not be as annoyed if they’re invited (they’re all college students too so it’d be nice to get to know them). However, I’m worried that if they accept, it’ll just add to the volume. 

Have any college aged students here dealt with this before? How do I keep the volume low? How do I approach my neighbors about it so they don’t file a noise complaint? Thank you! ",26Feb2019,3

93,"TL;DR at bottom

During my last class of the day a couple weeks ago, I saw an envelope on the floor with my friend's name on it (it's a very unique name). I picked it up, planning to return it to her because she must have dropped it, and an invite fell out. I picked it up, glanced at it, and saw that one of my other friends (let's call them 1) was having a party. I put it back in the envelope, and before I walked out of the school, I found 1 and gave them the envelope, saying that I found it in my class, and asked 1 to return it to her because I ""know you guys are close friends"". They said thanks, and I left. I thought about it, and I was kind of hurt. I'm not 1's ""best friend"" or anything, but we're close. We talk in class and after school, and they're someone I like to be around. I thought that it was either that they didn't want me at their party (maybe it was just for a small group of friends), or they just didn't bring an invite for me (maybe they forgot it). I left it at that and waited, but nothing.

The next day, I wanted to find out, so in class (we had a couple minutes at the end just to talk and do HW or something, so the room was pretty noisy), I said ""Happy birthday, 1!"" They said, ""Oh, it's not my birthday."" I lied and said that I had heard people in the hallway saying ""birthday"" and ""1"", so I just thought it was their birthday. 1 said, ""Oh, they're probably just talking about my Sweet 16. I keep forgetting to bring in the invites."" I said, ""Oh! Ok,"" and that was it. 

I was kind of more confused, because they probably wouldn't have mentioned the party if they didn't want me knowing about it, much less say that they were slow with invitations. They'd probably say, ""I don't know why they're saying that, that's weird."" So I thought maybe I WAS invited, and they were saying that they forgot to bring mine. Either way, I waited another day, and still nothing.

I mean, I was (and still am) totally fine with not going. It's their day, and they deserve to have whomever they want come. If that doesn't include me, so be it. I just wanted to know, so I wasn't kept in suspense until the day of, when I'd check my SnapChat or something and see that the party was happening without me. I just want to know, lol.

Anyways, I was talking to one of my close friends, whom I trusted (let's call them 2). I asked 2 if they were going to 1's party, and they said, ""Yeah, are you?"" I said I didn't know. I asked them if they could ask 1 in their next shared class, ""Do you know if \[my name\]'s going to your party?"" Apparently, 1 said ""I don't know, I didn't think to invite her"". Which made me think, oh, ok, I'm not invited. Whatever at this point, haha. But as I thought about it, I guess it could mean they just forgot??? Idk.

And today, we talked for a bit after school. They were totally normal, and everything was fine. So obviously they're not upset or anything at me.

Anyways, I just want to know if I'm invited or not. Obviously I'd LIKE to be, but I'm ok with not being invited. Again, it's their day, and who they invite is up to them. 

So my question/advice request is this: how can I find out? I don't want to confront them, because if I ask, ""Am I invited or not?"", I feel like that puts pressure on them to invite me out of being polite. I can't ask anyone to ask 1 again, because then they'll know that I know. I'm thinking of sending them a text saying Happy Birthday, and then acting confused when they say it isn't or something, and maybe asking if they're having a party? That's my best bet at this point.

Any advice on how to find out without pressuring them into inviting me? The date on the invite said party's sometime in April from what I remember, so I have a little bit of time.

TL;DR: Found out a friend is having a party. How can I ask them if I'm invited without pressuring them into inviting me out of politeness?",26Feb2019,1

95,"TW: depression

There's a lot of backstory behind all this, so there's a TL;DR. (You have to read the TL;DR, then I'll write out some more details under it)

My therapist told my mother not to push me and try to read an email that I wrote when I was feeling very depressed. When we got home, my mother forced me to write my email password and type it in on her cpu. She is reading the email, even though I said it made me feel uncomfortable and it was an intrusion of privacy. Mother said that ""it was her job to protect me""

Yesterday night, the police literally knocked on the door of my house and asked if I was home (my dad answered the door) because of a teacher who had *reported an email I sent to her to the school.* I'm not angry at this teacher, because she did the right thing, but the administrators who got the email decided to *call the goddamn police.* My parents were home and I got called outside where I told them a very downplayed version of the story. My father will not stop going on about this, and today I had gone to a session with my therapist. I was really blunt with her and told her everything and my therapist said that because I was a minor, she was obligated to tell my mother (even though the admins had already done so) that she should be careful about me. She said to her though, ""Please don't push (my name) and ask her to show you the email"". My mother and I had a good conversation in the car, but now my mother is accusing me of lying to her about my email password (which I was forced to give to her). I had *accidentally* said my password had a 8 instead of a 7. She said it hadn't worked and I logged in for her, and she said ""WAIT, THAT'S A 8 NOT A 7, ARE YOU LYING TO ME?"" I said to her that I had accidentally written 8 instead of 7, but then IN FRONT OF ME, she said ""Liar. Now show me the email that you sent to (teacher)."" I begged her and said ""please Mom, this is an intrusion of privacy"" but NOOOO. She made me show it and we had a short yelling match. I stormed away. It's a very long email including LOTS of bad thoughts and some very \*ahem\* suicidal thoughts. I quickly went upstairs and blocked her computer from my email, but I don't know what's going to happen. Knowing google, since she was already on the page, nothing will happen as she reads it. I'm really mad because that email was NOT MEANT FOR HER. Advice?",26Feb2019,1

103,"Now before anyone bashes me in the comments: no, I don't deliberately act like this because I see myself as superior to others or because I think I'm perfect in some way. Anyways, I am a hobbyist artist and creative writer who designs their own characters from time to time. I've been an ""artist"" since I was four years old, and I got into basic character creation around the age of 10 or 11, I'd say. I've been doing both for years now, and I genuinely enjoy writing and drawing. I'm definitely not the best in either and nowhere near that godly tier, but I've been going along and trying to improve at my own pace in both areas. However, I become noticeably uncomfortable and unsettled when I receive criticism, constructive criticism, or other types of advice from other people; this isn't limited exclusively to art and writing, but it is especially prominent considering these are the two areas in particular I have been working at for years. I don't necessarily argue back with the people who criticise me--I usually just give a ""thank you"", nod, and promptly change whatever it is they indicated--but my face does flush up and I start to get a rush of disappointing (is that the word? I can't really describe it, but just a general jumble of negativity) thoughts that flood my mind, if that makes any sense?
Honestly, I personally believe the root of my problem with criticism comes from the fact that I have low self-esteem and self-loathing tendencies, which is another issue I've struggled with for basically all my life. I tend to heavily berate myself and criticise my own doings, so there's this... uncomfortable feeling I get when others point out my flaws for me.
Point is: I'd like to change and be able to take the hits with more grace and dignity, since I do understand that I'm definitely error-prone just as any other human and will inevitably be criticised for the rest of my life, no matter now uncomfortable I am with it.

I don’t want to act like this doesn’t exist, and I don’t want to act incredibly sorry for her making it harder for her to let go. 

On one hand I can see how pretending it’s a non issue will make it harder by making her see the way her life used to be before she was sick. Bunny doesn’t want to die and she’s not ready, so I can see how this will make it harder for her to let go. 

On the other hand, I can’t help feeling a little bit sorry for her. What she’s going through is very hard for a 16 year old girl, and I want to be there and show some empathy for her, but I’m afraid of making her feel guilty for being sick because she’s “upsetting her friends”.

BUT CAN YOU STOP CONSTANTLY BRINGING UP YOUR EXES,  I don't care about them,  I care about US. Why is she still worried about them? How do I bring this up and how can I get her to stop bringing them up without sacrificing the promise I made. 
TL;DR: Girlfriend constantly brings up exes, sick and tired of it. ",26Feb2019,1
109,"Hi, I’ve attached a link to pics of what I look like. I was wondering what others would suggest for me/what you think would suit me best. I tend to like my hair lighter because I am generally paler and I feel like it compliments my skin tone but I actually have no idea. I also think mid length hair suits my face shape best. I’m looking to change my style up for spring and summer though. 

I’m not sure if there is a better place for me to post but thanks to everyone in advance!

110,"I (14M) am dating a beautiful girl (14F). We had our first date at the mall last Sunday. It went pretty well, we hugged and kissed, normal date stuff ig. But she gave me one of her scrunchies and she mentioned that it smells like her. When we were together I noticed she smelled really good and I even told her that. I'm pretty sure it's just perfume but it smells really good. Anyways, when I got home from the mall, I smelled the scrunchy and it smelled amazing, I'm slightly obsessed with smell. Am I a weirdo for liking the smell of her? or more specifically, her scrunchy? I'm just kinda concerned that being almost obsessed with a smell is considered ""creepy"" so any feedback helps.",26Feb2019,1
111,"I fucked up.

I work in a computers shop, nothing too great but it's the job I've always wanted because it'd give me the opportunity to learn hardware and practice my social skills.

After almost two months unemployed applying in shitty call centers and asking myself if I should sell icecream on the streets or sweep the floor I finally found it! A job in a computers shop in a nice area, above minimun wage with nice bosses and good coworkers. It's almost too good to be true.

And then I fucked up.

A coworker told me that when I told the customers about the computers I could give them a small discount, think of $15 dollars. She did it a couple of times to show me and it was great.

So I started doing the same these days and... well... I had my first sale today but when I told my boss I was about to sell a computer, guess what, the discount didn't apply to all the computers because some of them were already discounted! But I didn't know! 

Well... my boss choosed to confront the client, tell them I was new and the client almost left because they got kind of dissapointed to pay more of what I promised. I asked my boss to not dissapoint the client and to just discount it from my salary. My boss didn't do it.

Okay, not that bad, the customer ended up buying the computer, what's the big deal? All right, in the shop when a client is interested in a computer but they're not buying it in the moment we give them a sheet with the computer requirements and the price.

Imagine how many sheets I've given in these four days.

Eight.

Imagine you live in a cheap thirld world country where $120 is a third of your salary.

I fucked up. Tomorrow is my free day (I work six days a week) and we're talking about this on wednesday.

I'm so scared I wanna cry :c I don't care to have my salary cut I just don't want to dissapoint the clients and lose my bosses and coworkers' trust. Sorry for my english btw.",26Feb2019,1

113,"I'm applying to Nursing school, which requests that I have an ""academic reference"", ie, a reference from an academic source which in my case can only be my old high school teachers. As I've been out of high school for almost five years now, I was a little worried that my teachers wouldn't remember me. I ended up emailing two teachers with whom I had a good relationship with while in school - my English and Biology teachers.

&amp;#x200B;

My English teacher got back to me first, and over the next couple of days we sent emails to each other figuring out the process. I was grateful that she'd be willing to be my reference, despite not talking for so long. (I had moved away and, with the exception of a visit to them both a year after school, basically haven't so much as talked to them)

After receiving her final email, I received a message in my inbox: my Biology teacher, who until now had been busy correcting mid-term exams, finally got back to me, saying that she could be my reference. Figuring that a Biology teacher might have better weight in a medical science program, (not to mention I did far better in her classes) I received her information and used that one instead. 

I thought that that was that, and let it rest, not wanting to tell my teacher that I decided to go with the newer request. Until today.

I logged on to my email (I don't do this daily), and noticed that 5 days ago, my English teacher had emailed me, saying that she didn't receive a form for the reference from the school, and she was concerned because the deadline was approaching. It only just occurred to me that she likely had taken the time to write a letter already, and felt incredibly discourteous for not telling her she wouldn't have to write one anymore. But I still don't know if I should just tell her that I thought someone else would do a better job - and that I was too stupid to realize that people likely write a reference for you before getting the form.

Should I just be completely honest with her, and tell her that I wasted her time and didn't use her as a reference? I really don't want to ignore her email and don't know what to say.",26Feb2019,1

115,"So for a bit of context, I first met my friend online (About 4 months ago) and it's stayed that way. I reached out to her just to look for a friendship, I don't want to get into specifics about what exactly the friendship involves, it involves a lot of guidance and advice. In return, I joke a lot with her and in general just be there. It's not a one-way deal, just to make that clear.   
  
About a month ago in mid-January she was in the hospital and she said she needed time to be with her family, about a month's time. Which I respected and gave her room, only message her a few times just because I had some important issues I needed advice on.   
  
I misread some of how she was feeling and messaged her quite a bit in late January. All the conversations were as though nothing was different. I didn't realize it at the time but about 1 week later I realized just how much of a dick I was acting like. She still needed time to be with her family at that point. So I waited out, for the approximate time she needed. Waited a bit longer after that to get another conversation going (Last week in fact, Sunday). Again, that conversation was like nothing different. Got the impression she still needed a while to get back into the groove of things so I respected that again.   
  
I tried to message her last week Friday to no avail. Tried Saturday again to no avail. So I said to myself I would wait. I would wait until I got a response or something. But I just don't know if I can because I see she left me on read. I know it's a short time frame but looking back at our conversations, it definitely seems like our connection is slipping away. I want to message her but I'm afraid I'll dig myself in a further hole.   
  
Our last conversation, she pointed a thing out about myself that I spent the entire week working on. I know it will make her happy, I just don't know if she'll see it as genuine. I want to ask if she wants to renew the friendship as well, I know that's the best solution to re-establishing the friendship. I just don't know when I should message her again.  
  
If you need context on anything, I'll be happy to provide. For example, she is a fair amount older than me so I know she lives a hectic/busy life. ",26Feb2019,1

The mom, unfortunately, has breast cancer and lives with HER mom and her dad and her husband and two kids. I was doing everything except spending time with the kids. I was cooking, cleaning, doing everything around the house. She fired me because I wasn't spending enough time with the kids.

About a month after that in November around Thanksgiving my uncle died. We had been spending a lot of time together in the last few months of his life and I miss him so much. It rips me up inside everyday when I think about him, but I know he is happier this way, because he was very unhappy while alive.

Then, around Christmas, my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me. We hadn't been spending a lot of time together because of everything I had been going through, and because my physical health is not too well. It takes me a lot to even get out of bed mentally and physically.

An old friend of mine stopped being friends with me for something I didn't do.

My parents are getting a divorce.

125,"I’m a junior in high school thinking about my future, and I have many in-sate and in-country schools that i like. However a fantasy i’ve always had was visiting Canada and maybe one day living there. Not that there’s much wrong with the US, I just really like the scenery and culture of Canada, but i digress. 

So obviously, going to school in Canada seems like the perfect way to immerse myself within the country and really see if i like it.
Yes it will be expensive and I will most definitely be homesick for a while, but the idea is just so attractive that going to school in Canada (UBC or UoT) is the key.

Is it worth it, though? Should i just go to school in the states and travel abroad? If i get my degree in Canada will it even be usable within the states if i end up staying here?

130,"Hi,

I am a 21F living in the PNW. Great job in technology making $87K a year, and have a good thing going life wise with friends, finances, and my career.

However, for years I have dreamt about moving to southern California, somewhere in Los Angeles county. I lived there when I was younger and stayed many times in between then and now. Eventually I want to pursue a career that is not in technology and requires creativity (whatever that looks like for me). I don't hate tech, but it's my gig until I figure out what I want to really do and I daydream doing something in the entertainment industry.

 

Initially I set a deadline to move at the beginning of September. I decided to postpone now ""when the time feels right"" due to the following:

* I want to pay off some debt
* I would like to go skiing this winter
* I want to visit Banff

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, however, I have gotten into some great best friendships. I am a single right now and love being able to go on adventures or have wine nights with these girls or drive out into the woods and go kayaking. I adore them like sisters. It feels like that time in my life that I will look back and smile on when I am older. I fear leaving them will make me miss out on more good memories.

This being the case, the other side to it is that these girls are not single. They have their own things going on (which I respect), and I am not the type that really planned to stay in my hometown forever. I just feel less excited and motivated to move when I have great things like this going on. I have tried to fight ""settling down"" by downsizing what I own, obtaining a month to month lease, and working on saving $10K so that I can leave at the drop of a dime if I chose to.

He constantly left me or cheated on me with other girls and I finally had enough and put an end to it. We didn’t do anything sexually, just make out. It’s been 3 years since that and I’ve started dating again. Because he ruined my self esteem I made sure to bring it (my self esteem) up before I date anyone else so I don’t let them use/manipulate me. Anyway, I’ve dated two men in the last year and for some reason, I can’t date them for more than a month because I start noticing their flaws and get annoyed. I just get mad when I see them and I break it off. I don’t know why and I feel extremely bad. I wish I wasn’t like this. I have never gotten sexual with either of them but they are truly nice guys. One of my issues is that I tend to believe I love someone because they do the minimum. To elaborate on that I mean when guys do what they’re supposed to, like hold the door, compliment me, be trustworthy, etc. My ex never did that... it was just a constant battle of the unknown. I have gone to counseling and I know I am over my ex but is it possible that I’m traumatized? Am i just a cold hearted bitch?

""of course i do"" i told her. i didn't. i wanted to impress her and i knew if i showed up at her place driving, it'd only be a matter of time before she's all over me and only me. i forgot to mention, at the time she was talking to 3 other dude as well as me but i was top priority to her since we we're doing things the rest weren't so i wasn't even worried about the other guys. it did irritate me though how she would let the guys give her hickeys on her tits and how she didnt want to tell them we were friends with benefits but again, i wasn't worried. back to the story, she said ""ok come by at 10:30"". as soon as i read that, i started sweating. i had to figure out what to where, what cologne to put on, and how i would get one of my dads cars for the night in the first place. but my luck was on another level that day because i found the perfect nonchalant outfit and used up the last bit of the cologne i remember she said she liked. as for the car, my dad and my cousin, who was staying with us at the time, went out to drink. i knew where my dad kept his spare key for the other car so i figured id have the car for the rest of the night. i took the car at 10:30 (also forgot to mention me and my girlfriend were 17 at the time) and started heading to her place. this was maybe my 5th time driving and i was terrified something would happen and i'd be fucked but i wanted to see her. When i got to her place, i texted her saying “im here”. She said “ok give me a minute”. I wait 20 minutes for her to sneak out her window and her side gate. Once i saw her, i froze. Almost like i blacked out or something. She got in my car and i swear i still feel the awkwardness to this day. I started driving and we started talking. I didn’t even know where we were going but i didn't care. I was enjoying her presence. All of a sudden i had the urge to just stop the car, get in the backseat with her, and fucking her brains out. At the time we were both virgins but we were horny as hell. I didn't want to throw the idea out there though just in case she wasn't in the mood. And looking back at my backseat, we wouldn't be able to move. She then says “lets hang at a park”. I say “alright”. I saw this as a chance. Maybe if we find a park, we could get to 4th base. I google parks and to no surprise they're all closed. I then remember elementary schools have playgrounds that stay open. I google elementary schools and started driving. We went to maybe 4 different parks before we found one. When i parked and got out, i remembered the weather. Of all days in the area i live, which is always hot, it's 64 degrees. That killed any opportunity for us to do anything sexually but we still hung at the park talking and playing. She actually made a video of us that day that she still has. all that fun lasted for all of 20 minutes. Remember how i took the car? Well my dad was back home wondering where me and his car was. He called and called but i ignored the calls just to spend a little more time with her. I then started getting calls from my whole family and realized i had to leave. So did she. I answered my dad heard him yell for a bit then said i'm coming. It was quite the drive to take her more but i could just leave her there. Once we got to her place, things got even more awkward. We couldn't park in front her house so we parked down the street. I wanted to kiss her goodbye and she could tell but wanted to see how i would do it. I come up with the great idea and said “you got something on your face” then leaned in. she couldn't hold back her laugh. Neither could i. Once we finished laughing, she leaned in and so did i. That kiss was passionate. I still feel it to this day. She got out and snuck back in. i knew as soon as i got home, i'd be fucked. Scolded till the end of time but i didn't care. That night to me at the time was the best night of my life. I went home with a big ass smile.

2 days later she loses her virginity to this kid shes know for a long time. Her reason for doing this? “I knew him for a long time and i told him he'd be my first and after him id fuck other guys”. I couldn't believe it. I was so mad. I wanted to stop talking to her but obviously i didn't. I was so confused and just put in a bad space. I felt betrayed. We started going out a month after. She took my virginity 2 months later. I can never forget nor forgive her for what she did. Our relationship isn't even healthy. We've broken up 4 times but somehow always come back to each other. i no longer feel the same way towards her anymore. She's making me stop talking to one of my closest female friend just because a year ago she didn't invite my girlfriend to her birthday party. She beats up on me when i piss her off which is not hard to do since she has short temper and gets mad when i block one of her slaps. She’s very childish and is the only source of problems in my life. You know i think her and the dude she fucked were meant for eachother since both got the mind and body of a child. The dude was literally 2 years younger than her. I've been told a thousand times to dump her and move on but i just can't for some reason. Despite all that, I somehow see a future with her and her the same with me. I still spend all my free time with her. The way i see it, no ones perfect and we all make mistakes but the mistake she made a year ago will always get to me. Also if i were to leave her, id have to make sure i have a back up hoe or something but i'm too loyal to do that or cheat. I want her to know how i feel but it's just not possible and im not to sure if i could live with myself if i made someone feel the way i do. I don't want to break up with her again while were in high school because then it'll be awkward seeing her around the school. We’re about to hit our 1 year and 2 month anniversary but i don't know how much longer we'll be together if things don't change.

Well that's the end of my story, if you actually read all this, congratulations! And thanks. Please let me know if you got any comments or advice. If the way i feel can go away, i'd like to know how. I don’t know how I made it so long with her to be honest. Maybe it was because I didn’t want to be lonely and leave her. Maybe it was because she’s the only person I’ve ever fucked. I honestly hate telling this story though as it only makes me hate her more and more. She tells me she loves me alot and i say it back every time but i'm not too sure i mean it. I just might be saying it so she thinks nothings wrong…

I wrote all of this yesterday and today she told me how in june or july, she's moving somewhere 20 hours away from me because that's what her parents want. I didn't know how to feel. Maybe i needed this to happen. Maybe being alone would be best for me. Maybe her leaving is a sign to move on. Either way, our original plan was to go to colleges 10 minutes away from each other after summer but now shes leaving at the beginning of summer. I’m thinking about applying to a different college now or maybe joining the military. Things definitely are different now since we are on a timer. I think I’ll have to tell her when she moves we have to break up for the final time. She thinks we might still have a future together and I can see it too like I said earlier but everything we’ve been through in the past eats away at the back of my mind. I just don’t know what to do.

P.s. we’re planning a trip to out of county for 2 days and i'm paying for the whole thing. Its $330. Bad idea? I honestly don’t want to go because I feel like I’d be a waste of money but then again it would be a nice trip and I don’t even know how I’d tell her I don’t want to go.

P.s.s. We just talked and the same dude she lost her virginity too, hit her up today asking if she wants to talk and she said “sure”. He asked if she wants to hang on Thursday. She told me all this wondering how I would feel and I said it’s the same way I’ve always felt which is not comfortable with it. She got mad and said “why can’t I let go of the past?”. I told her how much of a hypocrite she sounded like in which we had another fight where she was mad at me because my feelings weren’t with hers. I want to leave her now. But I just don’t want to see her and the other dude around school. I’m definitely calling off our $330 trip.",26Feb2019,1

143,"I [F, 30’s] work at a technology company that’s transitioning to scrum, and I sometimes get a little uncomfortable around our scrum master [M, late 50’s]. Not sure if I’m blowing something innocent out of proportion, or if this is a little off.

We’re a pretty casual office, so I didn’t think much of it when he mentioned that his wife is much younger than him during a conversation. A couple of times when we’ve been going through the same doorway, he’s moved to put his hand on my back and I’ve moved away before he made contact. 

Last week I raised some concerns about his job performance / professional actions to his boss, and today he sent me an apology via the company electronic chat. He apologized for involuntarily making me uncomfortable (he made a comment in a team meeting towards me with a negative connotation), and included a couple of flower emojis. I clarified the problem, and he offered a reasonable way to address it if it happens again and all was good.

But I can’t help but wonder - if this apology was sent to another member of the team, would he have sent emojis? Or is that kind of weirdly unprofessional, albeit within a casual channel?

To make it clear - I am not interested in anything other than a professional working relationship with this man. My concerns about his job performance (and impact on mine / my team - I am not his boss, but have more seniority) are separate from the concerns I’ve posted. I’m hoping to get outsider perspective on if this is inappropriate, or a downside of working with someone with an older-fashioned view on workplace roles?",26Feb2019,2

147,I know the questions seems pretty silly but I’m pretty antisocial when it comes to being at home. I don’t really feel like socializing with my roommate I rather just stay in my room and do my own thing but at the same time I feel kind of bad like I’m being rude or something. I moved in with my friend after her and her bf broke up and she needed a roommate and I was looking for a new place.  She’s home pretty much all the time whereas I’m usually just here to sleep. Idk why I feel like I need to socialize with her maybe because I feel like this is her home and I’m just kind of living in it if that makes sense. Most of the furniture and stuff is all hers I really just have my room stuff. It feels weird for some reason and for the most part I don’t like being here all day if we both have the day off I rather just spend the day at my bf place and spend the night there. I guess I also don’t want her to feel alone because I know her ex really took a toll on her and they were always together so I know this is also a pretty big change for her and I do want to be there for her during this tough break up but at the same time I just want to be in my room. I guess I’m asking if it’s okay to be so antisocial at home?,26Feb2019,1
148,"So we have this very old skinny dog. He's about 9 and we got him a couple of months ago. I love him, he's silly and sassy. Though is missing one eye and is blindish in the other so he constantly runs into or over things. I'm very afraid I hurt him.  He's so frail I think I did something that may kill him. I picked him up as we tend to do but he squirmed and fell. He looked in utter shock and I feel very bad because he must have hit his mouth or bad eye because he keeps pawing at his mouth and licking around his body (something he doesn't do).

I share a room with my younger sister and I get no privacy and she is annoying as hell and just exacerbates my anger problems (I get angry super easy (like within seconds quickly) and she makes me so angry I have a) picked up scissors from my desk and walked threateningly towards her, b) thrown pencils at her several times, c) hit her so hard on the legs my own hand hurts, and several other things.


I have tried everything to get my own room: I've talked to my mother calmly, I've laid out reasons I can't share a room with her anymore, I've offered other plans of rooming BUT NOTHING. She just doesn't care and it's making me lash out at all of them. At this point the only people I would care about if they died would probably be my parents. My siblings can just... go choke on some fruit.


My brothers are both failures at life. I hate them.


I should probably go to therapy for this but my parents don't do that... I talked to my mom about it once and she shut me out. I'm just so tired of living with them and I want to get out of here. I'm just going to go to the park tomorrow after school and not come back until they decide to actually care about me.


You know what, I probably sound like a terrible teenager with a bad temper and an overreactive personality. I don't care.  There's more in my life causing me stress but this post is long enough.

When I come home it's ""oh my god you didn't clean the kitchen"" or if I ask him to take out the dog it's ""oh because I haven't talked him out every time"".

154,"So I really don’t know what to do here, if anything at all. A little context for you here. I (f18) am a senior in high school (in America). One of the teachers at my school (m40ish) is a bit.... peculiar. He’s a junior history teacher and he tends to be very... chummy with certain female students. When I was a junior in his class last year (from the ages 16 to 17) he would often single me and other female students out, commenting on our physical appearance (ex: I often drastically change my hair, and he was very complimentary every time I changed it, to the point of disrupting class to comment on it and making me very uncomfortable) and other characteristics. He was also very upfront about his romantic relationship with a woman that was about half his age. He’s also a bit violent, sometimes breaking rulers or coming to school with bloodied up knuckles with some excuse as to how he got them. Anyways, I could go on and on here about other comments and things he would do to me and other students that would make us uncomfortable but I’ll try to keep this short. Anyways, one thing he would do for every student is that, on or near your birthday, he would do this whole song and dance for you in front of the class. Embarrassing, sure, but generally innocent. However, a junior taking his class this year posted a photo of her birthday dance and.... he had a boner. Like full on, completely visible in his pants boner. Now, I DESPISE anyone who, in any fashion, commits any level of sexual misconduct, and I fear that if I don’t act someday he might actually do something to hurt a student, if you understand what I mean. But I’m also afraid that this is all a big misunderstanding, he’s just a normal, innocent guy who’s a bit socially inept and I definitely don’t want to put his career in jeopardy if that’s the case. Basically, what I’m asking here, should I just mind my business, or should I do something, and if that’s the case, what do I even do in this scenario?

TL;DR: A teacher was photographed with a full boner while singing happy birthday to a student, and had previously exemplified potential predatory behavior. Should I do something about it or just assume it’s a misunderstanding? ",26Feb2019,1

157,"I can't tell my parents because the last time I told them I felt depressed, I was in eigth grade, and they told me I didn't know what I was talking about. I'm now a junior in high school. I don't trust my parents to get me help after what they said the last time, and I don't know who to go to. If I tell a teacher, they go to the guidance counselor, and then she legally has to tell my parents that I'm possibly depressed. I don't know what to do or who to go to. Somebody, please help.

Below is an explantion of how I've been feeling for those of you who want to know. Obviously, I cannot diagnose myself, but I've read about symptoms, and I recognized some of them in myself...

I've always known I might be depressed, but it recently really hit me. I only got out of bed today because I missed a day last week. I missed that day because my body wouldn't allow me to get up.

I went five days without a shower because I didn't have the energy to walk to the bathroom. Instead, I laid in my bed and I cried for the most part. I also forgot to feed myself at some points. I only drank water to take my medicine.

I'm a month behind on my English homework, and my teacher is luckily very lienent. I'm supposed to do it all tonight. I'm supposed to read an entire book tonight. The only assignment I work on is my art project.

Today, I barely talked to anyone in school. It hurt to see my best friend with somebody who hurt me a lot (and admittedly, I hurt them too, but I tried to make things right. That person ended up giving me another chance but recently cut me off without explanation). The only time I spoke was when somebody asked me a question. When my phsyics teacher asked me if I was okay, I said ""yes,"" but almost started crying. 

In first period, I think I experienced sensory overload. My teacher was talking, and so were two of my friends, but those two friends and one teacher felt like two thousand people. I did my best to block it out, and I failed. I almost started crying again. 

I have been sluggish all day, and my sleep schedule is messed up, but that's normal for me. I don't know why I have recently just started acting like this. 

I'm sorry for such a long post, but I wanted to explain how I felt before somebody told me I was just seeking attention.",26Feb2019,11

165,"This has been bothering me more and more, I don't know what I should do so I'm hoping maybe someone here can help. Please no bashing, I'm not up for it, if you want to criticize, do it politely. (Also, this is a throwaway account).

A friend of mine has a son who is around 4 years old. He walked at a little bit over 18 months and has been showing delays in gross motor skills. 
A few months ago, he started walking on the balls of his feet, tiptoeing, and my friend has been scolding him more and more for it. 

I recently noticed he had a peculiar gait, like his belly sticks forward and he's a bit hunched back. So I paid closer attention the other day and I noticed he was showing the Gower's sign. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowers%27_sign)
He gets up that way every time, I have seen it on multiple occasions. 
This led me to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I then noticed he had basically all the other symptoms including the enlarged calves and tongue muscles. 
I figured the Gower's sign can be indicative of other issues, but in any case, it's something significant (I think). 

Adding that he's also clumsy and asks for help with multiple daily tasks, which he would normally be able to do at his age. His parents treat it as if it was laziness on his part, and it might be, I can't know. 

Now I'm not a doctor, I only researched it because I'm a curious person and then I couldn't ignore what I've noticed. But of course I can be (and hopefully am) wrong. I know no one should self diagnose and certainly not a friend's child, no need to tell me, I wish I didn't check, but I can't just pretend I didn't.

So my question is, should I tell her about my concerns? 
If I'm wrong, I'll have caused a ton of useless worry. 
But I'm afraid that if something is going on and I don't say anything, maybe they'd loose the advantage of early diagnosis. I'm also thinking about the child, what if he's really struggling physically and is getting scolded about it, it isn't fair to him. 

Also, they have a doctor whom they will see in about 8 months who will hopefully notice if something is wrong or not. Is there any point in voicing my concerns before? 

I don't know. If it were one of my children, I would prefer knowing to get an eval from a doctor so that I could have a definitive answer. But I'm not sure what she'd prefer. She's the reserved type and she doesn't like to share her feelings or worries. Maybe she's well aware and just pretends like she's not. 
She's also an adept of being ultrapositive to the point of wishful thinking, so she might be ignoring this. And she's busy with her youngest who is 6 months old so maybe she's not as focused on her eldest. I don't know, what would you do? ",26Feb2019,2

171,"My best friend ""brother from another mother"" and I have been very close for over 6 years.  A few years ago, he started dating this girl who is emotionally unstable, and physically and emotionally abusive to him.  I saw what was happening and I tried to get him to see what she was doing to him; both my partner and I spoke our peace several times and I also gave him a book about how to spot this kind of behavior and how to stop it.  He started to read the book, but stopped and always had an excuse on why he couldn't read it.  When I tried to raise my concerns to him verbally he always had an excuse for her.  One of his common excuses is that ""she was drunk.  I won't hold that behavior against her because she was drunk.  That wasn't her.""  It got to the point where I told him I wasn't going to have anything to do with her anymore, and that I'd still love to hang out, just not when she will be around.  He told me he didn't blame me at all.  He instead came to me for advice about his relationship with her, and still always had an excuse for her bad behavior.  Eventually, I told him that I don't want to hear about her, that I don't want her name to come from his mouth, until he has finished reading the book; so he started doing the ""she who cannot be named"" and just kept talking about her.  One night, she gets drunk and they get into a fight (pretty common) and he crashes on our (my partner's and my) couch (also pretty common).  The next day, he texts my partner to say where he (my best friend) was the night before, so he (my best friend) can show his girlfriend, because she believed he (my best friend) was cheating (he wasn't, and hasn't).  I told him that was the same thing as asking either me or my partner to directly intervene when we both made it very clear that we wanted nothing to do with her, that this relationship will be the death of him, and that what she is doing, and what she has done in the past, is abuse.    
I had a phone conversation with him where I said these things again, and told him goodbye; I refused to respond to any texts or calls he sent after that, even though he kept texting and calling for over a week after that conversation.   He texted that they broke up about two weeks after that conversation (and my first thought was ""for how long, this time?"").  I ran into a mutual friend several weeks later and was told they did actually break up for good.    
I was angry for 6 weeks or so.  Now I just miss my friend; however, having been in an abusive relationship before, boundaries are very important to me.  The reason I said goodbye in the first place was because he was not respecting my boundaries.  I figured that if I gave myself a year, when we have both grown into different people, that maybe we could start a fresh friendship.  My partner tells me that while it is my decision, that he advises to wait at least a year so that the same boundary-disrespecting things don't just start happening again.
In the mean time, I keep getting the random text from my best friend that such-and-such is broken on his car, can I please fix it?  I haven't responded (I've done a lot of work for him on his car before).    
Losing this friend is heartbreaking to me.  I am not sure what I should do here.  Do I take the full year, or close to it?  Do I just move on with my life as if he died and don't try to reestablish contact ever?  Do I try to reestablish contact now?
One thing, the fact that he's asked me to fix his car several times with no response from me, in some ways makes me feel taken for granted.    
A second thing, another friend of mine said that I need to think on whether I value my hurt and my anger more than I value the friendship, and think about if I want this person back in my life.  I have thought about it, and I can't make a decision on that.  So then I thought, ""if he died tomorrow, would I regret not making contact again?"" and I don't know the answer to that either, because he isn't who he used to be; this girl changed him, and not for the better.  If he was who he was before he started dating her, the answer would be I absolutely want him in my life again; he's not that person anymore, though.    
Any thought, suggestions, or ""I've been in a similar situation before, this is what I did, and this is how it turned out"" are appreciated.",26Feb2019,1
172,"A few months ago, I had invited a friend over (18M) to hangout and drink a little. I had also invited my other friend, who is now my boyfriend, but he couldn't come. 

When the friend arrived, I was already somewhat drunk. We ate some food, watched youtube, and the night progressed relatively normally. 

As to not paint myself as a victim, and so that I can get unbiased advice, I will preface this by stating I had taken off my pants so that I was only wearing underwear and a long sweater that was basically a dress. This did not seem weird to me since I always walk around my house in only underwear but I can see how that might look differently to someone else. 

At this point we had both had a few more drinks and I thought he was also pretty drunk (later on he told people he wasn't that drunk). I was fading in and out of consciousness. I don't recall explicitly what happened in between but when I started to remember again, was when I was laying on the couch and he was next to me and crudely rubbing me through my underwear and basically giving me a really painful wedgie lol. 

After finally mustering up some confidence, I told him that it hurt and to stop. All throughout this, I don't remember myself ever initiating anything sexual (besides taking off my pants - which I didn't consider sexual). it's possible that we kissed but I can not be sure. 

NOW is the part that I am almost positive is some sort of equivalence to not consenting ??

At about 3 am he asked me if we were going to have sex but he didn't have condoms. I said I don't have any either and I thought that would be the end of that. Boy was I wrong. He said he would walk to the gas station to get some in the middle of a blizzard. I said no don't go to the gas station - repeatedly. 

He then left my house to get condoms and returned about one hour later (without condoms thankfully)

However, if he would have acquired condoms, I don't know what he would have done. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my ultimate question is, did I unspokenly consent by taking off my pants? 

I know I didn't want to have sex with him but I feel as though by inviting him into my house, being vulnerable by being drunk, and removing an article of clothing, I somewhat allowed it. ",26Feb2019,1

So my friend (N) was sleeping when my other friend (J) went into her room and sexually assaulted her. they had a prior relationship that ending alright but J was upset. They remained friends for a few months and still hung out. They were hanging late one night when N decided to go to sleep and offered for J to sleep oin the couch. Later that night N woke up to J in her bed groping and assualting her. She pretended to be asleep as she was understandable scared. In the morning he played it off as if he was giving her a back rub and asking her if she felt anything last night. N told J that she knew what he did and he acted like nothing happened and that he was tired and couldn't remember anything. They are both my very good friends and im obviously very upset at J. Im in support of N as i believe her fully. How should i go about confronting J and what should i do about this situation, Any feedback is welcome.

178,"So I’m from Connecticut, and I’ve been debating to move away from home. I’ve lived here my whole life, and literally the only reason that stops me from moving is my family and friends. I love my family, family comes first for me. I want to help my parents retire early. My family is very huge and close bonded. Every weekend we have get together and all the family come together to eat and drink. My aunts and uncles are like my second parents, my cousins are like my brothers and sisters. My dads side of the family is up here, and I want to move to Arizona. That’s where my mom side of the family is, including my older brother. I’m close with my moms side also, but I’m more close with the family I grew up here. They are many reasons why I wanna move. I have a troubled past here, I’ve done bad things to help myself survive. I’ve been in and out of college debating if I wanna finish. I’m a lost soul as you would say. I even went to Arizona for a whole summer to see what it would be like, I enjoyed it but I feel like it wasn’t like moving because I knew I was going back home eventually. My older cousin told me, “I grew up in New Orleans, I’m glad I moved away from that city. I think you can’t change unless you move, as long as you keep going back to where you are, you won’t grow.” I told him he’s wrong, I thought I was mentally strong enough to fend off my demons back home, and better myself. But nothing has changed. And now I’m really thinking about moving.

I visit Arizona pretty frequently, about two or three times a year. I love it there, it’s my home away from home. I think I love it enough to move there, but I don’t want to abandon my family from home. I’m scared to start over. 

So my question is, for those who moved away from their loved ones? What’s it like? How do you feel? Even for those who moved away because “their families suck”, what’s it like? Adapting to a new environment? Making new connections? ",26Feb2019,1

185,"I hope you enjoy Seinfield'esque type stories. Last Nov I complained to our landlord about a vibration coming from one of the neighbors in our apartment complex and we couldn't find the problem. A few months have passed and recently this low key vibration has become apparent again.  

At one point mid December when I was the only one home, there was a noise loud enough coming from the apartment next door to warrant calling the police - who went up the neighbors door and reported a ""loud noise"" - however no body answered the door as they are not required to by law. The police left that night.
Back to today: a week or so ago my mattress and pillow were shaking enough for this to become an issue again. This time it's not noise driven, but causing a very mild shaking. I called the landlord and complained. The landlord spoke with the tenants next door who explained they run a ""fan"" . It didn't stop. I approached the neighbors a few days later at the landlords request, politely. They were very rude. To me they explained it was a ""dehumidifier"" Whatever it is, they sleep with it throughout the night. So perhaps the exact description of what it is, is a simple miscommunication. 

So the end of last week I had had enough of not being able to sleep throughout the night as again, this month this thing has gotten quite annoying. So I slept in another location and there was no vibration, got checked out as healthy by the doctors, and even got a new bed-set. Last Friday the Landlord spoke with the neighbors and reported the neighbors said they will ""stop"" using this dehumidify thing they sleep through the night with. Neighbor gets home tonight, plops in their apartment, and it started right back up. My guess would be they moved the thing because the vibration / annoying feeling / isn't as amplified and for once isn't shaking my pillow. My roommate doesn't feel it, but he's all the way on the other end of the apartment. My room borders right up against the neighbors. This was  question the landlord asked last week. I'm not crazy, I can go back to the landlord tomorrow, again. But what else to do? :/

187,"I got my first career job at a marketing firm doing web development and I strictly did that for a year and a half. At that point, my boss -- who is a wonderful person that I was on fantastic terms with -- left the company for bigger and better and I took over his position in the interim with little by way of a pay raise. I did pretty well for the next two and a half years, but in the end, I left as well due to a struggling dynamic with the C-level exec's. I know the reason why I left and his reason are the same with the added aspect that he wanted to be compensated appropriately. Very fair.

I then took a position as a web developer again at a media organization which is quite a bit larger. Everything is going wonderfully, I'm on great terms with my boss, but he decides to leave for essentially the same reasons. For him it was mostly being fed up with the beaurocracy and he wanted more pay. Again, very fair reasoning. I partially took over his position even though there were guys far more experienced in the industry and with the company, granted, they were also far more experienced development-wise.

I finally take an official position as dev manager and I get to know the VP who is my direct supervisor. She absolutely loves me and I her. We have a great dynamic and work very well together, but... you guessed it, she's leaving, too.

At this point, I feel three things: 1) I'm cursed and there's nothing I can do about it. 2) They feel comfortable I can take over in their stead and these are great opportunities I shouldn't take for granted. Or 3) They don't give a hoot about me and are doing what's right for them.

My logical brain says, ""Duh, Sherlock, it's 3. Dont be so self-centered"". My hopes say it's a mix of 2 and 3. And my irrational insecurities say the it's obviously 1 and I should do my best not to think of it.

“Hey, I know you are all into Brazilian culture. I think it’s great. My mom from Brazil is here and we’re going to a carnival party this Friday. Just a heads up... I don’t think it would be a good idea to bump into each other.”

So just some background: this was an ex I had been with for about 2 years, had ended in complete flames. She actually reached out to me after I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 6 months, drunkenly calling me, asking to meet up with her, another time asking to get drunk with her. I have absolutely no interest in her and politely declined each time, not only because I’m still hung up on my more recent ex, but more so because that relationship was absolutely bonkers and so on. Not going to go into details because she is a nice person at heart, but despite her 10 years of seniority on me she has a history of being extremely emotionally immature and occasionally manipulative. Again, she’s not a bad person, and of course I have my problems too, but that’s just some context. 

So flash forward, this upcoming weekend there’s a Brazilian Carnaval event in Toronto that I had planned on attending for the last few weeks. We have mutual friends on Facebook, and it looks like one of them is also “attending” on the Facebook event. Obviously she must have said something, because I just got this text.

I initially wanted to reply with “well, that’s a pretty silly thing to ask” but honestly I decided to not even say anything and potentially start unnecessary conflict. My take is that it’s pretty ridiculous to ask me to not go to an event that I could just as rightfully ask the same thing. I don’t think I’m going to say anything, and I’m pretty sure I’m still gonna go and just act casual if it does happen.

She was having an anxiety attack from me stressing her out (wasn't intentional, I was just telling her facts) so I gave her some space. Later she messaged me and apologised. I apologised for stressing her out and explained that wasn't my intention. We talked for a little bit but she didn't really seem too into the conversation, however, she still responded.

She started going to the gym with me, we were inseparable friends. I moved from Michigan to Florida recently and we talk on the phone as often as we can, on Valentine’s Day I sent her an Edible Arrangements with some chocolates and a bear. I’ve met her parents and they loved me so much that when her parents couldn’t get her to come out to dinner with them they would call me just to come have drinks and eat with them while they were in town. 
I live 1,000 miles away and it’s killing me that I never mustard up enough courage while I was still in Michigan to tell her. I have plans on moving back sometime in a year or so, but it terrifies me that she might meet someone before I can make it back to stay. I fly back  to visit every once in a while to see my friends and stuff. 
So lately when I’ve had a few too many to drink I type out a long text to her. Explaining everything. But end up deleting it. And tonight. I wrote it on paper with plans to mail it. (You know, like that cute shit you see in the movies. Who honestly snail mails anything sentimental anymore?)

I've currently hit the end of the line and I need to move out. Life is dragging me down and being piss poor sucks. I live in a very rural West Virginia town that has died out due to the coal veins drying up and finding any job that pays above minimum wage is impossible. I've worked the same fast food job for four years and it's become emotionally draining. I need a big change in my life and I want to move far away. I'm 21 with no family or friends to rely on anywhere other than my roommate. I have a $500 credit card and $2000 in savings and I also have a decent form of transportation. I could easily fit all of my belongings into a sedan, minus my futon. My roommate got a job offer in the next state over and is giving me until near the end of April to move out. I'm terrified because I lack the money and the knowledge to properly move out. I need to get as far away as possible from my toxic family and everything about this small town. I can't move with my roommate to his new city because he wants to start his life with his SO, which is understandable. 

I currently have my eyes set on Colorado. Ive loved everything about the state since I visited it as a kid. I've done a bit of research into getting a job at a ski town resort that also gives housing, but I don't know how I would even go about that being across the country. Other than a ski town job, I'm not sure what else I could do with such a low income. What would be my best course of action to get to Colorado? I'm used to living on ramen and oatmeal so living very frugal isn't new to me. Do i sell my car for extra funds for the moving? I'm hoping a kind redditor with more life experience than me could guide me in the right direction. I'm not sure how to secure a job out there or how I just pack up my whole life and move it to another state but I really feel like it must be done, any advice reddit?

209,"So for as long as I can remember. My family has been very religious and I think around the time I was probably like 9 I started believing there wasn’t a God or any superior being. I go to a Christian school as well. My family and friends thinks that all people who don’t honour or love god are just in denial and will suffer in hell because God won’t save them. Since I’ve never believed I kind of stopped following the “rules” of being a Christian, such as praying, not smoking the devils lettuce and drinking and saving yourself for marriage. It’s not that I’m purposefully rebelling against my family’s belief I guess I’m just an atheist. So I was wondering what would the best way to I guess, come out and tell my parents or if I should just keep it a secret until I move out I’m almost 18 now. Moving  out when I turn 19. I don’t want my family and friends to see me as a failure or hate me. I just personally don’t believe there is a superior being watching over us nor do I believe there is an afterlife in heaven or hell.

210,"She used to be blocked. She made my life hell and stalled me and called me and was trying to get my boyfriend to be back with her. It came to a head when she came over unannounced and he blocked her on everything. 

Well last night we were watching a video on my boyfriends phone and she called him. He didn’t answer. I left because I had to for work but hung out outside his door to his place for a second and heard him talk to her and mention that they had talked in person last week. 

I feel so betrayed and upset. I shouldn’t because I’m being controlling but how could he be meeting with her and not telling me? I heard him say to her that he is sad when he thinks of the future and it involves me. That we haven’t grown together like he had hoped. He was giving me a shot and it wasn’t working out anymore. He had given me a shot for the last year but nothing has significantly changed (he said). 

I’m hurt. I met his whole family. His friends. We always go to his friends events. I thought this ex thing was over with. How is he trying to go back to her when he has been with me and everything has seemed so fine and great lately. I also heard him say he has never felt the way he feels with her with me. That he isn’t head over heels for me. He said he knew it may be because he is older but there’s something missing between us. 
He never said to her that he wanted to be with her. I did hear her say that she doesn’t want to be with someone like him. She likes him as a friend but she and he aren’t emotionally compatible because he must be dating someone. She told him she believes true growth comes from being single and finding oneself. She said she hates how he copies her and how he doesn’t seem genuine. He just wants someone around so she doesn’t see him as something valuable because he doesn’t value himself. She said she may not even want him as a friend and she called to tell him that they shouldn’t talk again. They had talked the week before and she said she felt wrong for doing so cause he was dating someone.  


He has never seemed upset with me. He has always been happy and open and warm and giving and loving. I don’t understand how he had all these other feelings when he acted like all was fine.

Last night she sent streaks on Snapchat. It was her straight from the shower, with her body (naked) in view. You couldn’t see anything (like her hips, tummy and shoulder, all barely) but she also had some serious side boob showing (she had her hair covering the nipple, but the breast itself was visible). I talked to her about it, mainly just having a joke but I wanted to make sure she is ok. She was, and that was that.
So I woke up this morning and remembered my dream. After all this crazy shit happened in it, I saw her in my dream, completely naked. No sex, just her naked and talking to her, then a little bit of kissing and then I woke up.

214,"I’m gonna try and keep this short it probably not . I almost posted this on r/offmychest because just typing it now gives me anxiety. 

So I moved to Oregon from Georgia about a year and a half ago. I moved for opportunity and safely. Plus minimum wage is still 7.25 in Georgia. 
So over the last year and a half I’ve busted my butt trying to take of advantage of the opportunity the is available here.  I started at a job at 16.50 an hour. And I’ve the last year after a few jobs hops I’ve made it to 27 an hour. 
I got the job of indeed. I had two companies both hoping to have me work for them. After a “bidding war” if you will I accepted a job at a restoration company.  
First impression was that everyone was pretty laid back and it was at first. My first month went without error and after a few paychecks I was starting to chip away at some very urgent bills. For once I was able to do a little more for my family, not much but more than we were used to. I even was able to help a few friends back home with small thing.  
After month two rolled around I noticed some unusual things. First thing That kinda made me wonder was My project manager thought the earth was flat. I was didn’t really care but it did change my opinion of him. 
The second thing that sparked my interest was I was riding with one of the high school workers (family church/business and friends children) was feeling under the weather. So on the way I asked him if he needed anything or if we needed to stop and grab some meds or something. He told me he was fine as didn’t want to be drowsy. So I asked him if he had taken DayQuil before. He said no. I asked him about several other meds before he told me he’d never taken any medication in his life. Later he revealed he was unvaccinated as well. 
So now I’m like wth. Through further prowling I found out the same theme across the board for all of them. 
So on another job with my co-worker who was not from the family and just recently quit. We got to talking about said medical weirdness and he unveiled even more dirt. Told me about a case that just ended in a couple from their church receiving 60 something years for not taking their sick new born to the hospital. I did a quickly did a google and boom right there. I started googling everything about this church and was blown away. ( not giving away to many details because I would be screwed if this got back to them) ( prolly already did give away though).  
Another time I did a fire demo with about 5 high school kids and basically found out the girls are not allowed to say no to a boy From their church. So the guys just pass the girls around in a make out ring. It’s disgusting. On top of that these kids are fucking insane. Our job as to strip the house down to its bones and rip the roof off where it burned. I find these kids using the clients contents (pots,pants , knives , liquor bottles) that where all to be boxed up and viewed by the adjuster or something (All I know is they are part of the insurance claim) and using them to throw through drywall and out windows. Also the where hanging from the rafters and swinging on them. Absolutely nuts. They all smoke cigarettes underage and beg for them if they don’t have them. One of the kids whom i borderline hate thinks it funny to dryhump people. So he tried it on me so many time I almost punched him but he is underage and I need this job. Adding to the I’ve caught him burning shit in the back of my van on break and in clients house. He is literally out of control. 
  So I’m after all this I’m fed up and about a month ago I didn’t have any jobs lined out for the day so I tagged along with this young kid in another field. He is balls deep in This church. His Mom, dad, girlfriend, grandparents ect all included in the church.  So through the day we get to talking and he is obviously got a lot going on. He is texting frantically. Stepping out for calls. Almost all of our project managers (also in church) called him during the day to talk to him about an even that happened.  Eventually he told me that he had starting wondering things about the church and decided to go to another church to test it out. Word got out via social media and it got back to the church. The elders literally blocked the doors after service and confronted him. He reached out to the other pastor after the event for advice and that pastor decided to show up for the next service Unannounced. The elders literally locked arms and blocked him. So he is in the hottest of culty church hot seats at this point and is stressing. Also confessed he smokes weed occasionally. So I gave him some advice on Friday and we talked over some biblical points and I told him he wasn’t crazy and to trust his gut that what he was feeling was rational.  We talked about a few other things and went home for the day.
The following Monday, the kid didn’t even look at me when I said hello. So I just kept it moving. Two days later I go to the shop in my work truck and then head to my job. I got to my job and heard a hissing. Tire was had a two small holes in it. Call PM and go to tire shop. Next day i get another flat again pulling into a coffee shop. Take it to the tire shop. 
So the next day I called in sick. I wasn’t sick but I needed a break.  While I’m at home I get a call from the manager that the tire shop said my tires were slashed and that it had to have happened at my apartment complex. That they would not allow me to take the vehicle home anymore. It may not seem that seriously but it was a big blow to my family’s daily operations. My pregnant girlfriend was able to use the car instead of dropping me off at work at the crack of dawn.  So I call my front office and ask them to review the tape and let me know if they saw anyone near my truck (which i park on the front for that reason). They found nothing and I haven’t said anything because I didn’t want to stir shit up even more. 
Well shit was already stirring because a few days later my manager again comes up and explains that they think they need to drop my wage 7 dollars because my work didn’t meet what they expected. Well I have proof that I have. Texts, voicemails, pictures all on my phone showing that my project managers where all happy with my work. I’ve made a few minor mistakes but all fixable.  And I think they are doing this to get me to quit. But I can’t afford to quit. I’ve got a baby on the way and a lot of bills. I’ve already a forfeited all my games systems and musical instruments that I love to pay for food an such since the drop. my phone doesn’t have any service and I’m two months behind.  I don’t know where to go from here. But this is fucked

Sorry if this is incoherentnonsense

mexican high school only lasts three years) is

actually kind of rude isolating myself and now
they actually don't like me.

I recently escaped from a toxic relationship where in I was constantly put down and emotionally abused, and had to deal with them constantly saying they were going to commit suicide because of me, for things as simple as me taking an hour to respond to a message because I'm busy. I got free from that about 3 weeks ago.

Anyway, this semester started back in the first week of January. And I have been. To. ONE. Single. Class. I went to my first class and then decided I'd rather go back to my apartment and sleep after that. I legitimately want to do nothing but sleep, and occasionally play video games. I just want to be asleep all the time. I wake up in the morning and I sit in bed for like 3 hours just trying to convince myself to at least go make some coffee.

One of my professors emailed me asking me if I was alright because they noticed I haven't been to any classes, and I cannot even bring myself to respond to the email, even though I so desperately want to. I just keep avoiding everything and I feel like I'm making things worse every minute. I'm likely going to fail out after this semester, on account of me missing 2 months of classes so far.

My Reddit post history is quite rubbish so I’m unsure why anyone would want to meet up with me. Commenting on like one or two dirty joke posts, stating my political opinions (no I’m not a trump supporter but still), making sensual posts myself, hinting at my sensuality and men’s coy perspectives of me.

They randomly changed my schedule last minute and told me I have no choice but to work a double on Thursday too. This is against my desires and availability. I told them no, I just wanted my single shift on Thursday evening as usual.

Instead they gave me a 4 hour morning shift on Thursday (which we all know is a baby sitting shift where you make no money and stand around in an empty restaurant.) AND they took away my evening shift on Thursday where I actually make money. I’m down to 24 hours a week total. Which is shit.

I asked them what’s up and they said they changed it to this because I complained about not agreeing to work doubles back to back.
I told them this will affect my income pretty big. (I didn’t say this part: it’s also a god damn waste of my time and an insult to leave me with a shit shift like this and expect me to be ok with it.)

223,"TL:DR I've never met the person, Last year I spoke to her for 4-5months pretty much every day then she sort of ghosted in a sense by blocking me on social media which I was kinda confused about but a couple days later I managed to get a hold of her and she just said she couldn't do it anymore, we never really had any arguments and she shared a lot of personal stuff, next three months or so was pretty much mostly nothing apart from be analysing literally everything because I was completely confused, started somewhat talking ish again in December and I eventually found out a couple things which was pretty crazy. She lied about a few things one being her age, I had been believing she was 19 but infact she was 16. And said some really horrible stuff (Okay so just go get a life or kill yourself either one if it means I'll never hear from you again) that being one, I also found out that 2 days after she stopped talking in September she had made a reddit account and was posting explicit images, when I eventually found out her age I managed to get her to delete everything because it was illegal etc and I managed to contact the moderators at gfycat and got roughly like 50links deleted.  Fast forward to now as much as everything has happened I caught feelings and it feels completely fucked up being that I'm 23 I wish I understood why I feel like this but anyway the advice I'm asking for is she told me she wouldn't do this again until she was 18 atleast but just earlier I actually notice she posted again just before deleting it, she doesn't understand what this could do to her future and her brother doesn't seem to really care about it. I just want to help her even after all the lies etc &gt;.&lt;

224,"I have been friends with this group of guys (5 people including me) for the past 3 years. We have been really close till last july when we were about to off for our internships and had to submit an assignment. Although i am not saying that what we do is right, its very common where we would copy other people's assignment and change it a little so save time and whatnot. And this assignment was for a class without any grades just a ""pass or fail"" module so pretty much the entire class just copied off the hardworking guy. 

So what happened was that the hardworking is friends with this girl and we were close to this girl and we had a discord group with the 5 of us and the girl. Since we were copying off of her friend one of the guy told me to create a group without her. And i created a group without her. But did a major fuck up where i accidently renamed the group with the girl as ""dont add 'girl's initial' here"" and she was the only one with that initial and the guys tried to help me out  by acting as though it didnt happen but it was pretty much a big fail and she caught on. So i chose to be truthful and i told her that i created that group because i was gonna copy her friend's work like how everyone else in the class and i said only me and none of the other guys cos i did not want to bring them under the bus with me, and she threatened to tell the lecturer that i was copying off of her friend and i was fine w it 

Somehow me telling the girl this did not sit well with one of guys and he started avoiding me. I tried to apologise and kept telling him i did not bring him up when i told the girl about the copying and shit and he somehow convinced all the other guys that i was like some kind of bad person. This was back in july of last year. 1 week later we had our internships where 2 of the guys joined me in the same company and the guy who avoids me and 1 more of the guy were in another company. 

During the internship, the guys in the same company as me talked to me normally and told me not to worry about the other guy and time will heal. 

Fast forward yesterday when we needed to go back to school for extra modules and suddenly the 4 guys avoided sitting with me. Today, we were supposed to create a group of 4 to 5 for presentation and the 4 guys created a group without me. This wouldnt be a problem for me if the module's presentation did not hold 60% of the module's weightage. Im fine with joining another group for the presentation but the way my ""friends"" behaved just did not sit well with me. ",26Feb2019,1
226,"I’ve never stayed at one job longer than 3 years without moving up in some way. 

To give a brief look:

Retail Location #1 (first job): 3 years ~$8
Retail Location #2: 1 1/2 years ~$10
Road Construction Labor: 1 1/2 years ~$13
Certified Engineer Inspector: 2 years (promotion once, current) started at ~$17 now at ~$27

I always see people in my current field looking at other jobs either within my line of work or something very similar. My work in itself is very stable and I don’t foresee it slowing down in my area any time soon. 

My question though is if I think this could be where I actually start my career is it necessarily a bad thing to work for a single company for an extended period of time? I think I could reasonably move up more given more experience and more training but I think I’ll be capped at a level above my position for quite some time. 

I don’t necessarily think I need to look but could use some insight if I should keep looking for better opportunities or if it isn’t a bad idea to stay where I am currently. ",26Feb2019,1

228,"I was in a 2 years and half relationship with a nice girl with a good family and education, and I’m still struggling to accept it’s over and move on.

Next month it’s going to be exactly 1 year I was left at the bus station on my way back home, she is staying by her relatives for college in a big city 100 miles from me.
It was the right thing to do at the time, I was about to become a very toxic individual back then, hanging out with not very recommendable people, spending my time drinking and smoking  instead of finding a job after being fired because of attitude.

After that I started to get back on track quitting with all the toxic behaviors and vices I had. 
Got a job as a lifeguard and found some nice friends but  didn’t enjoyed anything about it because the depression and the remorse were eating me from the inside.
After that we met and found peace but I had to leave the country because I was given the opportunity to live and work in the US (considered to be like the El Dorado around here) and it was something I had in mind for a long time.

After a few weeks she told me that we were so close to put the pieces beck together but I screwed it up being childish thinking I’ve been cheated on , and refused to answer my calls.
Depression started to  crawl back and I felt devastated again. Few moths passed by and one day she texted me and I moderately kept it in a good vibe trying not to be too much intrusive.

After that I had to get back in Europe and the first thing I wanted to do was to go by her house and bring her a box of Belgian chocolates I got at the duty free on my way back.

We got pretty close after that, eating out and going to the library without too much problems, but she was still reluctant about putting pieces back together. 

Before Valentine’s Day I asked her out to have a dinner with me, ( she was back in town at the time) at first she accepted but in the end she told me it wasn’t the right thing to do because  it wasn’t making any sense to her.
We kept talking but one day, trying to justify her incoherent refusal, she jokingly told me I meant nothing to her. I told her she was exaggerating,  she mocked me and I replied with a simple “fuck you”.
I wasn’t comfortable with the idea of my last text being like that, but my attempt to restore a friendly conversation was ignored.

I’ve been trough a lot during this year, got in trouble with the law in my hometown, fucked up the relationship with my father in the US, and some other things, and yet, losing her is the only thing that pains me more than everything.

I consider myself redeemed for what I’ve done, after all this time spent on improving myself.
Now I have a  good job with a very decent salary, and in the my free time I dedicate myself to calligraphy and painting watching Bob Ross on YouTube.

But deep inside I still want to find a way to make things work between us.
The next move in my mind is going to that cursed city I hate to the bone, then hand her over a poem I spent some nights writing.

English is not my first language so please forgive me, but this is the first time I write something so long, and to whoever is reading this, thank you for your time.

231,"I recently had a email conversation with one of my professors and it left me confused and honestly kind of angry. The emails went something like this: (I will paraphrase the first 3 but the final one is exact)

Me to Professor (Sent Saturday)

**Hello,

I was wondering if we will still be having class on Monday, since you were out last class on your trip to London. 

Hope you had/are having a nice trip,

Eggthan**




Sunday morning at 10am, I receive this reply.

**Eggthan,

We will be working on sound next week. Check the syllabus for assignment details.**

He sent this on a Sunday, and said next week. Now I was pretty sure he meant next week as in next week and not literally tomorrow, but just to make sure I shot him another quick email to clarify.

(Sent less than an hour after he sent his)

**Professor,

Do you mean next week as in Monday the 25th or March 4th? Sorry for the confusion.

Eggthan**

I did not receive an email the rest of the day, so come Monday I decided to not go to class thinking he was still on his trip. I knew there was a slight chance we still could have class, but I was willing to take that risk and assume any normal human being would not use “next week” to refer to tomorrow.

2 HOURS AFTER class had ended I receive this exact email:

**It clearly stated on the announcement last week that we would be meeting to do sound during the first class of next week. That was today... But, I think we were still working on our collages...so...come to class this week and next week as well as the week after. 

ALso, this week is this week. ANd next week is the week after this week.**

I missed class. We didn’t work on the new unit. No harm no foul right? No. The last few sentences really annoy me, like he’s insulting my intelligence. Am I insane is there anyone who would refer to Monday as next week when it is Sunday?

Anyway, I guess what I want to ask is should I respond to this? In no way would I be rude, but oh boy don’t I want to crank out a nicely worded email explaining why he’s wrong right now. Thought I’d get some advice first tho.",26Feb2019,2
232,"So, 8 years ago I met this girl on a virtual game and immediately we just had a great chemistry with one another. Nothing romantic or sexual just a very strong connection on all levels. We shared stories about our families and childhoods then realized over the 6 months we had been talking to each other we basically realized had the same life growing up and we didn't feel so alone in the world. Except she didn't grow up with either parent showing her what love really was. While my mother showed me as much love as she could give, my step father was abusive. Her step father was abusive and controlling and her mother was just there not believing the abuse she would tell her.

Her step father didn't like the idea of her talking to me so he threatened her. If she didn't stop speaking to me he would find me and hurt me, he had looked up social media profiles, phone numbers and addresses on me to show her he was serious. I had no idea of this until a few years later after we had found each other again and he had died of a heart attack a few months prior. Her life was a wreck and I was just starting Culinary school. So we drifted apart once more then two years ago we began talking again but we were no longer playing on a virtual game, we were texting and skyping one another and we finally got to sit down and voice our emotions and feelings that we had for one another for so many years and before you knew it we were basically seeing other. We had the I love you's along with good mornings and good night's going off everyday without a hitch. We would Skype all day usually ending with us sleeping on the phone, she would go to work and call me just to hear my voice. Things were great for about 9 months then we finally made plans to meet up and that's when things took a turn.

She ended up telling me about a guy she was living with (I was high key pissed off at this whole situation) they weren't currently dating but they had dated prior to us speaking to each other again. The guy and I spoke, he spoke and he sounded very controlling of her life. He didn't want her speaking to any of the friends I had introduced her too nor myself. She had no friends of her own outside of the friends he had when they got in a relationship. Her friends she had prior he didn't like so he made her push them away. He literally sat on the phone and told me ""I don't want her speaking to you and I haven't yet decided if she could speak to the others."" That sounds like control to me but then again I may just be crazy and paranoid. Either way he was stepping up and wanting her back and he was her first love so she gave him that chance to show her. I took a step back because I was hurt but I still wanted to be her friend because we still helped each other through so many issues in life. She felt the same way and we continued to speak in private talking about current issues we had going on in our lives.

My feelings were on reserve and I constantly pushed for him and her but he was being a dick according to her and not playing the bf role by basically ignoring her at all turns. The first major holiday since finding out about him and her had come around, it's Thanksgiving time and he went to his parents house and she went to her grandparents, she spent the whole time Skyping me. She seemed happy to spending that time with me but I was still pretty reserve and constantly telling her to message him because I knew were her heart was with him. Then Christmas came and she dreaded having to go and pick up his brother and girlfriend because she knew she would have to be around him and know he was basically gonna pretend their lives are great in front of his brother. I was content with all of this because I still felt her heart was with him and I was fine with just knowing if I ever needed to talk to someone about my issues I could speak to her. The night after Christmas when she called crying saying they got into an argument he had called her overweight then she went on to say there was other times he called her clingy and her behavior was out of control and blamed her ADHD.

Their relationship is a mess basically but the way she always spoken about them being together it sounds like they're just roommates. They never sleep together, he would be in another room playing video games all night after work and she would be on the phone with me. New years and my birthday came by and she spent it all with me then February came and he found out about her still talking to me and made her delete all of her social media's and block my number and cut me off. I've been trying to deal with not speaking to her daily and it's hard not knowing if she's alright or not. I completely understand that I was a bit stupid for even trying to stick around in her life after the fact of all of this but she was the only person I've ever known in my entire life that I could speak to her about anything in the world and not have to worry about judgement or thinking she'd be bored with whatever interests I had and vice versa.

She was a best friend I never thought I'd have in my lifetime with how I live like such a loner and all of that is gone now because of some dickhead who claims he loves her but has constantly forgotten and ignored her basically the whole time they've ""been together"" shows her a little bit of what she fell for all those years ago then he reverts back to ignoring her again. She keeps falling for it because that's all she knows as love and she's become so content and comfortable with that being love. I'm already started seeing a therapist but that's only once a month and my mind is forever running. So what would you guys do in this situation?",26Feb2019,3
233,"I’m a senior in high school and I’ve never made a B. I’ve flunked individual assignments, even projects, but the only overall B grade I’ve ever made was in 4th grade writing because I hated my teacher and made that Very Clear. Other than that, my lowest grades have been 91s in PE.

I’m determined to let myself make a B before college. Lots of difficult stuff is going on in my life right now, and I’ve been trying to let some assignments slip without beating myself up.

234,"I was going through her snap story. She's doing all these TBHs but no names. I come across one that I'm 99% sure is mine. At the end it says that at the beginning of grade 10 she had a big crush on me. We are really close but we live far away from eachother. I'm always concerned with her wellbeing, especially because she's had/having mental health issues. Before the confession she writes that 'you're always so supportive and even though we don't talk that much you always hmu when something's wrong...' which is exactly what I do.

She also came out to me that she was bisexual at the beginning of grade 10. Maybe she found that out with me (female)? She said it was super confusing for her but she didn't go into much detail.

237,"The neighbor who lives across from me is the most obnoxious person I have ever met. For some reason she thinks that we’re friends. We are NOT, never have been, never will be. I was polite to her once out in the parking lot and now she thinks that we’re best friends. She comes over to my house multiple times a day, wanting to talk. She is constantly bumming smokes from me AND my husband (who can’t stand her either) and has literally smoked more than half of my pack in one day—that’s how often she comes over.

Both my husband and I (and a mutual neighbor) have spoken to her about this behavior (MULTIPLE TIMES!!!) and told her it is very inappropriate. She is bipolar and doesn’t take criticism well. She’ll cry and apologize and say she’ll stop. A few days will go by without her, then BOOM! There she is waltzing into my house like nothing happened. She comes in whenever she feels like it. She has come into my house while my husband or I were napping right on the couch, sometimes she wakes us up because she’s so fucking loud; other times she thinks it’s okay to quietly sneak by to the backyard and bum smokes without asking. She has NEVER once asked for a smoke, she just reached into the pack and takes them. She’ll smoke at least three in the five minutes she’s over. She’ll leave, then come back TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES LATER and ask if we want to go out and smoke. We’ll say no, which you would think she would get the hint, but nope! Walks out to the backyard and AGAIN helps herself to our smokes. Once I asked her why she didn’t buy her own and she made some bullshit excuse that if she had her own pack, she’d smoke all the time. REALLY??? But it’s okay for her to come smoke all of mine? I asked her if she was going to smoke mine, could she pitch in so it’s not coming out of my pocket? “I’m broke,” is all she says. My husband and I both called her out on it and she did her “cry-and-apologize” routine and left. A few days later, there she was again. She’d come sit outside while we were smoking and tried to hold a conversation (hard considering we were both trying to ignore her) but kept glancing at the pack of smokes until my husband got annoyed and gave her one. He should NOT have done that, because all it did was make her think it was okay to come over and smoke all of our smokes again. I don’t know if any of you smoke, but out here smokes are over $8 a pack, and her blowing through ours is costing us a LOT of money.

We can’t even have our front door open without her thinking it’s an invitation to come over. We live in SoCal, have beautiful weather, and like to have fresh air in the house on nice days. Not anymore! As soon as she sees our door is open, here she comes! We have a security screen, but even if we lock it, she’ll stand there and say, “Hellooo? You gonna let me in?” We are so fed up with it. It’s not fair that we have to constantly have to have our door closed and locked just to keep her out. When she does get into the house (usually after one of my kids goes out and leaves the door unlocked) it’s always the most inconvenient times. My husband and I will be trying to clean the house or cook dinner and she’ll just stand there hovering, talking about stupid shit like the book she’s supposedly writing. If we don’t reply, she’ll start talking about something else, asking us the most asinine questions, like how our day went or what work was like, or did you watch this show because you should, it’s really good! It’s like, just shut the fuck up and go home! Then we’ll be trying to eat dinner as a family and she will either come in and sit there while we’re eating, or slip out back and have several of our smokes. She comes in and out as she pleases and we’re sick to death of it! She’ll come in while we’re in the shower and just sit on our couch and wait for us to get out. When we do our weekly grocery shopping, she comes in as we’re carrying stuff in and gets in the way while we’re trying to put stuff away. NOTHING is sacred! She even comes over on holidays! Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, you name it, if it is a day that ends in “Y” then she’s got her ass over here. She always comes over when we have birthday parties for our kids even though she never gets them a gift. We were trying to have a private barbecue with just our next-door neighbor and our families, and she weaseled her way into that, too! And no, she didn’t contribute anything; money, food, NOTHING. She takes and takes and takes and I am so god damned sick of it. She can’t take a hint, she doesn’t know how to read people’s reactions, she’s just so clueless and idiotic and RUDE.

A little background on her, like I said she’s bipolar and unstable. She and her daughter live with her parents because her mom is disabled and she takes care of her. (Though I don’t see how, since she’s always over at my house!) She doesn’t have an actual job, she pretty much does nothing all day but wait to see when we open our door so she can come running over. (Oh, supposedly she’s trying to write a book; she’s made me read some of the stuff she’s written and it was awful.) We’ve been dealing with this for 12 YEARS. It’s getting very old. My husband and I have even started looking into moving because we just can’t stand it anymore. My cousin says she’d gladly come out and beat this bitch’s ass for me, and don’t think I haven’t considered the possibility. I’m at a loss for what to do. It’s not fair to us to have to move. We thought about talking to the landlord about her, but we don’t want her parents to be punished, they’re actually good people. (Don’t know how they made someone like HER!) We considered talking to her dad, but we don’t want to drag him into her drama. Short of a restraining order, does anyone have any advice? We’re DONE. ",26Feb2019,1

241,"I am a female in my early twenties. From the time that I was about eleven I have been sexually attracted to bondage, humiliation, bdsm, and sexual torture. I've never spoken to anybody about the extent of my fantasies, but I have always felt greatly ashamed of them.

I am not a violent person, in fact I'm very sensitive and when I see or hear about unnecessary violence it sometimes makes me cry. I'm always described as overly emotional and too nice, so these fantasies feel so out of character, especially since as a girlfriend I am extremely passive and feminine.

I can't explain it really but watching porn videos of men being dominated really turns me on. And not just regular dominatrix stuff the things I like are really intense, and the fantasy is made better with more humiliation and force, the more real it feels the better. It's my ideal fantasy to have my boyfriend tied up and blindfolded while I do whatever I want even things that are uncomfortable, or to watch someone else do things to him.

I know it may not sound bad but to me it feels so wrong and I wish that this wasn't the main thing that turned me on. I was just wondering if there were any popular theories for why people are attracted to things like that.

I wanted to be in a position where I could make the difference for someone in need by being good at what I do.

245,"I graduated last year and got my first full-time job in Houston. I work in a company where almost 80% of people are from same country and speak the same language (Not English or spanish). It is important to mention this because I also belong to that 80%. During my graduate studies I interned in a big company and with people from diverse backgrounds. They were very professional and always respectful. I learned a lot there.

At my current job, I noticed that people who are from my country don’t treat each other very respectfully and talk to each other in a authoritarian way. As Im new there, most of my co-workers are interfering in the work that Im doing and changing the plans at the end moments without communicating or letting me know. On the other hand, they talk very politely to the English speaking people. 

My coworker always acts like he is my manager and disrespects me in front of people who report to me. I don’t know how can I handle this situation as I don’t want to confront him and make things bad between us because we work in the same department and he is kinda short temper. TIA..! ",26Feb2019,2

247,"Obligatory mobile formatting apology.

When it comes to the way I view myself I'm very confident and comfortable with who I am. I'm not insecure about my appearance or personality and I'm generally happy with myself, give or take a few bad days that we all have. But even though I'm a confident person in normal life I turn into a nervous and insecure wreck in relationships.

For context, I'm 19F and in university. My dating history isn't the best. My first relationship that was serious (at least to me) ended because he admitted that he was never interested in me from the start, and he was just ""too nice"" to reject me. This was after 6 months of him trying to make me have sex with him and me not realizing his total lack of any personality around me was a sign he wasn't into me. I was 17 and being a bratty teenager I acted out and tried to ruin his life, but luckily I realized that I was being immature before I could do any damage.  

That whole experience was embarrassing and humiliating for me, especially the way I almost created a warpath after it ended. My friends got bad vibes from him from the start, even my mom didn't like him. My friends didn't say anything and I think my mom just wanted to trust me that I could make my own decisions. After that I didn't talk to anyone with the intention of anything romantic.

Then high school stopped and college came around and I made plenty of new friends. Eventually a romance started to blossom with one of them (and this time it was natural, not me forcing myself onto someone who couldn't tell me they didn't want it). We've been together about 5 months now and he's really the greatest boyfriend; he makes time in his already insane schedule for me, he listens and remembers the smallest details that I say in passing, he asks me about my day and says goodnight every single day. Sometimes he shows up at my door unanounced with gifts. He doesn't force anything on me and always makes sure I'm comfortable. He really shows that he cares and I know that he does.

However I still find myself thinking about things that I don't need to, like ""what if he doesn't like me? What if he likes another girl? What if we get in a fight and he wants to break up?"" Then I start mentally preparing for a situation that most likely isn't gonna come. I know that I have no reason to think like that, but I think because of the way I've been hurt in the past that there's a part of my mind that expects the worst and wants to prepare for it. Of course I don't bring any of this up to him because I know now that creating drama is only gonna drive people away, and I really don't want to ruin this relationship because it's going so great. I hate that I do this because I feel like the 17 year old me who was so insecure and desperate for validation. I'm not like that now and I hate that the anxiety is creeping in again. I've done a lot of growing up in just two years but this seems to be something I'm still immature about.

So how can I get over this weird relationship anxiety? Has anyone else had to deal with this before?",26Feb2019,1

250,"Hello everyone! I am in my early 20's neither vise nor strong person. I do cooperate with people using wheelchairs, or mothers with babychairs. I open ramps of the public buss for them to enter or when they need to leave. Some times especially if I am not in a hurry I wait with the ones using wheelchair so I can make sure they get into their buss.

So recently in university campus I saw a guy using wheelchair climbing a steep ramp. Because it rained before, ground was wet and there for bars which he was holding. And those bars get usually freezing cold when weather is bad so holding theme gets worse. I was away from this guy. Really far away. There was no way I could reach this guy by walking. So I began to rush towards this guy in the ramp. And as soon as he recognized me running towards him he begin to climb the ramp a lot faster. I never tought he will feel like this because of my past experiences. I saw people I cooperated never felt guilty, ashamed or bad about doing stuff with me. But this guys face was ""I better be death instead of your cooperation"" thats what my friend next to me told me. It is sure that he get offended. But I didn't mean to cause harm, or make joke about anybody. As I said before that ""some people refuse others help"" idea came to me always as a legend after my past experiences, but I understand it is real for some. Now I want to apologise to this guy, but don't know how. My friend told me it will worsen the situation. I don't know how should I start that conversation or continue it, or what should I meantion about, or the way I should be talking. 

My mind was ""Oh my god! I need to stop walking and rush or else he could get tired because his face seems struggling and he maybe didn't calculated wet ground and wet bars being ice cold and slippery to hold. His stamina might getting drained every second. Or else he will slide really fast through back and something bad will happen.""

I can't admit now while reading the stuff it seems I am someone rude but, nothing rude was at my mind at that time.

I rushed towards a guy with wheelchair to help him climbing a steep ramp. He realized me and climbed faster to avoid my help. I want to apologize to him but don't know how.",26Feb2019,2

253,"She used to be blocked. She made my life hell and stalled me and called me and was trying to get my boyfriend to be back with her. It came to a head when she came over unannounced and he blocked her on everything. 

Well last night we were watching a video on my boyfriends phone and she called him. He didn’t answer. I left because I had to for work but hung out outside his door to his place for a second and heard him talk to her and mention that they had talked in person last week. 

I feel so betrayed and upset. I shouldn’t because I’m being controlling but how could he be meeting with her and not telling me? I heard him say to her that he is sad when he thinks of the future and it involves me. That we haven’t grown together like he had hoped. He was giving me a shot and it wasn’t working out anymore. He had given me a shot for the last year but nothing has significantly changed (he said). 

I’m hurt. I met his whole family. His friends. We always go to his friends events. I thought this ex thing was over with. How is he trying to go back to her when he has been with me and everything has seemed so fine and great lately. I also heard him say he has never felt the way he feels with her with me. That he isn’t head over heels for me. He said he knew it may be because he is older but there’s something missing between us. 
He never said to her that he wanted to be with her. I did hear her say that she doesn’t want to be with someone like him. She likes him as a friend but she and he aren’t emotionally compatible because he must be dating someone. She told him she believes true growth comes from being single and finding oneself. She said she hates how he copies her and how he doesn’t seem genuine. He just wants someone around so she doesn’t see him as something valuable because he doesn’t value himself. She said she may not even want him as a friend and she called to tell him that they shouldn’t talk again. They had talked the week before and she said she felt wrong for doing so cause he was dating someone.

255,"Quick intro. So I have this friend , lets call him Zack. Zack is overall an extremely introverted kid that only has a small handful of friends at most sadly. I get the feeling that Zack seems to not believe in friendships and especially relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

So me and my best friend, lets call him Kyle (he's like a brother to me at this point) run a small YouTube channel together. This is the second time that Zack and another friend of Zack and I joined the group of friends that Kyle and I generally roll with. And during this second time, we decided to start up our YouTube channel again so we record the day. Then I was joking around telling Zack to come check out the channel to look out for the video when it goes up. And then Zack tells me to blur his face, I kinda joke around then realize this is serious. Zack does not want to budge on the video thing and won't tell me what is his issue with being in the video. He's not even featured and just in some of the b-roll and cinematic shots with music over it. Zack literally won't give me any room to work with and it kinda annoys me since I've literally been willing to do so much to help him out.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I talk to Kyle about this situation I wanted to potentially get some advice from some people so I don't ruin this situation. Because I don't expect Kyle to understand all of Zack's self-consciousness issues and Zack seems to have more issues than that. I told him that less than a thousand people would see the video but he's just so scared for his face to be out there. Zack also has no social media and all that. It's creeping me out and makes me wonder if he has any deep issues that he won't reveal. This annoys me since he knows he can trust me and that I'm a real friend. So currently we are a bit cut off but things could still be fixed before it's too late.

257,"Hello, sorry in advance for poor formatting since I am on mobile. 

On Friday, I learned that my alcoholic father and his long time partner of 20 years had separated. She took off because he allegedly threatened to kill her and then kill himself. He claims that she threatened suicide and she was mad when he told his partners brother about it. 

I visited him the next morning at their house and a few moments later the police showed up. His now ex partner was forcing him out of the house. It is important to note that she has all claims to the house and my father has been completely financially dependent on her for at least 10 years. 

My fiancé was with me when the police showed up and we agreed to pack him a bag and take him somewhere safe that he could stay for a while until his court hearing. We took him to the hospital because he was threatening his own life and was extremely drunk. 

The hospital released him in less than 24 hours so we decided to get him a hotel for a few nights. On the second night of his stay, after becoming sober, he got drunk and got himself his second DUI in under 2 years.

Now with my father in jail, I am unsure what else I can do for him. It feels that I have done all I can. He has no money and has burned a ton of bridges with everyone close to him. I am unable to support him financially or provide him a place to stay since I am a recent college grad just beginning my career.

258,"I’m a 18 year old male that feels like I don’t deserve attention from attractive people, even if they act interested in me. When I was little I fondly remember talking to girls I had huge crushes on and being like any other kid but when I was around 7 I ended up curiously looking online and found pictures of naked girls. I told my parents about it after because I felt guilty and they got really mad (they basically told me seeing that stuff should never be seen by anyone) I thought they meant girls but looking back they were definitely talking about porn and I felt extremely terrible about it and it still scars me now. I’m thinking this is when my feeling of being undeserving of people I found attractive came from because I became really uncomfortable and turned off about talking of  sex or who I have a crush on ever since. 

Now I find it extremely hard to talk to girls I like and I end up having sex with people I don’t even really find attractive because I feel like that’s all I deserve, there was a girl in high school that I honestly thought and still think is the most beautiful girl in the world and my friend that knew her told her about me and she asked for my number and seemed interested but I freaked out and said I didn’t like her to my friend (which he said to her). 

I also tend to avoid talking to attractive people because I feel like they won’t like me and I hate it because I know its dumb and comes across as rude but I just can’t have a normal conversation with them because I feel like they’re too attractive to even be interacting with me.

Today, my car wouldn't start. So a friend (also classmate) picked me up so I could make it to class. Then after class we went to get something to eat and then went over to her house to study and do homework.

My younger brother needs a place to stay, boyfriend is adamant he cannot come here...and data this a relationship dealbreaker if I allow him here. But I feel obligated as he's my brother and has no one and he is suicidal.. but I also worry about it becoming a long term thing and fear for the safety of my child.

I have a 5 month old baby and live in a tiny bachelor apartment, I have the father of my baby here who doesn't get along with my brother.
He does not like my brother as my brother has stolen from family, and showed up at our home high on heroin whilst I was pregnant. Etc... 

My brother is 19... He is now homeless as of today  and off hard drugs (unsure of this tbh) he is mentally unstable and believes he experiences others memories by touch etc...he also sees abuse in many situations where it is not happening and fiends to retaliate with violence, often threatening with knives even to close family and friends...he is also leaving an abusive relationship. 


He is on probation for theft and fleeing the scene so legally he shouldn't be in my home and only at a certain address after a certain time a d has had police warn him in  the last 24 hours. This is legal implications for me and him if police come here.

He has a terrible temper. And does not listen to things asked of him as he has issues with control (eg smoking inside moments after being told not to) 

I love my brother. I want to help him. I am also very poor at the moment and cannot afford to have him with me long term and likely I won't be able to get him to leave... I also fear as he is unstable he may become violent. 

Out of love I want him here but I worry if I do I could cause greater issues.

I've set him up with local resources to get on financial aid, offered food, bus tickets, doing laundry etc..

Logically I know it's risky to have him come here, but he also needs support and I fear he may hurt himself without it as he has attempted suicide 3 times now.

I don't know what to do..  I'm terrified of possibilities ...

However, it is worth mentioning that I don’t like studying with N because I feel as though I put in more effort than he does and it seems like he just waits for me to figure out the answer and then he just kind of copies whatever I write down, without really giving any attempts at the problem. I still study with N because I know he has a hard time with some of our biology courses and I genuinely want to help him succeed, but I’ve been trying to keep it more to a minimum. In a result of this I’ve been studying with other people, more specifically J, who is friends with both N and I. N noticed that I’ve been studying with J a lot and seemed to try to cover it up. He wasn’t wrong, I was doing it because I felt like I had to include J every time I studied with N. But the part where the conflict actually starts is because I fucked up and declined studying with N to do homework with J and N caught me because I completely forgot I told him I couldn’t study. 

N confronted me about it and it was a long conversation and I ended up telling him the reason why we hadn’t been studying together much, which I maybe shouldn’t have done. Now I feel like an asshole and I know N is still hurt (I saw him today and could definitely tell). I want to make it up to him and continue being his friend, I just can’t study with him all that often. What can I do?",26Feb2019,1

275,"First post and I’m on mobile (TL:DR At bottom sorry it’s so long)

A little backstory: I was the schools horse girl, but with ducks. I have no idea why, but ducks were my favorite animal, and everyone knew it. My ADHD was really bad back in elementary school and I was practically insane. I was loud, hyper, told everyone everything. Needless to say, I got bullied. I wasn’t shoved around, but it was people constantly making fun of me. Remember that whole “gullible is written on the ceiling” well 5th graders could paint on the tiles. Someone. Wrote. Gullible. I hated that room. Whenever we were in it at least 3 people would tell me “look up, gullible is on the ceiling”. I never could remember what room it was so I just stoped looking. Which made people laugh. I remember drawing some smiley faces on a card holder thing, (green cards meant you were good, yellow you got a warning, red meant you were bad) only to find the next day they were all crossed out and every single red card was in mine. Now the first time I thought nothing of it. Until it happened again. And again. And again.

Star of the issue: all of those things were very miner compared to the amount of people making fun of me for ducks. It got so bad I went to the counselors in like 4th or 5th grade because I was so upset after so long. Yeah it didn’t help. The duck jokes carried over till 8th grade then finally died. I was petrified of someone bringing it up. I couldn’t look at a duck without getting paranoid, i couldn’t call a stuffed animal cute. I made sure to get rid of most of my things that were ducks when I moved (not to far, I stayed in the same district) including my favorite, giant, stuffed duck. A friend of mine made a joke on what I used to say and do in elementary school, except one of my main bullies was right in front of us. I was 2 seconds away from a full blown panic attack. 

Problem: I’m in my second semester of college now and I really want to watch the show Duck tales. However my anxiety is so bad I can’t even say that out loud. Just typing it is making me worried. The show looks like something I would love but, I can’t bring myself to watch it. If I end up liking the show (which I probably will as I’ve seen clips and I loved them) then I feel as if I’m backing up into a corner. Realistically, no one cares/remembers but the 1% chance someone will is enough for me to just not watch. 10th grade was when all bullying really stopped. I’ve gone 3 1/2 school years without any bullying and I can’t break that streak. I really need advice on how to break this mindset. I’m sick of walking in a grocery store during Easter and getting scared when I see a duck/chick decoration. I hate being scared to watch a kids show. I don’t know what to do 

TL:DR: I got bullied from kindergarten - 8th grade for being obsessed with ducks (like a horse girl stereotype) and now im in college wanting to watch the show Duck Tales and I can’t bring myself to actually watch in fear the bullying may start again (yes, I know, it’s completely unrealistic but an anxious brain will think what it wants to think) ",26Feb2019,1
276,"I'm 16 and I take pictures for my yearbook at school and while I was at a girls basketball game I was hanging out with a para teacher and one of HIS friends came over by him and they were talking which I didn't mind about but when I started taking pictures this guy says ""Don't you be creepin on my girl there"" I don't  know who this man's daughter is even and I quickly said ""oh, I'm just taking pictures for the school"" and this guy grabs his fingers into my collar bone which I just thought he was messing around, it hurt but it didn't hurt very bad but about 15 seconds in I said, ""hey okay this kinda hurts can you seriously stop"" and he kept doing it for like 10 more seconds.

280,"The people in my group are all close friends and us guys have been together for around 2-3 years. We are in a group chat  and all practically know each other very well. Problem is, is that everything has changed during 2018. What i thought of how we see each other is completely different to how i feel they see me. A sort of girl group now hangs out with us during recess and lunch and its not that im awkward around them, in fact they are pretty good people. It's just that now I feel like I am the 'extra' of the group. Even if I joke around or discuss with someone, i mostly get ignored or they visibly look and say ""yeah"" or anything blunt and discuss other things with others in the group.

It kind of hurts. There was a video on r/all not that long ago about this kid in VRChat as Kermit and he talks about his social problems. He said something like 'If i wasn't funny, whats the point of knowing me' and i felt that because i don't know how else i could be friends with those guys if i didn't tell jokes here and there. I have tried telling one of the guys i'm just gonna take a break and i did by hanging out with other friends. But the problem is, is that keep in mind we are close friends so if i felt off or down, they do ask ""whats wrong"" or ""are you okay"" and when i don't hang out with them for a bit, they do say ""you don't hang out with us anymore dog"" (as a joke) or ""where have you been man"" and this does make me happy because i feel great that they realise i'm not with them when i should but then this leads to that unending loop of me going back to hang out with them only to feel like that 'extra' again. I did talk about feeling like this (to an extent) to the closest friend of mine in that group, yet he insists that they never see me as an 'extra' but does agree that the girl group did change our group significantly making it more 'awkward'.

It's a shame because who i thought was my best friend in the group, was literally the same or even closer with others so technically i really don't have any best friends i can vent to.

It's come to the point where i literally feel sick hearing that i have recess or lunch next because of the anxiety of not knowing what to do, speak or even just the little things like where should i sit so that im not as ignored in the conversations. There's even times where i feel like the last resort as a person talk to, for example: if it was just me and a friend from the group, we would get along and shit but if there was another person that this friend knows sitting with us, then it just feels like a one-way conversation between them.

There are others who i hang out with outside the group and they are good people, but have noticed that i've started hanging out with them more than my close friend group and have questioned me which leads me to no response because i don't want them to feel that i only hang out with them because they are my supposed '2nd choice' which is not true.

Now these guys in the group may seem like bad friends, but they are really good guys and would never put someone down *intentionally.* My problem is, is that i feel like they don't know they are indirectly putting me down or making me feel out of place with those little things that happen during interactions. I'm on the verge of sending a detailed long message on how i feel about this group and myself in the group chat and how much it has changed but don't know what to say because i feel like this is all me just feeling this kind of stuff and am overreacting yet i really do feel uncomfortable during our interactions or after. I'm just afraid they think of me differently if i vent out to these guys and things would never be like the old times.

Am i taking this too far or should i really confront these guys about how i feel?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR) Group changes making me feel all over the place yet I'm still hesitant to leave because of how i know the guys.

281,"Hoping for your advice on an issue I’m not sure what to do about.

My roommate and I both have dogs. She is gone 40-50 hours a week and I work from home. Since I am usually home and she’s gone, she will frequently ask me to let her dog out to pee (4x a week usually, sometimes 5x). We’re in an apartment so this involves putting on her collar and taking her downstairs and outside. I also can’t take her dog and my dog at the same time because she pulls too hard if another dog is around, so I have to take them separately. 

Now, this doesn’t take me long — probably about 5 minutes — but I’m starting to get frustrated about it. People usually get paid for this sort of thing. Sometimes she’s gone for a long time (11-12 hours) and she relies on me to let her dog out.

The only reason I haven’t said anything yet is because she’s always willing to help if I’ll be gone and my dog needs to get fed or go out to pee. It doesn’t happen often since I work from home (maybe once every two weeks), so I sort of feel like the trade off is unequal. I don’t want to make things weird by bringing it up since she may not want to help me out if I Express not being willing to take her dog out as often. We also are decent friends and I don’t want to ruin that either. The only thing I can think of doing is just lying and saying I’m not home when she asks me to let her dog out. 

Am I making a big deal out of nothing?

TLDR: I work from home, my roommate asks me to take her dog out to pee pretty much on a daily basis during the week. Not getting paid for this. Haven’t said anything yet because I have my own dog that she sometimes helps me out with and I don’t want to make things weird.",26Feb2019,2
282,"I have two upstairs neighbors who like to make a lot of noise, most of the time. I’ve constantly had to ask them to turn their loud music off at odd times of the night during the work week (10:30pm, 11:30pm, 2am, etc.), and I have gone as far as filing complaints with our leasing office. 

Since January, there has been an incessant strong vibration traveling down to my place from theirs. A few days ago I went up to find out what the noise was and talk to them once again about playing music loudly at odd hours. It turns out it’s a new fish tank they installed to which the guy acknowledged that it is loud, but won’t necessarily do anything about it.  I looked online and it seems that quiet filters are fairly inexpensive. 

My question is: should fish tank filters/pumps create vibrations strong enough to travel down into someone’s apartment below you? If so, what are some fixes?

284,"As you may have guessed by the title, this is an alt.

I've used Reddit for 3 years as a way to release stress. I'm 16 now and it's been immensely helpful. On my main account have have a fair chunk of karma, and I know it sounds stupid, but it means too much to me to just give that all up.

Anyways, the trouble started about a month ago. I had made a post on my main about my boyfriend and how my entire family doesn't know he exists. My twin sister, about a week later, asked me about my boyfriend by the fake name I used for him on Reddit. When I asked her about it, she said she got the wrong name and it wasn't a big deal. I didnt push the issue further.

Fast forward a week and I post a political opinion that my family disagrees on, about cops or guns or something (I can't remember, lol) We get in an argument 3 days later and she says ""At least I don't support _____!"" And storms off. At this point, I knew she had access to my Reddit account. I don't know how, but she did. 

So, no biggy, my twin sister and the person I trust most in the world knows a few more secrets about me. I wrote it off and just got more careful about stuff I posted. I would post stuff on the broken bone subreddit (I have a broken tibia) about what my PT said and she'd ask about it. Stuff like that.

Now, I'm screwed. Long story short, I got in a fight with my dad and posted a rant on some rant subreddit about my dad being a racist. Well suddenly my entire family and extended family has an image of that post. They're messaging me on Facebook trying to tell me I was wrong. The whole thing was screwed up, I deleted the post and apologized on Facebook. But I was pissed. She sent a screenshot of a rant post to everyone in my family.

It's been 2 weeks and the only people who are acting normal are my mom and my brother. My twin sister is avoiding me and my dad keeps making comments about ""When are you going to move out?"" Etc. I'm six-fucking-teen. I know to some people this doesn't seem like a big deal, but my dad doesn't joke around. He's actually sending my mom legal stuff about moving me out. I don't know what to do. Can I fix this, is there any way for me to?",26Feb2019,40
285,"So here's the situation. I got denied on my Medicaid renewal but I'm fighting it and give myself a solid 50/50 on winning. If I get to keep it, all my medical expenses are free.

My only other option is to enroll with my work which has crappy insurance but I'll need it if I can't keep Medicaid.

If I sign up for my insurance through work, and end up keeping my Medicaid, is it possible to cancel insurance through my job? I know you can usually only enroll or cancel during open enrollment, which ends in three days.

It would suck to opt out of it and get denied for Medicaid. It would also suck to sign up for it and lose a hefty chunk of my checks and get approved for Medicaid and not end up being able to cancel insurance I'll literally never use.

286,"I’ll try to keep this short (that’s what they all say, amirite) TL;DR at the bottom.

Dated for around 3 years. During the first year of dating, I found out that she was still talking to her ex at that time (the same ex that saw her merely as a way to fill his sexual desires, even texted her for favors throughout my relationship with her and she knew this as well). She would always complain about him even before we started dating, yet there she was...still talking to him... one year into our relationship...under a woman’s name on her phone so I wouldn’t get “suspicious”. 

Obviously, a conversation should arise about how uncomfortable I am, to which she replied, “we’re just friends now, don’t worry about it. You’re the only one I love. You’re the only boyfriend I’ve had that actually cares about me and treats me like a woman, etc”. Well, I don’t know what it was, but I knew something was not genuine and sure enough, several months later I find out she had gotten into the car with him and “only” made out with him. I don’t know why I didn’t break up with her at that point. Most likely because I thought I was “in love” with her and/or she was my first girlfriend so maybe I was just blind. 

Fast forward to around the second year of the relationship. We’re about to graduate high school and move to college. Relationship is as best as it can be. I give her a promise ring (with her parents permission, which now that I look back at it, might’ve been weird, but I liked her family and they said I was the only boyfriend she had that they approved of, so why not build on that trust). Then off we go to college together.

Third year of dating. College away from home. A new sense of freedom for the fishies. All is good, with her new promise ring she wears everywhere and she seems to enjoy all the “WOW” looks she gets from her new friends. 

Later on, she starts work and she seems to be hanging out with a particular coworker all the time, even going to his house (she says he always hosts get-togethers there with the other coworkers) “he’s just a coworker, don’t worry”...gee, where have I heard that before. She’s always going on nights she works and says it’s because I don’t really spend time with her and it’s a lot of fun there. I admit, I haven’t been the best boyfriend at this time, mostly because I’ve been focusing on school work and trying to help my best friend back home via voice calls, but I mean I guess I could’ve tried harder. So I did, I explained the situation to my best friend on how I might be losing her and he understood. We watched movies together, took her out to dates more often than I have in the past, and stayed with her in her dorm to talk about life stuff and eat macaroni until she either had school or work. One night, she broke down crying.

O boi. 

Apparently she felt guilty whenever I would start doing these things and confessed that she had intercourse with her coworker on multiple occasions. What I felt that day was absolutely devastating and it honestly brings back some pain just writing this. 

Side note: Ironically, her ex, the one at the beginning of this post, cheated on her, and I remember her crying for what seemed like a span of 3 weeks everyday in high school. So she knows what it feels like. During the first month of dating she even told me that she wouldn’t want to wish that feeling even onto her worst enemy. Welp. I don’t know what the heck that makes me then -  you’re best friend?! 

Two weeks after she confessed, we never talked again. I’ve only seen her very rarely on campus for brief seconds and I never made an effort to talk to her and catch up on things. Her mother still texts me from time to time to see if I’m doing okay. Which I can proudly say I am..after years of wondering what went wrong, how I could’ve prevented this, and countless times that I’ve blamed myself for everything.

Now to the present. I’ve decided to forgive both her and myself. I will be graduating college soon and I honestly miss talking to her. I made a lot of friends along the way, but it’s really not the same. I also heard from friends that she now has a boyfriend so maybe she’s moved on? Maybe she doesn’t want to talk to me and is perfectly content with how things ended? Should I text her and meet up with her? Am I making a huge mistake?

TL;DR - Huge red flags I ignored throughout relationship, ex ended up cheating on me. I forgive her and want to catch up after years of not talking. Should I?

287,"I \[23F\] have just come home from college out of state and am back at home with my younger siblings, three boys and I am the only eldest girl. Being the oldest of course there's the expectation of taking on responsibilities early on and often even making up for parents' shortcomings, in some siblings' eyes.

My mom had become fairly neglectful after being divorced a couple years ago, and my brothers have taken the short end of this more than me, because I went away to college very soon after the split. Them, still young and growing up in the household, experienced more of the post-divorce effects including shortage of money, parents dating others, moving around a lot and so forth. I often feel like I lived a very different childhood to them being that I grew up while mom and dad were still together and they didn't. 

Whenever I would come back home on school breaks, one of my brothers would constantly insult me, mainly being degrading in a misogynistic way. I noticed the same behavior towards my mom, who he felt rightful anger towards, because of her often bad parenting, like smoking weed, or never providing healthy foods that they really wanted instead of constant fast food. He made a lot of comments to me that I was just like mom, comparing my fun college life habits to those of a middle-aged mom who simply had her priorities wrong, drawing parallels of her irresponsibility to my, just, having a good time away at university. He stated things like he could never see me with a family, or asked me blatant ""what are you even doing in college anyways"", only focusing on the fun I had and not my studies, when in fact I was working my ass off for my degree.

Now that I'm back for good, at least for now, I'm getting so much anger from him in the form of frequent and backhanded insults, on the way I dress, my job, what I shop for. Despite this, I have come back home from university immediately and in earnest, to help my family financially as I'm the older one - buying Christmas presents, giving gas money, helping siblings pay rent, and taking them shopping. Its exhausting. With the already existing burden of being an older female figure in the family over all boys (in a traditional household where the paradoxical idea is women should get the highest degree of education but also be motherly, wife material, etc), my mom has neglected and in many ways relinquished her duties, leaving the responsibility on me to feed them during the weekends when shes away with a boyfriend, and furthering my brothers displacement of frustration onto the next female proximal to him - me.

How do I confront him about this? I feel like a guilty slave to my family, who, despite receiving my help, always seem angry at my for having gone to school in the first place. How do I also stop feeling ashamed for literally just going away to college? Is this a time where I should be stepping forth to help as much as I can, or should I be looking for distance to conserve my mental health? I love my mom, my three brothers, and my dad (who is kind of out of the picture due to mental health circumstances) to death and want to help the best way that I can. I was offered the best education because at the time my parents could afford it. But at the same time the backhanded anger I get hurts a lot, and I feel completely underappreciated.

288,"In high school, maybe 5-6 years ago now, two kids were in a fight. One of them got beaten up really badly.

As the beatdown was happening, a group of kids surrounded it and laughed. No one seemed to take any issue with it. Everyone found entertainment in seeing someone get physically beaten.

To be fair, I am not a mind reader, and it’s possible other people disapproved of it too, but didn’t speak their disapproval out loud. But so many people were expressing *approval* (laughing, clapping, etc) that it’s safe to say most people didn’t take issue.

I was traumatized then, and it still hurts me half a decade later. I don’t claim moral superiority over everyone else, but the fact that a physical beating didn’t upset people still hurts. People were supporting this fight. Some of the most polite people I knew were cheering it on.

How can it not bother you to see someone getting beaten so badly? That’s someone’s sibling getting beaten, someone’s child, someone’s grandchild. I don’t understand.

The guy who beat up his opponent in the fight was one of the most respected and popular kids in school. This fight didn’t seem to hinder his popularity, though he did go on to make some enemies with other things.

291,"So my cousin recently got an arranged marriage in December. She at first did not want to get into the marriage but after some convincing she agreed and got married. Now for some context I’m not really close to my family either anymore but I attended her wedding and spent a few days with the couple and they seemed pretty happy. She used to live with her brother, his wife, their kid, and their mom(my aunt) she moved with him a state over which is about a 3 hour drive from where they live. My family’s pretty conservative in tradition but still liberal enough for me to be certain they would not have forced her into the marriage if she had said no and never changed her mind, I dislike my family because of issues of religion and I left the religion and thus my family too so trust me if they were the abusive forcing types I would have gone straight to the police. Anyway we all met up for the first time after her wedding last week and the couple was fine they were acting normal literally nothing out of the ordinary. But today, nearly 2 months after their wedding she leaves a pretty disturbing message in a family group chat I heard the voice message but since I’m technically not in the family I’m not actually in the chat so I’m paraphrasing but basically she says that she’s sorry she let everyone down and to take care of her baby niece and nephews and don’t make the same mistakes with other girls in the family that we made with her. She’s crying and she says “what did you guys do to me.” And then she closed all her social media accounts and either blocked us all, turned off her phone, or she just got a new one. So my other cousin, her brother, calls her husband and he is shocked just as much as we are. I’m not so gullible as to believe he’s without blame but honestly he seemed pretty sincere. He said that she made him breakfast in the morning and nothing was weird so he went to work but after my cousin had called him he went back to the house and found that their bedroom door was locked. We called the police and they showed up a little after him and opened the door for us and found a note saying she hated the guy and named the older family members as oppressors and that if she was to go back to us she would probably be forced back to his house. The cops said there was nothing that they could do since she left willingly, so me and my cousin go down to the police department and we try and explain the whole situation and we come up with the argument that she’s suicidal and that she could be a threat to herself, which I actually believe, but the cop told us that if we don’t have any reasonable proof to back up the claim that she might be suicidal they couldn’t help us. Anyway we leave the department and go back to my cousin’s place. Basically we do have proof because in the voice message she confesses that she had been depressed since her previous relationship from 7-8 months ago and that if she “didn’t leave she would have ended up either killing her self or him” My biggest concern is her safety of course and throughout the day we were reaching out to any friends that might have helped her but we came to nothing. We could go to the police with the voice mail and hope they can help us find her but I’m personally afraid that she’ll probably resent us more, not to mention what the police would even do once they found her? Would they throw her in some institute for evaluation? Would we be making a bad situation even worse? Chances are she’ll probably reach out in a few days but I’m worried sick about her. I texted her saying she could live with me until she got back on her feet (She sold her car before the wedding and also had to leave her job as she was moving states) she’s got maybe enough money to last her a few weeks and her list of friends is short. She didn’t get my message as it’s still not delivered.

I feel just confused about my feelings and not sure what this is. It’s definitely not a crush, it’s a lot more caring and I just want to be with her. I probably don’t even stand a chance as she probably doesn’t like me but I need help.

Also, my parents are traditional Asians and I’ve always been taught to find a “Chinese girl”. However this girls white which makes me feel confused.

Could someone just tell me what emotion this is?

299,"I've been pretty concerned about this for a while, but just got around to actually asking his weight today. I did the math and I actually started crying. 40 lbs underweight and a BMI of 14. I couldn't believe it.

We have a very stable and strong relationship and I love him more than anything. Except he's a bit weird about this issue in particular.

He basically doesn't eat when he's stressed. He's been stressed for a while because of a certain situation at his job. He is more than likely autistic. He says that eating in this emotional state makes him feel ill.

Any time I say anything about this issue, he avoids it. It's always not the time to be thinking about it or something like that. He has expressed a fear of dying over this. And he has had episodes of like, almost fainting due to no energy. He has to be on his feet for 9 hours a day, most of the time like 10-15 days in a row until he gets one day off. I am understandably not okay right now. He is trying to eat more in the mornings but still getting like, 1/3 of his required calories on a bad day and 2/3 on a good day. That's to maintain his current unhealthy weight.

What am I supposed to be looking out for, in terms of health risks? What would give out first? Is trying to get a ton of liquid calories (sweet coffee, hot chocolate, etc.) into him to make up for those calories a bad idea? I am also basically considering feeding him greasy lard bombs (which he would probably eat like a small piece of before giving up). But I feel like I would just swap one set of problems out for another. Who do you even go to in a situation like this?",26Feb2019,1

I was dating a girl for a while after we had been friends for about a year and a half, during that time I was mostly the initiator texting her starting conversations a keeping conversations going. Overall talking was almost like a 70-30 workload with me having to carry conversations. We broke up because she said she wasn't ready to date and still wants me to carry convos and text her often. She doesn't say this outright but we don't talk unless I text her, if I don't we won't talk for several weeks. I can't deal with this anymore, I was really hurt when she broke up with me and it hurt me to talk to her.

Nights spent crying, constant weekly gaslighting, and being treated like a door mat got me to the point where enough was enough. I put my foot down and stood up to her.

She lashed out in return. When it didn't work. She sent her main girlfriend, who she cheated and left me for, to harass me with messages, making multiple online accounts to get around blocking me.

A police report later and she stopped harassing me. My ex became even angrier and said just, unforgivable things. 

But one thing keeps resurfacing. She mocked and belittled me, that I won't ever have sex with her again and see her naked. Where her girlfriend sadisfies her in ways I never could and no one would ever touch a limp disgusting piece of trash like me. That I will alway be alone, and to enjoy my hand alone without her or anyone ever again. *Her words still:* because the only way I could ever be with a woman was to rape one.

I haven't been well. The way she treated me was the same my parents had growing up minus the beatings. 

Four months so I nce the fight and everytime I am in the mood still, her words creep into my mind. I feel disgusting and alone. It's something I hate now and can't seam to ever enjoy. And I know I should not care about anything she says. None of it is true.

I talked to her about it, mainly just having a joke but I wanted to make sure she is ok. She was, and that was that.

309,"Firstly, I don’t have any hard feelings really. 

This breakup was a long time coming, as she was clearly not able to balance college (which we both just started) and our relationship. As a way for her to vent her stress of college, she was causing arguments almost every day, and she was avoiding me every chance she got just to avoid the stress of arguing, and her grades were slipping and she was using the arguing as the excuse because she “wouldn’t be able to focus after an argument” which I 100% understand. People deal with stress in different ways and this was hers, we tired so many things to get her temper under control over the 4 years together. Yoga, Exercise, different anger management methods, Dieting, Journaling... 

Nothing helped, so this was the next logical step.

But, since college started, she started spending more time with my friends because she liked to play video games as a way to escape from her responsibilities, and we all have our things, mine is watching YouTube tbh. Anyways, I was too focused on my studies though, to spend any time with them...

So when the breakup came, they had to choose who to boot, and even though I was there for longer, I guess she was just closer with them recently as I was admittedly distant from them because of school. So yeah, they chose her. 

Now obviously not all my friends, I still have a few who weren’t part of our main group, and, some friends from college. But the vast majority.

So... No girlfriend for the first time since I was 15... And no friends for the first time since First Grade... Basically starting my life from scratch minus my studies and my job...

318,"I got an internship working on a T.V set as a production assistant. My dad used to work in production and knows the owner of the company from college. I understood that the days were long and I was going to be on my feet all day. I was prepared, eager , and understood that I would get a lot of stress.


On the first day they had one production assistant, not even my supervisor show me around and explain things for ten minutes. One of my supervisors Meg is a woman, as soon as she meets me she takes a condescending tone with me and replies to me with “yeah girl” passive aggressively. She also implies that I’m useless a lot.


I try to always keep a positive attitude, don’t complain, am punctual,and try to be a team player. I respect my coworkers boundaries, I try to make conversation about where they’re from or where they went to school. I try ask if they need any help or what needs to be done during down time. I walk around set checking trash/areas during down time. I ask other departments if they need help sometimes. I feel like I’m doing the same amount of work as my coworkers, but my supervisor nitpicks me a lot.


On my third day in I had only done one run. Usually what they mean by “runs” is going out to buy stuff needed on set or get coffee/lunch for the higher ups. When asked to get lunch by my other supervisor Matt Meg rolled her eyes and gave three names of other people she’d rather go on the run. Finally she lets me go but is passive aggressive. It takes 30 minutes to get to the restaurant as soon as I get there at 30 minutes she texts me asking if I have gotten the food. I say no she says hurry up.


I get the food, get back as fast as I can while she’s constantly calling and texting me checking where I am. When I get back she grabs the food quickly in a condescending tone says “thanks girl”.she told me to ask questions, that they want me to learn. But whenever I ask questions I get a “just figure it OUT” or her rolling her eyes at me, then explaining to me like I’m five. I ask for feedback from my other supervisors and coworkers, they say I’m doing a good job. I always take criticism seriously and want to do the best job. 


She constantly whispers about me to my supervisor Matt. Sometimes I get confused about names of places on set or where stuff is. If I don’t know where stuff is immediately she’ll whisper to him “OH “MY GOD SHES SO SLOW SHE DOESNT KNOW WHERE STUFF IS”. I’ve never worked on a set before and I explained this to them. My supervisor Matt has a dog in the office that I have to walk sometimes. The dog is huge,it yanked me forward, and I got scraped up bad.


When Meg saw she was annoyed and told me to go to the medic then get back to work. Every time I enter a room I feel like Matt and Meg give me dirty looks and ignore me. I’m a reserved person, I like to keep to myself. I do try to take interest in my coworkers and learn a little bit about them but I feel guarded. On my last day of shooting I felt so uncomfortable. They said bye and thank you to me in a condescending tone.


I sent an email to the owner of the company thanking them for the opportunity and educational experience. Only a couple of paragraphs.The owner responded right away saying that I was a good team player and thanks for the help on set. My supervisors ignored my email.

I am in my late twenties, and I have worked for a sloppy but personal small company, a couple of big corporate environments where nobody gives a shit about you, and one company that was voted best workplace in the country I was living in at the time and was amazing aside from the fact that my whole team left right before I got hired and was in limbo for the entire time I was there. I work hard, regardless of whether I like what I do or not, but lately it's getting harder and harder to maintain my usual level of productivity and to repress my disappointment at what I hoped would be a fulfilling career. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in school I was so motivated and driven, excited and ambitious about learning new things and moving forward. I worked full time the whole time, graduated with honors, stressed about bills but managed everything with a smile and a social life - I want to feel this way again, that there is a purpose to what I do. But no matter how hard I try to be postive  I just never felt that way while working. I have learned a lot while working in my field and  progressed a lot in terms of pay and position in just a few years so by my own measures of success I am doing ok, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm not moving forward, but away from what I should be doing. \[Note that I have no idea what I should be doing, all I know is that this isn't it, and as each year passes I get more and more anxious and angry about the smallest tasks, how incompetent the people I work with are (even when I change work environment), and how I wish I was the type of person to just pull the plug and be free but I feel that this is idealistic and naive.\]

&amp;#x200B;

I have savings, enough to fund me for at least half a year if not a full year if I budget, so what do I do? I went sober 6 months ago, to see if these depressing thoughts are exacerbated by a live for the weekend lifestyle. I started meditating and practicing yoga around the same time to try and deal with these emotions. I read books that discuss the meaning of life, how to be happy, changing mindset and I am admittedly a lot better at controlling and calming these feelings and I don't show them out at work. I am happy for the most part, but inside this is slowly eating me alive, and it is now almost a daily occurrence that I just want to throw my laptop out a fucking window screaming, and swallowing it down does not seem like the right move anymore.

So I'm starting a new job today in a very big restaurant/hotel as a prep chef, I've done very little in the way of cheffing before at my old job maybe 2-3 shifts and then 1 trial shift at my new place.

340,"Hello people, this is my first post on reddit so I am a little bit excited and anxious. And english isn't my first language so feel free to point out my mistakes.

I am a 14 year old boy. I go to 8th grade which I am very worried in, since there are High School exams this year. And I have problems like other people. Depression,Stress,Family matters and I am not that social and cannot talk properly,most of the time, without waiting a few seconds and thinking what should/could I say. Anyway the main topic is this: I have a crush on a girl.

I mean I understand if you just say: ""You are just a kid, and your so called ""crush"" isn't real etc..."". But I can swear this is just so different. I know this because I had a so-called crush on an another girl before (both of them are in the same class). Well, it wasn't love in first sight, thats why I am telling you the history between us.

I will be calling her Laurel, her best friend Sarah,that boy will be Oliver (yea I am an arrow fan).

So Laurel and I met all the way back when we were only 4-5 years old. And by coincidence we were put in the same class in middle-school unlike elementary. I wasn't that close with her or the other girls. And, well, I was a little pervert. Not really though I was branded as one. I wasn't going around touching other people's asses. I only talked about sexual topics often. This was 5th grade. Thats when the problems started. I was kicked from the community because of this. And not only that not even a single night my mother and father would shut up. Always arguing and shouting enough to make my eardrums get destroyed. this still continues but I got used to it. Anyway when these started to happen I started to not being able to talk properly. People started to make fun of me all the time just because I couldn't talk.

Fast forward to 8th grade now. In the meantime I told my crush on that other girl to my so-called ""best friends"" at the time.Laurel knew this too. I didn't wanted to say this to her but my one of the fuckers that knew this decided to say this to them. Whatever. One day I was talking in the messenger with one of my friends and Laurel. We had a private group. My friend decided to open the topic of ""having problems"" while he had almost none. Then out of nowhere Laurel asked me if I had any problems or not. I said I had plenty. My friend didn't care. While Laurel DM'ed me and offered help. I didn't knew what to do at first. But I decided to tell her. She had her own problems as well which she shared with me. We got very close (atleast in my side) in short time. She was my best friend at the time and I didn't had any feelings for her. Mostly because she had a crush on Oliver. Who is Oliver? Oh boy (no pun intended) I can just throw that dickhead into toxic water and slowly watch him die. I know, that sounded a bit edgy. He is the perfect example of a hypocrite. So there is this other girl (I am calling her EA for short because both are asses) EA, which Laurel HATES. And, you guessed it, Oliver is friends with her. Laurel continuously said that he should stay away from that girl (oh and I forgot to say that Oliver has a crush on Laurel). Oliver never listens. And he actually gets jealous of me because I talk with Laurel more than him. He said to Laurel that he is jealous of me. And after that day Laurel started acting cold. One day I asked her why is she so cold. She replied by saying ""I dont want Oliver being close with EA so I don't think talking to you is right. And you know Oliver, he is jealous."" Well I wasn't that surprised. I offered that I dont talk to her in school and she gladly accepted.

Thats when I started to love her. Everyday was hell for me. In a span of a week we would only speak about 1-5 sentences (excluding messenger). I was in love and I never said this to anyone. I kept it inside me and I am still doing this.

Now the part that hurts: I lied to her.

You would expect that it is a big thing and all but IT WAS NOT. The only thing I said was that ""I had a 40 level plane in merge plane (an mobile game that we both play)"" It was only to joke but I took it a bit far by saying the same lie for 4 days. When I told the truth she was a little angry. I was not that worried. But then she said I made her lost her trust on me. I was destroyed by this.

We were getting along fine though. So I kept it inside me once again and procedded with my life. Until the last 3 weeks.

She would look at me being very angry. I didn't knew the cause and when I would talk to her about any topic her voice tone would be like a damn murderer's. One day after school I asked her why is she doing this. She didn't reply to my question but Sarah said that she knew its cause. I said ""is it because Oliver is jealous?"" She said yes.

We weren't talking at all. Even in messenger she would cut the conversation short. She was still angry at me. I asked her the REAL reason why is she doing this. It was because she doesn't want to talk to a person whom she doesn't trust (this happened yesterday btw).

I was completely broken and sad. I don't know what to do anymore. my question is: What should I do?",26Feb2019,1

343,"I work in a supermarket, it’s just a part time job whilst I’m studying so I’m not too bothered about it. There’s this one guy who literally acts like he is our manager, when he’s just a regular colleague like me, and tries to boss us around and tell us what to do. 

Usually I don’t really care and let him get on with it, I just want to do my shift and then leave. But lately he’s gotten worse. What annoys me is that he is usually always on ‘fag breaks’ whilst we are all doing the things he’s told us to do. What got to me today was he started to talk down to me as I made a simple error last week and done it in front of my other colleagues.

350,"So I’m currently 18 and enrolled to study a Bachelor of  Zoology and Animal Science next week, with this week being my orientation on campus. Last year when deciding to apply for Zoology I felt pretty excited to do the degree, but for the past months (since January) I’ve had ‘cold feet’ and felt nothing but dread for studying it. 

There’s been many things that have made me reconsider studying this, including knowing a girl at my work who studied the exact same degree at the same uni and still works at our retail chain and with her degree only helping her be able to volunteer at zoos. As well as that fkn Caleb from Starbucks thing that’s been reposted on reddit a million times and has scared the shit out of me even further. 

I went on my first 2 days of orientation and the first day was boring and mortified me. Today was the 2nd day, and we did a ‘scavenger hunt’ which was fun but I also realise it’s not going to be anything like the course. I feel like an imposter at the campus making friends in my degree because I haven’t even bought the textbooks or resources yet even though I start in less than a week. 

I’ve considered a gap year but that also terrifies me because I’m scared it’ll turn into a year working my retail job and when I go back to uni the following year I’ll still be in the same issue of not knowing what I want to do. 

I don’t know if I should keep giving the course a go or if I should defer and have a break until I know. Zoology still seems interesting to me, but I don’t know if it’ll lead me to a career or if I find it interesting enough to study for 3 years. I also don’t know what I would study as an alternative at this point. I’m really stuck.

360,"Me and my girlfriend of 10 months are both 16 and have an amazing relationship and we both trust each other not to go fooling around with other people. One of my girlfriend's oldest friends (let's call him James) has walked to and from school with her for years and for that time James had been in a very long relationship with another girl. A few months ago James and his girlfriend broke up and although I was a little skeptical of his intentions with my girlfriend at first (she had sent him an underwear pic before we were dating and he was ""the one who taught her to appreciate her ass"") I quickly got over it because I trusted my girlfriend to do the right thing. They recently started texting and planning to hang out (gf let me read the messages and they hadn't actually hung out out yet) and I saw no harm in it. Except for one morning James had texted her saying ""love you"" quite out of the blue. She replied with ""as a friend or more"", to which he responded ""as a friend I guess but if you were single I would definitely do stuff with you"" and that alone was enough to make me and her both very uncomfortable. James asked her if she would ""do stuff"" if she was single and she responded with something along the lines of ""I'm in a great relationship with my bf and and thinking about that feels like cheating which I don't want to do"". 2 days later they were snapchatting and when my gf asked James what he was doing he said he was thinking, when she asked what about he responded with ""your ass"" she left him on read and about an hour later he snapchatted her requesting to know what she was wearing and she said she has a boyfriend and that is a completely inappropriate question to be asking, to which he responded "" there's nothing wrong with that question, just answer it"" she responded with ""Ok bye"" and has assured me she plans on never talking to James or hanging out with him again because he was trying to dismantle our relationship so he could swoop in and take her.

362,"My husband and I bought our first home in October 2016 in Victoria BC. We know the entire history of the house as it belonged to my husband’s mother and was built by his father (also the reason for their divorce? If so, hope it’s not cursed 😬) 

It was built on the back of a character home and you can’t really tell it exists unless you stare down driveways for no reason. Hugging the property is a covered parking lot and 3 storey apartment building. The parking structure is as tall as my back fence, 12 feet (The fence is actually 7, as my property is graded differently). Several balconies look in to my back garden unobstructed. 

On two different occasions, someone has egged the back side of my house that faces the apartment building. The first time I was able to hose it off the second storey of my house before the summer sun baked it into the paint, but this time the eggs left black streaks on the gray paint. Estimated $3000 to repaint the entire house now, and my attached neighbour is livid. 

I’ve been wracking my brain on how and *why* someone would egg the back of my house. There’s no real “front” to my home, so I guess the back was the easiest target? 

I’ve had a verbal altercation with the building’s property manager over complaints of my dog barking (it couldn’t have been him and never received official complaints from any authority ). The manager chose to wait until my husband was at work, midweek before noon, to confront me alone and try to intimidate me on my own property. Both egging incidents have happened since, but they happened a year later.

What should I do? The only way the eggs made it onto the wall would’ve been if someone had a good throw from a balcony, the parking lot, or the top of the parking structure. ([pictures of the building and egging](https://imgur.com/gallery/QYLRpQA) ) 

No matter what, the vandalism occurred on that property. Due to Canadian laws, im unable to record security footage that contains footage of other properties, so i dont know how i can catch the person who is doing this so we can hold them criminally and financially responsible for the damage. 

either that, or my mom suggested paintballing their stucco through a second storey window.

So he had a pool 'party' and invited this girl and a couple other people. He has always had a huge crush on her and when they made out cause she was almost drunk  he thought it was basically them dating now. So that day he also tried to put his hand down her pants, she didn't let him (this is important later). The other people who were there which I'm also good friends with told me about this because im friends with them both and I asked what happened cause I was at a friends party. At school 3 days after most people knew about this but not many people but me and my friend knew the full story because we talked to her in a discord call for like 5 hours about it. She told us that he didn't listen the first couple times he tried putting his hand up her skirt. Somehow people found about the hand up skirt (not the almost rape) and started calling him a rapist as a joke. And he then and went complained to her crying like a little bitch cause he thought they were dating not knowing she has zero attraction to him and was going to ghost him but decided not to. So what he told her is that I told the entire grade of 150+ people that I said he 'violently raped her' which made her get really mad at me and idk if he actually thought I did even though I didn't get to school till like 30 mins after school started. So I already had plans with her that afternoon to meet and get food with a couple of her friends. The entire time I just sat there on my phone as she literally did not even say hi to me. That night I messaged her saying I understand if you don't trust me but I want to get my side out there and said that according to my other friends he has had a hate for me the past couple years which she said 'yeah its chill idc'. Ive now messaged her a couple times like I usually do just for a chat and she is ignoring me and she has posted on her private ig saying that im sorry if she doesn't reply to snaps because its glitching.

368,"On mobile so please forgive any errors.

TL;DR: company offers me the option of going hourly and I don't know what I want to do.

Currently I am a salaried employee. All PTO is accrued. The company I work for usually denies requests to make up time in lieu of PTO.

My department is 4 salaried employees: supervisor (S), co-worker (CW), myself, and one other person who is not relevant to this situation. It's worth mentioning that CW and I are the only ones with kids. It's also worth noting that depending on how busy we are, I work a lot of extra hours, by choice. I do not expect to be compensated for it.

CW has a habit of coming in 15 min early so she can leave 15 min early. She would take a day off and ""make it up"" by coming in early or leaving late. As stated above, company doesn't like that and put a stop to it. 

With recent weather came frequent school closures. CW lives about an hour away. While she could easily have her husband stay with their kid (works outside, so if school is out, he typically will not work), she chose to stay at home because of the commute. This is understandable. However, she does not have enough PTO to cover. Her pay is docked and she does not accrue PTO. 

At this point, I have just enough PTO saved up to go on a trip to see family. But my kid's school closed, it was my turn to figure out plans (ex and I take turns when our kids don't go to school), and this would cost me PTO for my trip. I call my supervisor, and ask if it would be at all possible for me to come in on Saturday. I will have plenty of work to do, so it will not be wasted. He checks with the owners, they approve it just this once due to the circumstances. That and it's not something I ever do.

Recently, the owners pull CW and I into their office. They ask us if we want to be hourly. This way, we accrue PTO on the time we work. We are told this makes sense in case we need to take multiple days off and don't have PTO to cover it. Same pay, same benefits, hours, lunch, etc. I would need to clock in and out. The only other difference is that rather than getting paid 2 times a month, we would get paid every Friday

I don't think I want to go hourly. I normally don't have a problem with my PTO, but I got roped in because of one incident. A part of me believes it's less professional to be hourly. Plus, as stated above, I work a lot of extra time during our busy season. I do not expect OT pay, I just do it because it needs done. Company does not approve of overtime unless certain conditions are met (almost never). If I clock in and out, my time card will show OT and I could possibly get in trouble or something. Not sure because it hasn't happened yet. 

Another downside is that I feel I would be less fiscally responsible if I get paid more frequently. I'm still working on not blowing my entire paycheck in one day.

I just don't know how to feel about this and what route to take.

I have created a App introduction video. I need your feedback on the video so i can improve it further. Here's the link

371,"TLDR:  I took what seemed to be a great job working for a smart businessman.  Turns out he's a vile person, the job is a bit of a letdown, and I need some help with my escape plan.  I also need to figure out what I can do to help save other folks from having their time wasted here.

&amp;nbsp;

Background:  I have held my current job for a few years, working for a wealthy individual and helping with the operations of his businesses.  When I first interviewed, I hit it off with this individual and was pretty eager to believe his sales pitch: interesting work, good pay (with potential upside in investments), opportunity to grow and eventually become a partner in his group or CEO of one of his companies.  The compensation was about average market rate, but with 30-40% of annual compensation tied to an annual bonus (golden handcuffs).  In hindsight, I should have seen that this would create a real headache in case the job turned sour and I wanted to leave in-between annual bonuses.  Unfortunately, I was too busy focused on potential upside.  The guy was also offering me a cut of the proceeds on a big investment vehicle he was working on raising... just around the corner.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward a few years.  The mask has lifted and it turns out my boss is a nightmare, this firm is a joke, and I was a complete fool to believe in this job opportunity that had fallen into my lap.  Where to begin?  

&amp;nbsp;

**The Boss:** Turns out this guy is a manic-depressive who alternates between periods of ""going dark"" and being unreachable for work purposes only to rally back weeks later with severe tantrums.  The guy lives alone (no family) in a skyscraper apartment.  Instead of going to an office, he has his minions visit him in his home.  I discovered that he usually keeps a (much younger, always attractive) assistant there, using a guest bedroom as an office, to manage his calendar.  These assistants never last (few months) because they are the first target of opportunity for verbal attacks and perhaps creepy advances.

I know that he had a wife at some point, before he started beating on her / was arrested for domestic violence, and she divorced with some serious money.  There are multiple articles about the arrest online, but these are obscured by his padded search results.  He has used his network to generate a bunch of short low-grade interviews with a mix of unheard of and sort-of respectable outlets (bloomberg online, forbes online, etc).  I also know that he has lied his way on to several ""Top Performing Investor"" lists by selectively reporting his investments.  He then set up an online presence (wikipedia etc) that cite his quotes in these articles to back up exaggerated / dishonest claims about him and his firm.  Don't get me wrong, he has a big resume.. but he's representing 200% of the truth to dazzle investors, potential employees, etc.  Real bullshit type guy.. and I bought his act.  

&amp;nbsp;

**The Firm:** The firm's website is riddled with obvious lies.  Claims of partnership with some of the top tech companies in the world.  Lists a whole bunch of employees who have not worked there in over a decade.  Lies about how much money the firm manages.  It's willfully misleading.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Job:** I have received the base salary and bonus discussed when I signed on.  Not too shabby.  The investment vehicle has been ""just around the corner now"" for about two years, and looks to be getting started just as I'm heading for the door.  I feel like a real fool for accepting a lower salary in exchange for interest in some future fund.  My shady boss played me like a fiddle, but at least I have no reason to stick around past my next work anniversary and bonus.  

&amp;nbsp;



Thanks if you read all that crap.  My current plan is to wait a few more weeks for my work anniversary (and hopefully collect a bonus before leaving).  Boss is currently on a hiring blitz, perhaps because he thinks I'm leaving.  No skin off my ass, but I would like to warn people that this place is not what it seems.  I worry about the guy who is going to fill my seat when I'm gone.  I really really worry about the next young female assistant this douchebag is going to have cooped up working out of his side bedroom.

Any advice would be welcome.  Thanks again for reading/skimming this shit.  ",26Feb2019,2

373,"Reposted because I realize the title may have been a bit harsh in the first post

Maybe the title is a little harsh but I just need help dealing with the type of female that one would call an ""attention seeker"". For one, i have the type of personality that just cannot be around those types of people. It drains me of my energy having to always be interrupted by a funny story or anecdote that they always need to add, no matter what the topic.  But I've tolerated her so long because we work together and my colleagues are like my second family so we spend a lot of time together whether I want to or not, but she just keeps crossing the line every time and while I normally would bite my tongue, she has been getting disrespectful to me, especially with my boyfriend. She will parade her ass in front of him, spend the evening talking to him about how she loves squirting (yes, that happened), and how much she appreciates him (mind you she's talked to him twice maybe), and taking off her lingerie in front of him. She wears garder belts ALL the time, even at work. And not the type that are hidden under a skirt or shorts and peek ou from time to time, when sitting in a certain position. No, I mean she wears them with booty shorts and a bra that is ""covered"" by barely anything, and has no shame about bending over in front of people. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for wearing whatever you want, freedom of choice blah blah but coupled with everything else about her, you can clearly tell she's only doing it for the attention. Last time, she went too far. Bending over in front of my bf, taking off her stockings and putting them back on as if she were doing a show for him, telling me that I treat my bf like a child and me his mother, just because I asked if he wanted a drink....I'm about 2 seconds away from losing my mind when I see her again, so I just need some advice from people who have been there or who have some advice about how to handle this type of person and situation gracefully and in a diplomatic manner.

376,"This may end up long. My apologies in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not entirely sure where to begin but I suppose the best word to sum up how I feel is nihilistic. I feel I'm aware enough to at least realize that my situation isn't really that bad, but I still feel as if I am fighting a losing battle each and everyday. I get more and more bitter and angry and resentful day by day. 

Both my weight and my financial situation burden me. It feels like I know each and every thing I need to do and should do to be the person I 'want' to be, but I can never seem to get more than a week or two and I end up falling flat on my face. If it's with diet, I fail by binge eating. If it's financially, I fail my spending sprees. Over, and over, and over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am young. Just 24 years old. I know I have tons of time to correct and even more than again to be 'successful', but many days I wake up and just feel so... lost? Like I don't care about it and I don't even want to try anymore. I constantly look to the future and think, ""is this what my life will be? Constant fighting to be a 'good person'""? I don't want to say specifically that I am suicidal, but my life just seems so moot when I delve into it. I realize I have no goals or aspirations. I've recently come to associating a sense of self-loathing with video games because I feel as if it's a waste of my time. Time I could spend bettering myself in some way, but then I just end up watching hours of podcasts or trying to read to no avail. It's as if nothing can dent this armor of hopelessness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had significant struggles with my mental health in the past, and even now, but I never find medication does anything lasting for me. Same as anything and everything I become attached to. I sink my teeth deep into new things and I thrive for brief periods right up until I crash and burn. I can't say I have any overarching interests or lasting loves. It's all a roller coaster that ends with it going off the rails. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again... it's as if I know the path to take but I cannot find a single shred of me that will hold onto the horse for long enough to make a difference. My single greatest accomplishment is getting through drug addiction. But then part of me wishes I could go back to that to lose all the goddamn weight that keeps coming back. I never will, I have etched that into my being, but I still dearly wish I could do anything without the aid of substance. Even the happiness I've come to find in the past has been from psychedelics. Psilocybin mushrooms seemed to give me temporary relief from my self-induced grief but I can't exactly tote them all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I have made some strides in the past years but I'll always find myself back here in this position... wondering why I do the things I do, wondering what it's all for and why I even continue on. It feels so completely... pointless. It's all for nothing it feels. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any advice anybody has as to finding a purpose or reason to exist? A reason to do anything at all?

They said there weren’t any errors on their part she just crashed on the table. This vet has put her under anesthesia before as well. Should I have asked for an EKG before?

383,"I don't really know why I'm writing this, I'm not sure what I want to hear. But here it goes...

Being raised in a dysfunctional family, I'm starting to feel something that I might think it is jealousy towards my friends who had it all growing up. I mean, when I was a kid, I thought that what I had was normal, but now I just wish my parents had taken me to guitar lessons and soccer practice and all that when I was a kid, instead of arguing, trying to kill themselves and (my father) drinking his way through life.

I tried doing a few things (tried soccer practice, basketball and guitar lessons), but we couldn't afford them, because my father hasn't worked in the last 25 years and my mom was also unemployed most of the time. And anyway, nobody helped me pursue my talents, so to say. They never once tried to take me to any kind of activity whatsoever. 

I'm 24 now and had yet to have a family dinner, first beer with my dad (it would be weird, as he is an alcoholic) and I know that it's too late now for that. I never had my dad cheering me at a football game, I never took my first drive with him, I never went fishing, swimming, or anything with him. My mother did what she could, but she was severely affected by everything that had happened to her (money problems, my father's alcoholism, depression, suicide attempts and everything).

And the problem is that when I think about the fact that someday I will have a son/daughter, two things come to mind:

1. That I would do anything to give her everything that he/she needs and that I didn't have. I would do anything to keep him/her happy, safe from everything.
2. That I would become jealous of him/her if I'll give him/her everything I didn't have, because it would only make me realize more everything that I've missed out on.

I know this might make me a bad person, it's just that I feel scared that the second thing will happen, and I don't want to ruin my future kid's life. I just want him/her to get everything and don't go what I've gone through, I want him/her to be happy and have everything, and I fear that I might not be able to provide him this.",26Feb2019,0
384,"Context: I am \[25M\] and live with my single mother and younger sister. Now before you jump to conclusions, I am a college graduate with a well paying job. I am self dependent and do my own cooking, cleaning, etc. I am socially awkward and have a hard time maintaining relationships (relevant later). I have to particular reason to move out and I am not looking to spend the rest of my days alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a married older sister \[30 yo\] or OS from now on that stays with us 5 days a week alongside her two boys (baby and a toddler) for working purposes, instead of living with her husband whom lives about 90 min away. Her usual schedule would be going to work at 7 am and back around 3-5 pm. All the while leaving her children to be baby sat by my mother, this ""temporary"" arrangement has been going on for 3 years. My mom is 60+ years old with poor health. Suffering from high blood pressure, obesity and who knows what else she isn't sharing thanks to her martyr complex. She can't enjoy her retirement years because she is too busy caring for her grand children indefinitely. My sister was suppose to find a job closer to her home the moment she got married but I see no effort for such thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I can remember, my OS was a bitch. Always angry about something and if she wasn't, she would always talk down on us. After my dad left us, she would out right demand and harass my mom to buy her vanity stuff, never things she actually needed. My mom, despite disapproving would always fold at the end and pay her up. This has been going on for 15 years. One day I decided to confront my OS about how she treats my mom and if she ever planned on moving out. She saw this as a personal attack and saw no wrong doing of what she does and ended the argument as she always does with me, by remarking how I would never get married and likely die alone. As I walked away mid her bitching she called me back demanding ""respect because she was 5 years older"". Usually I would just carry on because it was nothing new but something in me snapped. Might have something to do with her giving away my kitten while I was away for work few weeks ago. I told her to shove those 5 years up her ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

This of course didn't sit well with her ego and proceeded to tell my mom and younger sister to reprimand me I guess. My younger sister didn't particularly care but shocked my mom. In which after I dropped the truth bomb about how I feel about my OS and my mom's self destructive martyr complex. Both were angry with me, my OS again felt and saw no such thing in her behavior and my mom would just make excuses for her. Few days later my mom came to me asking me to apologize to my OS and return the house the way it was. But I refuse to bend to my sister ego yet again for the sake of ""peace"" in the house. Mean while my OS continues her holier than thou attitude and shows no sign of change, just the ""inevitable"" apology.

This is my first time asking reddit. It would mean a lot if you can give me your advice 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

So in short I’m (26f) someone in the creative field. I’m an artist, designer, videographer, animator &amp; content creator. I’m also experienced in social media and marketing which is a plus. 

So a few months ago I quit my job of 4 years to focus on being a better creator in general. Thought my old job was very limiting and didn’t push my skills or didn’t give me the creative freedom. It was all about how we can make money in the fastest way possible by creating more content. After 3 years, and after reaching a managerial position with good pay I decided to quit. I noticed that I wasn’t happy despite being good at my job, and I started working on projects after work just to keep the creative person in me alive. Everyone around me thought I’m crazy since I quit for nothing. I didn’t secure another full time job, and wanted to take sometime to redirect my career path &amp; discover what is it that I want. I’m freelancing at the moment, and I’m happy in my life. I get the time and freedom to work on what I want and choose the projects I’ll spend time working on.

But, I keep getting job offers in big companies abroad in the MENA region. They reach out to me without applying &amp; they are always excited to ask me to join the team as soon as I can. The only problem is I don’t have the gut feeling that tells me to go for it. I’m very grateful for all the opportunities, but my heart isn’t set up for it. All my friends and family disagree and encourage me to go for it, try it out for a couple of months or year and see what happens. But still I’m not convinced. 

Here are some of the reasons why I’m not encouraged.: 
-The jobs are for big news companies, which I’m not personally interested in working in that field. 
-All the jobs are asking for delivery of work in the fastest time possible, meaning quantity over quality. I don’t believe it’s the path I want.
-The pay is really good yet I’m not after money at this stage in life. I have no responsibilities at the moment &amp; i feel I shouldn’t stress much on stacking money. 
-I believe I’d be unhappy in a city I know no one in, it’ll take time to make friends. (I’m not particularly interested in living in those countries, anywhere else I’m all for it)
-I personally think it’ll just drift my path. I’m 100% sure if the title was exactly what I want I’d go for it regardless of the pay or place. I want sth in the film making industry, cartoon or gaming, something that would push my creativity &amp; improve my experience. 

But everyone around me is telling me I should go for it, it’s good for my CV and so on.

So after reading you’d think I shouldn’t go for it and that’s it. But my problem is am I being immature? I mean maybe I need a reality check, and the whole idea of finding your purpose isn’t important. Maybe I should take making more money more seriously since I’m an adult. Maybe I’m just being a baby and saying no because I’m scared of getting lonely in a city I know no one in. A part of me is scared that maybe I’m just living in my own la la land waiting for the perfect job. 

I don’t know! What do you think I should do? Any advice would mean a lot to me.

 I am not proud of her as a mother and I hate the core of her selfish personality and everything she chooses to stand for. She’s the cause of all my ill mental health and life problems. (And before anyone tells me anything, I AM DEALING WITH ALL OF IT THE BEST I CAN. Just because I found the blame, doesn’t mean I’m not working against it constantly. Please don’t berate me for it.) 

The moment I can cut myself off into a new life, I just don’t want constant reminders. 

Out of all her siblings she was the prettiest one so she was the most spoiled and had many admirers. In an older third world country, that was a bigger deal I guess. But that shaped her into the laziest, narcissistic human being who always put herself first before her own children. 

The entire lives of my two younger siblings from a different father, are pretty much my responsibility. 
I’m 22 but I’m always home or at work. Never been in a relationship or had any friends because I don’t have the time or mental capacity to think about my own life because I have to think about what my mother has neglected, even throughout middle school. 
Recently I’ve just been having bad cases of feeling “FOMO”, but I just continually suppress them. I can’t relate with any of my peers. I’ve been out of high school for a long time, and I haven’t been even able to consider going into college because I don’t have the time or money. I just feel like I’m just being left further and further behind. I don’t know how to drive or can even afford a car because life just swept me up the moment I finished high school, and the city bus is cheaper.

Despite coming from a dirt poor family, and still being on government aid, she still hasn’t worked a day in her life. Except those two times she worked at a caretaker home and quit after the first week, and McDonald’s for a month, then never ever again.

Which is why I hate the whole hard working immigrant family stereotype because I’m so jealous that that’s the exact opposite of what I’ve been saddled with. 

I’ve always felt orphaned despite having both parents still alive. But my contact with my father (who is the only parent I recall having any real parental bond with and who actually told me he loved me) had been completely severed when we moved to America. She would spend money for long international calls with her friends and boyfriend though! :)  

I remember being so young, pretending to be asleep, and listening to her conversations really late into the night, wondering why she couldn’t set the same thing up with our father. Hearing her giggle and be more affectionate with childhood friends and a boyfriend she never met in real life.
Meanwhile I hadn’t  heard my fathers voice once after that sad taxi ride to the airport, and never have again. 

I’m leaving out A LOT of other details, this is only a very small fragment of the entire picture. Some things I don’t want to talk about, but you get the picture right?

Is thinking of changing the name she gave me, and the face she gave me, too much?

I’m just worried that future friends or partner would judge me with these choices and assume I carry a whole lot of baggage. Personally, I think I turned out okay considering my upbringing. 
I’m also worried about how the rest of the family will judge me for it, since they don’t know the full story and thinks my mother is just a “lazy but VERY kind person :)”
I also think people might see someone who goes as far to change their name and kind of change their face as someone who is “self obsessed and narcissistic”, the exact opposite of what I try to be, unlike my mother. 

I KNOW eventually as my siblings get older and finance becomes easier to handle, I can go back to school and have my own life. I just hate how much older and behind I’ll be from everyone. On paper and socially. 

I’m not sure I even want to live past 35, to be extremely honest. I don’t have any serious dreams or ambitions. I don’t really have a WANT for anything. 
I just want things straightened out for my siblings, that’s it. 

But once I’m finally starting to carve out any semblance of a personal life and be able to think of myself selfishly, I don’t want to go around with the same name that reminds me of this time, and a face that only slowly becomes more and more like the person who held me back.

Is this too extreme? What can I even do in the meantime... 

I’ll probably delete this later since it’s too detailed and personal for me to be comfortable with it sitting in the internet. But if you’re somehow in a similar boat, I might prefer private messages a bit more.

Thank you

398,"I met this girl on tinder, we talked for about week and things were okay, there was sparks but we got along okay. So I ask her on a date and it's nice we go into the city and have a good date. At the end of which I ask her to be my gf. 

I should say that during that week we were talking she was say how she didn't think she was good enough for her and had some depressed episodes I guess. I kept telling her how she was good enough for me and that I like her and was just saying things she wanted to hear. She was saying I should find someone else, but I didn't want her to be right, cos I didn't think she should think of herself that way, I told her I could handle her.  I know this is a horrible thing to do, it was cruel and unfair. 

Now we've been dating for a little over a month and I don't know why but I thought things would change, they haven't. She still doesn't think shes good enough for me and over this month we've never really connected over anything. She keeps saying she loves me though and is putting pressure on me to say it back. 

She isn't controlling but she keeps saying stuff like she wouldn't know what she would do without me. And whenever she feels like something is wrong she suggests sex or other similar things and i know she's doing to make me stay but all I want to do is leave. 

I don't know how to do it though, like I've met heaps of people on her life and they've all congratulated her on finding a bf. She even told me early on that her mum said she didn't think we'd last. I don't want to put her through all that but I know I need to think of myself first. 

Man this is alot, I appreciate it if anyone takes the time to read this and offer any support. ",26Feb2019,4
400,"So basically a year ago my ex paid for our holiday trip and back then I was okay with repaying her by paying for the next trip that was supposed to happen this year. Unfortunately we broke up shortly after coming back from the holiday (She cheated and lied to me for full 3 months so I could say the breakup was really really bad and it left me emotionally crippled).

Now, the thing is... She is in a bad financial situation and thus she asked me if I could give her the money (or part of it) she spent on our trip.

(Im doing more than okay myself. I have a good full time and around 13k saved up.)

401,"So I have this friend - who is now my roommate. She’s lived with me for about a month and let’s just say we are on different ends of our spectrum in life.

I am married, I have 4 rescue animals, a house and a business I run full time with my husband- I also do a blog on the side and social media for some of our business accounts.

I’m very busy- I’ve also made a commitment to myself to not drink soda for the first 60 days of 2019 -and I started with 90 days no alcohol but i have decided to continue the year with NO alcohol.

I made this decision because up until recently I’ve been overweight, overwhelmed and depressed. 

I also make it a point to be healthier in all aspects because I want to live a long healthy life.

My friend - the Bee is kind of selfish(from what I’ve observed and what she has said). She constantly just talks about herself which consists of mostly in order from the most talked about to the least : 
-Alcohol/ or past events she has partaken in including alcohol and a surely messy ending
- Bumble (dating app) she sits on this app and is constantly showing me or talking to me about her conversations with guys who she’s trying to qualify? I guess 

There’s only 2 things she really mainly talks about and it’s really mentally exhausting experience. She is constantly talking to herself negatively, eating junk food, going out and spending money she doesn’t have and then talks about wanting to buy a house or move away. 

She also started a 30 day alcohol detox after having a heart to heart with her and she went out 2 days ago and drank a beer and was like oh it doesn’t count lol. She’s also told me on multiple occasions that she believes she is an alcoholic and she doesn’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol. 

I am an extremely positive person and I work hard every day to maintain that but I honestly feel drained every time I try to have a conversation with Bee. I understand she likes alcohol and living her life the way she wants this is America after all, but how do I tell her I don’t wanna hear this shit all the time without being rude? 

I’ve told her that I don’t enjoy talking to her about these things and it’s still the first thing she talks about in the morning and the last thing before she retreats to her room at night. 
 PLEASE HELP ME I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT IM CONSIDERING KICKING THIS GIRL OUT. 

But I’m hella tired of hearing about bumble and drinking and partying 🙄

402,"For context, I’m a 18 y/o girl. Not overweight but neither underweight.
So I just started in this new gym right next to my house, same fitness chain as before but one closer to where I live, (it’s about 1 min away). 
Anyways, it opened yesterday and I enter it today wanting to start my weight loss on the right path, so I step on the treadmill when this man jumps out of the blue and tells me that he is going to train me for free (he works there) and to get off that machine to go to the stair machine for 15 minutes. 
Then he tells me to start to a whole combo of squats with weights, using a machine I never used before, leg pushing until I start to tremble and can’t use my legs anymore. 
I told him that I don’t really what to put on that much muscle, because I actually just want to lose some weight for summer and I don’t quite like women who are that muscular and he answers that he likes thick women, not that much on the top but from the waist down likes them really toned up. 
I really suffered today in the gym and I don’t think this is what I want to do. I actually just like to be on my own, run half an hour on the treadmill and do my typical squat-abs-legs light workout. I feel like if I don’t enjoy what I am doing I’m going to hate going to the gym.
I don’t want to seem rude to the man or anything but I would love to tell him that I don’t want to work out with him and to leave me alone. 
Thank you so much for your help!

405,"TLDR: I am saying goodbye to a company that screwed me over, lied to be and made me cry. Now they want me to give a speech about what I've learned from them, how I've grown as a person during my time there and what my happiest and hardest moment were while working for them. I don't want to give them any impression that I've had a good time, learned anything from thém or am thankful for anything. But I also don't want a big confrontation or make a scene. What do I do? What do I say? What would you do in my situation? If you had a silimar experiance; what did you do!?

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm 26 and had my first work experiance at a company that promised me an amazing traineeship that would turn us into projectmanagers within two years. We would have projects and various different companies and encounter different subjects (like city planning, social or security projects). Yes, the starting salary was very low, but it was the companies policy to give raise every 6 months up to a certain salary. They promised to place us at projects we wanted to explore and also that if the job/traineeship made us unhappy they would help us and in the worst case scenario, they would let us go  (I explicitely asked!).

&amp;#x200B;

The last two years I have been doing secretary and project support jobs for three different companies in city planning projects ( while I told them from day one, that I wanted to explore social projects).   
The traineeship was absolute shit too. We'd spend a whole days talking about microsoft software, sports and nutrition or how to impress with how you dress. It was an absolute disaster. 

My manager and his assistent were dicks. They made various collegues cry, they lied to us about the bonus policy, they lied to us about the raises, they pushed us to do tasks that were completely useless or impossible (like, plan a coffee date with the CEO of your company. Like the CEO of a big company has time for a project supporter/assistent who wants to chat about nothing in particular). When we started a conversation about all of this, they were dismissive and angry. We got gaslighted constantly..  


A year in one of my trainee collegues told our manager how unhappy he was at this job and asked if they could talk about solutions. After being told to suck it up, my collegues said he wanted to quit because he was so miserable. This was when we were told about the clause in our contract that prohibited us from quitting... they would be able to sue us for thousands and thousands of euro's. And yes we checked with all kinds of legal experts, they are allowed to do this.. apparently.. My collegues was told 'You were a big guy when you signed this contract, so be one now.'

&amp;#x200B;

This was when I did something really bold and scary. I send a letter to the management of our company to tell them about our treatment and how the traineeship was a complete disaster. I was super lucky we just got a new CEO, who was already questioning the quality of the traineeship. Our dickhead manager had applied to be the new CEO but got declined and left the company. His assistent was on maternity leave and we took the opportunity to try to turn this traineeship around. To keep a long story short: the traineeship was turned around for the new groups of trainee's. A lot of our suggestions have been implemented and the traineeship seems improved. But we, the first traineegroup, have been forgotten, none of the improvements applied to us and have an aweful reputation within the company. We are the complainers and the arrogant group, who every is glad is leaving soon. They act like we're assholes, while we've had sleepless nights, got close to burnouts, got lied too and got fucked over. I have cried so many tears over this stupid job and now they make us feel like we're the badguys!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So neatless to say I have had a horrible experiance at this company. I am so so so happy that this contract is coming to and end and I can't wait to be done with these snakes. 

Now we have been asked to make 15 minute speeches about what we've learned at this job, our happiest and hardest moments and how we've grown personally and professionaly. We were told during a workshop by a lady who is not a part of our company. All of us told her we feel incredibly uncomfortable doing this. The company brought most of us nothing but misery. And now they want us to tell them how we've grown? Like they were somehow responsible for that. We grew despite everything we've been through, not because of it! She told us we can talk about anything and encouraged us to talk about some of the hardship aswell.

&amp;#x200B;

People have advised me to use my 15 minutes to give them hell. Tell them how they me feel and what they have done wrong, but I really don't feel like another big confrontation. It isn't going to help and the whole gaslighting thing will probably start all over again. And the people who did this to me aren't even going to be there.. 

I also don't want to give them the impression I've had a good time or grew as a person because of them. I just want to leave and never deal with this people again. What do I do? What do I say? What would you have done? If you had a silimar experiance; what did you do!?",26Feb2019,1

409,"Hey guys. I’ve been having a lot of issues lately. I’d really like to see a therapist, but I don’t have insurance or know how to get it, and while that iron is in the fire I don’t really have anyone I can rely on to help me with it. Or to rely on for anything, really.

I’m 22, male, and work 36-44 hours a week, with an additional 6-8 hours commute time making not a lot of money. 

My job would be fantastic for my goals and aspirations were it not for my coworkers, who are frequently catty, cliquey rulebreakers who are- to my knowledge- trying to take over. I work directly with a biological mother and daughter, two romantic couples, a group of old high school friends and two sets of cousins. I don’t live in town, so naturally I don’t have this level of acquaintance with anyone there. I really feel outnumbered despite having seniority over all of these people. They never show up for work on time, and when they are working there are frequent attempts to throw myself and my shift under the bus, as well as more serious reports to certain nonspecific regulatory agencies in my field. It causes me extreme distress and my mood and temper grow worse daily. 

Because of their inability to show up for work on time, which has been “dealt with” by management staff nigh weekly for six months, I routinely miss the only time I would get to spend with my family (12+2+8 hours doesn’t leave a whole lot of time to dilly dally) and it is infuriating, but management is not capable of handling the situation and it is causing me immense depression and distress. As I mentioned, these people do not like me so they don’t care if I get to see my family or not, which is really all I have going for me.

I am saving up to move state soon, but it’s a slow process. This area has a nonexistent job market. I’m always afraid of moving and floundering from not having enough money before I find more stable footing, so I’m trying to hold out as long as I can. But lately my stress levels and anger are becoming harder to control.

I used to drink a lot, and smoke, but I have since dropped both habits. I still remain steadfast in my decision to remain unaltered in that regard. Fast food is becoming an unfortunate but sole piece relief, and ill soon need to combat that also. I don’t have much to look forward to in my life, so it’s hard to deny myself fast food. I find that my personality is very addictive, and I’d like some tips to combat that also if anyone has any.

I find that I’ve been bottling up my stress and anger until I can’t, and then having outbursts when someone tries to drop something of their own on me. This is not a healthy behavior. I avoid discussing these matters with my girlfriend, because it just stresses her out, but I find that it’s not always so easy. 

I just wish I had someone who cared to vent to, but good friends are hard to come by, especially on twelve hour night shifts, and I’m trying my hardest not to lose everyone I have because of my need to vent frustrations.

I guess I just feel really helpless and alone. I’m worried that I could get canned from my job because of lies or slander or simply getting voted off of the island. I worry I won’t save enough money to move soon enough and my girlfriend will get tired of me playing it too safe. 

I really don’t know what to do with myself. I guess I just needed to vent. If anyone reads this and has any particular insight into any of my problems, all feedback is welcome, and I appreciate it. Thanks guys.

410,"I'm a Junior in high school.  I'm currently taking 3.5 online college level classes, 1 online AP class, and 1 normal foreign language III class.  Last semester was perfectly fine, I was taking 1.5 less college classes, but still, no major problems and all As.  But this semester has been actual hell.  I've been completely unmotivated to do any work.  Most of my assignments are submitted late and the ones that aren't are poorly done.  I can't tell if the reason I hate doing school now is because of normal teenage hormones or because of something deeper.  Every time I open up an assignment, I can feel this extremely strong pull to do anything else.  It almost feels like an addict's pull to drugs, but in reverse.  I'm not normally this opposed to doing boring work, or work in general, except in these past 1.5 months.  I do want to do work and would probably be more productive if not for this strange pull I've had recently

I brought it up with my dad and he thinks I'm either crazy or clinically depressed.  My mom, on the other hand, just keeps repeating the same phrases as if they'll magically work the 57th time around.  ""Just do it,"" ""Think about the future.  If you do this work now, you won't have to in college,"" ""When I was your age I didn't do this,"" etc.  I don't exactly enjoy taking high level classes, they were mostly forced on me by my mom.  I don't specifically rebel against it or anything; I'd say I'm mostly pretty chill with it.  If it means I don't have to take boring shit in college, that's fine by me.

I'm not entirely sure if it's even related specifically to school.  The months of January and February were awful in general.  I had a lot of stress with friends, organizing an event, being in a huge concert, and a few more things.  Just this Saturday I completed the last big event that will happen for a while.  I assumed by the time I got that thing over with I would be fine but now I just feel empty.  But my homework problems weren't magically fixed (I'm currently still sitting on an assignment that was due Monday).  

One last thing, last semester, my primary pull to do school was stressing about deadlines.  It wasn't healthy, but it kept me going.  I would submit projects minutes before deadlines and be constantly panicking about getting them done.  But this semester I stopped caring about deadlines.  Minutes before an assignment is due I won't be trying to get it done, I'll be scrolling through Reddit, almost as if forgetting about the assignment will make it go away.  August-December me would never do this.  2017 me wouldn't do this.  I should be panicked about deadlines, not completely disregarding them.

418,"hey! I really hope this is the right place to post it, this is quite literally the first day on reddit with an actual account here on reddit.

and to make things clear and give no wrong impression as I go on, I am not suicidal, nor am I dealing with self harm issues. I never cut myself or did anything in that direction, nor do I ever intend to do.

DISCLAIMER

After reading what I wrote I realized that I gave way too much backstory and vented quite a bit. And since it involves sexual and emotional abuse to some degree I thought putting a trigger warning here might be the right thing.


With that beeing said:

I was raped twice in my life. Once with 12 and once with 15.
One of them was a Stalker who did stalk me for 3 years (according to him. I really can't tell if that is true, since I never saw him before) and the second time it was my uncle when I had to live with him for two weeks.
i was always a little timid and shy, but after the first incident it got a lot worse, going as far as to tear up whenever someone who wasn't my dad, brother or one of their best friends I knew all my life, even just touched my shoulder.
after the 2 weeks living with my uncle it became much worse. 

as you can guess, timid and shy already, but isolated and quite all the time after sll that, I wasn't the most popular girl. There was bullying here and there, but when the story about my rape incident came out the second time (the first time it leaked because of police investigations at school while searching for the stalker, but up to this day I really can't say you how they got the information about my uncle a year after the incident) it got much worse.
some started making fun of the fact that it hapenned to me. ""Lennister-Jokes"" became pretty common and it went on for quite a while.
Of course this doesn't mean that everybody bullied me. It was just a small minority, but the people who would be friendly to me and start talk to me either stopped doing that because they got sucked up into the bullying while doing so or simply because I have really no real social skills in person and tend to be paralized because I fear I would upset them or say something. I don't consider myself to be not attractive and think I have an appealing appearance,  but even hearing a compliment from someone just makes me think at the spot that it is just a setup for a followup and an insult or some kind of other hurtful comment. And same goes for everything else, I always feel like whenever says something nice to me, some mean follow up will show up and hurt me.

Now the problem is that somebody while I told my family about the two incidents, I never did about about the bullying and especially how it got worse (having the courage to tell my family did lead to my mom breaking down, starting crying and hugging me almost for two hours and saying again and again that she was sorry she didn't notice it, no matter how often I said to her that I did not think for a second that she had any reason to apologize and my brother and dad enraged and almost heading out to probably beat my uncle up. I had to beg them quite a while to calm them down again)

And here lies my problem, the bullying itself didn't get worse, it's not much worse than usual.
But some guys are spreading informations about me. My name, my contacts, and actively saying to people they shluld ""insult and hurt me"" and, which is the one that pains me the most and made me write this, that even my parents won't ever love me and that no matter  what they say, they think of me as a bother, as an insecure and fear crippled daughter who just drags them down. that they only endure me since they feel obligated as parents do so.

Many write really supportive messages snd most people are really supportive, some let out their frustration about the people who send them my contacts and just come by to warn me and leave a encouraging message.

but There are also those others, especially those who mention my parents.
And it is killing me inside. I don't know what do about it. I know my parents love and support me, as does my big brother.
But I also know that no matter how much they do, to some degree they are right. I am not easy to handle and a lot of work.
I literally can't sleep on my own when I hear thunder without crawling into my parents or my brothers bed. and I'm 17, I should be past that point a long time ago.


I try my best and I really do progress, step by step.
But after changing my phone number for three times, these messages keep coming... and I can't just bring it up to tell my parents. To make my mom sad again or see  how my dad and my brother want to protect me.
While my dad  would get angry at those who did it I know he would still stay calm, take me in his arms and try to comfort me while thinking of a solution for everything.

My brother on the other hand... he's got a very short temper, especially when it comes to protecting me (not as in that he ever physically abused me or is opressing me in ny freedom. Quite the opposite, he always encourages me to get out of the house, get out of my comfort zone  and to try things out and develop as an individual) and I am genuinely afraid that he and his  best friend would just run straight to my school and probably just beat up quite literally everybody they even suspect in bullying me or spreading this stuff around about me. And I don't want either people to get hurt because of me nor do I want to risk that my brother or his best friend get arrested or some other legal issues because of me.

I just don't know what to do. because telling it to the school would probably make things worse once thry find out. telling my parents or brother isn't an option either. I'm a burden and a handfull of work as I am already, I don't want to be even much of a bigger burden than I already am..
and going to the police would not change anything either.
thinking of walking into a police station and saying ""some people post informations about me on a completely anonymous site like omegle on como
pletely diffeent hours of the day without any pattern at all to backtrack them"" just feels... as if they would think that I'm just a dumb little girl...

It's probably one or a few from my school, but still, I jsve no idea who it might be.. And I may be paranoid, but I am so scared of this whole thing going viral and my name as a rapevictim gets spread. I am even really scared this post might get upvotes and might get pooular (If you still are reading this, I would be genuinely greatuful if you did NOT upvote this post... sorry for beeing so paranoid again..)

to be honest, I'm so paranoid that I am even scared to some degree about posting all this here.

I am really really sorry though.. I just wanted to make a short post and ask for advice, and most of what I did was venting in the end..

I really hope this was the right place though... if not, I am really sorry.
and... any advice would be appreciated. If someone actually did read up until this point, thank you so much! and again.

419,I’m in a relationship and my gf is pretty much adamant about having a kid. She’s dump me if I didn’t want one some day. When I was single I’d often tell myself having a kid isn’t worth it. When I speak to other parents they tell me what a fucking nightmare it is. I don’t know if I want that burden on me for the rest of my life. Financially combined we could do it. But I am not hardworking and I am lazy. I don’t like challenges and I often avoid responsibility. On the other hand with my nephew I love him and I like to play around with him and we have a good relationship. Is it really as hard as people say? And is it ever a good idea to have one if you’re unsure?,26Feb2019,1
420,"My best friend which I've met through the platform known as Discord began ghosting me and my friends.

It began in December of 2018 and he just blocked me on everything we both contact each other: Discord and Steam, at first I thought he only left because it wasnt new that he left because he wanted to get away from the internet and had trouble in real life, but this was just out of the blue, none of my friends said he told them anything bad and our last conversation was only about good things.

It isnt like hes absent from Discord or Steam because I saw him change profile pictures more than once, I've tried to send him friend requests (which he declined), send him emails to the only email I know from him and thought about going back to Snapchat.

423,"So, my brother has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for many years now. They're both 24 years old and together since highschool. They lived together for a long time but recently she isn't home with him any more, but with her parents, since she finished University and is working in the city her parents live. She goes over around two times a week to see him.

So, a couple of weeks back, my brother and I have been on a vacation to our Homeland, and I had a feeling, that he got a little too close to a friend of ours. I sometimes though I heard kissing sounds, but I don't think anything more serious than that could have happened, since I have been around the whole time. She lives there and also stayed there after we came back.

He flies back a week before I do, and I know, that his girlfriend won't be with him for around two weeks, since she has to work in a different city for a shirt time.

Since I have been using his Amazon prime account for streaming on my phone while I'm vacation, I am also automatically logged in to the Amazon shopping app, which gives notifications about recent purchased and if something is going to be delivered soon. I saw, that he ordered condoms, which I found was weird, since I know that she takes birth control pills every day.

So... I don't know, if everything is just fine and I misinterpreted the thing on vacation. And he possibly just bought the condoms for a friend or for other reasons. But I just checked his purchase history on Amazon and he deleted the listing of that purchase. 

This is all very suspicious to me, and I actually told his girlfriend when he was around, that I had a dream, that he cheated and they were separated, but they both just saw it humorously.

So, my question is. Should I not do anything, or should I take to one of them? I mean he is my brother and we are very close, but I don't know if I can talk about this with him. I am very close to his girlfriend as well, and I would feel guilty if I did not tell her what I know. So this is where you guys should help me.


tl;dr I think my brother is cheating on his girlfriend, since he ordered a pack of condoms in Amazon, although she is on birth control pills. He is alone at their home the most of the times recently.

425,"Hi reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting on behalf of my fiancé and her position in her family. I will keep it brief as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my fiancé is the middle child between an older (step-sister) and younger brother. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sister (30+)- Lion of the family, toxic, narcissist and will fight for everything to get what she wants. $50,000 loan to ""pay back"" from her parent/step-father, stole $5,000 from her dying grandmother - refused to acknowledge or pay back such amounts. Changed the subject every time. No one dares to confront her. (*is now only recently going through a divorce, before this all happened - karma?).*

&amp;#x200B;

Brother (20+) - The favorite, gets everything without asking for it. Recently bought a (2nd) new apartment and the parents  are jumping at the idea of renovating ($10,000+) on the same apartment floor as them. Praised for everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Fiancé  - The feeler, asks for help but get's shutdown on mostly anything she asks for. She got into debt once due to an abusive ex-boyfriend about 5-6 years ago ($5,000). Her parents helped her out, but had to pay everything back. Only recently managed to get a little bit of help to get a brace, which she has to pay back. Confronted her mother about the unfairness and the response was ""I understand"".  

&amp;#x200B;

It's not just about the ""help"" they get from their parents, it seem's to be the lack of equality.  I've spent many nights with her in my arms with her crying her eyes out because she always feel's left out of the family and forgotten.

429,"Sorry for the bad title and my English. 

 I’m 15 and a female. I am really insecure, I think I have social anxiety (havent been diagnosed) and I'm have no motivation to do anything. 

So 1 year ago I changed schools, I didn't lose my friends we still talked a lot and I visited my old school often. 

I did have some trouble making friends at my new school. I would often sit alone during classes and I was kinda a crybaby so whenever I got lost or we had to make groups I’d get stressed out and cry. It's not that I choose to sit alone but everyone already had groups so I didn't know who to join. 

So I didn't have any real friends till 2018 Feburary. We got really close and I was happy. 

At that time my grades were pretty low and I think that was because of me being alone all the time. I didn't want to bother my old friends with this stuff and when I talked about it to my parents they'd brush it off and say your grades are more important.

Because of all the stress I gained some weight . I used to be 52/53 kg (115 pounds) to 56/57 125 pounds kg but since I'm really short it's more noticeable. 

I didn't really care until my mom kept telling everyone stuff like ""Yeah she gained a few kg."" Or ""She got a little heavier."" That really hurt my feelings. My brother also makes jokes about me being chubby but no one here cares. My dad even laughs along sometimes. But when I why are you laughing he says it's just joke and I shouldn't get so offended.

I started taekwondo but I just keep gaining weight. I binge eat a lot and after binging I stress out and think of all the kcal I just ate (I don’t throw up but I might go jog or exercise at home) I used to be super motivated, wanted to lose weight and get my splits. 

Fast forward to now and I'm 58 kg (127 pounds), I have no motivation for school, I get stressed whenever I'm alone in public and I cry and break down about everything at least twice a week. Like yesterday I got lost at the mall, I was scared and started crying. I am 15 almost turning 16. 

My mom said if I get 1 more bad grade I have to stop with taekwondo to focus on school. I just got 2 bad grades. I won't be held back but I know she and my dad will be angry. She hasn't seen them yet and I'm scared. 

My family is pretty poor so we can't pay for a therapist and I don't even now how to tell my parents about all this. I know they just want the best for me but I am getting more social because of taekwondo.",26Feb2019,2

hey! I really hope this is the right place to post it, this is quite literally the first day on reddit with an actual account here on reddit.

and to make things clear and give no wrong impression as I go on, I am not suicidal, nor am I dealing with self harm issues. I never cut myself or did anything in that direction, nor do I ever intend to do.

DISCLAIMER

After reading what I wrote I realized that I gave way too much backstory and vented quite a bit. And since it involves sexual and emotional abuse to some degree I thought putting a trigger warning here might be the right thing.


With that beeing said:

I was raped twice in my life. Once with 12 and once with 15.
One of them was a Stalker who did stalk me for 3 years (according to him. I really can't tell if that is true, since I never saw him before) and the second time it was my uncle when I had to live with him for two weeks.
i was always a little timid and shy, but after the first incident it got a lot worse, going as far as to tear up whenever someone who wasn't my dad, brother or one of their best friends I knew all my life, even just touched my shoulder.
after the 2 weeks living with my uncle it became much worse. 

as you can guess, timid and shy already, but isolated and quite all the time after sll that, I wasn't the most popular girl. There was bullying here and there, but when the story about my rape incident came out the second time (the first time it leaked because of police investigations at school while searching for the stalker, but up to this day I really can't say you how they got the information about my uncle a year after the incident) it got much worse.
some started making fun of the fact that it hapenned to me. ""Lennister-Jokes"" became pretty common and it went on for quite a while.
Of course this doesn't mean that everybody bullied me. It was just a small minority, but the people who would be friendly to me and start talk to me either stopped doing that because they got sucked up into the bullying while doing so or simply because I have really no real social skills in person and tend to be paralized because I fear I would upset them or say something. I don't consider myself to be not attractive and think I have an appealing appearance,  but even hearing a compliment from someone just makes me think at the spot that it is just a setup for a followup and an insult or some kind of other hurtful comment. And same goes for everything else, I always feel like whenever says something nice to me, some mean follow up will show up and hurt me.

Now the problem is that somebody while I told my family about the two incidents, I never did about about the bullying and especially how it got worse (having the courage to tell my family did lead to my mom breaking down, starting crying and hugging me almost for two hours and saying again and again that she was sorry she didn't notice it, no matter how often I said to her that I did not think for a second that she had any reason to apologize and my brother and dad enraged and almost heading out to probably beat my uncle up. I had to beg them quite a while to calm them down again)

And here lies my problem, the bullying itself didn't get worse, it's not much worse than usual.
But some guys are spreading informations about me. My name, my contacts, and actively saying to people they shluld ""insult and hurt me"" and, which is the one that pains me the most and made me write this, that even my parents won't ever love me and that no matter  what they say, they think of me as a bother, as an insecure and fear crippled daughter who just drags them down. that they only endure me since they feel obligated as parents do so.

Many write really supportive messages snd most people are really supportive, some let out their frustration about the people who send them my contacts and just come by to warn me and leave a encouraging message.

but There are also those others, especially those who mention my parents.
And it is killing me inside. I don't know what do about it. I know my parents love and support me, as does my big brother.
But I also know that no matter how much they do, to some degree they are right. I am not easy to handle and a lot of work.
I literally can't sleep on my own when I hear thunder without crawling into my parents or my brothers bed. and I'm 17, I should be past that point a long time ago.


I try my best and I really do progress, step by step.
But after changing my phone number for three times, these messages keep coming... and I can't just bring it up to tell my parents. To make my mom sad again or see  how my dad and my brother want to protect me.
While my dad  would get angry at those who did it I know he would still stay calm, take me in his arms and try to comfort me while thinking of a solution for everything.

My brother on the other hand... he's got a very short temper, especially when it comes to protecting me (not as in that he ever physically abused me or is opressing me in ny freedom. Quite the opposite, he always encourages me to get out of the house, get out of my comfort zone  and to try things out and develop as an individual) and I am genuinely afraid that he and his  best friend would just run straight to my school and probably just beat up quite literally everybody they even suspect in bullying me or spreading this stuff around about me. And I don't want either people to get hurt because of me nor do I want to risk that my brother or his best friend get arrested or some other legal issues because of me.

I just don't know what to do. because telling it to the school would probably make things worse once thry find out. telling my parents or brother isn't an option either. I'm a burden and a handfull of work as I am already, I don't want to be even much of a bigger burden than I already am..
and going to the police would not change anything either.
thinking of walking into a police station and saying ""some people post informations about me on a completely anonymous site like omegle on como
pletely diffeent hours of the day without any pattern at all to backtrack them"" just feels... as if they would think that I'm just a dumb little girl...

It's probably one or a few from my school, but still, I jsve no idea who it might be.. And I may be paranoid, but I am so scared of this whole thing going viral and my name as a rapevictim gets spread. I am even really scared this post might get upvotes and might get pooular (If you still are reading this, I would be genuinely greatuful if you did NOT upvote this post... sorry for beeing so paranoid again..)

to be honest, I'm so paranoid that I am even scared to some degree about posting all this here.

I am really really sorry though.. I just wanted to make a short post and ask for advice, and most of what I did was venting in the end..

I really hope this was the right place though... if not, I am really sorry.
and... any advice would be appreciated. If someone actually did read up until this point, thank you so much! and again.

And again, just to set it straight and not concern anybody: yes, I suffer from it quite a bit.

  Hi, everyone! 

  So, I’ve been wanting to start a web comic series and have it posted online for free except I don’t know what to do about getting it supported. I’m not expecting it to make millions right off the bat but I would like some kind of profit made from it. I have considered Patreon except the idea of offering incentives and fulfilling them seems to me like it’s adding more work and the comic itself takes hours. I could open a bank account, get a PayPal, and have commissions to do on the side although that’s the same thing as the Patreon incentives: more work. I guess my problem is that I want to post the whole series for free but I don’t want to feel like I’m working “for exposure” even though I’m doing it all by myself and I want to be able to do it with as little stress as possible. 

  With that said, how should I approach this? Am I overreacting or is this a genuine issue? Any piece of advice is most appreciated!",26Feb2019,1
441,"Here's some context.

It's break time and I'm sitting in the break room eating my lunch. Multiple co worker just wants to talk about random stuff or ask random questions.

I never initiated a single conversation with co workers.

Main issue is, my Chinese is really bad, none of my co workers or boss speaks English. They're also way older than me. I'm the youngest one, being 18. Youngest is is 35, others are a multiplication of my age. It sounds extremely disrespectful to not talk with them.

Every time I speak with them, I keep making big embarrassing mistakes due to my poor Chinese skills. It leads to lots of misunderstanding, sometimes makes my reputation worse, or make them think I'm such a big naive narcissistic asshole (unintentional) from the way I sound.

Sometimes my boss talks to me and it drives me anxious if I make a bad impression.

How do I politely tell people ""I don't want to talk""? Or to ""shut up""?

I've never told them any variations of the above lines before, because I can only imagine the many negative scenario, impression and anything else missing.

1: If I say"" I don't want to talk because it's break time and I want to rest. ""

Boss/co worker will probably think I'm lazy, always tired, and secretly sleeps on the job. They may also start getting angry.

2: I thought about an alternative to trying to get more rest without mentioning rest:
 I say ""I don't want to talk. I don't hate you or anything, I don't have anything against you, I just don't want to talk right now.""

They'll probably ask endless series of ""why?"".

3: Napping on break time.

They'll probably do the same as scenario 1.

4: Leave as soon as they speak.

That's probably extremely disrespectful.

446,"I would really appreciate someone’s opinion on so things going on, if you’ll can.

I’m 16, and I play a sport. I started playing it in 9th grade and I’m in 10th currently. The only reason I play the sport is because my mom wants me to have it on my college application. Though I’m really not enjoying it. I like my teammates and coaches, which makes it harder because I feel like they deserve better. I show up to practice, but I miss some because of arrangements that I actually like: babysitting, writing, clubs, and my volunteer work. 

I’ve tried to talk to my mom about me but wanting to play but she doesn’t want to hear it. My parents are divorced and my dads thought about it is if I didn’t want to play why play. So there’s some friction there that I believe attributes to my moms reasons on my continuing to play. My mom and counselor think I should try and get a scholarship, but I’d really rather not. 

The reason I’ve started to actually think about quitting and putting it to action rather than “suck it up” is because of something my coach said to me when I told him I couldn’t go to practice. He said I’ve already missed a lot and often don’t know the new plays, and even though I knew that I still wanted to stay home and help out at my nanas daycare. 

So my question is, how do you think I should tell my mom I don’t want to play? ",26Feb2019,2
448,I want to start with saying I'm an Indian and my mom is strictly against alcohol and stuff. So on new year's night I was drinking heavily and I was talking loads of shit and one of my friend was recording and there were few of my friends and he sent the video on our WhatsApp group in which my cousin is also there and his mom saw that video. My cousin told me about this and he told that his mom will show the video of me getting wasted to my mom when my exams are done which will end on 12th March. Guys please help me what do I do should I tell my mom directly about it (as one of my friend told that if you confess her yourself then she will be less angry compared to my aunt showing it to her). ,26Feb2019,3
449,"My friend has three kids. The older two are perfectly healthy and smart kids. She took doctors advice and they are vaccinated and she really didn’t think twice about it. Right after she had her third child, a boy, she started going “all natural”. For example, she made her own soap, started eating only fresh food (no processed stuff or red meat ect), only bought organic products. It was only mildly annoying how she was constantly showing off her new lifestyle online, like Facebook. It was annoying because she portrayed this clean, vegan lifestyle but in real life she wasn’t actually like that. 

Fast forward a few months after her third is born and she takes a class at a community college, and one day they are debating vaccinations as a school assignment. She decides to take the side of the anti vaccine and does all this “research”. Don’t ask me what sites online she sourced because she couldn’t tell me. Aka they weren’t creditable. Now she is online posting constantly about how people shouldn’t have to vaccinate their children and how it’s absolutely disgusting to expect them too because there are so many risks associated with them. She has even gone as far to tell people online her third child was injured by a vaccine and now has epilepsy.  She went online and filled out a “religious exemption” so she isn’t forced to vaccinate any of her kids anymore but still wants to use public schools and daycare.

It’s really putting a wrench in our friendship. How to I tell her I think she’s nuts without saying I think you’re nuts?

I have a venerable 3 month old baby. So that’s another reason I feel the need to speak up",26Feb2019,13
450,"If I break any rules, or do something wrong, please let me know. I tried to keep it within the post criteria.

&amp;#x200B;

To start, my name is Dylan and I am 16 years old. I have spent a large portion of my life staying with other people other than my parents, due to issues with the two. Drugs, domestic violence, my father did some unspeakable things with my stepsister. I could provide more backstory, but I don't wanna write too much. But, was homeless a few times. Staying with strangers. Pretty much was in survival mode my whole life, and that has messed me up emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

I am no doctor, but I *think* I have [borderline personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder). I have ""studied"" this disorder and I have quite a lot of symptoms of having said disorder. But it is harder to pin point stuff like this, especially with my age. It could be a large selection of things, but point is, I have issues. When frustrated I tend to bite my hands, scratch myself, smack or hit my head. Those things don't happen often, but thought I'd mention it. It's really when I am sad, or the lack of feeling sad I should say. Most of the time I honestly feel nothing. Writing this now, I don't feel happy. Or sad. Just nothing. But sometimes, I get sad or upset over little things like how people respond to me, which I understand is not a strange thing I am sure A LOT of people feel this. But in the past, I feel it has seriously damaged my relationships. Or when talking about something emotional, and I have a blank face people think I don't care. I do, I just don't feel it? I dunno. But later on, I most likely will cry my eyes out. Or sometimes it's literally for 3 seconds and then it's gone. I just want to feel. There are a lot of other things, but again trying to keep this shortish.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, my friends encouraged me to talk to my family about this. I have not told them anything about how I'm feeling since I was 6, honestly. So it's hard. My thought process pretty much is I am supposed to be *funny,* not sad. In class, I texted my sister who lives with me and my mom. She is 22, so she pays her own rent and such. I texted her while I was at school that I might have bpd, and that it has been really hard to come out and talk about this stuff. It was pretty much a cry for help, and she was there. She said that she was there for me and that it was okay. She has been through her own stuff, so I think she understands the most out of everyone I have talked to. Plus, living in the same environment. Anywho, so my sister told my mom (which is okay, that was the point) and I was pulled out of school because it was hard not to cry in class. As soon as I was called out, the need to cry was gone. So I tried my hardest to vent how I am feeling, answering whatever I can. ""I did it"" I kept telling myself. My mother, however, had interesting stuff to say. ""I thought we could do, maybe, a group therapy. After hearing all the stuff you'll have to say to your therapist, I might need help. I don't think it'll be good for me."" When I write this, that might not sound as bad because it's just text. But the tone, she didn't seem like she cared about my issues. She seemed to care about herself over me. I didn't want group therapy, because I have never even had my own therapy I don't think I am ready. So time goes on a little, mom said she was working on stuff etc.

Then, I had a breakdown. I think it was about my girlfriend (we are not together anymore, due do my issues I decided to try to better myself before I continue with relationships), at the time. I had done something that I hated, and I was just hating on myself hard. I didn't want to make these mistakes because I lost the last relationships to these issues. I was texting my friend some scary stuff about ripping my throat out, BUT I said this because I had a sore throat. But I understand the concern my friend had. I said other stuff, like I was biting my hand and such. I was just having an breakdown, and the next day at school security is looking for me. My friend told her school to call my school, and make sure I was okay. I was brought to the office and my mom picked me up. She talked to me saying ""I didn't realize it was this serious,"" stuff like that. She said that she was going to put me in a hospital to get results as fast as possible, and I liked the idea. I had a friend do that. But when I went there, it was really for people who are going to hurt themselves like, suicide. I didn't feel like I was supposed to be there, and I didn't want to take up any beds for people who NEED to be there. They asked me a bunch of questions like how I am feeling but I told them I wasn't suicidal. They also had me eat a gross turkey sandwich, yuck. Anyway, they asked if I wanted to go home and I simply said yes because I don't want to take up a bed for no reason, you know? I go home, they give us numbers to call. I stayed there for like a night and was brought back home but since then, nothing has happened. It's been, maybe a month?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR (I would suggest reading)**

Pretty much what I am asking is, what do I do? How do I tell my family that I am suffering and that I need help? I am already scared to come out with my feelings as it is, and this is just hard. Any tips, ideas, anything? Thank you.",26Feb2019,2
451,"Long Story short, I didn't take school seriously when I had the chance. I am not a high school graduate, falling 50 credits short because I was too busy prioritizing a girl in my life at the time. I have never had any true ambition, anyways: not particularly having even the slightest of clues as to what I even wanted to do with my life. I never had long-term goals outside of my sometimes unrealistic dreams. 

After my ""graduation date,"" I jumped straight into the work force and had a blast earning my own money and just enjoying it as it came. I was exhilarated to be part of a team, and slowly become valuable to that team. Now, fast forward to 24, and I am Night Auditing for a hotel, looking at a promotion to Front Office Manager in late March/Early April. My life could be much worse, so I am not really complaining--it is just a matter of acknowledging the fact that this is not what I want my life to mean. I need to have purpose, and challenge in my life. That is what makes it exciting, right?

Anyhow, to proceed forth with what I was saying: I would like some advice as to what I should do/how to go about completing my high school diploma (if even possible) and putting my foot in the door to a more meaningful life. I work full-time with full-time bills, living on my own. It almost feels like this is just it. This is all I can do, and will do for the rest of my life. I don't particularly have anyone that I can legitimately speak to about these things. No one in my family went to college, and I want to be the one that breaks that. I want to support my grandparents financially, and just be a dependable role model for my younger siblings. 

I love learning, but I am just a very particular learner. With that being said, I am also regrettably disturbed by the thought of failure. I have held myself down over this high school regret since 2013. I know that a GED is an option, but I really, really just want to get an actual diploma as a GED STILL has so much stigma around it... Plus I am sometimes so short-sighted when it comes to book work.  I am very hands on and visual. I really do need the interaction for knowledge retention. 

Perhaps it is a hopeless situation where my dreams are getting far ahead of my reality, but I just figured I'd put this out there. A conversation with a close friend of mine stimulated this thought I have been hung up on. There is so much that fascinates me, and that is where I have had the hardest time making life goals. She said to me, ""You love learning... And all of those things work really, really well together... Why don't you just go for it?"" I feel so fucking stupid, honestly. It feels like there is this weighted label weighing at my cloths like rain water as every opportunity closes its doors in my face. I don't know.

455,"I know you've heard this a million times, but even I'm as gullible as the multitude of humans before me to fall for the fabrications of our minds, or our times, or our very own innate humanly nature. I've always been so closeted about what's going on in my mind, and all the things i wish i had said and i wish i had done.


Not that i regret the things that happened because of my shortcomings, because i believe to be held responsible for whatever my life is. But I'm so sick and tired of being defensive, of lying to hide my feelings due to the dread of judgement. Of being cynical when I want nothing more than to just be the opposite. It's stale, and it's unlike me. 


But my past experiences and the thoughts that come with it refrain me from acting upon my better judgement. I'm no longer in touch with anyone I've ever exposed my feelings to, as they tend to desert me the more I tend to rely on them and talk to them about it. All my ex girlfriends, or friends i had in the past, seem to hit a ceiling level when they can't tolerate me anymore.


Except one girl, who has known me the longest and have stood by my side for the past 7 years. And now I'm so afraid of losing her, due to shitty decisions, experiences and people of days gone by. If reality could dictate my actions than my past or my fears, I feel my life could've been better. I've always loved this one girl since the day i saw her, and for the past 7 years I haven't told her. I've been in different relationships during those and I've tried to love others, but in the end came to realize that I love her. She loves me too, I suppose, but the way i act towards her, I believe she can never believe that i like her romantically.


Just to downplay how I've consistently loved her for the past 7 years, i tend to abstain from expressing myself fully with her, although it's safe to say that she knows me the best and I'm the closest with her than I've been with anyone else in my life. Even right now, I'm not able to say everything that's there on my mind. It's like, suppose I'm going out somewhere and i want her to come with me, I'll not ask her because I've such an immense fear of rejection, just for her to tell me why didn't you take me with you. Every stupid thing I do to not let her know i love her, are the things she calls out and tells me to not do. I don't know why, but my mind is holding me back from being myself, and it sucks.


Everytime someone praises me, I've stopped believing it even though it might be true. Every step someone takes in my direction, i take 20 steps back, although i want to run towards them. And I don't have a lot of time before I move out of my city, and I really wanna tell this girl everything that ever came across my mind about her. The truth, none of the friendly sarcasm, but the truth about how beautiful she is in all sense, and how she really has transformed my life in the past 7 years.

But my negative thoughts tell me something else, and he saw through that. Should I listen to the negative thoughts of insecurity, or should I disregard them? The guy I'm with really wants to know where I stand on the monogamy topic, and I find myself wanting one thing but feeling a completely different thing. I didn't mean for him to notice, but I told him that him seeing others would make me jealous. I tried to explain that that wasn't a problem, because jealousy can be healthy. He said I'm being self depreciating and he now cancelled a sex session with a girl he's been talking to just because of me giving several messages.

I recently said yes to going for drinks with a guy and he very seriously asked me to decline it, so I did. He says it's because drink means sex and I'm too unstable to have sex. 

I want him to be happy and if seeing other women would make him happy, them I can overlook my jealous feelings. But maybe I only think this way because I don't think I'm good enough for him, and I absolutely love torturing myself emotionally.

470,"I apologize for the wall of text but I'll try to give you the backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

About 5 years ago I was charged with a DWI and was required to install an ignition Interlock Device (breathalyzer) in my car for 12 months.  3 months in to me having it installed, I was instructed by the DMV to come in and get a limited drivers license.  I went in and was given the temporary certificate while I waited for the actual license to arrive via mail.  Unbeknownst to me, that license was deemed null and void due to the date on the back of the license indicating when I can remove the Ignition Interlock Device being issued incorrectly... by 1 day.  (I was moving around a lot at this point so if they sent me a notice letting me know in the mail, I never received it). Fast forward about a year (I'm getting my ignition interlock removed, I even had it installed an additional 3 months to be safe) I'm about to start a new job and don't have any sort of identification so I go to the DMV to get my license reinstated.  Person at the DMV tells me the other license was issued in error and there is a suspension hold on my account for some reason or another and she's not sure why.  Since I need an some sort of identification,  I ask to get just a normal State ID card.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward again like a year or two to yesterday.  I bought a new car and was looking to get all that figured out and I know I need an actual license.  I go into the DMV and wait a couple hours and it turns out there's a glitch in their system and they can't get it figured out in the office so he directs me to a phone number to find out the situation. After an hour or two on hold I find out the issue:

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out, when they issued the incorrect ID, the timer I had on the ignition interlock PAUSED at 3 months.  So the additional 9 months (I completed 12months to be safe) counts for NOTHING.  They're claiming I needed to pick up a Limited Driver's License instead of an Identification Card (even though DMV wouldn't issue me my limited license on that visit do to an unknown account suspension.  

I'm really worried that they're gonna make me reinstall the ignition interlock again.  They are RIDICULOUSLY annoying, and not to mention the monthly fee.  I calculated that I spent over $1,500 on this thing for my previous time.  I have proof of installation, removal, and EVERY monthly appointment that I had with the ignition interlock company.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently awaiting a call from the DMV that will explain how things will proceed from here.  I'm just curious if I have any hope of using the proof I have or if I'm going to have to redo 9 months with a breathalyzer.  I acknowledge that I am at fault in this as well. I spent WAY too much time between receiving the incorrectly issued license and my Identification Card.  Additionally, I had not contacted the DMV prior to removal to insure I was in the clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience or any idea about this situation? Would a lawyer help this situation? Thank you so much,  any advice would be greatly appreciated.

This has caused me to feel isolated and quite lonely but I am gradually building myself back up again. The process is just slow.

I totally get that but I had told his mum once before that I really can’t stand to be around her, I know she isn’t doing this to hurt me and it is purely because she needs to run her business. 

The advice I need is : what do I do? The thought of having to spend up to 8 hours in her presence, to have to hear her voice. See her interact with my bfs mum and my boyfriend (I get triggered by this as the ex best friend had tried to go for an ex of mine before) really makes me anxious. I feel down and upset already just thinking about it. 

I want to tell his mum I can’t work but as it is my boyfriends mum I don’t know if it will disappoint him. Should I just suck it up? Part of me feels like I am being immature but the other part feels like I have every right to refuse to see this person.

Any thoughts are appreciated, thank you!",26Feb2019,1

480,"I’m completely torn between two choices and I think I need a third party’s input. I currently live in an apartment with a girl I met through craigslist and her two dogs and I’ve been there for about 9 months. This place is in a good location, a 30 minute drive from my parents’ house and my office and a ~20 minute walk + 20 minute train ride into the nearby major city. One of my best friends is currently on an apartment hunt in a smaller city an hour away, and I really want to live with her. However, I have to give my current landlord notice of renewal or non-renewal 90 days in advance, which is the end of February. She is still looking for places, which means that if I decide to live with her and we don’t find anywhere she’ll stay at her current place (a 1 bedroom) and I’ll be up a creek or living with my parents, neither of which are ideal. My job allows me to work remotely, so the distance to work would be manageable because if for whatever reason I didn’t feel like driving I could work from home no questions asked. Also, this is a bit of a weird/shallow caveat but she is more than twice my age and I know multigenerational friendships are common but I worry it will be weird explaining to people that I moved from a prime location in a great neighborhood to a small city with significantly less going on so I could move in with my older divorced friend. She also has lived on her own for the past few years and part of me is worried that she will move in with me and realize that she preferred living alone, and that will hurt our friendship. My heart is screaming at me to do it but my brain knows it’s not smart - has anyone else been in a situation like this? I feel like I’m watching all my friends take risks and huge leaps of faith that will make them happy but I am just stuck and unhappy in my current situation. I don’t have a lot of friends, I really just go to work, go to the gym and go home. I wish I could be in two places at once so I didn’t have to choose!",26Feb2019,1
481,"Hey so this is a bit of a long story so ill just right in. Friday night me and my sister, her best friend and few others went to the bar. By the end of the night me and her best friend were dancing and kissing a bit. I went over to my sister at the bar and asked “do you care about this, do you want me to stop?” She smiled and said “no, it was going to happen eventually”. She was definitely a bit drunk but we all were and I think she knows what she was saying. Anyway, the night progresses me and her friend take an uber and my sister and her boyfriend take an uber. Unbeknownst to me her friend texted my sister and said something to the vibe of “oh we’re just going to smoke and talk, then I’m going to go home”. She spends the night and then we get my car at my sisters house the next morning and I take her home. We all chat a bit things seemed fine. Then a few days go by. I saw her friend sunday again and she slept over again. Then yesterday my sister txts me in the morning along the lines of “me and (best friends name) are cool but were not really best friends anymore, I can be best friends with her while shes dating my brother and this changes this, I dont think we’ll ever have the same friendship again.” The only thing about this is that it was coming from a place of anger and her feeling her friend was inconsiderate of their friendship and now she basically doesn’t wanna be friends with her anymore. She also said “she didn’t talk to me about it or anything” but me and her friend assumed based on her saying at the bar, “ I dont care it would have happened eventually” that she didn’t care and that it wasn’t bothering her but it was and she didn’t say anything and now shes saying her friend was incosiderate of her feelings. 

TL:DR - me and my sisters best friend hooked up and now my sister wants to cut off the friendship because she feels her friend wasn’t considerate of their friendship despite the fact my sister said “I dont care, it was going to happen eventually”. 

What do I do? Her friend is super upset (not at my sister) because of the fact that my sister said it was cool and now shes losing her best friend, and my sister just is stuck in only seeing her perspective. ",26Feb2019,2
482,"I met this girl that at first I had no interest in. But a few months after hanging out, I starting having a crush on her. It was pretty obvious that she knew about the crush but she didn’t seemed bothered by it. This went on for about a year. Then a little over a month ago I decided to actually talk to her about it and ask her if she liked me back. 

She said no but still wanted to be friends. I agreed since I thought she was a pretty cool person and that we get along so well that I’d have no problems just being friends. But then I made the dumb mistake of asking why I wasn’t her type and she ended up getting insanely pissed and wanted to cut ties with me. Have no idea why that offended her so much but I definitely didn’t deserve that just for asking a question.

Probably good to mention that she had a boyfriend at the time that literally EVERYONE in her life was against. And during the texts I said that this guy is trash and that she can do so much better than that. P.S. they broke up a week ago and only lasted a month. In other words, I was right.

But either way, knowing she always makes treats like that when she’s mad and usually gets over it within a few days, I didn’t think much of it. I didn’t text her for a month to give her some space and decided to text her yesterday. Just to see how she’s doing and remind her that I’m cool with just being friends and that I still care about her as a friend. She read the text and never replied to me. Obviously either still mad over I said or upset that I was right about the shit boyfriend.

Just a timeline of the events if anyone’s confused:
-She gets trash boyfriend
-Few days later, I tell her how I feel and she gets mad
-don’t text her for a month
-a week ago, she breaks up with boyfriend
-yesterday, I text her and ask how she’s doing
(Also she doesn’t know that I know about the breakup. Her brother told me)

490,"Hi I’m a high schooler still living at home with my parents and my fathers depression is really taking a toll on me. From as long as I can remember, my father always woke up later than everyone else in my family and has shown many other symptoms of depression so I think he’s been like this for most of his life.  At the moments he is very bad ever since both his parents died. All he does is wake up, sit and do nothing, maybe put the TV on but he barely pays attention to it, barely speaks to me. Another annoying but understandable thing he does is he never knows where I’m going, what’s going on in my life because he barely talks to me! Sometimes it feels like it’s just my mum and brother in the house. I don’t want to feel this way but I can’t help it.

I do try to help my dad by speaking to him but he just doesn’t want to talk. He takes antidepressants but is constantly having them switched around by the doctors because they aren’t working or giving him really bad side effects. He gets counselling but comes back into the house the same as he usually is. It is absolutely fucking tearing me apart and it’s making me want to leave the house because of the emotional toll it’s having on me. I care about him a lot but thats the problem, it’s distracting me from work which I need to do to get to university. If it wasn’t for my mum I don’t know where the hell I’d be.

A selfish thought I do have constantly that bothers me is what if I become like this? I personal deal with anxiety and so does my dad so obviously I am worrying about me becoming like my dad. I can see that everyday is like hell to him so obviously I am quite worried about this happening to me because I’m like my father in some ways. On the bright side, it encourages me to work real hard so I can become successful and not fall down or whatever. It just just looks like my dad has almost given up on life and waiting for death. That’s what it feels like. I really really need some support from someone because I don’t know anymore who has this issue.

I/me: me (16-18) W: bf (16-18)  K: my friend (16-18)  (Junior-senior) V: W's ex (16-17) (freshmen-sophomore)  

Basically, I recently I got back with my ex (w) after two months of breaking up (we dated for 2 years). We broke up because W vaped and smoked weed behind my back knowing I don't like it or want him to hurt himself. W dated another girl (I'll call her V) during the break, but it didn't work out it. I started to get a small crush on a good friend (K), but I just wanted to become closer friends. 
Sometime later, W confessed to me that he missed me and realized he needs me. I missed him too. A lot. But if we were gonna be back together. We made a promise. W will stop talking to V and stop vaping and drugs for me and his health, if I stopped talking to K. I felt horrible because I felt like W's health was in my hands and I had to drop a friendship that grew closer. W said he didn't want K and I close/ talking because he is scared that K will take me away. (W knew I had a small crush on K and W and I had this convo when we were fighting:
W: who do you prefer: me and K?
Me: K because at least he doesn't vape or smoke
I was mad but I know I shouldn't have made that comment)

I decided to drop K for the sake of W's health. I hated it because K didn't do anything wrong.  K now doesn't like me and lost trust/respect for me. But now I feel W isn't keeping his side of the promise. W did sell most of his stuff, seeing him do it himself (vape pens and mods), but keeps on saying if he and I break up, he will go back to doing it. W still has a vape pen but told me its empty (washed it out too). However few days ago he pulled it out, gave it to our friend and it still worked. W says he has it on him to sale it. But no one really wants it. Just give it away at this point I think. Also, W said he blocked V (also she is kinda toxic), but I saw she messaged him. You can't message a person if the person blocks them. I asked him about it, he said she texted him saying why aren't they talking. Idk if he reply to her or not. I still love W but I feel like a shitty person for dropping a friend who didn't do anything wrong. I feel a lot of pressure because W's health is my hands. I know W loves me, it's weird to explain how do I know, I just do.

Overall, was it the right choice to ruin a good friendship because my partner's health is in my hands? Should I confront W of me thinking he broke his promise? Am I just being paranoid?

TLDR: ex and I got back together. We made a promise with his health in my hands. I dropped a good friend for ex's health. I think ex broke his side of the promise. I don't know if I did the right thing or what to do.

He also has a very bad porn addiction and I think that porn is also a part of this problem. Last week I saw his history tab and it was filled with porn but right after the porn he started searching stuff like ""Why I masturbate so much?"". Personally, I have watched porn and masturbate and sometimes still have the urge to watch it but I can control it (sometimes) but he legit feels sad about watching porn.

498,"I'll begin with a short preface that leads into the current state of things...

&amp;#x200B;

Preface: A few months ago I was on a walk and I was stopped by two girls in a car, the girl driving (who I now have a crush on) gave me a piece of paper and asked me to ""text her sometime"". I texted her later that night and she apologized for being so forward, and claimed that her ""wild"" friend drove her to do something as extreme as she did - if you could call that ""extreme"". We texted for the night and eventually I never got a text back. Over the months I eventually got her snapchat and regarded her as ""some girl that I kinda know"".

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago I sent her a snapchat of my blunt and she said ""we should smoke sometime! the question is when?"" so I invited her over that night. If I'm being honest, I was expecting a hook-up and that was it... she came over and I quickly realized how cool she was. We are similar in many regards and we had a great time. We hung out for a few hours and talked about everything from music, hobbies, etc. She even cried talking about some of her personal dilemmas. I also played her some guitar - she seemed to enjoy the night overall. 

&amp;#x200B;

She talked about her ex, who she's been broken up with for over a year now, and how he never wanted to let her ""live"", make friends, and have experiences. I broke-up with my ex of 4 years for the same reasons. I can see this being a reason as to why she wouldn't want to get involved again, but what she doesn't know is that I am not trying to hold anyone back, and I don't want to be held back, either.

&amp;#x200B;

It's safe to say that I have a strong crush on her now, that night showed me that she is someone I wouldn't mind getting to know a lot more. For whatever it's worth, I've never had a bunch of trouble with women.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her to hang out a few nights later and she was busy, and then I invited her to a show my friend was throwing and she also said she would be busy (this past weekend) so now I'm hesitant to contact her again at the risk if appearing to be desperate or annoying but I do want to see if she could possibly like me as well... how should I go about breaking that barrier again and seeing what's possible with the situation?

501,"At the end of my Masters degree 7 months ago, my supervisor was impressed with my thesis. He said there was a chance I could get it published and so I agreed to keep working on it (for free) back in my home country.


After about 2 months however, I stopped working on it and sending any updates. This was due to a few reasons:

1. As I worked on it more, the less novel I found my work to have been and results got less conclusive.

2. I had some mental health and family issues.

3. Financial pressures made me have to get a job quicker (I had initially budgeted some time to work on this)


I am not proud of how I dealt with this however. I just ghosted an email from him asking about my progress. Then, I got locked out of my university account (expired) which can only be unlocked by going to tech support in person (I am no longer in the country).


Now, I would like to get in touch with him. I am embarrassed by my conduct despite the reasons for it. My reasons for wanting to get in touch with him are not entirely selfish:

1. I would like to have the chance to thank him for the fantastic experience I had working under him

2. I would like to apologize for my conduct

3. I would like to give him an update regarding my career (which is in the field of his &amp; my research!)

4. I would like to rebuild the relationship and have him as a referee/reference for the future. (I am NOT seeking a reference in the immediate future)

502,"My boyfriends sister ‘lauren’ is married with two children. Recently she has confessed to me about her husbands ‘aaron’ infidelities. It has led her into quite an anxious and depressive state but she has chosen to forgive him and move on and work on her marriage. Aaron has had multiple affairs and repeatedly Lauren has forgiven him, finding it easier to blame the other women than Aaron himself. 
Usually I stay way out of other relationships and rarely get involved. However recently Aaron has been sending me Snapchat’s which are highly inappropriate with regards to how I look and even asking me ‘how big are your boobs they look amazing’. He then goes on to mention how good I look in my Instagram photos etc. I have stated that this is highly inappropriate and the comments need to stop. However, he keeps trying to message me, admittedly they are fairly innocent messages ‘how was your holiday’ or ‘how was work’. But again he asks me directly over snapchat rather than in the group chat we all have together which involves my boyfriend and Lauren. 
I am now in a difficult position because I can either tell laura and potentially break up a marriage, alternatively she may blame me for his wrong doings which would make it difficult for my boyfriend to have a relationship with his sister. Or I don’t say anything and feel guilty for what he has been saying. 
I have communicated this with my boyfriend and initially he thought the best thing to do was to tell Lauren. But now he thinks keeping quiet is the best option as Lauren tends to blame others and forgive aaron anyway.

506,"TL;DR: I’ve accepted a job teaching students math and science and I really don’t want to do it but, I don’t know how to get out of it. 

Background: I’m an engineering student and I have been working with a tutor in calculus for a bit over a year now, a few weeks ago she asked if I was interested in working with her and another instructor to assist kids with math and science at a local education centre. I said yes. 

Conflict: I was under the presumption that I would simply be helping younger students with their homework questions, similar to how I worked with my tutor. However, this is not the case. After meeting the other instructor, who runs the education centre, she explained to me that I’d be expected to prepare lesson plans and give lectures to students.

529,"So I'll try and make this short and sweet. 

I work for a non-profit animal shelter, which is technically ran by a board of directors, however our board is VERY hands off. They hired our current Executive Director about 3 years ago and since then things have gone south. 

She is a horrible boss, and I've had my fair share. When she is having issues at home she will take her anger out on staff, volunteers, and even visitors sometimes. I've literally seen her call our telephone company and scream at them because she dropped a call and was already in a bad mood. She snaps at employees for no reason, to the point all of my long term staff are afraid of her, and we all physically stress out about having to go into work. She has also chased aaay numerous Volunteers with her attitude and inability to get even the minor projects done.

There are also a TON of other issues, she hasn't written any grants or done fundraising efforts in months, and her entire three years here has maybe written for 6 grant's total? She hates our annual fundraiser and is trying to hard to get it squashed. We're a non-profit, this is what her job is!! Now that we're running out of money frequently and having to pull from our endowment fund frequently, she snaps at everyone about it, like it's our fault we're out of funds. 

There are other issues, she's on salary and honestly I can't even count how many times she's taken off 2+ days and not taken any vacation time, however I am also on salary and if I take even a half day I have to use vaca time. Not to mention she's taken this time to go make money from one of the shelters big donors. That feels so off to me. 

When we run special needs fundraisers, online crowdfunding basically, she always asks us to fundraise for more than what is needed for the surgery or procedure(which includes medications follow-up, etc), and instead of any overages going into our special needs program funding, like we tell people it does, it just gets used for operating expenses. 

Lastly, because I really am trying not to be too long winded, she hardly ever works on shelter related projects while she is here. We share an office and I would venture to guess she spends 60% of her time working on things for her daughters private school, as she also took a temporary position as their development director. 

Our resale shop manager went to the board and our director twisted everything around and has convinced everyone she is nuts and not doing her job, which might have a tiny sliver of truth, but not near as much as she's made it out to be. 

I'm stuck in the impossible situation of trying to figure out how to convince them this woman is ruining our organization, without it being spun around on me.

Two.  The guy isn’t in a good financial statement and never competed college, that’s all okay but I feel talked they’re moving fast. I wouldn’t He engaged to someone at least until I’m good in finances..

When we talked again we talked and I told her she was moving fast lol. Didn’t mean to be serious but was slowly bringing it up but she all acted defensive and a tad rude. Since many people have told them they’re moving too fast which I wouldn’t find offensive if was marrying someone. 

She’s a good friend and all but I don’t think she should rush things. It can be ruined. And the boyfriend almost was threatened to be kicked out of the army and if he was, they’d be in a bad financial situation. 

What should I do? I want to support my friend but there being defensive. Or should I just let them be and if all goes to ruin it’s fine. I often heard Mormons marry fast and they’ve been okay.

I have a friend who we met up with at a party, and since then has been messaging me non-stop planning things to do. Most of his suggestions are things he's doing anyways, or that are convenient to him, and that we don't want to do like:
 - 3 hour roadtrip to go skiing, when we don't ski
 - Playing hockey goal for his team because it's his turn to play goalie and he doesn't want to
 - Looking for jobs together (wants me to build his linkedin and resume)
 - Hanging out with his work acquaintances
 - Trying to organize lunch dates between my wife and his gf
 - Getting a gym membership literally 1 minute from his house, and 25 minutes from mine

I've said no to everything, and he either ignores it and asks again the next day or says ""I'll take that no as a yes, you'll come around, be a yes man"". I invited him out for a beer, and he tried to turn it into a big potluck / games night / casino night with people I don't know.

539,"One of my[35F] good friends[37F] of ~20 years has had a rough time with life over the last 7 or so.  She has a debilitating autoimmune disease that puts her in perpetual pain and is destroying her joints.  She lost her job after the birth of her youngest child, and she and her boyfriend decided she should be a stay at home mom.  Her child ended up having a lot of developmental issues, so she never returned to work. 
 As such, she could not afford insurance or the pain meds / pain management appointments and so she turned to drugs.  I've done everything I could to help her, but her life has spiraled out of control and she's landed herself in prison for the next 3 years over drug abuse and burglary to obtain said drugs.  

She has lost custody of her two children, and is not allowed to have contact with them for the next 7 years.  Her oldest will be 20 and her youngest will be 12 by the time she is allowed to speak to them again.  Despite her personal issues, she loves her children and I know this is devastating to her.

I'd like to send her a couple of things to get her started while she's in there.  Her family is understandably upset with her and have kind of left her to rot.  She has stolen from them and abused their love/trust in order to obtain her stupid drugs so she's got nothing and has no support group to help her work through this.

I don't think I can abandon her too.  Maybe it's naive of me to think so, but perhaps I can help her keep a shred of sanity in a small way by sending her some things to occupy her mind.

With that said, I'm completely ignorant about prison life.  I have no idea what kind of things prisoners have access to or what daily prison life is like.  I've looked up the website for the prison she was in, and it looks like they have anger management programs, drug/alcohol addition recovery programs, and inmates are allowed to complete courses with a nearby technical college.

It seems like she will have things to keep her busy, but for her downtime I was thinking of sending her a couple of adult coloring books/markers, some stationery and prepaid envelopes, some snacks, and maybe a radio/headphones through a pre-approved prison property catalog.  

However, I worry if I send her anything useful that it could just be pawned for more drugs.  I realize I could just call her and ask her if she wants or needs anything, but if she's still coming down off the drugs she may lie to get valuable things to sell/trade.

What do you think?  What would you do?  Should I bother sending her anything, or just write some letters?  She's truly not a bad person, she's just made some awful decisions.  I really just want to do a kind thing for a friend in a terrible situation.",26Feb2019,1
540,"Hello! So I came into college as a Freshman this year intending on majoring in Music Education, but now I'm switching to psychology after thinking about it since December. My main reason to why I switched is because I genuinely enjoy depth psychology; learning about different theories and perspectives of the human conciousness. This was not a sudden decision I made, I really did think deeply about if I wanted to go through with this. Anyways, after this semester I will already have a year worth of credits in music so I intend on minoring in it still. I'll only need to take  3 more classes for it next semester and 1 more in Spring of 2020 to get it. However, I was also considering minoring in political science since I figure it would be a great qualification along with a psychology BS. I also intend on continuing onto grad school to further my psychology education. I'm not necessarily interested in doing something along the lines of therapy or anything, but conducting research and further expanding the understanding of the human psyche. Regardless of what direction I intend on taking my psychology degree, I'll still need to continue on to grad school to really do anything in the psychology field.

543,"Let me start of by providing some background information: I am 21 years old and from the Netherlands, I've had a terrible upbringing and was abandoned at 16 to fend for myself. I've mostly lived my teenage years in organizations that provide living space and adult supervision for troubled and abandoned children. 

Been to jail, had a pretty violent and criminal youth, so I'm no stranger to the likes of extortion and black mail. I don't mean to imply I'm a ""succesfull criminal"". I stopped doing that stuff years ago and alienated all my former acquaintances. Just saying I have a history with it. 

I've moved into my first appartment 2 months ago and I'm hoping to go to the rock academy someday soon, instead of doing stupid criminal stuff in my free time, I've picked up an electric guitar starter kit and started playing. (generic backstory blah blah) 

Anyway let's get to the point. Before I moved to my own appartment I lived at another one of those organizations for troubled people. They under fed us, made a whole bunch of bullshit rules to keep us from socializing and were all in all a terrible influence. 

Later on I learned that while all people who lived in one of the organizations houses had terrible living conditions but some higher ranked employees and the CEO had a ludicrous salary. Like much more then they should have. But nobody could change anything about it so nobody cared. 

When I started living there I payed an x amount of money up front next to my monthly rent with the promise of getting the money back when I leave and my room was in the same condition as I got it. 9 months later I left. I painted the walls, repaired any damages, and generally left the room in a better condition then when I received it.

I really needed the x amount of money to kickstart my venture of living on my own. And since I painted the room and repaired all damages I thought to myself the money was a basically given at this point. When I finally moved out I bought some cooking appliances 'n stuff to get myself started and waited for the x amount of money to be deposited because I was going to buy an oven and FOOD with it. I didn't get the money. 

They told me I didn't pay rent for the second month of my stay there but I was sure I actual payed it. This was really really bad news because I couldn't afford food anymore and since I don't have any family who could help I was left on my own. I had basically nothing, no food, no money. I got low and wanted to take my own life. 

To my surprise some of my close friends reached out and helped me, loaned me amounts of money I would never dare ask for and buying me food and weed (I am dutch after all) allowing me to survive the month after starving myself for 3 weeks.

545,"Hello r/advice, long time reader first time poster.
Im ngl this is a bit of a long one.

     Last year around the end of April my best friend and I had a falling out. I think it was my fault, before she stopped talking to me for two months I was invited over and in a super depressed/ dissociative state and I must have acted like an ass. It was a couple days before my birthday, unfortunately thats when my depression is at its worst so I dont doubt I was saying or acting dumb. I honestly dont remember much of that time period... 
      She would snap me sporadically  and vague posting on social media a bit so I knew she was mad. I felt terrible that I didnt know what I did specifically to hurt her, just because i was in a bad head space doesn't excuse my actions. This went on for about 2 months, she replied once directly to tell my she needed space so I left her alone all of may and june. 
       It made me really sad. I missed my friend but she clearly didnt want anything to do with me so i just had to accept it. Wed been friends for like 10 years. 
    She sent me a meme about how she had no friends so i finally drafted  a lengthy text. The gist of it was that sending me things like that even if their jokes really hurts my feelings since shed said she wanted space from me and it ended up turning into a nasty text fight. 
     She then called me one day in late june about a week after that happened and we were able to talk calmly about stuff. She never told me exactly what I had done the last time we hung out to upset her but she did apologize for purposefully  ignoring me. 
    We've been able to get together about twice since then, I guess we're on civil terms? We dont talk regularly anymore like we used to. But shes always so busy with work and school, she couldnt come to either Halloween party or Christmas party that I host. Nor did she wanna go to new years together. It makes me sad i miss her...
      My question is; Am I a bad friend if I keep inviting her to things? Shes super busy with work and school and her boyfriend, but i dont wanna seem like im hurting her by inviting her to things knowing she can't go, is that mean spirited?",26Feb2019,1
546,"I'm Aryan (like actual north Indian) born and brought up in India, and up until now in my 17 years of existence I never realised that the term Aryan was so used and abused by Nazis in a racial context. History in Indian schools didn't cover the western world in a lot of detail and the Nazi misuse of Sanskrit was mentioned barely in passing.

As I'm opening up more to the world and learning things, I'm realising the negative implications of the term are extremely negative, not to mention misrepresented. Even today people are using the term to justify genocide and extremist actions that I hate seeing. I find the association hurtful, but I don't exactly know how to deal with it. I know they are bad people but I can't stop it from affecting me.

549,"Let me start of by providing some background information: I am 21 years old and from the Netherlands, I've had a terrible upbringing and was abandoned at 16 to fend for myself. I've mostly lived my teenage years in organizations that provide living space and adult supervision for troubled and abandoned children. 

Been to jail, had a pretty violent and criminal youth, so I'm no stranger to the likes of extortion and black mail. I don't mean to imply I'm a ""succesfull criminal"". I stopped doing that stuff years ago and alienated all my former acquaintances. Just saying I have a history with it. 

I've moved into my first appartment 2 months ago and I'm hoping to go to the rock academy someday soon, instead of doing stupid criminal stuff in my free time, I've picked up an electric guitar starter kit and started playing. (generic backstory blah blah) 

Anyway let's get to the point. Before I moved to my own appartment I lived at another one of those organizations for troubled people. They under fed us, made a whole bunch of bullshit rules to keep us from socializing and were all in all a terrible influence. 

Later on I learned that while all people who lived in one of the organizations houses had terrible living conditions but some higher ranked employees and the CEO had a ludicrous salary. Like much more then they should have. But nobody could change anything about it so nobody cared. 

When I started living there I payed an x amount of money up front next to my monthly rent with the promise of getting the money back when I leave and my room was in the same condition as I got it. 9 months later I left. I painted the walls, repaired any damages, and generally left the room in a better condition then when I received it.

I really needed the x amount of money to kickstart my venture of living on my own. And since I painted the room and repaired all damages I thought to myself the money was a basically given at this point. When I finally moved out I bought some cooking appliances 'n stuff to get myself started and waited for the x amount of money to be deposited because I was going to buy an oven and FOOD with it. I didn't get the money. 

They told me I didn't pay rent for the second month of my stay there but I was sure I actual payed it. This was really really bad news because I couldn't afford food anymore and since I don't have any family who could help I was left on my own. I had basically nothing, no food, no money. I got low and wanted to take my own life. 

To my surprise some of my close friends reached out and helped me, loaned me amounts of money I would never dare ask for and buying me food and weed (I am dutch after all) allowing me to survive the month after starving myself for 3 weeks. 

Anyway back the point I was originally trying to make. I have collected evidence to proof the organization in question commited fraud and kept MY money for themselves. I have bank transactions in my possession that clearly state that I payed my rent on time, every month. And I don't know what to do with it.

So basically I have green hair (and yes I'm a boy what a surprise)  and people at school call me ""broccoli boy"" or ""bushy boy"" or ""grass boy""  I've told them to stop and while some did, others didn't. They tell me it's just a joke and ""I don't see the big deal"" and ""you need to chill"" but they still call me those names and I absolutely hate it.

PROBLEM #2   
This kid in my class every day (I have long hair) just comes up to me, grabs my hair and pulls on it really hard. I tell him to stop. same thing ""it's just a joke"" or sometimes in response he just moans really loudly.

PROBLEM #3 I like anime quite a bit and since I like talking about it to some of my friends and because I dyed my hair green as an anime character cosplay""  people call me ""Anime boy"" and say things like ""ew anime"" and it also gets on my nerves.

u/Amethyst_Jomes
So I have a situation and would like some advice on how to proceed.

I'm currently crushing on this man. Let's call him Tom. Tom is very good friends with my cousin and her husband. Ive seen him a few times but rarely talk since A)I'm usually upstairs with the girls and hes downstairs drinking and B) I was in a serious relationship and kept my distance. Hes 39, funny, good looking, kind, blah blah blah. Always has something nice to say. As for me, I'm 25, attractive and liked by most. 4 months ago I separated from my bf and haven't dated anyone since. I felt I need some me time. Lately though, I've been thinking a lot about Tom and have been trying to think of ways to get us from just acquaintances to something more. So a few weeks ago I was invited to a wedding. I mentioned to my cousin that I needed a date and she suggested I ask Tom. No one knows im pining for him so it was a big shock for her to pull his name out of thin air like that. She proceeds to send me his number and after a couple of drinks of liquid courage, I sent him a text asking him to be my plus 1. I was terrified he wouldn't even know who I was! But he replied back quickly and said yes. I didnt even tell him the date for the wedding and he said yes, that he would love to and couldn't wait! Suprising as all hell.

All in all I'm happy but I dont want to wait 5 months until the wedding to see him. I'd really like to ask him out for a drink but would hate to make him feel uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I move to really small city, because my university is here. This year I started to live in a student house with my 3 friends, before that I lived in dorm. My initial plan was to live by my own but my friends insisted to come. Considering financial side of the situation I accepted. These 3 are the only ones that I get along. I stand out a lot because city I live is highly conservative and traditional place whereas I am more of a world citizen. My friends are also open minded. I was having fun until few months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

After moving out to new flat each of us gets a room. That's nice. We split into 2 teams, each day one prepares the dinner, next day the other team. Everything was fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I should give some background information. For the last 5 years I've been through a lot. My dad became skin cancer, he divorced with a greedy bitch, I happen to stay alone in a country where I don't know anyone or their languages for 9 months and came back home with anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder... So much shit is going on I could not write them all. And for the same 5 years I live like a nomad. Traveling places because I tried my best of trying my shit together. Was very unlucky tho. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my friends started to live like married couples. Let's do everything together kind of stuff, which I don't really like. They also in night program, which means their classes start at 5 pm and finishes around 11.30 pm. They stay awake till 5-6 am and wake up around 4 pm. I try to wake up early, do my breakfast, go to school, come back and do my assignments etc. When I finish that day's work, they want me to do things with them. I don't want it, I could've do that in afternoon or any time in the day but the thing is they force their way of life to me. They want me to go to gym at the same time with them. When we go they don't even wait me, they go home when I just finished the first half of my schedule at gym. We don't even do the same exercises or help each other lifting, again our programs are different.

&amp;#x200B;

 When I declined their offers to hangout etc. -I was mainly trying to study- they get it like I don't like them or whatever. I cannot concentrate well. I try it so hard. I don't wanna do anything, like nothing at all. I just stare at my computer's screen for 4-5 hours, only after that I finally manage to study for 1-2 hours. That's some hard work for me and a great achievement. But home mates always disturbs me for any fucking reason. When I say that I try to study, their reply is ""You weren't doing anything"". I tell them that I cannot concentrate and need a gun pointing my head kind of thing just to study, they don't give a shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever they do feels so toxic to me. One time I wasn't eating (I still prepare dinner, wash the dishes and everything) but I was just not feeling it. I didn't eat at dinner. Maybe some crackers and milk. They talked with me and told me that if I want to get out of dinner loop I can just say it to them. ""We are making dinner for 4 but when you don't eat it just become wasted"" is their point. Which they sound right but I told them frequently that I don't want to eat. If I were to eat I got something. They still make it for 4 and I get the blame for wasting food.

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired of being harassed by them. They call me caveman, just because I don't go out very often. They don't respect my personal space whatsoever. Whenever I try to 'get my shit together' like I deleted social media accounts and their reaction was ""You're going to open them anyway"". I know that my will is not strong but my tryings are ignored even before the start. I don't use twitter and instagram for 2 months already.  I am not even saying sexual assault like behaviors, because no one gives a shit sexual assault over here, since I am male it's beyond absurd. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a 3 week semester holiday. Now I come back again. Still dealing with their toxicity. I talked with my dad back home, told him that I want to live alone since there is one year left to my graduation. He responded positively. I told my house mates that I am out for kitchen stuff. I only pay the rent, bills and the cleaning stuff. They said some stuff as always. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of things that I don't remember right now but these are the things just comes to my mind. My rental contract ends in june. After that I plan to say ""Fuck you and good bye"". Is there a problem with me or with them? I can't really handle an unnecessary problems like this. I am about to have breakdown.

557,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Sorry for bad formatting due to being on mobile.

My ex and I broke up around October last year. We were in an LDR relationship. He does art stuff and has a character with a sizable following on his art page. I decided to help him make merchandise to help him gain some income.

Prior to the breakup, I've helped him order merchandise of some omanjuu (a tiny hacky-sack like keychain stress ball thing) from Taobao to be shipped over to where I live. He can't sell the things himself because he doesn't have any reliable transport to any post offices in his area. In contrast, I know how to get around on public transport in my home country in South East Asia. 

After the breakup, he hasn't ever marketed nor advertised the product nor my webstore more than once. The stock is not worth much money in USD, but was made with a sizable chunk of my own savings (due to the crippling state of my country's economy). I'm a college student on student loans in another state in my country where I am unable to sell the products at local art markets nor cons, so the only way to sell it without a monetary loss would be online due to the difference in currency.

I don't know what to do with his merchandise just sitting in my room in my home miles way from where I am studying right now. Now that he has found a new girlfriend, I don't know how I'm going to sell off his stuff and get my money back. It would be rather costly to ship the stock over to the USA. His things is one of the things that I need to get rid off in order to truly let go of him forever. It pains me every time i go back for the holidays to see the remnants of my past (and my hard-earned savings) collecting dust in my room.

Note that, i'm in no condition to market his products for him at the moment because I don't have a sizable following like he does, nor do I have access to his audience without him redirecting them my way. 

So, do I send it back and ask for money? Do I just wait it out? Do I talk to him? What do I do with his merch (that I paid for 100%)? :(

tl;dr: Made merchandise for LDR ex. Stock was sent to my country in SEA because he can't do shipping. He doesn't market his merchandise. I'm unable to effectively market and sell the stuff at the moment. What do I do with his (but technically my) stuff?",26Feb2019,1

This is my first ""healthy"" relationship, i think.  i have had a very traumatic childhood and upbringing which has led me to make some shitty choices in the past, especially with men. My self worth was shit, so i was abused and cheated by most men in my life.  i took a lot of time ""off"" from relationships and focused on getting me better and working on my self esteem... eventually i met my current bf though mutual friends, we hit it off and rest is history.  He's supportive ,  caring, funny, all that good stuff. He is very private though. We recently moved in together and things are pretty good for the most part. He is very private though, i didn't meet his parents or family until recently (i didn't even think they knew i existed), i met only 2 of his friends (He says he doesn't have many friends) and none of his friends or family ever come over. He's very outgoing and works in sales so he meets people all the time and maintains these relationships. So my issue is his phone is ALWAYS blowing up with texts.. i know he has group chats w/family, friends, coworkers, and that's all great, but whenever his phone goes off (usually its on silent) he makes a point to turn himself away, re position himself, or walk away to answer the text or look at the phone... it bothers me because i'm very open and transparent. i don't ever think to turn away for a text or when i'm browsing Reddit. He on the other hand does this even when he's just scrolling though yahoo news or whatever ... From past relationships, this is a trigger for me that there's something going on w/his phone.  i don't know how to bring it up to him, i don't want to invade his privacy, i don't want to snoop, and most importantly i don't want to accuse him of anything. But my gut is screaming at me every time his phone pings.. i don't know if its my anxiety from past traumas or if i should listen to my gut bc something is wrong.

570,"Okay, so, the title isn't really clickbait, but its probably not what you think either. So for reference, I live in the UK. We go through a system of GCSE and A levels for those who don't know. Gcse's are final exams sat at the end of 5 years school, while A levels are higher qualifications sat within 7 (including the previous 5).  After finishing GCSE's, students are responsible for their own future, and so you can choose to leave school after they are completed, choosing to go straight into work or do an alternative qualification to A levels, in this case a Btec. Okay, now that that's done.

Im in my last year of GCSE studies, and I have good predicted grades (Sitting 10 GCSE's, predicted 6As 3Bs 1C). These results would be more than enough to allow me back into school next year to sit A levels, and while I've been encouraged by teachers to do so, I don't really want to. See I want to do Zoology as a career, and unfortunately I didn't study Biology at GCSE level, so it would require me to either take the GCSE at A level and add to stress or just not do biology, which isn't an option as its essential to Uni entry. Here's my dilemma, my local further education college offers a level 3 btec (equivalent to 3 a levels) in animal management, which doesn't require me to have biology GCSE. This seems like something I really want to do, especially because its coursework based instead of exam, the college is much more laid back so that would help with stress, and we get to do work experience as part of the course. I honestly don't see a downside, however, pretty much everyone else does, my teachers, family, friends. So I go to a grammar school (basically an ordinary high school but they only accept more intellectual students) and so because of that, everyone thinks that me leaving to go to a community college would be a waste, as id be 'wasting potential'. Honestly my current school just stresses me out, and I don't enjoy being there, I don't think the fact that its a grammar school makes any difference on my level of intelligence, and also, I don't enjoy exam style learning, I much prefer coursework and practical based learning, which the btec offers. My friends look upon the community college as a place for stupid people, and so if I went theyd likely have the same opinion of me, despite me having superior grades to them currently. Basically, I need advice on whether I should drop out of school next year and do a btec or not. I want to, but nobody seems to agree with me that its a good idea, so im starting to doubt myself, my family are telling me im too young to make these decisions and am just stressed with school so im acting out, but I honestly prefer a btec learning style, and nothing I could take at a level interests me nearly as much.

571,"I posted a version of this question to another subreddit, but wanted to get more advice. So here it goes: 


I’m a 26F living in a HCOL city. I moved here about ten months ago for a job. My bf already lived in the city, and I moved in with him. I also genuinely really like the city. 

I’ve been wanting to break up with him for a few months now. He’s a sweet guy but we want different things long term, and just aren’t compatible in that way. I really want to date and find someone whose life goals more align with mine. 

I was starting to look for my own place, when all the sudden, I got laid off from my job. I now can’t break up him with him because I am jobless, and am looking for a new job, and have nowhere to go otherwise. 

I want to break up with him after I get my new job. But I’m unsure if I’ll be able to handle living in the same city - he’s pretty much the only person I know here, and I associate so many things in the city with memories of us. I’m also nervous about whether my new job will actually pay me enough to have a decent living situation post breakup. 

But again like I said, I really love the city. It’s not perfect but there are so many great things about it. 

My parents have been urging me to move back to my hometown, get a new job there, and find someone to settle down with. They argue that if I find an SO in my HCOL city, part of the battle will be convincing them to move to my hometown, which is not a small city by any means, but not a cosmopolitan city like my current one. 

Part of sees the logic in the idea, but the other part of me hates it. The plus is that I’d have a support system post breakup, and I’d be close to my family. And yeah I’ll move back to my hometown eventually because I’ll want to be closer to my family, but I want just a few years away in a different place. I didn’t even go away for college, and this is the point in my life where I can live in that type of exciting city. 

I suppose I could also move to a different city than the one I’m in and my hometown. But I really don’t want to. I know the world is a big place but for me leaving my hometown for someplace that isn’t my current city isn’t worth it. I love the city I’m in and don’t want to completely start over somewhere totally different again. 

So my 3 options are: 

1. Find a new job in current HCOL city, live there for another year or so and continue exploring and experiencing everything it has to offer, date around after I’ve recovered from the breakup, and if I find someone new, convince them to move to my hometown after a year or so. 

2. Move back to hometown and forgo dream of living in HCOL city longer. Date here and find someone to settle down with. Won’t have to convince him to move. 

3. Move to a new city entirely, date around, and convince person to eventually move. 

My fears boil down to regretting my decision either way. If I keep living in HCOL city, what if I regret more time away from family, and end up “wasting” another year of my biological clock not settled down? At 26 I’m getting quite old. But on the flip side, what if I move to hometown, and forever regret all the things I didn’t get to do in HCOL? I feel like ten months here hasn’t been enough. 

I’m unsure of what to do and need some advice.",26Feb2019,1

575,"(Sorry this post is a bit long and English is not my first language so I apologize in advance!)

I (21f) can't sympathize with my 16 y/o younger brother who has been a source of hurt to me ever since I was a kid.
I can't really count up all the shitty things he has done to me or other members of the family through out the years but I can write up a few.
-we don't have the same father so on more than one occasion he has told me that I'm not a part of the family.
- he used to make fun of me in front of his friends, finding my dirty clothes from the wash and throwing them at me (especially underwear).
-making fun of me for having a hard time with math and failing a math exam in high school.
- he used to slap me on my butt which made me feel really uncomfortable and I always told him to stop but he never did.
- he also bullies our cat and it's borderline abusive.

The time where he was the worst to me was also a time where I was suffering the most from anorexia and anxiety/depression so I had a really hard time with him emotionally. My mother no matter how much she saw and heard him never did anything to stop him. She is a pushover and once at Christmas my brother really wanted an Xbox but didn't get it. He decided to cry and scream until my mom bought a Xbox for him. He has always gotten everything handed to him even though he is never grateful for it. He got branded slippers from mom which were very expensive, my step dad wore them once to take out the trash and my brother freaked out because he said that he ruined them (not true, they were still 100% wearable and nothing about them had changed). He threw them in the trash and I DECIDED to take them out and wear them myself. I took them home with me (I lived at my grandparents back then) and a few days later my mom bought him new ones.

But back to the issue at hand. My family moved from Norway and back to Iceland after living there for 8 years (I moved back 2 years earlier and lived with my grandparents) and now my younger brother is having a hard time at school. He doesn't have any friends and school is hard since he can't write or read Icelandic. Friends of our cousin have tried talking to him but he doesn't reply to them. He doesn't seek help at school and mom has to do it for him (which is very understandable). Because of this he has lost a lot of self-esteem and is very lonely since it's hard for him to make friends here (he had a group of friends in Norway which he stuck to) and I feel like he is so used to get everything handed to him that he doesn't know how to solve stuff himself. My mom is really worried about him and is doing everything in het power to help him, which is something she never did for me back when I was suffering from anorexia and anxiety/depression and it hurts seeing her go all out for him. My brother doesn't want to see anyone and doesn't want to solve his issues. He is searching for a job but doesn't want to work at grocery stores in the area because he feels the people there are below him and that he deserves better job opportunities.

Despite all this shit from my brother my mom tries to involve me in helping him, which I have a hard time doing. She wants me to be soft on him when he is saying crazy stuff or is abusing our cat. I've had enough of my brother and I have no desire to help him. I cannot sympathize with the person who used to and still does bring me a lot of hurt.",26Feb2019,1
576,"Backstory: I've always wanted to become an engineer and own and work at my own Research and Development company. For that I've always known I'd need a large amount of funding. Recently though, the best track to do that was I would become a software developer, work to reach management and in around 5 years or so make 6 figures to fund real estate investment that would eventually be the largest amount of my income so that I could fund my own research.

Where I am at now: for the last year and a half I have worked as a teller at a small bank in my home town while I go to school in the evenings. I have done as much as I can to make myself as indispensable as possible. I have taken on as much other responsibility as I could and have done well. I oversee Cybersecurity and also work on introducing and implementing new technologies into the company, as well as being the best teller on the line. The CEO and head of the BoD have started mentoring me in hopes I would stay on here, although they know I have always planned on leaving.

The other day, the CEO pulled me into an office to make sure I knew what I would be doing if I stayed here rather than leave. He made it clear that in 10 years when he retired he would be expecting me to be the new president, and him and the previous CEO would groom me for the position. If I decided to stay he would promote me off the teller line and into a loan office within the next few months after a short training program. Provided I have a large loan portfolio, I could be making 6 figures rather quickly (3 years or so). I'd be starting at around 50k a year (negotiable) and they'd pay for my schooling. In 8-12 years I'd be president. Both CEOs current and previous are well off and successful real estate investors, who would be willing to mentor me in both banking and that area. If I take this opportunity, I would be retired a millionaire before 50 with a possible ownership stake in the company.

I am a very hard worker, i'm intelligent, and I am good in leadership positions. I don't doubt that I would do well if I did move on with my previous plan, but I fear I don't know enough about the industry to know if I'd be able to be better off working in it or staying. The CEO has made it clear that if I chose to try software development and come back that I haven't burned a bridge and the offer is open. So my best thought at the moment is to do an internship that I have planned for about 3 months before I get a job offer and then determine my future possibilities. I'm curious as to what some other, more educated in the fields opinions may be. Any advice is welcome (especially someone who knows something about the success of software developers, and project managers), thank you so much.

580,"In order to explain my situation I first need to tell a little bit of backstory: When I was very young I had three friends who all lived less than a block away from me. We would always play with eachother. They were my best friends up until when I was 11 years old because my school changed the classes and I had moved away (I still went to the same school). Because I got into the other class I couldn't be as much with my friends and eventually completely lost contact with them. When we saw eachother in the corridors we wouldn't even say hi. Six more years passed and they were still friends and I don't really remember how but I somehow made contact with them online and started playing games with them.

I'm now 16 years old and play games with them almost everyday. When I talk with them over the internet it feels like I'm 7 years old again and we're best friends. But when I see them in school they completely ignore me. I've tried to talk with them several times but they will avoid eye contact and keep walking. When I come home to my computer it is as if nothing happened and we're friends again. I would like to become friends with them in real life but I just don't know why they keep ignoring me.

582,"Hi! Thanks in advance! 

So last night, my mom and I had one of our pre-bedtime chats. It started out as usual, I let her vent about her coworkers while I confirm that they're part of the problem and she's doing the best she can. 

This time, though, the topic shifted. She manages a grocery store, and we got to talking about GMOs and how they affect products, and after a bit, she paused. ""You know, after a lot of soul searching, I realized that's what I shouldve studied in college,"" she said. She sounded a little sad. ""I just find them fascinating.""

I suggested to my mom all the different papers and books that are just a Google away thanks to technology, but she shrugged it off because she was ""too old"" and wouldn't use it. She did go to college, but went in to be a teacher, realized she didn't enjoy it, and eventually left school to join the workforce. 

I know and begrudgingly accept that going back to school isn't likely an option (lord do i know about student loans) but I'm a strong believer that if something interests you, you should look it up and learn all you can about it - especially now that libraries' worth of knowledge is available from the desktop or even a phone. And it was amazing to learn that there's something my mom is so passionate about - to just see that passion be swallowed by her daily responsibilities would be heartbreaking. 

So if anyone has any advice on how to convince her that studying just for the sake of knowing things is worth it, or if anyone has any words to say to her, I'd greatly appreciate it. Her birthday is coming up, and I'm on Amazon looking for books on the subject now. I think that's a good first step.",26Feb2019,1

586,"Hello people,

My fellow coworkers and I require some opinions regarding a new venture we have been pursuing. Here we provide a quick overview as we seek your opinions and any questions that you may have.

Our idea consists in a platform where young adults (18-25yo) with non-/diagnosed mental health issues can get help (remote psychology treatment) from semi-/professional psychologists. In essence, the platform would serve two potential customers, the client willing to get help, and the psychologist who would be providing the help, both of which would be incentivized for the platform to emerge and grow. Both users will be able to access our services via web or mobile.

As we developed more and more research, we found out few young adults have the necessary finances to seek professional help and often perceive a lack of safe, accessible support systems as a barrier to tackle depression, anxiety or similar issues. To tackle this issue and reduce costs, we would have semi-professional psychologists (third-year psychology major students) provide the remote psychology treatment to those young adults who require “light” guidance or help. (They would charge a flat fee between $15-$20 per session/hour) In the case that they are already diagnosed as “mentally ill” or require further help from experts, they would then be referred to professional psychologists (They would be allowed to set their own price) that can provide immediate guidance.

Furthermore, the platform will have a preliminary assessment (through questions via chat) to better understand needs of patients and cater the experience to their needs. Patient information will be secure since they can choose for their own psychologist from our “recommendations,” and psychologists themselves cannot reach out to clients firsthand to secure client privacy. Also, psychologists (professional and semi-professionals) will also undergo necessary validation processes to ensure they are capable of providing such service.

Keep in mind this is a quick overview of the platform, there are much more factors in play.

We would like to ask you, What do you think of the idea?

Do you think it would work?

Are there any barriers worth mentioning that we might be overlooking? (Imagine we are basing ourselves in United States)

For psychology major students, would you be willing to grant remote assistance in your free time for a small paycheck of about $15 per hour?

If you have any other questions, concerns, or ideas, feel free to please address us, everything is appreciated.

590,"So a little background... my girlfriend has recently been complaining a lot about her day job as an engineer that she started at 6 months ago. There seems to be this really annoying guy she works with that constantly wants the lights in the office turned off because otherwise he gets headaches and also he seems to just be lacking a lot of general self-awareness.

She hasn’t been as upbeat recently because work has been very stressful and this guy sounds like the source of most of her frustration (i.e. not training her as well as he should have, blaming her when things go bad).

I personally can’t decide if it is solely about this annoying guy that just makes day to day work unbearable, or rather the work itself is less than fulfilling to her. 

To me, I feel like a lot of this is just about adjusting to working in the real world, and dealing with people on a daily basis that you might not particularly like. I have suggested she talk to her boss about this guy and just ask for advice or see if he can help, but she says that he will just tell her to suck it up. I still think that is worth doing though.. right?

She says maybe she just wants a new job, but I’ve always been told that the worst thing in a resume is jumping around from job to job too soon. You have to show employers you can commit, even if they don’t ever have to commit to you (that’s a whole other gripe of mine).

I’ve told her from the start I’ll support her decisions any and every way I can. But I also want to offer advice and help her with this the best I can. What should I say to help comfort her? To advise her? Any other advice on what she should do, questions I should ask, or just general help handling this situation would be greatly appreciated.

591,"I don’t really know where to post this but I just need advice and I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m a wet napkin. 

Just to give backstory my dad committed suicide when I was 16. He was physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive but also a functioning alcoholic. I loved my dad when he wasn’t drunk and a raging cunt, he was my best friend. My half sister is eight years older than me, she and my dad hated each other. 

When dad died my mum never showed me the will, or any of the documents that were my fathers. I only ever /heard/ about them. I was only 16 but I still feel like in retrospect I should have been involved in some way?? like of course around that time everything was crazy of course but that’s important stuff. Right? 
Mum told me she was going to invest mine and my half sisters money from his death into businesses for us—which I didn’t want, ever, and told her that—she didn’t listen.

My mother had multiple sources of income at the time and has currently a smoothly running small business that pays the bills well. I’m extremely grateful for my mum and know she helps me a lot, but I just know that her keeping the money and “investing it” (poorly) will not help me at all. 

I’m 21 now and at university working my lil butt off and I guess I just don’t know how to bring it up? Like ‘hey mum I want my dead dads money because I don’t trust you with it.’ 

Am I entitled to it? I don’t want lawyers or anything involved because i feel that’s completely unnecessary and this can be solved with a conversation, I just don’t know how to start the conversation, or if someone could give me alternate perspective where I can justify pushing it down and never bringing it up with her.

592,"For some background, I lived with her \[20F\] for a year (I moved out due to a career-related housing opportunity). We got along extremely well, and she was there for me for a really difficult time, where I was raped and spent a period of time in a psychiatric hospital.

When I moved out in August, I lived about 20 mins away (not far). We are both full time students and I would call her everyday to see how her day was. We were in a mutual friend group of two other people, so I would speak to them often as well.

Then, around November, she increasingly stopped answering my texts and phone calls. I would ask if she was okay, and she would say yes, just busy. Again, I kept making these efforts and it wasn’t reciprocated. 

Around New Years, I realized I was completely blindsided, as she was posting cryptic things on social media and her friends had blocked me on a few platforms. I tried calling her and she didn’t answer. Then a few days later, she sends me a novel of a text message. She said that I spent way more time talking to our other friends than her and she felt that I was trying to “push her out of the friend group.” She said I was a mean person, I made her feel “suffocated,” and that I needed serious help.

I heard her out, dealt with it in a completely respectful and appropriate way, and told her that I was willing to compromise to make our friendship work. She said she would reach out to me after having a little bit more space.

Since then, I have asked her to go out and talk three times. Each time, she has an excuse. But this past time, she took ten days to answer me. She said, “hey, sorry I didn’t know what to say. To be honest, I’m still hurt and not ready to talk to you.”

Its been three months since I’ve seen her. Any time I try to reason with her, she takes it as an attack and says that I’m invalidating her feelings. It’s so easy for everyone to say “forget about it and move on,” but I just feel completely disrespected and tossed to the side. 

I know I don’t want anything to do with her anymore, but I want her to understand the way her actions make other people feel. I don’t know how to respond to her text in a constructive way without her twisting it around to be an attack.

She has dismissed all of my efforts to fix things.

600,"Hello,

First time reddit poster (this is a burner account as I was advised to do). I graduated high school last spring in 2018 and I have never enjoyed classes and rarely have found anything I learn in school to pique my interest. I basically just did what I had to do in high school to get by with As and Bs. If it weren’t out of respect for my parents I likely would have just scraped by with mostly Cs. This isn’t due to me being a dumb kid either. Despite my cheating through many tests and assignments throughout high school and now even in college, I scored a 33 on the ACT fairly easily. I also have scored very high on AP tests with mostly 4s and 5s. I have always naturally been good at math and things like economics and geography as well. So essentially ever since I can remember I’ve been a very high achieving test taker, but have lacked motivation and interest in mostly every part of my education. Naturally I thought I was just supposed to go to college because “that’s what smart kids like me do.”

So to get on with it I am just curious to get opinions from people who have maybe had similar experiences or anyone really on what I should do moving forward. I am currently enrolled and participating in my second semester of college. So far I have dreaded waking up to go to class and have not found much interest in any class once again. I failed/dropped multiple classes last semester purely out of lack of attendance, and I already screwed up and will have to drop a class this semester but I’m doing ok in the rest. Everything else in my life is fine as far as my job (just a small 10 hr/week job)  and other aspects as well. I have no mental health issues and I may be biased (lol), but I seem to be very likable I have a great sense of humor, and I get along with mostly everyone and vice versa. So I ask, should I drop out? If so, what are my options and what does everyone think I should look into doing for work? Any other opinions are welcome too. I appreciate any and all replies. Thanks!

601,"So I guess this won’t really count as “quitting” smoking to most, but yesterday I got rid of all my vaping products. I was using a Smok Novo, which is essentially a JUUL.

I’ve been smoking about 50nic juice for a year to 2 years now. I just realised it’s a waste of my time and money as a student.

So, a little backstory..

I'm very very afraid of her getting pregnant because I don't want to be a father like now or never and she doesn't want to be a mother either so we are cool in this.

About us..

I started dating her in late 2017 we have a great relationship and I love to be with her but early 2018 we started touching each other (we are young) and we would be very touchy but ever had sex cuz she wasn't on birth control and we were both occupied so we waited until like September when she went to the doctor (I went with her cuz I wanted to know about it) and she did the 2 months of regulation of her system so we're basically okay doing whatever we want. Not until New year when we had the chance to be all alone by ourselves at a hotel we were together for the first time by this time she was like 6 months in on birth control and we even used condom there and until now, always.

She has been gaining weight and I'm always worried that she is pregnant..

She knows about my fear and not even after when we had the talk about if it happening or not I could deal with it..

Please help me, I can't live in this fear and I want to keep my relationship but if I can't deal with this properly I may end up ending something that is precious to me.

608,"TL;DR - Every time I get close to actually committing and falling for someone, I fuck it up. I suck at closure and fear regret. I'm terrible at being honest with myself but I need to figure out how to start breaking this cycle. Please be kind, this is hard.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first several years of my dating life (14-21) every boyfriend I had cheated on me. Ever since then, I feel like I need a ""back up plan"" - i'm constantly in fear of the person i'm seeing cheating or finding better. I don't distrust them where I am concerned about who they're talking to or anything. If anything, I keep myself distant and avoid a deep relationship. Where this has started to get complicated:

&amp;#x200B;

In Oct. 2017 I went on a date with a guy, C. Our first date was very good. He became very enamored with me fairly quickly and we were spending a lot of time together. Around February he started talking about valentine's day and meeting my family and wanting to be together for real, talking about being soulmates. I got very scared and just sort of disappeared. I stayed in touch, certainly, but I just felt overwhelmed and scared. He (rightfully) started talking to someone new fairly quickly. I kept in touch and he ended up breaking things off with her to continue pursuing things with me. It (unfairly) made me sad. I allowed things to get more serious - sleepovers, spending every day together, traveling together, being ""official"" and all of that. It was very fun and thought I felt so in love. He started talking about more intense things. Like wanting to move in together, and my marriage timeline, kids, finances. This was about 8 months in. I froze. I shirked those questions and conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

As time wore on, I think he became sick of my inability to have conversations about more long-term things. We became less love-y and more resentful overall. The things I'd originally ignored at the start of our relationship really started to wear on me. Bad financial decisions such as not paying taxes, being kicked out of an apartment and wanting to stay with me, and eventually going through my personal affects while alone at my house left my feeling exhausted... in general a lack of boundaries on his end. Shortly after the start of the new year, I broke things off. I am very bad with closing doors. I acknowledge this. I continued seeing him for about two weeks, but it just didn't feel right. Conversations were awkward and it merely felt like a sexual fulfillment only.

&amp;#x200B;

I went on a few dates with someone else a few weeks later. It was...fine? Nothing I was necessarily feeling strongly about. A fun person who was adventurous. I think the juxtaposition of the two people and my emotional connection with C had wrapped me up. I couldn't stop thinking about him. The guy i'd gone on a few dates with posted heart eyes emoji on one of my instagram photos and C messaged him, saying ""I'm her boyfriend, whats up with that?"" - he was not my boyfriend, and I had not seen him in nearly 5 weeks. I feel very torn and now that I have to make the decision to sever ties with C, I feel I cannot do it. I get stuck in this hurtful pattern of thinking things will be different. Like, maybe i'm actually in love but too afraid of commitment to give it my all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how love works. I don't know if the difficulty of dating is like this. In my past relationship, from when I was 20-24, I loved him and actually could see myself marrying him... but he later admitted that the first year of our relationship, he was continuing to have a sexual relationship with his ex. It broke my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

When you fall in love, does this stuff just fade away? Do the red flags not matter? Do the anxieties disappear? This all feels so abnormal; like my gut tells me C is not the one, but yet I am struggling so much with just saying ""okay, it's done."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not navigating my romantic relationships well, and I need help.

609,"My(27M) wife(25F) just told me yesterday that unless she was presented with compelling evidence to vaccinate, she would not vaccinate our future kids. We don't have any kids right now, and don't plan on having any for a few more years, so that's good. 

She argues that neither of us has done enough research to determine if they are actually safe or not, and by default she would choose not to vaccinate. Admittedly she is right, neither of us has done actual research. That being said, I feel strongly that they should be vaccinated. 

This is something we discussed before getting married, and she agreed that we would vaccinate our kids, so this is a little bit of a blind side. 

The advice I would like is, where can I find actual, unbiased evidence and research pointing to vaccines being safe and effective? 

Thanks in advance!

P.S. - Please speak kindly about my wife. I love her more than anything, she is an amazing person and just wants to do whats best for our future kids. Her mom (who still vaccinated all her kids) and close friends are anti-vax believers and have been influencing her.

Let me just start off by saying that shit went down last night. This was the first time in my 17 (almost 18, birthday soon) years of living that I have ever seen my parents show such anger towards me, and I guess I deserve it, but it still hurts. 

For the record they (50/M, 43/F) are both good parents. Not the best but hey no parents are really perfect. They have good jobs, are usually happy most the time, buy my siblings and I gifts and treats, so they aren’t bad parents. 

This might be a little long so please bear with me because I’m not so sure I can handle much more this this. 


Yesterday I snapped. When I say snapped I mean I totally lost control of myself, got moody and angry. What made me so moody and angry? Everything I guess! I honestly can’t give you a straight answer. It was like I was a different person. I was tired of being ignored by my parents not listening to me when I say I have problems and need help, I was starving because I hadn’t eaten all day for my own punishment, I was cooking up something bad. My mental health is garbage and I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but that’s another can of worms entirely. I guess my feelings started overflowing and I just kinda said ‘fuck it’ and let them run.

When I do have an attitude, my dad (or both my parents really) goes straight to threats. It starts off with a warning. “You better lose your attitude right now.” Or something along those lines. Then “if you don’t stop I’ll go shut off the internet.” I usually break down and start apologizing. Not yesterday though. For some weird reason I hadn’t reacted when my dad had threatened to shut everything down. No reaction from me whatsoever. I just sat at the dinner table and stared back at him. Emotionless really. Kinda broken. Or so I imagine. Then I said something, I can’t remember what I had said, but snapped back at him and oh dear god I had not realized that a fucking demon had been unleashed. 

I do somewhat remember some of our conversation: Me as me, D for Dad

D, angrily: “if you don’t knock this shit off I’m going to slap that attitude out of you.”

Me, the dumbass that I am: “oh please do.” 

D, yelling now: “give me your phone right now!” 

Me: “no.” 

He asked again, still yelling, and I still said no. The next moments were a blur. My dad had reached down to grab my phone out of my hands and take it from me, but I had a very stubborn bone in my body and refused to let go of what was mine. (No, I didn’t buy it, and I’m sorry, but it’s still mine and I deserve to have my privacy. The phone is mine. Please don’t talk to me about this.) 

Anyway we fought over it and my hand refused to let go, so I screamed. He towered over me. I was afraid. I was really really scared. Everything became so bad so fast. My dad - not pleased that I wasn’t giving up our game of tug-o-war -grabbed my arms instead. Hard. He squeezed and yelled and I was already bawling at this point but I was holding my ground. 

Next thing I knew, he had pushed me against the chair and I could hear my younger brother and sister scream for him to stop. His hand was around my throat. I couldn’t breathe. It wasn’t very long but it was long enough for me to freak out again and smack my plate of food across the table. 

Me: “I don’t fucking care anymore!” 

Done. I was just done. I had/have no desire to live anymore.

My father dragged me by the arms to his bedroom and I sat on the bed. Still emotionless but with tears and puffy eyes. We talked, but I didn’t say much. Just “I don’t know, I don’t care.” We talked. We hugged and he apologized for putting his hands on me. I still can’t trust him because of how he reacted. 

The most surprising part was after a few hours, my father came into my room and started crying. We hugged again, I told him it was okay, but he said it “really wasn’t.” Then he left. I cried myself to sleep last night, head pounding. 


I think the worst part about this was my mother. She was IN the kitchen when this went down. She saw me getting tossed around and heard me scream and cry, saw how furious my father was. She didn’t do shit. No support on her end. My mother didn’t follow us into the room to try and calm my dad down, she didn’t come talk to me after we were done talking, she didn’t even bother to ask if I was okay. In fact she ignored me the entire night. This morning was even worse. The only time we ‘talked’ was when she told me what time to leave for school. We didn’t speak during the ride. No goodbyes or ‘I love yous’ or any words at all. She was aggressive and I could tell she was upset. 



What should I do? I’m at school right now and I feel like I’m about to break down crying. I don’t want to go home. I don’t want to see my parents or talk to them, especially not my mother. I have nothing to say to either of them right now and I’m lost. I love them dearly but I’m so broken and don’t know what to say to them. Please help.

TLDR: I was a moody teen and snapped back at my dad. Dad tried to take my phone from me, I fought back. Dad grabbed (and squeezed) my arms and my neck, then cried and hugged me. Mom is now angry at either me or my dad. Everything sucks. ",26Feb2019,1

625,"I was starting to get things back on track in my life but I feel like things have gone to absolute shit again. I fall into a downward spiral of depression. It's a pattern in my life. I feel like I was starting to change things; yoga, meditation, taking more risks, even Hypnoses. 

I feel a tremendous amount of pressure on myself. From almost every aspect of life; Work, family, health and the social pressure. My family is not the best. Overall the family unit wasn’t the most stable. 

I was diagnosed with Hyper-mobility. I have some herniated disks. I try to manage back pain with yoga but work doesn’t leave much time. I get very bad anxiety and this just increases the muscle pain. My neck is just constantly stiff and sore. And the emotions come out with the exhaustion of it all. I feel very tired too. 

My biggest problem, I push everyone close to me away. I’ve already had two fights in the past few days with people I was communicating with. I will go from talking to people one day to in the next day wanting absolutely nothing to do with them. Almost feeling like they are an absolute and complete hindrance on my life. And then I lash out at them in some way to make them angry and then start a fight as if it was mutual. It is fucked up but I don’t even notice I do it even though I have probably done it 100 times. 

Its so much pressure emotionally for me to have people in my life for some reason. I just feel very pressured to please people and to be what they want me to be that I end up confusing everyone. But definitely myself too. I am so lonely yet I continue to do what I am doing. 

I take on the victim mentality because I feel so extremely hurt and lost in this world. I haven’t made a true friend in a very long time. Most of my relationships at the moment are only lasting a few weeks. I am emotionally, physically and mentally drained and fed up and really just wish I could press a button to not exist. Life feels so meaningless without real friends. I often wonder what life would be like if I wasn’t too afraid to let people in? I think I will never know.

626,"I've been working for my current employer for about 3 years now. We have this one senior vice president, he's probably in his mid to late 50s, maybe even early 60s, super rich, married white guy. At my first Christmas party with the company, everyone was getting super hammered, except I wasn't drinking at the time and it seemed that he wasn't either. I was standing in a group of people and during this first xmas party he was just always standing close to me and trying to flirt with me in very subtle ways. I didn't think anything of it at the first xmas party. The second year, at the next xmas party, i was minding my own business somewhere when he comes outta nowhere and walks by me, brushing his shoulder up against me as he walks by. I know this was not an accidental bump, because I wasn't surrounded by anyone unlike the first time. He didn't say anything or even look back at me, just brushed my shoulder and kept walking by. At the third year, at our xmas party, i was at the bar ordering a drink. I was wearing a fur vest thingy. my back was against the room and towards the bar, and he came up from behind me and put his arm over me on the bar. I turned around to see who it was and he basically had me cornered up against the bar, as there were too many people to go anywhere else. He said hi to me and then proceeded to actually rub up and down my fur vest (read: where my boobs are) basically using the pretense of wanting to feel my vest and commenting on how much he liked it and how fuzzy it was. It made me feel really uncomfortable and totally caught me off guard, and I couldnt even leave because i was still waiting for my drink. He lingered for a bit and I eventually got my drink and walked away. Also, earlier that night, I caught him visibly checking me out (like literally, saw his eyes look me up and down), while my boyfriend was away to get me a drink. His wife was at the party too, so he basically was checking me out and he knew I saw him, his wife came back and he basically just turned to her and away from me as if nothing happened.   


All of these incidents have happened at our work christmas parties. We do not work in the same department or together at all at work, so i don't really interact with him much there. I see him sometimes in the halls, and he will always go out of his way to say hi to me or ask how i'm doing (i have no interest in engaging with him though). Recently, he's been walking closer and closer to me, sometimes coming up from behind too, almost like an intimidation tactic. I'm totally at a loss for what I should do. This guy holds a lot of power and pull in the company so i don't anticipate him being fired unless i had real tangible evidence of an incident. I'm not sure whether it is worth reporting to HR because I'm not even sure if these count as harrassment or if it's all just something in my head that i'm making a bigger deal out of. i have not told anyone at work about the incident except for my boyfriend (who also works at the company). I am afraid if I go to HR they will either not believe me, or if they look into it and confront him, he might deny or spin the story to make it look like i'm making things up.

627,"Full disclosure: I know it’s my own fault. 

So, I’m currently stuck in a South American country. I was doing some travel with my boyfriend, he’s always wanted to travel around South America and so have I so we’d thought fun backing through South America. 

Now, just some background info. We booked a one way ticket (non-refundable) back in January for South America. I was working in January and had a bit of money saved so I said “okay cool, why not?” Well, between then and now I lost my job and was living off those savings. I thought I’d get my last paycheck from the company I was working for and they said I owed them money from the advance I got months ago. I also thought I could use my tax return for this trip but there was an issue with that and it’s going to take longer than thought to process. To add to this, so I live in China currently where they require me to have a visa to live there.

Now, I do have a job lined back up in this China but I have to pay for the visa and then wait a week for it and book a flight back to that country. 

On the other hand, if I go back to the US I just a return flight but I don’t have a job lined up or anything. I’d be living at home with my family until I get a new job. Another kicker is that I want to go to law school in the US and I was just living in China temporarily until I start school in January. 

In addition to this, my boyfriend is Chinese. And his dream is to travel around the world. Now, he has money saved up for HIM to do some traveling for several months but he didn’t account for me traveling with him.

He said “it doesn’t matter to me where you live.” But he still wants to travel for months at a time and have me wait until he gets back. 

Anyways, my question is should I beg my mom to pay for a ticket and go home to the states start looking for a temporary job there until I start school? Or should I pay for the visa and go back to China with the job I have lined up then wait until law school there?

Initially I was sceptical about this as while I hate current school I do have some amazing friends, as time went on however I became more and more exited to.""start fresh"" with new people and a fresh environment. I initially beleaved that the reason for this move was for my brothers and I to be closer to our father and for my mother to be closer to her new boyfriend, this move and change of schools would also aid my mother's career in the long run.

Today I found out that my mother and her boyfriend are planning (this plan has been already set in motion) to rent a house together and his 2 children live with us aswell. I should mention that my mother's boyfriend is French speaking but he speaks almost perfect English, however his children do not speak English and my youngest brother has no French and my middle brother has a little les that I do, I can so times understand what is being said but that's not all of the time.

When the weekend comes, I have no energy left in me, just want to stay home in my sweats and relax.

When her weekend comes (once every other week), she wants to do things, see people, go out, etc. 

We're not on the same page and it's hard.

She needs a break from taking care of the kids. She's the one in charge of the groceries, kids lunches, week meals, etc. Basically everything regular house/kids tasks. I'm away 12h/day (long hours + commute) and take kids to their activities (and have one on my own) on the evenings.

We have a pretty active social life, there's not one weekend we're not having friends home (sometimes going out). 
It's more than enough for me but not enough for her. She has few friends of her own, she ""inherited"" my group. So there's little chances she's gonna do something on her own.

What frustrates me the most is she gets plenty of 'alone' time. The week she doesn't work she's home alone for 8 hours / day. Of course there are groceries to do and some chores (mostly laundry) but there's a whole 40 hours there that doesn't seem to 'count'. I know daytime alone in the house isn't as exciting as weekend nights with friends.

They then told me that I didn't send them a valid form of ID, removed my Facebook account, and requested more forms of ID. They won't let me have access to my Facebook data until I send it in and will not reply to me.

It was the night that I learned that they wouldn't be taking my rape case to court so I originally didn't want to go out, I wanted to stay home. Was encouraged by everyone to go out, so I did and I got drunk. Before Joe got there, M told me that if I ""got too drunk, he was going to give me to Joe"". I freaked out a bit on him because it was really disrespectful and he knew I had a boyfriend. He said that it didn't matter because bf wasn't in the same time zone. Anyway, Joe gets there and I'm wasted. I'm sitting on the couch and he sits next to me. He then starts rubbing my feet through the blanket, makes me uncomfortable but I don't say anything to him about it. I fell asleep watching a movie and woke up to Joe with his hand up my skirt and he's rubbing my vagina. I didn't confront him but I woke up D and T and asked them if they could take me home. I tell them what happened right away in the car and I told J and M the next day. They tell me it is my own fault for letting him rub my feet and for being so drunk. Also went on to say that I'm a piece of shit because I ruined the friend group by divorcing my husband and that if he was so abusive, why did I marry him in the first place, etc, etc. Then goes on to tell me that he's been telling Joe that I'm into him and that he should make moves on me, etc. 

I obviously blocked J, M, and Joe, but I still talk to D and T. They claim they have cut ties with Joe entirely, but they still see J and M quite often. Part of me feels they shouldn't have to choose between me and them, but also M was really fucking awful to me and T made excuses for him. It's been a year but it's still so fresh. I can't get past the fact that D and T still see them, and I don't feel right asking them to either stop talking to them or stop talking to me, so I want to just stop talking to them. I don't know if that's the right decision, nor do I know if I should tell them or just ghost them. I don't know what to do.

D and T are pretty much my only friends except for my uncle who is my age so I feel like I'd be losing a lot. Not to mention, if M would have said half of the things to T that he said to me I would have lost my mind on him. *I* would have stopped talking to him.

649,"This has arguably a lot of unnecessary detail, and I’m not sure if this is the right place. Hopfully this post is understandable, and not a dumb question.

So, for some backstory this is a bit more difficult because of my family’s religion. They’re very strict, and their religion very seriously. I personally don’t believe in their morals, so when I’m an adult I’m going to move away (and leave the religion). If they know that that I leave they’re going to disown me, and I don’t want to hurt their feelings, hence I’m moving far away and cutting off any way for them to get in contact. 
This is important because when I’m an adult, and my mom dies I’m not sure how they could get in contact with me, or how my mom is going to put my sister in her will. 

About my sister, she’s handicapped. She has microcephaly which causes her to act 3 instead of her being in her 30s. Because of this, none of my other siblings want to take care of her, and I feel bad. I don’t want her going into foster care, especially considering that she’s disabled. 
Still, I don’t want to take care of her since I do want to be able to have some freedom, and if I constantly have to take care of a toddler for the rest of my life I doubt it’s going to easy. Considering everything I want as an adult, (job wise, moving to the other side of the country, etc) it wont be easy. Along with that, I’ll have to keep in contact with my family which means I either have to lie about being in same religion, going to meetings, etc. or I have to stay in a religion that I don’t agree with. Even then, I don’t want my sister the only reason why I’m considering it is out of sympathy.

Tl;dr/question: When I’m an adult, I want to leave my family and either they disown me, or I basically disown them. Still, I want to keep in contact because of my handicapped sister. I’m not sure what to do, do I lie to my family and keep in contact so I’ll have my sister when my mom dies, or do I leave my sister to eventually go into foster care?",26Feb2019,1
650,"Hi guys,

Looking for some clarity here...my husband (13 years older than me) has recently changed the password on his debit card to prevent me from ever having access.  Long story short, we’ve been married for 2 years and we had a life altering still birth 10 months ago. We are now in a coping place but I’ve been unable to work because I’ve been dealing with health complications from the pregnancy. I was 7 months pregnant when we had the stillbirth (April, 24, 2018).  Things have been tough to say the least. The issue now is, my husband has become cold to me. He treats me less than, hurts me with his words. The worst part is that he recently changed his debit card pin knowing that’s my only access to funds right now while I’m not working. I’ve always been financially independent but not being able to work during this time had made me reliant financially on my husband. I’ve recently had some great interviews and am on the way to being employed...however, now I feel as though I’m unable to trust him, connect to him or be around him. I feel betrayed and most of all, expendable. I feel like our tragedy is somehow my fault and he is punishing me for our son not being here.

652,"This is kind of a weird situation, but I'll do my best to explain. (I also couldn't come up with a good title sorry)
So my parents have these neighbor's who don't currently live in their house because they're working in a different state (so this is kind of like their 2nd home). In October my parents moved and I had been living with them up until this point. Their new house was basically across the street from their old one, but our neighbors wanted someone to watch their house so they offered to let me stay there rent free and I would just pay the difference in the utility bill. My parents were downsizing and I was basically right out of college so this sounded like a good idea.  

So fast forward to a couple months ago and I hadn't heard anything about how much I owe them. I texted them to ask about it and my neighbor said he would get back to me, he never did.

Now, my boyfriend and I are close to closing on a house and I texted my neighbor again to tell him about this, and that I would be moving out of their house and I haven't heard from them. They're not people to be checking their phones all the time, but it's been over a week now. I just don't know what to do. I'm not sure how much I'm going to end up owing them and I don't wanna have to give them a bunch of money all at once because... well I'm buying a house and that's quite a bit of money.

654,"Hey guys!

I legitimately have no idea what to do in this situation as of right now. So a little background would help, right? I have worked at this independently owned restaurant for 7 years. I moved up to assistant manager and finally manager as of a year ago. The business changed hands about six months ago and I was demoted from manager in order to 'prove myself' to my new boss. 

That's fine. I wasn't the greatest manager in the world and I certainly had a lot of growing to do. So we end up working closely and I continuously prove my worth. It got to the point where he promised that I would have salary and benefits by September. 

I get benefits in September but no salary. Okay. He plans a staff meeting in October, I attend and get promoted back to manager. Yay, cool, that means I am a step closer to salary!

Nope. 

He tells me he doesn't have the funds. Okay, yeah, the business isn't doing well. That's fine. I can wait a bit because I love my work. A few weeks later he tells me we need to have a chat about all the things I'm doing wrong as manager. Out of the blue and because I forwarded a concerned text from an employee to him. He ""does not want to see employee complaints""

 Now, at this point, three people have quit. No one has been hired to cover them, the remaining staff is working double shifts just to cover the day. We aren't getting paid on time, either. We are supposed to get paid Friday and don't see checks until Wednesday of the following week. And when we do get paid, the bank rejects the check.

I'm exhausted. I told my boss that I am stepping down as manager because it isn't worth it anymore. I put in my notice. He told me that if I help train people, he'll let me work and make money until I find a new job. Just be a server, that's it. 

Okay. 

He hasn't hired anyone at all. It's been two weeks. More people quit. My check just bounced four days after I was supposed to be paid, again. He yelled at me over something that wasn't my fault today and is now actively ignoring me even when I try to be professional and figure it out. 

So here's the question, I guess. Should I make this Sunday my last day, or next Sunday (the 10th)? Like I put in my notice two weeks ago and he hasn't hired anyone. I'm being treated like shit but I'm afraid saying my last day is at the end of this week is too short notice. I'm not trying to burn a bridge. I'm just so mentally drained from the place at this point and I don't know what to do. I worked here for 7 years and now I feel like I'm a piece of literal trash.

Second program I took is Baking and Pastry Management where I was really enjoying it at first. During second semester I started having these anxiety attacks as I would go into the kitchen. I am miserable and cannot see myself working in a bake shop which I thought was my dream.

I thought that maybe some of you lovely people had similar experiences in your life because nobody in my life understands and I’m getting pretty desperate. I’m really embarrassed because it’s completely ridiculous here it goes: 

The problem is that I got really into shipping this one couple from one of my favourite series. It started right after I fell into a deep depression three years ago and I used it as an escape from all my problems and feelings and as a coping mechanism. The problem is that I lost touch with reality more and more. I became addicted to it and blurred the line of where the characters end and I begin. It was my only source of happiness and belonging for a long time, but it also made things so much worse. Whenever something dramatic would happen in one of these stories (cheating, death, break up etc) I would get so ridiculously upset like it had really happened to me. I cried for days and got even more depressed. I’ve gone to therapy for my (unrelated) depression, got on meds and after one year of lying in bed crying, I got back on my feet, got into university and pulled my shit together but I can’t get rid of this fucking obsession.

So here I am, a 21 year old woman in college who can’t get over a VIRTUAL couple like some 14 year old fangirl. And it still upsets me, I have literal break downs over some made up stories over characters who had a max of 45min screen time. I can’t kick it though, it still brings me a lot of happiness and content, sometimes I still cling to it for emotional support but it keeps upsetting me. I HAVE TO check their AO3 tag several times a day.

TL;DR: I have a totally embarrassing obsession with this one virtual couple from a Franchise. I’m completely infatuated with shipping them. This would all be fine but it has gotten out of hands and has brought me to the brink of insanity a few times. 

So how can I finally get rid of this? Every time I try, I go back to it several hours later? Is there any way to keep up with it but draw a harsher line between my own life and the virtual world?

I tried some apps to remind me to do some productive activities but I just don’t manage to do them. My best friend is making thousand bucks a month doing almost nothing and I’m just sitting here being envious and I feel so bad for it because we really appreciate each other. 

I don’t even take my meds (zoloft) because I don’t want to mix them with alcohol I take sometimes with my friends. That’s the only thing I enjoy which is fucking pathetic. I don’t study at home I don’t go to the gym I planned in my mind I don’t do nothing I’m just depressed. When I go to school I stop being depressed and start being fucking anxious as hell.

Can’t say the details as they’re too disturbing, but even after what he has done to me, i don’t have any feelings of hatred or anything like that. I feel uncomfortable around him and i don’t let him get close to my siblings but i don’t mind shaking his hand or having a small conversation with him.

668,"So for a little bit of background, I am a college student working part time at a library within my campus. (USA)

This job pays minimum wage, and seemed to be pretty laid back in terms of physical labor (due to a chronic disease I have, I cant work certain jobs that require much labor)

I was hired back in December and was scheduled to start working in february. They told me to come in for an “orientation” in january in which they would teach me basic skills for working at the front desk.

When I got to the orientation, it was some guy reading the “expectations” of the library workers and the computer program was down so we did not learn how to use the software. 
Flash forward to my start date, I got scheduled for a very slow shift (which I dont mind at all) and went in for two weeks, then my mother had a heart attack and had to undergo emergency surgery back in my hometown, so I immediately drove 8 hours back to stay with her and take care of my siblings (we dont have any other family)

Through this mess, I just didn’t think about this stupid minimum wage campus job, so I forgot to notify my supervisor that I wasn’t going to show up to sit at a desk for four hours on a sunday morning.

I was gone for a week, until I got a hold of a family member that could watch my siblings while I went back to school, because I had three exams within the same week.

I came back and my supervisor took away my shift, and told me that I was about to get fired for not coming in for that one shift. I explained to her my situation over email and she simply said I have to set up an appointment with her to discuss “employer expectations”. 

I have been working traded shifts for the past two weeks because I do need the money, thankfully these shifts are at a different library on campus.

Today I worked a 2 hour shift covering for a friend who had an interview, and my supervisor spotted me and loudly announced I still have to make an appointment with her in front of everyone, then proceeded to talk about me in third person right in front of me like: “SHE (me) is lacking a lot of customer service skills” 

I don’t understand why my supervisor is acting like I did something terribly wrong, I basically have to crawl back to them to get my shift back.

How would a professional handle this? Should I file a complaint with HR?

669,"Last night my coworker and roommate came up to me about something that happened last week. He was joking around with a coworker as per usual but I guess this coworker was having a bad day. He said that after kind of busting his balls(we work in a warehouse, this is common,) the guy said under his breath 'just wait until i bring my m16 in'.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend/coworker that said this to me basically was going to just put this out of his head. This incident happened on Thursday but told me about it Monday night. Once he brought it up I immediately told him this was a huge issue and warning sign and should absolutely not be ignored. 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, it was pretty harmless joking around, calling him a name that they have both joked about before. I guess this guy was having a bad day and got very defensive. It seemed that when he made the threat under his breath he didn't want anyone else to really hear it or maybe just my friend to hear it. So it's unlikely anyone else really heard it. However once my friend heard it he became somewhat distraught and loud saying 'what the fuck did you just say to me' and even immediately told another coworker that he happened to be doing some on the job training with that day about it. That guy made no big deal of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, I convince my friend to go to management today. I went with him because it was clear that it was effecting him emotionally and he wanted me there for support. We went in and told management and were then taken to HR. This is a pretty large company, about 5 locations worldwide so not enormous. I really dislike how HR and management responded to us bringing this to their attention.

&amp;#x200B;

For one they had no idea or set plan in place for dealing with this. This is strange to me considering you hear about a new active shooter once a week these days and my last company had an entire process and SOP built for this kind of situation. HR even asked my friend 'if he was apologetic, would this be someone you could continue working with?' fucking what? Are you fucking serious? The guy made a threat on my life and others? So HR did end up contacting the police about the matter. It really seemed like HR was standoffish with us, not sure if it's true, if he's making it up kind of thing. I understand this because of course you need evidence. However they're supposed to be human resources and they acted like robots.

&amp;#x200B;

They basically even told us that they were going to speak with the guy that made the threat today. Now my friend is reasonably worried about retaliation as the guy who made the threat will immediately know that the only one who heard him say it is my friend. What if them talking to him about it is what pushes this guy off the edge to do something crazy? They gave my friend the day off paid, they made me take a PTO day as I was also feeling extremely uncomfortable being there knowing they were going to confront him about this once they spoke to anyone who could have heard him and gathered all of the evidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is should we have said nothing? It seems like they would have much rather us said nothing and kept our head down. I feel as though if I'm in HR I'd be grateful that someone had the courage to bring this to my attention and potentially helped me prevent an active shooter situation? Is there anything more we should be doing? They said they'd call my friend once they've figured it out but we are fully expected to be back at work tomorrow. If they do nothing and he's there and knows that my friend tried to get him fired or worse arrested for making a threat like that I just wonder how he'll react to my friend.

I avoid opening my mouth because the pungency can even be tasted in the air! I can’t just ignore it, and I know that he has access to running water, it’s just that he avoids showers or something like that. His little brother smells just fine. I’m not just gonna walk up to him and say “Hey dude, you smell like ass. Take a shower.” Is there a way to tell him without him knowing who it was?

672,"I am 17 years old and I am a junior in high school. I've known this girl for about 5 years and she is in our inner friend circle. About a week ago maybe a little more she invited me to her house and one of my other friends (male who I've known longer) to hangout. We played a few games then went on to watch a movie called ""the dictator"" (hilarious btw) as we were sitting on the couch she started to inch toward me and started to cuddle with me. That's where it hit off, I asked her out she was very excited and said yes. 

So this girl has had a previous relationship before where the guy would emotionally abuse her and be mad at her constantly, everyone she knew said to leave him but she was very stubborn and didn't for a long time. She is now very insecure about herself due to that relationship and thinks no one can like her anymore.

The relationship started really well but starting yesterday she's been acting very weirdly. And today I saw on her snap story she started to talk to that guy that hurt her again. I asked if anything was wrong but she didn't want to talk about it. Then I offered to walk home with her but she said her dad was gonna give her a ride... her dad works till 3:30 and we get out of school at 2:00. She ended up walking home alone.

I told her since he didn't come I would've been fine coming back to walk with her because she seemed very down but she said she was fine and needed time to herself. 

Also during lunch she was talking to that guy and being touchy feely which is what I heard. I've told her if she ever feels uncomfortable or anything is bother her to tell me, even if it's about me I don't want her feeling trapped in this relationship.

Final thing. Today we were supposed to have our first date by going out to eat then ice skating but yesterday said her family wouldn't let her so she invited me over but forgot today is her nephews birthday so she completely cancelled. That's not really bothering me because it seemed like an honest mistake but idk if maybe u guys can get more info through that.

Sorry for the long story I've known this girl for 5 years and I've never seen her act this way.

675,"My abusive ex and I have been divorced a year and a half, and split up for 10 months today.

I have a 5 year restraining order that was granted sometime around the divorce.

My ex broke it and weaseled his way back into my dumbass life, but last April I'd had enough.

He threatened to kill the baby, me and himself when I added a male on Facebook,

so I noped the hell out of there with careful planning.

Ever since then he's posted nasty shit about me online 

(revenge porn threats, slamming my **beautiful** appearance, calling me a psycho, making fun of me, etc.) 

When it was first happening, it bothered me a ton, and my attorney filed to modify the restraining order to include no online harassment. The hearing kept getting delayed and 7 months passed,

and thanks to therapy and no contact, I stopped caring what he had to say.

I thought court today would be saying hi/bye to the judge and ending this mess.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex showed up though, with a thick packet of god knows what to try and smear me.

He has photoshopped evidence in the past (don't look at me like I'm crazy because I know I sound it.)

My attorney advised we drop the modification, as I was shaking, and she knew my abuser would get off on this all. I agreed. 

My attorney did so, and came out of the court room and we spoke for roughly an hour.

When we went to leave the courthouse, my ex walked past and had a ton of papers in his hands.

He was leaving the self-help center. I am assuming he is attempting to try and file for custody,

there's really no other reason for him to be in there.

My lawyer is honest and thinks he could manage to get supervised.

He should not be around his daughter. He is a massive threat to her.

I'm not going to sit here and explain the things he did and didn't do to her, 

but this monster will destroy her as revenge to me not staying with him,

or I will be framed for the 3rd+ time. 

&amp;#x200B;

My lawyer is advising I get the hell out of here.

Somewhere he can't commute easily to. He does not drive. 

She says if I'm gone 6 months, he would need to locate me and move to wherever I'm at to attempt to get any custody.  I don't want to move. I have a great job and great daycare, and my very, very small support circle is here. That being said, it's expensive as hell, (Southern California) and I'm not sure it's even worth it to stay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note\* When my attorney and I parted ways in the parking structure, my attorney watched as my ex apparently tried to follow me. Since he doesn't drive and ubers don't wait in parking lots, we all know he was coming to try and harass me. My attorney called to warn me, but I was already exiting the parking structure, which is odd for me, as I usaully sit in my car awhile before driving off. I found this incredibly creepy, I don't get why he is still so obsessed.

&amp;#x200B;

After the hearing, I called child support services and dismissed them.

Since my ex was having his wages garnished, he bragged that he's entitled to future custody.

I know my ex will not voluntarily submit payments, so I'm hoping to lessen the attraction.

&amp;#x200B;

I just need all this shit to finally stop, *now.*

Does anyone have any advice? If I moved, where could I go? How could I pull it off?

  I go in, relatively nice place, the owner sits everyone down upstairs (There were several people, so it struck me as a competitive position) while he gets his office set up downstairs.

  The place was nice, but something just tipped me off. Idk if I was annoyed buy the commute, but something in my gut is just telling me to call them and politely refuse.

  It's a good position with steady hours, and I'm still in the process of job hunting, but I can't shake this feeling about this place. Like maybe it's the owners but something is unnerving me about the whole ordeal.

677,"was laying in bed the other night around 2 AM and I started thinking about this memory I had with this girl.

​

It was one of those relationships where we were basically dating but unspoken. We hung out every day and talked all night and were very close.

​

We went camping together with a group and everyone else fell asleep and we laid on the side of a river and looking up at the stars. We weren’t cuddling exactly but our arms were interlocked.

​

Anywho, needless to say I loved this girl. I was head over heels. Sadly we just kind of faded apart about a year later and she dated 
someone else.


I’m not the best with being social but i really felt comfortable with this girl. I realized while thinking about that and being in love that I don’t remember what it feels like. It’s like I can almost feel it and remember it but it’s just out of reach. Like i was trying to remember a dream i had but just cant grasp.

683,"Hey so I just want to here some other opinions on my situation. I currently work at a Hotel in Food and Beverage. I got this job out of college and it is a training program where I get moved around every 6 months to a new property. 

I am about to make my third rotation in April, back to the original hotel were I began my time with the company. 

So I pretty much hate my job and down here I have a manager who is so incredibly lazy she will take 4 hour shifts and leave. Then makes the schedule so she can work a double and complain how she has to work the double even though she scheduled herself to do it. She doesn't help and has many hourly staff contemplating quitting as well as the other trainees. The hotel i servery understaffed causing a good deal of extra work for me. 

Trainees are Salary exempt so I make half of my hourly rate for any overtime I work plus I only get vacation days after 1 year, and even then I get 3 vacation days until my third year were I get 7. This company does not care for its workers and my manager makes it even harder, especially when I hear her talking shit about how others do their work. 

So I guess what I am asking is do you think I should quit? I want to but always have found this kind of decision is best to make when hearing others opinions. The only reason I would stay with this company for a few months longer is I get a good $2500 bonus when I go back to my original hotel, which is run very well and is a high end place, but the work is incredibly stressful. I guess it boils down to is the extra $2500 worth doing this a little longer. 

I have back up plans and my parents are very supportive of the decisions I make so it is not like I would be homeless until I figure myself out. I also have saved up a decent amount to live off of while I sort my career out. 

So if anyone wants to share their 2 cents about my situation feel free and thank you I really appreciate any responses and if you have any questions let me know. ",26Feb2019,1
684,"Before I even start, I don't exclusively want to hear from members of r/pornfree and r/NoFap as I want advice for different people.  


Some background info: I started seeking pornographic images at age 9 or 10, and I am 23 now and still haven't given up PMO (""Porn/Masturbation/Orgasm"" for those unfamiliar with the term) for more then 5 days since age 11 (or whenever I hit puberty). I am also (for lack of better words) a ""hard atheist"", meaning I am not open to the idea of ""finding God"" (so please don't spit bible verses at me) though I am not too intolerant of people who do believe. My sex is male, and I have Bipolar disorder (Type 2 I think), which I take medication for. Also, at this point in my life, I have no interest in getting a girlfriend. I also have only have full blown, penetrative sex, once, when I was 15

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, on and off, I have thought about NoFapping (not masturbating) for 90 days to reboot my brain and then I would be Pornfree (not look at porn) for the rest of my life (I assume), though after those 90 days I could masturbate, since I feel that it is physically healthy to masturbate.  


The reasons for doing NoFap: I feel like I have hurt a lot of people, including people I am very close to, due to my porn addiction/sexual addiction. I used to give unwanted sexual attention to a lot of people (especially females) in an attempt to get laid, though I don't completely know why I did some of the things I did, part of the time. I feel like I've developed unnatural fetishes due to my use of pornography and sexual addiction. I've also masturbated and looked at porn in public places. I used to send nudes to a lot of people (especially females), without fully considering whether they would want to see them a lot, and I used to take a lot of sexually explicit nude photos to send them to people through text or internet, even at one point making a solo sextape, which hopefully no one has seen. I also still fantasize about teachers from middle school. I also feel what I just described in this paragraph is just the tip of the iceberg.  


The reasons for NOT doing NoFap: I have realized what I have done in the past because of my sexual addiction is wrong and I try my best not to repeat the past, though I don't know if that is all too possible. I also feel like I don't have much reason to give up porn at this point in my life, because I live with my parents, and I am looking for my first job (I know it's a weird thing to be 23 and never have a job in your life, but bare with me), which is difficult due to a series of minor mental and physical disabilities I have. I sorta feel like, that at this point in my life, there is not much to do in terms of my sex life, then to look at porn and masturbate, since I have no interest in getting a romantic/sexual partner until I leave to live on my own. Porn also helps me explore my sexuality, which I feel like I couldn't do without it.  


So I'm at the crossroads, I want to give up porn, but I am not sure I am ready to do so or if it's even the ""right"" thing to do.

Manager combs through our bookings for the day, works out how many prepays the clients have left, and then tells us that we need to basically force them to buy more. If they have enough prepays that they don't need to worry about them, we're supposed to upsell. Which is fine if they're interested in other treatments, but if they don't say anything after the usual prompt questions (is there anything else you're interested in getting done, any other hair/skin issues etc) we're supposed to point out an area that we think needs work (like pigmentation/freckles/scars/stretchmarks/hair on another visible area) and basically tell them that they NEED this treatment to fix it. Now, maybe I'm just too polite, but something fucks me off about essentially pointing out a flaw and telling them that they need to fix it. Regardless of cost. I feel like there's a difference between upselling and browbeating a client into buying something for the sake of buying something. 

Literally last week we had two clients (mother and daughter) who were on their last prepays, so the manager had dollar signs in his eyes hoping they'd buy more. But they're moving house, and therefore don't want to spend any money right now on cosmetic treatments. I got an earful from the manager the day after because I couldn't convince them to buy more prepays. He also called three times throughout that day, speaking to a different therapist each time, asking how much money we had made, who took the money, and from which client. He's unreasonably excited by the fact that we've made somewhere around 7k that day. 

Aside from this is the targets. Now, I've hit my personal target more often than I haven't. The months I haven't have either been when I was starting out or when it's a slow month, and barely any of us have made our targets. Yet every month the manager sits each of us down in private and informs us that we're not doing as well as we should, we need to do better for the benefit of everyone. He's told me that my target isn't as high as it should be, but he hasn't raised it because I've made it clear that I'm comfortable with my current target, and as much as he doesn't want me to be stressed/uncomfortable, he thinks I should be doing more. Bear in mind that my monthly target is high in the 4digit mark. He wants it to be 5. I've never made less than 4digits, even when I don't make my target. When I don't make my target, I never fall more than a couple hundred short. The other therapists are the same. None of them have targets lower than the high 4digits, some of them are on more because the expectations for them are shocking. 

Now, my main gripe with this is that we don't get a commission. We get a cash bonus of 150 if we make our commission, 100 if we don't. Regardless of how much we make. I'm aware that this is nothing to be sneezed at, and it's better than nothing, but it's also the first job I've worked in my field that doesn't have a formal commission for everything we sell. Even a low commission of 3-5% would earn me 2-300 more than what I'm getting every month. If my colleagues with higher targets made a formal commission, they'd be getting an extra 1000 or more. We all bend over backwards to sell treatments and products for 150 extra a month. Now, call me ungrateful, but this seems unfair. Especially for the therapist who is expected to make 20k per month for a measly 150 reward. 

And this is aside from the constant nagging over how much we're making. 

On to my other issues. They seem to be hellbent on turning the therapists against each other. Especially the new girls. They will talk to a new girl privately and tell her that so-and-so has been saying negative things about how they work, for no real reason. This backfired horrendously when one girl, the kind who prefers to face things head on and get to the root of a problem, calmly spoke to the senior therapists who had supposedly said things about her, and the two of them were totally blindsided, having never said anything about her standard of work and having found her to be overall a good, confident therapist. She's not the first person they've done this to either, since they did it to me when I started too, and I think it's safe to assume they've done it to everyone. 

They're also in the habit of bitching about every single one of us behind our backs. They'll say things about our standard of work, our personalities, our private lives... I've seen it first hand, when one of my colleagues has some mental health issues, and they spent several days complaining about it. They still have her time off to deal with her mental health and get herself back into a good frame of mind for work, but they bitched about it in front of me, which I was really uncomfortable with and found really unprofessional. One of my other colleagues made the mistake of admitting that she's trying for a baby, and I heard recently that they've been constantly asking her whether she's pregnant yet. Now, if it were me, I'd be telling them that the contents of my uterus are none of their business, and I'd be rather upset at having to constantly tell them no if I was actively trying. 

Another thing they like to do is try to use one senior therapist as their bearer of bad news if they want one of the juniors to do something. Senior therapist is told to boss the juniors around, give them orders, tell them everything they're doing wrong, the whole nine yards. Now, senior therapist is having none of this, and has already made it clear to all other therapists that she is not a manager and therefore won't be behaving like one. If the managers want something done, they'll tell us themselves, because senior therapist does not get paid enough to be the bad guy. She's counting down the days until she goes on maternity leave in may. 

My next problem is with our wages. We make about 1.50 more than minimum wage, which typically I would be fine with, given the fact that in my last long term job (a spa) I was getting minimum wage, and it suited my needs just fine at the time. I was living with my mother and I lived close enough to walk to work, so my expenses were a lot lower even with giving my mam some money every week to help with household expenses. My problem with my current wage is the fact that it's technically not enough to live on in the city I'm in, and I'm acutely aware of the fact that I'm in a foreign country on my own, still sending money home to my mother (which is a different story altogether) and I have to travel to get to work. We all get the same wage regardless of how long we've been here, and I found out yesterday that I'd get a better wage (at least 5 more per hour) if I worked in a different clinic. I also found out that our wage isn't even as high as my friend who spends her time handing out flyers and vouchers on the street for a certain food delivery company. Maybe it's just me, and I think I'm about to make myself sound like an insufferable snob here, but I feel like there's something weird about the fact that I would get better wages handing out flyers/vouchers to strangers on the street than I do working in my field in a job that requires intensive training, qualifications and the use of expensive machinery. It's not like the clinic is doing badly, there are several branches of this company across the country, they're thinking of opening another, manager has his finger in at least one other business venture, therapists are constantly bringing in money, and we're fully booked more often than we're not. I might just be frustrated with the work environment already, but I feel like the wages could be higher for the work that we do and the money we bring in every month. 

Next up, we have to go back to the managers issues with money. I understand that running two branches of the clinic full time is hard work, and there are a lot of expenses (rent, electricity, maintenance etc) but he cuts corners as much as humanly possible. He doesn't want us using our mild topical anaesthetic cream as often during our more painful treatments purely because the cream itself is expensive. There are other reasons why using a numbing cream isn't the best of ideas (it deadens the nerves so treatment isn't as effective) but a lot of our clients need this cream in order to get through the pain of having it done, so we can't technically do away with it altogether. He rarely brings in necessary components for the machines, making us reuse old pieces that are technically supposed to be single use. When certain tubes stopped doing their job in our cooling machines, he fed us a story about how they're German machines and therefore don't break down. It took us three months to convince him that the machines aren't working as they should. And instead of replacing the required parts with the company that makes them, he brought in a technician who did a patch job on the tubes and put them back on the machines, meaning they're still not at 100%, but working relatively better than before. Whenever we have any issues with the machines we still get the excuse of it being a German machine and they're so good they don't break down. 

My last issue is with my contract. It states in my contract that I can't work for another clinic while I'm on contract with this company, which I'm fine with, but... The contract also states that I can't work in another clinic for at least three months after I terminate my contract with my current company. I can work in other areas of the field I'm qualified in (beauty therapy) but not in another laser clinic. I signed it with a certain amount of discomfort, wondering if I should be agreeing to something like that, but now that it comes to limiting my job opportunities should I choose to leave, I'm wondering if I should have contested this when I started. 

Now, having said all this, I enjoy the work itself. I like my colleagues. My clients are, for the most part, good people. When the manager isn't here, it's a great place to work. I just can't help but wonder if it's normal to go home feeling completely wrung out from having to listen to the manager all day. I've been comparing it to my boyfriend recently. When he comes home after work, despite his late shifts 6days a week, he's still energized, wants to socialize and unwind with friends at the end of the day, and enjoy his time off. I, on the other hand, despite only working 4days a week, do not want to even look at other human beings after work. I want to curl up in bed and watch netflix/youtube and avoid having to deal with people. I'm just... Tired. All the time. 

I can't tell if this is a legit problem and I need to start looking for another job or if I'm just being crazy and ungrateful. So I'm yodelling into the void that is the internet, hoping for some sensible advice. Even if that advice is ""suck it up and stop being such a goddamned baby""

*TL;DR:* manager is constantly berating us about money we're making, wages are blah, no commission, manager is actively trying to pit the therapists against each other, want one of the therapists to be the scapegoat, constant bitching about the employees, cuts corners on certain elements that need maintenance, squicky contract. Dunno if enjoying the work itself is worth staying for despite the issues. ",26Feb2019,1

697,"Sorry for how long this is. I’m currently (21F) and looking to go back to the school in the fall after some serious life events - right now, my main goals are to save money and go back to school. 

Currently I’m working as a barista at a pretty big coffee chain for about 1.5 years. I love being a barista, I love making coffee and talking to customers - and I’m *really* good at what I do. The issue is I have a horrible manager. I understand that you’re not always going to like your boss, but this is by far the most inappropriate work environment I’ve ever been in. 

One of my co-workers is a lesbian, who cares right? Well my boss takes ANY opportunity to make a homosexual joke at her expense (in her mind she thinks this is funny and that we all should as well) and everyone kind of nervously laughs along cause otherwise she gets angry if you don’t laugh at her joke. 

A few months after I got hired I came to work with a very small hickey. Unprofessional on my part, I know. I tried to cover it with makeup and it was mostly ok but I guess throughout the day the makeup rubbed off. My boss has continued since then to make jokes calling me a “whore” or a “slut”. Anytime she can make a joke insinuating this she does. 

She verbally abuses people constantly. Everyday everyone is walking on eggshells as to not upset her. If it gets busy, she’s angry. If someone doesn’t magically read her mind for something she wants, she’s angry. She never communicates what’s wrong she just begins a barrage of insults. Basically think a much more angry and hostile Michael Scott. 

Example: a coworker forgot to push a button in drive thru that gets rid of old orders that have already been finished. Manager says “I’m going to fucking kill you” in a super aggressive manner while also on the speaker outside as a customer was waiting to have their order taken. 

My manager has promised since last June that I’d be promoted to shift supervisor soon, as I really need the raise to really save for school in the fall. She has been stringing me along ever since. I finally as last month finished the computer training after much insistence on my part, and after badgering her some more she printed out more reading materials for me that I was supposed to go over before actual training. Well, I’ve read all the material and no training has commenced. 

Every night before work I become horribly anxious as I just hate my job so much. I was holding onto the raise but I no longer see that as an option. Ive applied today to 3 places and have heard a response from 2. Tomorrow I have an interview at a small local cafe as a barista and was have been emailing back and forth  with another employer after initially applying online for a dog kennel (my passion is animals and the job description listed that they help you get careers and certification in that field).  The cafe place sounds like a sure thing, but I’m not sure about the kennel. 

The advice I’m seeking is what to say to my boss? I feel as if she’s going to take this extremely personal, as I’m technically in the process for becoming shift although nothing is really happening. I’m also scared of the backlash and the inevitable hell of my 2 weeks.

703," Hi everyone. I have been friends with this particular individual for about two years now, and need some advice. I am a full time college student and have a good part time job as well as this, which pays pretty well. I run my own car, and although expensive, my job was always more than enough to cover this and my other outgoings- until I met my friend. She is 20,and has dropped out of college twice now, but refuses to get a job and instead relies on me and her girlfriend to bankroll her. She is a heavy cannabis user, and got me into smoking occasionally too, although I do not do it as regularly as she does. It’s got to the point where every single time we hang out together, she expects me to pay for everything- fuel to drive out to pick her up, food, cigarettes, and of course weed. I didn’t mind so much in the summer when I was working full time at my job, as I could afford it and I thought, ‘hey, she’s a good friend. Why shouldn’t I pay for things from time to time’. She didn’t take advantage as much then, but lately I have noticed things going missing. Cigarettes, food, spare change, weed etc. It is bad enough that she doesn’t pay her way, but I am really struggling to believe that she is stealing from me. I don’t know what to do. I have offered to help her apply for jobs, offered to take her to drug dependency meetings (as I know she abuses harder drugs as well as cannabis), and even tried to teach her to drive so she can have more independence. Lately I feel our friendship is coming under pressure due to these factors, and I am not sure what is the best course of action to take. If I confront her, I risk our friendship, but if I don't say anything, she will just keep on the way she is. ",26Feb2019,1

707,"So I’m in a online introductory managment class, I’m a 5th year graduate (4years undergrad, 2 years grad overlap 4th year) and it’s my last semester. This class has been driving me crazy. I work part time as a product Manager about 25-30 hours a week and I’m taking 4 classes. 

My professor has been assigning copious amounts of busy work a week anywhere between 1 and 8 assignments, and we have a group project (40 hour)  that will take all semester (pretty standard stuff and what I signed up for) however, today he emailed the class saying to sign up for a second group project, this second group project is another 40 hour project that is with a third party international business thing which will assign me a group of 6-7 additional members all of which will be from different countries, and will have weekly deadlines and focuses around making a business plan for an international company. 

I would be really happy with this project if it wasn’t the second for this class (both projects are occurring simultaneously) so it’s 80 hours of group projects (assuming “in class” work only) and I’m very overwhelmed.

This is on top of 2 other group projects from 2 other classes, along with my one other R class that has me writing algorithms every week. Not to mention my work outside school. 

I emailed the professor asking for advice on what his expectations are on the amount of time that is needed to be allocated to each of these projects a week along with our weekly assignment. 

Instead of answering my question he described the two projects to me, told me I could “write a thousands of words research paper where you have to work closely with the librarians” instead of doing one of the projects and then signed off saying “I come from the past where college courses are rigorous”

710,"So I’m just going to give a little backstory on myself. I’m 14, in 8th grade, a girl, and a virgin. In 6th grade, it was a “trend” or “phase” to be bi, gay, lesbian, etc. I didn’t really think about it until then, I had only liked guys. I started thinking about bisexuality and stuff at the end of 6th grade, and I started to become attracted to girls. I didn’t like just ONE girl, I was attracted to them all. In 7th grade, I reconsidered and declared I was straight. I know, you can’t just change your sexual orientation like that, but I was confused at the time. Recently, I became close with a girl on a field trip. (This was in 8th) I had known her since 7th, but on that field trip, I looked at her, and I kept thinking about how I would be OK with dating her, even though I was supposedly “straight”. I would look at her lips and think about kissing her. Sooner or later I had developed a crush on her. I know it wasn’t just me being fond of her in a friend-like way, because I felt the same way I did with guys I like. I’m aware of sex, and I have sexual feelings, as I am 14. I felt the same sexual feelings with her that I did with previous guy crushes. I soon declared myself bisexual and ran after her everywhere. I liked her so much. Then, I found out she was in love with some boy. Whatever. I still like her, even knowing I will never have a chance with her. (She’s straight I’m sure). But right now, it’s not like in 6th grade. I see girls and I don’t feel any physical/sexual attraction to them. Just her. When a guy, just any guy, not even one I like, touches me (like hands brush or something) I feel really nervous and stuff, because I get nervous around guys, but when a girl touches me nothing. Just her. If she (my crush) touches me I get all jittery inside and I feel like happiness in my heart. If I see a hot girl, I don’t think anything. If I see a hot guy, I get all nervous and stuff. She is one of my close friends. I trust her and she trusts me. Am I demisexual with just girls?

718,"This will be long, so please hang in there - any advice I get is greatly appreciated. I'm going to break it down into individual parts for ease of reading. Skip to end for the question and TLDR if you don't want to read.

&amp;#x200B;

So I recently made a large life decision to move across country on promises my sister made me about a job with the company she works for. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, my degree. (Not very relevant to story, but including it)

I finished college for an AAS in HSE in August. There has been an on-going issue with that in which the college did not honor a social sciences credit and an english credit that I was told upon transferring would be substitutes in their degree requirements. They decided not to tell me that something changed with their administration and upon applying for graduation, I was denied for this reason. They aren't budging on it but I'm still fighting them. At this rate, I may as well cut my losses and wait to go back for my BS, since I have the certifications from that degree plan and that's most of what jobs care for. So this aspect doesn't necessarily bother me, but could prove relevant in possible employment.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, my sister.

She told me when a position opened in her company in AK. At this point I had just moved back to Houston, my home city, from my college town. I had a full time job with a 'meh' company. I wasn't happy, had strained relationships with my family, and my job was full of nepotism and shitty management. So when she said that there was a position in which I'd have better pay and could be with her and my brother in law (we had always gotten along better than my near family), of course I immediately sent a resume and hoped for the best. Well, the position had been filled pretty fast by someone her boss knew, so I was bummed. She then, however, proceeded to GUARANTEE me that there were others and her boss loved her, so she'd find me something. At this point, I had been awakened to the fact that I was fairly discontent with where I was and this would be a good change of pace. She and I talked and cemented that I'd be moving up there around the beginning of this year. I'm currently staying with her and help and stuff around the house while unemployed, but once I'm employed I'll pay a portion of bills.

So when things began to cement with me moving, curiosity killed the cat and I began to wonder if there would be a decent shot at me finding companionship up there. I (22M) am gay, so it's not always the easiest thing to find good guys, especially in red states. So I hopped on a few social media sites and was honestly expecting nothing. To be fair, I had gotten out of a shit relationship in college around the turn of 2017-2018 and was enjoying being single, so I was fairly hesitant to consider another one, but it had been about 9 months at this point and I wasn't opposed to the idea. After a couple weeks I messaged this one guy (27M) and we hit it off fairly well. Again, I had defenses up and was hesitant, so at first I wasn't the best communicator via apps, but after a week of me doing that and this guy making leaps and bounds to communicate with me regardless, we exchanged numbers and things were amazing. This began mid-October and we talked every day, discorded, played games, and were just great friends with a very obvious romantic interest with each other. After about a month of this we basically agreed to be exclusive until I got up there, and come to find out that both of us had been doing so before discussing it, just out of hope that things would work :) Things with this man have always been immaculate. While I won't say he's the reason for my move, which is what a lot of family members are unfairly pinning on me since they saw my excitement increase (even tho my plans to move were made before he was in the picture), I will say he settled me into the idea since I felt that the possibility of love and companionship wouldn't be lacking from my life up there. One issue with us is that I'm staying with my sister about 3 hours away from where he is.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, and last, the move and present day:

After the planning since September, talking to my now BF since October, and getting my ducks in a row to leave state, I finally began my trip in January. I had to drive a lot and then fly, but I eventually arrived in my new state about a week later. I stayed with my bf for the first several days while I waited for my car to arrive. Things are amazing with us. His friends and family adore me, him and I are great together and the creeping feeling in the back of my head all those nights we stayed up to talk and play games came to fruition and I realized after a few weekends of spending time with him that I genuinely love this man.  I was honest about that and the feeling is definitely returned. Things are easy with us, in a good way. My sister and I, however, have been clashing a lot. Everything she promised me would work out for employment did not. I was initially cautious and applied places while making my move just to be safe, and when a decently paying one for a medical office popped up SHE TOLD ME TO DECLINE SINCE SHE WAS SO SURE SHED GET ME A JOB. Well, that all failed and now I've been applying everywhere and my only bite is a grocery store. Which I don't mind for the time being. After a month of me scrambling to find something she asked her coworker for help and he's offered to let me network with him and work at his business for the time being. I don't know the pay or the hours he's expecting and won't until Wednesday. She who was initially so sure she'd work something out that she had me decline an option, has been constantly bulldogging me to apply places - which I have already been doing on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, the dilemma:

With the background out of the way, here's the advice I need. My sister is pushing me to throw out my relationship because it is ""new"" and solely prioritize a career - sadly my other sister back home agrees with this so I don't have much in the line of support. As of right now, I've been offered a full time position at a grocery store that would be Monday through Friday and still give me time on weekends to see my bf, or should I have to work a weekend (the nature of retail being as it is) my bf can come down and see me a weekend. I also have the networking and part time offer from her coworker, which I want to take but I'd like to take it on the basis of M-F before my shift at the grocery store and, if he needs the help on weekends, some weekends. I'm not being steadfast that I want ALL weekends off, but I'd like a healthy mix so that I can have the steady employment, the part time networking, and my relationship. Am I asking too much for this? My boyfriend has expressed continual support, comforting me in the fact that any undesirable schedules should only be temporary at worst, and he will never hold it against me if we can't see each other for employment issues. However we both acknowledge there would be a fair amount of stress on the relationship the longer it persists. My sister, on the other hand, isn't budging on the fact that even after I'm being malleable with a lot of the time, I'm still being too ""picky"", and ""beggars can't be choosers"". I mean, she's not wrong, but  she's half the reason I'm in this position. Had what she promised worked out, I'd have a M-F desk job anyhow. Plus I found a sustainable gig for a temporary job that would still allow me weekends - so I fail to see how I'm fucking up here? I know the kind of person I am, and I know how much I value this relationship right now. If I'm forced to choose I will choose him, but I don't want to choose. How do I get my sister off my back?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I moved across country because sister promised me job, met a guy in the meantime. Job didn't work out, guy did. Shit is getting tense between my sister because I'm being pushed into a corner of choosing between relationship or unending job search. I don't want to choose, but I know what my choice is - how do I settle shit down and keep my relationship?",26Feb2019,1

723,"Hi reddit

So for some context about a year ago me and my family found a dog(german shepherd mix)  by the highway and decided to take it home. It was all good until a angry neighbour came knocking on our door , apperenantley our dog has jumping over our fence and stealing chickens (we live in a village) from him , we gave him a bit of money to avoid trouble and moved on , he came back a few days later having literally caught our dog killing his chickens ,this continues for a long time until we decide to keep our dog inside the house at all times (except when we were going for a walk of course). The problem with this is that nobody in the house can sleep since she keeps making noise and waking everyone up. As time passed things got worse we couldn't even call her back durning walks she would keep running away to the neighbours house and pissing him off.Its gotten to a point where we are so afraid of her doing something that we dont let her off the leash at all or let her outside without someone paying attention to what shes doing.The more she stays with us the bigger the damage she makes , we cant really keep paying the neighbour so he doesn't sue us or something.We wanted to try to train her but given the area we live in there is nobody that trains dogs close to us.My mom also had a friend who trained dogs , we tried doing things the way she told us but nothing was changing.The cute dog we rescued has become a constant fear and a big expense.I really don't want to simply give her to someone, but im simply out of ideas what to do

tl:dr We rescue a dog,dog ends up making a ton of expenses(raising fence,paying neighbour,paying for training and more)

So basically i need help with what to do now the only way i see this situation resolving is by us somehow getting rid of the dog which i would like to avoid.

I have admitted that I did what I did to everyone (including the school, hence losing my jobs).

734,"A few weeks ago, I overheard two colleagues, both women, in a discussion about an exceptionally public young woman affiliated with our organization who had posted a racy photo online. Basically, not to put too fine a point on it, they were slut-shaming her. I called them both out from across the hall, but only the other took the time to hash it out, and we basically agreed to disagree. This other coworker though has seen fit to ignore me altogether since then ... telling her subordinate that I had ""yelled at her"" and the other colleague (my supervisor) had done nothing.

I yelled \*\*to\*\* her and the colleague across the hall; and the other colleague and I had a quarter-hour debate over it. Weeks ago. This is certainly not the only area of contention between us, but jeez!

We had actually been incredibly good friends when she started working here (Like I had been to her house a few times and our kids played together). I'd cover her breaks; we'd chat on slow afternoons; we'd grind whatever axe there was to grind ... like genuine work buddies.

When she started a new role, I was definitely frustrated by the way she was handling it and I probably didn't handle that the best, but I thought we had more or less worked it out as there is plenty of real work to fuss with and actual internal struggles to deal with too (rather than petty office politics bullshit). I mean we were on good terms the nearest I could tell until she got a subordinate of her own very recently.

Since then, she has been incredibly unfair and unkind to her subordinate (in a way that half the office can hear her) and has a penchant for diminishing contributions of colleagues relative to her own while throwing coworkers, especially those that have left the organization and those who aren't around at the time, ""under the bus."" (also in a way half the office can hear her).

Just a mean girl. Like a total transformation. Went from favorite coworker to bully boss just like that.

I know she runs me down to the person she supervises because the person she supervises told me: things that are exceptionally unkind and prejudicial like saying ""He doesn't do anything around here anyway"" or ""Eww. I don't want to go to lunch with \*him\*."" I mean just really petty unkindness.

Normally, I wouldn't care if I had offended a single coworker like that,  but I thought she was a friend, and recently there has been a huge influx of new leadership and staff, and she can be found regularly ingratiating herself to both. She's gone so far as to inject herself into key projects completely outside of her role ... ever ""helpful"" ... HR needs some help for this compensation study, for instance, or acquainting new executives with the office, or whatever personal errand the CEO may have.

She is my subordinate by title, but is much closer to some key higher ups, and I wonder if she is treating me like crap because she found out she actually earns more than I do (and disrespects me) or maybe a lot less (and despises me for that)? Her lifestyle suggests she gets paid more than I do.

Like, the slut shaming thing couldn't possibly have resulted in this much blow-back, but I don't know exactly what else is going on.

In the last year or two, most of my favorite colleagues have left, and this lady is kind of undermining working relationships with their replacements. I'd call it poisoning the well, but it's more like just making me persona non grata ... I really don't want to blow this out of proportion. I know her subordinate has already gone to HR about her behavior, and I don't want anyone fired. 

I know the answer is ""Talk to her."" But  ... like ... how? We sat together at a work function with assigned seating right next to each other for over an hour, and I think she may have said three words to me. I don't think I owe her any apology (I had made a point to make amends after the kerfuffle around my frustration with her new role), but she certainly owes me an apology.

How do I approach this without rolling over for a bully or calling out a one-time friend to corporate?

735,"Alright my dad is a real fucking deadbeat, and I already have no respect for him. But today he sent me over the edge and I don’t know whether I can keep my relationship with him anymore.

My dads side of the family is catholic, and I was brought up catholic. I got confirmed last year, and I finally got the courage to say I’m done with this bullshit a week ago and left the church. I mainly went through with getting confirmed out of pressure from both sides of my family (my moms family is Jewish), and even in middle school RE (which cost $2k a year, mind you), I caught onto the holes in the logic and outright lies they taught us. Whenever I questioned in that class I got scolded and I didn’t say anything to my parents because I didn’t want to sound like a brat who didn’t want to take time out of his weekend to go to RE. 

I want to eventually make the conversion to Judaism as it’s part of my heritage and it aligns way more with what I value than Catholicism and Christianity in general does. 

My mom knew of my interest in converting since a few months ago. She initially stated she wanted me to be catholic because my dads side of the family was much more religious than hers was. They were the one Jewish family with a Christmas tree in their house when she was growing up! But she doesn’t care as long as I’m sticking to my morals and what I value. 

My dad on the other hand. 

Wow.

We both agree on the fact that people shouldn’t get offended over stuff that is hard to hear. We’re both conservative and laugh at liberals who can’t take views from the other side. I informed him of my decision to leave the church and he obviously wanted to know why. I explained to him my grievances with the religion and that Judaism is more aligned with what I value. A big part of why I can’t be a catholic is the fact that you’re not playing to win, you’re playing not to lose. You’re playing to avoid hell, not because you want to do good for others and your community necessarily. You can hide behind a priest and pray rather than actually go to the person you wronged and make it right. You lean on God for strength, not because you have the inner fortitude to do whatever you want to do. I can’t accept that. 


This is where it gets problematic. He says that Jews just want more and more and more for themselves, and he says that they’re white and they can’t act like they struggle like minorities because they are simply not. I ask him what he thinks the holocaust was and he says that he thinks it’s problematic and fishy that over 12 years they couldn’t see what the Nazis were doing. I tell him to think about all those who didn’t have the means to leave the country and those who got exposed as Protestant converts and his face is beet red. 

He then says that I just made the same generalization about Catholics after I say to stop being anti-Semitic. That Catholics aren’t good people, and never have pure motives. I see where he’s coming from, but I was innately hurt by his remarks about the holocaust and that Jews want more and more for themselves. 

Am I overreacting? I don’t want to tell my mom or my grandma because they will give him hell for it and I agree that if I’m overreacting I don’t want to turn my back on my morals and act offended over something that was hard to hear tbh.


Edit: also worth noting he said that no matter what religion you are, people hide behind it because it gives them a false sense of belonging, purpose, and belief that the grass is greener on the other side (concerning the afterlife). He also said that whatever extreme you take religious doctrine too is bad, like the evangelists or jihadists or the flag-burning Orthodox Jews. ",26Feb2019,1
736,"So I rent a room in a house with two guys. I’m a female. I share a bathroom with one of the guys and the other lives on the other side of the house. 

I had an awesome roommate for the first few months, but he moved out in November and a new roommate moved in. Let’s call him Joe. Joe and I have barely ever talked much. I always knew he had a girlfriend because she would spend a couple nights a week here.

Anytime I speak to her, she makes an irritated face at me and gives minimal answers. She glares at me anytime she sees me or just looks at me like I’m stupid. I have always been very friendly to her and I’m not sure why she treats me this way.

A few weeks after Joe moved in, he and myself and our third roommate all came home from our jobs one night and had a few glasses of wine and got to really know each other. Where we all work, where we’re from, that kinda stuff. Just shot the shit and talked for an hour or two. My boyfriend even came over and had a beer before going home as he was tired.

I went back into my room and fell asleep and woke an hour or so later to Joes girlfriend barging in screaming at him in his room about how she couldn’t believe he was drinking with his female roommate. He defended himself saying we were all hanging out and he was just having fun and that I have a boyfriend. I heard her shriek that she doesn’t care and that him even drinking is disgusting to her.

Every since that night in December, she stays over every single night (as if to watch him and make sure he’s a good boy) and he hasn’t spoken a word to me.  On his nights off he sleeps at his moms because she doesn’t want him home alone with me at night. She uses our bathroom and stays over so often but pays no rent and makes the house super tense when she’s there. It’s to the point that I spend as much time away as possible because it’s so awkward. 

I brought this up to the other roommate who the lease is under, but he insists it’s normal for her to be threatened because I’m an attractive woman and that Joe does work around the house so he won’t ask him to cut back on the time she spends here.

I’m growing weary of their constant fighting late at night (I work at 8 AM) and I don’t think I should have to tip toe around the house I pay $850 a month to rent a room in just because my roommates girlfriend is an insecure banshee. If us three are paying rent to sleep here every single night, she should be chipping in to make our payments less because she’s here just as much.

What advice do you offer me here? I had to pay first, last, and security for this place so I don’t exactly want to just hit the road. I would love to find a solution.

For example ""Why would you put the tv remote there you fucking dumbass."" When it's just a less convenient spot literally nothing to flip out about. 

She doesnt let me have any contact other women. Other than soft meaningless shit like a cashier at store. But like talking to them initiating or continuing a conversation not on the menu. 0 other women across all my social media. Which honestly doesnt bother me, because I didnt talk to any of them anyways. I'm not searching for a girl when I'm with one. But if she talks to guy or has one on her social it's not a big deal when I say something about it. Which it doesnt bother me much, it's just that if I'm locked down she is too. But shes always finding loop holes and using them against me. 

I spend everyday some point I'm over there to see her. But if I were to make plans with some friends or something and dont go over there not only do I miss her, but she gets mad because i wanna be with my friends more than her. But when I give her space to hang out with her friend everythings good. 

I feel like if I explain the one sidedness of the relationship to her say I say why are you able to talk to all these other guys and it's no big deal but when I say something to a girl it's big scene. She takes it as you wanna talk to other girls go right ahead. Not even try and comprehend the normal side of what I'm saying. 

Now as bad as all of this looks, why would I waste my time with someone like this. Because it's not all bombs dropping and shots fired. Most of the time, we joke all day long laughing, she always takes care of me after work, our drives around and our dates out theres a low to love but a ton to hate. It makes our relationship very bumpy when shes always has bullet ready to fire at me. Shes absolutely crazy but perfect the way I love her.

It’s also really hard to take a full breath, especially through my nose. It always feels like I’m talking half breathes and it leaves my chest feeling tight and unsatisfied. 

Has anyone had a relatively normal looking nose but had a deviated septum?",26Feb2019,1
745,"TLDR at the bottom.

To start, I'm a college student. This job was crucial for me, because it was within walking distance, I could work before 8 AM and get to class, and it offered some important discounts.

But everyone I worked with was incredibly cuntish. 

Condescending, horribly rude, they made me feel like I was extremely stupid for no other reason than they just *could*. They were all buddy-buddy with each other, with me being the first new employee in a number of years. Once I got into the elevator with a coworker and, as I tried to chime into the conversation that I was technically a part of so I wasn't standing there looking at my feet, and she pressed the ""open door"" button and left in the middle of my sentence. They often loudly humiliated me in front of customers for misunderstanding something, or breaking some unspoken rules I didn't know about. They'd stare deadpan when I was obviously trying to joke with them, despite being in good moods with each other. They refused to let me take a legit break, sometimes stopping me 5 minutes into my lunch to drag me back onto the floor - while taking 45 minute breaks for themselves. They'd intentionally sit away from me and gossip. Mind, they're all in their 40s-50s, too old for this shit.

They all went out of their way to ignore, belittle, and frustrate me, always implying that I was slow for not understanding their system. I was always trying to do my best and get along with them. A lot of the time I'd go 6 hours without saying anything at all, just to save myself the embarrassment. I was always on time and eager to learn, always. I did my best to be the perfect new employee.

It's been exactly one month. Today they called and fired me, stating that I was disliked by the manager, wasn't a good fit, and didn't work hard enough. I was so frustrated and close to tears at this point that I just hung up. Now I'm waiting for my other manager to call me so I can figure out what's happening.

I don't know what to do. They were so toxic in a single month that I want to be happy it's over, but I can't be. I want to lash out over the phone, tell them that they were unnecessarily bitchy and that the 30 days I've known them, I've hated their guts. I want to leave my shit in my locked locker for them to deal with. At the same time, I really need this job, and I also want to ask if they can give me another chance. It's crucial for me, but I'm so fucking angry. 

Should I just leave them with a ""fuck you"", or ask for another chance?

**tl;dr:** My managers and coworkers made my life a living hell for a month and just fired me for what amounts to ""we don't like you"", and now I'm stuck between wanting to cuss out my manager when she calls me or grovel to keep this very crucial job.",26Feb2019,1

As the title suggests. I want to move to a city a few hours away from where I currently live. Same country (England) but just different location. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I met at uni, from different sides of the country. After a couple of years I dropped out, but he's coming to the end of his degree and we want to move to his hometown together.  How do I go about this?! I Just want a fresh start.   
I've looked on jobsites but I find everything so overwhelming. I have severe anxiety and looking at pages of jobs for places I know nothing about scares the shite out of me. How do I get a job without a house in the area? How do I get a house in the area without a job? 

I've found myself stuck in a downwards spiral. I've been dreaming of this move for the past few months, it's been the light at the end of the tunnel, for the mess my life is right now. But now it's time to make the dream a reality I have no idea what I'm doing and would really appreciate ANY advice. Even if it's just to tell me to get a grip. Thanks.  ",26Feb2019,1

748,"Hello people of reddit! It's my first time posting so I apologise for any mistakes.

I'm from country A, but have lived in country B for over 10 years. Last year I decided to move to country A again in order to pursue studying. I met this guy on the station for buses that do international travelling. There was a problem with the tickets so he asked me for help and I gladly offered it. After we passed the border of the two countries there was a twenty minute break in which I managed to gather courage and go talk to him again. We exchanged Facebooks and kept talking about studying etc.  I really liked him from that day because he seemed effortlessly cool. Months(5 to be exact) passed and we hadn't texted, we only liked each others pictures on social media. On 15th February he wrote me a message and we talked for hours and hours. We went on a date which was amazing I think. We have so much in common! We kept saying the  same things at the same time it was unbelievable. At one point towards the end he wanted to kiss me and I refused. (he then just gave me a kiss on the cheek). When I had to leave we hugged and he asked me at least for a kiss on the cheek so I have him one. After the date we kept texting for a few days. Then he had to travel to country B again because he had a break from university. I decided not to bother him with texting when he's there with his family and friends. More than a week has passed and he's not texting me at all. Should I text him again? We had such a good connection I don't understand why he isn't texting me? 

P. S I thought at first that he texted me just because he was lonely on valentines day, after I asked him why he texted me he said that I had made a really good impression to him the day we met and I helped him with the ticket. ",26Feb2019,1

752,"I am right now in my las year of high school and i am thinking of snitching on my classmates (i know snitching is an asshole move, but hear me out) for the following reasons.
I have been studying this teacher subjects for four years, and i always had problems, and it is almost impossible for me to reach a sufficient grade. Because of that I started studying with one of my friends, who is the best at those subjects (always gets an A/A-), even paying him. At first I had good results, passing from a D/F to a C/C+, but then I went back to D and F.
Last year, every time the teacher gave us back our tests, he always told me that I wasn’t studying, that i needed to be more consistent and that I wasn’t giving 100%. So not only I was defeated because I didn’t have any results, but also my self-esteem went down, like under my shoes, to the point that I found striving to get better pointless and had multiple breakdowns over those two subjects.
In all of this, 3 of my classmates use their phones during tests, getting B/B+/A-. At first I didn’t care, but here is a little math: we are 20 in my class. 10 of them are naturally good at those subjects and get always good grades. 5 of them use cellphones or benefit from those using them, because they pass each other the answers. Then there are the last 5 (me included) who get insufficient grades. So the teacher, seeing that around 15/20 always got very good grades thoughts that the tests were too easy, so he kept making them more difficult, making it by consequence harder for me (and the others) to get a good grade.
On December 2017 he found out this story. And did he fail them? No. Did he made redo the tests to all of the class to have a fair one? No. He let redo the tests ONLY TO THE ONE THAT USED THE PHONE, so that they had a chance to redeem themselves. So I and the other 4 failed, while these 5 got a beautiful grade (because they used their phones again).
Last week we had a test. It was really difficult, ti the point where even the best of the class said that he had problems doing it. One of the guys with the phone finishes the tests, gives it to the teacher and says: “I answered all the questions, I hope I answered correctly.” He then turns towards my classmate (the one who is the best) and adds (whispering): “So that maybe I get an A.” with a mocking voice.
And now we skip to two days ago. He handed us back our tests. After a month of studying, 640$ for private lessons and studying by myself, I got a beautiful D. One of those guys got a A-.  What made it feel like a slap in the face was that when the teacher handed him the test back he was so proud of him, admiring his improvement. He then proceeds to PRAISE HIM for doing so good in the tests because “it shows how much you like this topic”. 

Now I don’t like people who tell on others, but the situation it’s become very stressful not only for me but for many other of my classmates, to the point of which, like I said, I have breakdowns while I study and I lose all my interest and motivation. I would love to go to the teacher as a group and tell him about all of that, but they don’t want to because they are scared. What do you suggest I do?",26Feb2019,0
753,"For reference, I’m 24, I’ve been out of college for almost 3 years now, I have a good job that treats me well, plenty of growth opportunities, and I’m working on a masters degree part time.  I’m in good shape, I have friends who I see multiple times per week, and a supportive family.  Things are pretty good for me, but I just don’t feel happy, I guess.  

Like after a long week of work and school, on the weekend, I just want to go out and let loose.  If I don’t, I feel like the weekend was wasted, and I notice it has a negative effect on my mental health.  If I do however, I find I almost always drink more than I want to, end up doing things I regret, and spend more money than I wanted to.  In college I used to do that all the time, back when it was normal and everyone did it, and even the first year out I didn’t really feel anything wrong with it.  Now, however, I just have this feeling like I keep doing this again and again and I don’t like it, but at the same time, if I don’t, I’m going to sit home and do nothing.  I’ve offered to designated drive for a lot of these events, that way I can’t drink, and it usually works, though it just doesn’t feel the same.

The problem is some of friends don’t ever want to do anything.  If I manage to get them over my house to stand in my driveway and talk for an hour on a Friday night, that’s a victory.  My other friends, who are mostly younger, want to go out and party, and I normally tag along, because I can’t control what they want to do or when they want to do it, so if I don’t go out with them when they want to, chances are they won’t be able to when I want to.  The problem is also I haven’t really found anything that interests me.  I’ve tried a few activities I used to get into, but nothing really “does it for me” anymore, I guess.  I also used to really be into science and history as a kid, but nowadays I’m drained from work and school, I can’t really take up any hobbies that require brainpower.  Some of my friends will try things with me, but problem is, I haven’t liked anything I’ve tried. 

I think part of it is I’ve also been single for a year, and I guess I subconsciously feel like I need to be putting myself out there in situations where I can meet someone.  But I know that getting into a relationship won’t completely fix this aimless feeling.  I had it to an extent when I was in a relationship before, but at least I had someone who’s life was tied to mine.  At least I wasn’t entirely alone, I suppose. Now it’s even worse. I’ve tried meeting people in real life, and I admittedly could try harder.   I’ve tried online dating, and it’s the same old – people I’m interested in aren’t interested in me, and vice versa.  Roller coasters of ups and downs.

I still do live at home, but that is out of necessity, more for my parents’ sake than mine, to be honest.  I’ve told them I want to move out when I’m done with grad school, which’ll be in a year and a few months if everything goes according to plan.  I thought that maybe having a place of my own would give me a purpose, but to be honest, the thought of sitting alone in an empty apartment on the weekend and paying over a grand a month for the privilege just seems straight depressing, to be honest. 

Like I guess my problem is I don’t feel like I have a future to look forward to.  As my friends and I get older we’re just going to slow down more and more, sure I’ll get my degree and advance at work, but for what? To be alone except for some precious few hours a week? When I was a kid, I never understood why, for example, people put so much effort into their lawns, or their gardens, but I get it now.  It’s to give you something to do.  You know that Sunday night feeling where you know you have to go back to work the next day? I feel like I have that, but about my entire life.

755,"I don’t know if this is the right place, but I’m stuck. 

I ordered a sweater from a company online about two months ago. I paid with my credit card and the money had been deducted. They assured me that when it ships I’d receive an email and as of today, no updates. I contacted them again as I was getting anxious and they’ve been saying not to worry and be patient. I asked about a week and a half ago I asked to cancel my order and receive a refund. That’s when they told me I couldn’t because it had already shipped, but when I requested shipping information and a tracking number they didn’t have one. They said it’s out for delivery and not to worry. They’re no longer answering my messages for a refund or cancellation. 

I’m so frustrated with this company. When I’d read the reviews they were positive and many people loved their clothing and now I’m convinced they’re not real people as I can’t find much on the company reviews anymore.

756,"So I started working at a daycare center about 3 weeks ago. Literally on day 3 of working there I started getting sick, ended up with a sinus infection. Not contagious, got some antibiotics, kept coming to work, all is good. This past Friday I started having body aches and just generally feeling like shit towards the end of my shift. Finished it out and went to the clinic on Saturday, what do you know, I have the flu. Clinic gives me a work note for a week, which I send to my boss on Sunday (work week is M-F).

Fast forward to about an hour ago and I come back to the clinic to get tested for strep throat (it was positive, yay me) and the lady at the counter tells me my boss called up there asking about the sick note and what was wrong with me, etc. Obviously she couldn’t give out the information and didn’t, but told me they usually don’t write notes for that long. Apparently the girl at the counter on Saturday was new and didn’t know they’re only supposed to do notes for 3 days at a time. 

My boss has said nothing to me. Not a word. I found out because this lady told me my boss called. My question is, should I just say fuck it and not go back? I know work notes in themselves are not indicative of trust by an employer, but her actually calling up the clinic? It’s not looking like I’m gonna stay healthy anyway. Thoughts?

761,"So long story short, my gf of 4 years was abused for years by her second cousin when she was about 5-13, and this cousin had been living in town at her mom's house for a couple years.

This cousin always had a hold on my gf even still, getting her to drink and do things she otherwise shouldn't (trouble wise).

Anyways, the cousin recently went to jail for molesting her, and she told me that last year, she paid for him to have sex with a prostitute while she watched. Obviously I was confused and hurt because this is so out of character for her.

Cut to today, my girlfriend never initiates sexual contact anymore, doesn't rub me or put her hand near my crotch at all unless it's ""sex time"", which is usually at 1 or 2am before we go to bed, and even then I caress her or kiss her boobs to get her in the mood.

I confronted her about it today because this morning I tried to initiate sex since we were both lying naked in bed, but she said that I want to have sex too much and rejected me. She also told me that she's sorry if she gave me the impression that she was someone who wanted to have sex a lot, because she doesn't.

I'm just so confused because in her past, she told me she would literally go to f*** guys in club bathrooms and at parties, had a kinky secret with her cousin for a year, and yet she doesn't get horny anymore?? Is there more to this than I know? I literally only ask for sex no more than twice a day, and i constantly rub her legs, massage her, and tell her how much I appreciate her and how beautiful she is.

762,"\*\*I am not looking for your opinion on my activities. There will be some NSFW material in this post.

I have been seeing a masseuse, who provides a little extra with the massage, for about a year now. I found her on backpage when the site was still up. When we first met, she was very clear about her rules and lines that she would not cross. She maintained a professional relationship with me for many months. Everything was strictly business. 

One day, I brought her a starbucks just as a courtesy on my way to see her. She appreciated the gift and we began talking about coffee. The conversation went on, and we discovered that we grew up in the same home town and actually went to the same coffee  shop. This led to her telling me more about her personal life, and we began to talk like friends. Everything else about the massage was the same, but this time I had made a connection with her.

When I went home, I decided to type her address into white pages to see if I could find out more about her. Not to much surprise, the name she had given me was not her actual real name. I typed her real name into facebook and found a couple profiles with pictures of her. I learned what I could from her facebook. It turns out she has 2 kids with her ex and currently dating someone else. At first, I was put off a little by her being in a relationship given the type of work she does, but the more I thought about it, the more I became fine with it. I figure her current boyfriend knows what she does and is fine with it. 

I continued the next few months going to see her on a regular basis. I did not mention anything I had found about her, as I do not want her to think I'm a creep, and I simply respect her privacy. It is none of my business what goes on in her personal life. My relationship to her was only a customer.  

A few more months go by, and I go to see her again. Before visiting her, I had gone to the gym and worked out a lot harder than usual. There wasn't much time between the end of my workout and when I went to see her, so I skipped eating to make sure I would arrive on time. In the middle of the massage I started feeling really shaking and light headed. She could tell there was something wrong. I didn't feel like continuing the massage, but I also didn't want to leave. We both laid down, and she cuddled up to me for the remaining time I had left. She seemed to be genuinely concern about me and even offered to make me some food. I told her I was fine and left after she spent about 30 minutes, over the time I was paying her for, to make sure that I was okay. Before I left, she told me the next massage would be discounted because this one didn't finish. 

At this point I started  to notice that I was thinking about her more than usual. I started to think about how she had cuddled me and even offered to make me food. I scheduled another massage only a week after the last. I thought about going back to see her the whole week. I am very aware of my thoughts and I realized that I was probably think about it a little too much. 

I arrived at her house for my massage. Everything started as usual, but this time she was wearing a more revealing outfit. I didn't think much of it at the time. The massage went on, but catching me off guard, she began to cross one of her lines that she laid out when we first met. A few more lines were crossed, and the massage was over. I wasn't sure what to say. I figured the best thing was to say nothing. We said our goodbyes, and I left like every other time before. 

It is now a week later, and I have been thinking about her non stop. I have been counting the minutes until when I can see her next. The way I think about her though has changed. I can't help but wonder if she provides the same service now for all her customers or if I am an exception. I know she has other clients and the thought of it makes me sick, but was previously fine with the idea. My thoughts are becoming obsessive, and I know they are not normal. 

Based on the details I have given, I am wondering  if maybe she may think of me as more than just a customer. I still pay her and she still accepts the money. If this is still just business, how can I stop thinking it is more than it actually is? I need a way to distract my mind. I want to find out if my service is the same as other customers, but I am not sure how to ask her. I want to find a way to ask her what she really thinks about me. 

**Important Info:**

She is at least 10 years older than me. I am in my early 20s. Our personalities would never work for us to be anything more than friends, and she has a lot more going on in her life than I would be willing to take on (kids). I am very aware that I may come off to be a creep. I am also very aware that she is probably trying to make money, and her actions are typical of someone feigning interest for more money. I do not have many other female relationships in my life, which I realize could be a reason for my behavior. I am single, and I could just be using her to fill something I feel is lacking in my life.

Thanks for reading and I hope I can gain something from your comments. Please do not judge me for what I like to do with my extra time and money. I am looking for relationship advice... If you can call it that.

763,"
I don't know where to post but I feel like I just need help so if there is a better place, please let me know. I have already posted in r/parenting and got some helpful comments and just want to see if I can get answers from a wider community. 

To begin my ex and I were in a long distance relationship between two European countries when I became pregnant, we seemed happy together and on my side very much in love. When we found out I was pregnant he was positive about our future (I was more realistic and terrified), he chose our daughters name and talked about our future as a family. His moods began to change rapidly soon after we were apart again and I started to notice when he was angry he would verbally and mentally abuse me, I can pinpoint the exact moment he first verbally hurt me and how it made my head spin but I still loved and adored him and being pregnant with his baby I tried to deal with my doubts and ignore all the obvious red flags. I finally broke up with him when I was 6 months pregnant as I could feel the stress of a long distance relationship was making me ill and he was regularly being mean, cold and nasty towards me, despite this I still believed he would support and love our Daughter and we would co-parent together. 

I quickly turned into an enemy to him, he turned horribly abusive towards me and then ghosted me when I was 7 months pregnant, I was ghosted up until I told him I would need to have a planned cesarean section which is when he finally made contact and said he wanted to see his daughter be born. I went into labour a week early so he missed our daughters birth but turned up when she was 2 days old and stayed for 3 days, signed her birth certificate, said he loved her and promised he would work to support her and I, he hasn't seen her in person since.

After she was born I had to deal with severe postnatal depression, breastfeeding on demand, insomnia and dealing with still loving but not trusting him. I went into a dark place after she was born and snapped at him often but I had a lot of pressure on me and I kept on asking him when he was coming back to us but it would always be that he had to work overtime and would be sending money to us when he could... 

I just had this feeling that he was lying to me but as I had always trusted him before I had never thought to look him up online or dig any deeper when I had doubts about him telling the truth, I just never thought about it.  When our Daughter was 5 weeks old and I was awake at 5am and pretty dazed I decided to google a username I knew he used when we had first met and it was through this I found his public instagram account which showed him going to parties during the time I was heavily pregnant and when I was in hospital, him chatting with friends about holidays they wanted to go on together and a new tattoo he had gotten soon after our daughter was born (which I knew he had spent money on instead of sending money for our newborn daughter.) It pushed me over the edge seeing this other life which made no mention of his daughter or her birth but instead showed him to be leading two lives...
From this point onwards we pretty much went through periods of getting along to sending horrible emails to each other, he threatened to fight for her and take her away from me so I fought with him but then when I tried to bring her to him he told he was too busy with work and looking after his sick Mother to see us. He finally disappeared completely when she was 4 months old.

I started working full-time when she was 8 months old and I begged him in an email to help me with her daycare fees so I could work, that was when we started talking again and he promised he would start sending money and that he wanted to be in her life. Nothing was ever given to me for her and he would constantly change the subject when I would ask about seeing her, he was more focused on trying to start a romantic relationship with me than asking about her and it made me angry as I was exhausted from working and I wanted her to be our priority. 

Our Daughter is now 20 months old and he has not seen her since she was 5 days old. I went to work full-time, I found a place for her and I to live and I pay all our bills, I've bought everything for her with no financial help and I've pushed myself to the limits to fill the role of two parents. She is happy and healthy but he has never asked about her health, wellbeing or if she is safe, which has always baffled me as I think about and worry about her constantly. The emails he sent to me as our relationship broke down for the third time were full of disrespect and just really horrible, it made me angry as I was looking after his daughter on my own so I always replied in the same manner as he did to me, to my shame. 

I have repeatedly sent emails to him asking for help to buy her new shoes, to help with her daycare fees and to help her when I was having a breakdown after quitting my job, every email has been ignored. 

In the New Year I sent him a nice email and photos of her and asked if he wanted to see or know how she is doing and again received no reply from him. I checked his Instagram again (I hadn't done it since she was a newborn as I've always been afraid of what I would find) and on his public profile I found him declaring his love for his girlfriend, showing off his new tattoos, new clothes, photos from nights out with friends and sharing quotes about self love next to selfies of himself.

I felt absolutely devastated for our Daughter and angry that I had let him get away with not helping towards her child support because I believed he was financially struggling when I was working full-time. I even gave him money after she was born because he couldn't get home without it, money I now feel like he stole from me.

I absolutely wish I could rain fire down on this man who denies our daughter basic parental love and support but will tell the world how much he loves his girlfriend, as he shows off new expensive tattoos while he knows his Daughter is wearing used clothes and is being cared for by a struggling and exhausted lone parent.  

He is currently refusing to pay child support and due to him moving and getting a new job last summer the authorities have struggled to track him down. On his IG he has his new work address but because of all the red tape I can't do anything until the authorities track him down. I now feel like a nuisance caller when I ring the courts for updates and help. I'm having panic attacks and worrying constantly about my daughter's future all why he is is living a life with no responsibility and generally enjoying his new romantic relationship and life. 

Our Daughter has never had anything bought for her from him, never any financial support and no presents on her first christmas or birthday, he hasn't paid a cent towards her. On her first birthday he posted a photo on his IG of a pair of new Doc Martin's he had bought himself, she didn't even get a card or any mention in his life that she existed. 

I know he is a terrible person for doing this to her but it's the fact he is publicly boasting about his happy life, his love for his girlfriends and showing off very expensive looking new tattoos while I'm struggling day to day to raise our Daughter alone. The damage he did to me through ghosting and gaslighting me while I was pregnant and while I was caring for our Daughter alone feels like it will never heal and I will never have a healthy relationship because of him. I'm also left to deal with the pain our daughter is going to feel when she starts to ask about him, I just don't know what to tell her and it makes me feel physically sick to know she's going to feel such pain and like she wasn't good enough for him. 

I want to name and shame him to the world and I want everyone who knows him to know what's he's done but I honestly feel voiceless and like I'm the crazy one for being so angry and hurt. It feels like him posting publicly online about his happiness and possessions while he ignores his daughter is like he is spitting in her face and not give a damn about how she will feel in the future. He blocks and ignores me so there is no way I can do anything to put a dent in his life.

I honestly don't know how to deal with this. I can't make him love or care about our daughter and I won't ever know why he suddenly decided he didn't want her. He named her and wanted her, then he didn't want her and I don't know how or why anyone can do this to their child. Is this normal behaviour? How can his girlfriend love him when she knows he has a young child he abandoned and who he refuses to financially support? How can anyone abandon their child and then disrespect the other parent who is doing everything? How does he get away with lying to family and friends about why he doesn't see his young daughter? 

All these questions eat me up inside and I hate that I want to focus on my amazing daughter but instead have this constant burning hatred towards her Father, not understanding why he doesn't want to know her and also that I have to worry alone daily about her future and money. 

Are parents who abandon their kids more common than I know? Have other people named and shamed the other parent and has it helped or should I just let it all go and let him get on with his life and just be happy but poor with my daughter? 
How do I explain this all to my daughter as she gets older without her feeling hurt? 

(Sorry for the long post but if you read it all, thank you.)

764,"So yeah, I started a hydroparty with my hands and feet from nervousness because my group is gonna ba defending our thesis on Friday. I don't know what to do and to be honest, everything that I try to memorize in our research won't go through my head.

 I'm still a Senior High student. My friends, who finished defending their thesis, helped me in making our research as well but I'm still afraid that I might be the first one to fail or get our study rejected because I practically did everything.

Any advice? ",26Feb2019,1
