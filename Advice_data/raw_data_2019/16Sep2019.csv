0,"So basically, I use the pill pack for birth control and when i opened it today somehow my pill was already wet. Like I have no idea how it got like that but it was wet while inside the pack, so when i opened it to take it, it was sort of falling apart. I managed to take most of it but im worried that it being wet for a possibly long time, or not being able to take the ENTIRE pill is going to mess up the effectiveness. To be safe should i take my active pill for tomorrow instead with this one? Not to mention I had JUST done shit with my partner today, we use condoms, but one broke today (which hasn’t happened before). Can anyone help me here?",16Sep2019,1
1,Hello! First time poster here! I am a 18 year old female who starting vaping at 16 due to some friend introducing it to me. In the beginning it was only when I was out with friends. I quit doing it all together 2 months ago because I was ashamed of myself for it and I was doing great for about a month until a lot of stressful things happened in my life. Now I'm back on it. It will take the stress away for a little but then I feel so ashamed and depressed about myself. I could really use some help so I'm turning to this subreddit hoping for some help! Thank you guys!,16Sep2019,1

3,"Okay so here is the story. My girlfriend(ex now ig :( ) just brokeup with me. She said this isn't working anymore. The first 4 months of our relationship was really good. We would talk nonstop all day long and we hungout and everything was perfect. then when summer started she just stopped texting me as much and we didn't hangout at all and she was lying to me a lot and posting ""thot"" photos on her instagram and snapchat. I love her so much I can't even explain it. She is literally my dream girl. She is the reason I believe in soulmates. She wanted all the same things as me for her future. A few days ago she really wanted to take a break for like a month so I said fine. She promised me after this break everything would be better and she swore to me so many times we would be together after the break. Now it's been 3 days since the break(today being the 3rd) and she just brokeup with me. I don't know what to do. I really love you. I don't know how to explain it. I did everything for her to. I bought her stuff I even wrote an entire book(took me a month) for her telling her how much she means to me. I always knew this would happen but she always told me it wouldn't and to stop worrying. I don't know what to do I just want her back. I don't want to let go. I can't let go I'm not gonna date anyone else ever again I'm not even exaggerating. She's weird, and cute, and silly, and funny, and everyone is different and she's perfect for me and I just want her. There could be an exact replica of her and I still would just want her because i love HER. I don't have any friends or anything and I go to an alternative school so the people that go there live far away. Please someone just help me try to get her back or something. I don't want to lose her.",16Sep2019,7

6,"Hello. I don't know how to put this without being blunt, but I don't know what to do.

I've known I wasn't straight since I was around 9. It took me a while to actually accept this, not as long as others but a good (bad?) few years. I still battle with internalized homophobia, but so far I'm winning. 

I live with my parents (66M and 56F). I'm a teenager, and obviously they had me late in life (not planned). There's a few things that might help you understand the situation a little more.

1. They've been split up since I was 3; never married. They hate eachother, but they still live with each other because my mom cooks dinner and cleans and my dad buys basically everything. It doesn't sound functional, and it isn't.

2. I have 9 siblings, all half, 7 from my mom and 2 from my dad. I lived with the youngest 3 until I was 11, when we moved and my sister (17F) went to live with her friend (and when that fell through, her boyfriend) because of my dad. My brothers got their own place after a few months of living at our new house. My other siblings I've never lived with, but have spent a good amount of time with, except 2 that I've never met.

3. My parents are homophobic. My mom ""just doesn't prefer to be around"" gay people and my dad is scary homophobic. You know how I mentioned those 2 siblings I've never met? One of them is my brother, who is gay, and was kicked out of the house and disowned before I was born. I didn't even know about him until last year, when my sister (45F) offhandingly mentioned him and was confused when I didn't know about him. She gave me a picture and told me about him. My dad doesn't know I know.

4. My brothers, who I've always been closest to, are kinda homophobic. They wouldn't shun me or anything, but would definitely think of me differently and I really don't want to ruin the relationship we have. I feel like if I did come out to them I would loose a lot of progress in accepting myself. I don't know what I would do if I lost them.

I'm terrified. I've never really thought about coming out, because there's always been such a great community of LGBT+ people at my school and online, and it never seemed important because I never really dated anyone. But ever since I learned about my brother, I can't stop thinking about it. I'm afraid of my parents finding out by me saying the wrong thing, or meeting my friends and just ""knowing"", or finding something in my phone. What would happen? I don't know anywhere I could go.

The only person in my family who knows is my sister who lives with her boyfriend. She's really supportive, and knows about my brother, but she just doesn't understand my anxiety over this. Don't take that the wrong way; she has a lot on her plate too. I just don't think she has room to worry about me.

Obviously I've been thinking about it a lot, and I think maybe the best choice is to wait until I'm old enough to be stable, come out then, and if my parents are even alive then they would come around. But I'm conflicted because coming out has always seemed something I should do when I'm a teenager, with the whole ""living a lie"" thing. What do you think the best thing to do is? Anything you can come up with helps.

TL;DR: My parents are homophobic. I'm afraid if they find out I'm bisexual they will kick me out like my dad did to my brother. What do I do?",16Sep2019,5
7,"So, yeah. This is my first year of public high school, but I'm a junior. I'm in my 6th or 7th week of school.

I don't dislike Physics per se (I'm just all around a lover of science, and my teacher is cool), but what worries me is that I'm really bad at math, and even though I'm understanding it so far, I might not be able to later on. 

I do wish I could be put in Geo-Space Science, because I was really excited for it, and IIRC I did sign up for it on my enrollment papers. I also really love planets and shit. 

Side note, after having watched Breaking Bad, I'm taking an interest in Chemistry as well.

What can I do about this? Is it too late to move classes?",16Sep2019,1
8,"So I met a friend on Reddit... maybe about a month ago. He was super fun and genuinely sweet. We talked off and on for a couple weeks and I really enjoyed his company. 

This weekend we spoke on the phone for the first time and it was pretty freaking great. We were both laughing nearly the entire time and I was giddy the rest of the day. But after our talk, he pretty much decided he doesn’t want to talk to me at all anymore. His reasons are sound... I’ve got a lot of shit going on and I get him not wanting to be involved. It actually makes him even better of a guy. Which sucks. 

The point is... I kinda feel crazy. Like I really want to talk to him. Like that’s crazy right? We’ve only talked to a few weeks so it’s not like I should care all that much but I do and I don’t know how to make it stop or what to do about it. Is this normal? Am I crazy? How do I stop caring about it?",16Sep2019,3
9,"Two months ago I (14M) got a cat as a birthday gift from my parents, and I love it to death. She's almost 5 months old, and we've been having some issues with her behaviour. Because of the material of our furniture, all our expensive chairs have been covered in holes from her claws and we've even had to cut up a perfectly good shoe because her claw was stuck in the sole and she was in excruciating pain. We've had a few plants die and have had to clean up a mess everyday. 

My parents are now interested in declawing the cat because our neighbour's had hers declawed for many years. I've researched the health concerns over declawing and although it is legal in my province, the actual explanation and procedure for it makes me think it's not a good option for my cat health-wise. I've read about things you can do to discipline your cat and avoid scratching furniture but it hasn't worked and my parents are fed up. 

My parents have told me that I can either declaw her or they're going to put her for sale. My parents also got rid of my dog 2 years ago and gave it away to my grandma before we went on vacation, although she was just supposed to take care of him while we were gone. I feel guilty because I don't want my parents to be more stressed than they already are by dealing with the cat, but I also feel guilty for getting rid of the cat after a couple months, or declawing it and worsening it's health while it's still a kitten.

 I feel like I have no good option here and I feel like it's my fault for not being able to solve the problem on my own. I've brought up many solutions that I got from highly respected sources in terms of cat stuff, but my parents always brush it off and say it doesn't work, and prefer to yell at the cat instead. I'm in my room writing this on the verge of tears, because I feel like it might just be a few days before I don't see her anymore. I have no idea what to do, and I really need some help here.


TL;DR: Parents are fed up with kitten I've had for 2 months, can either amputate her or get rid of her.",16Sep2019,3
10,"Hey just putting this out there to see what other people’s experiences have been with overcoming self-hate.
Since I can remember ever even having a body-image, mine’s been low. Wasn’t skinny enough, felt disgusting and ugly, and because of that and some things from my parents, I ended up feeling unloveable. I felt like love towards me was either conditional or that it was being faked. There’s so much value on looks too that I just know so much of my own value feels dependent on being beautiful and ‘therefore loveable’. But I know this perspective is messed up and unhealthy, so I’m trying to heal and have real self-compassion and understanding. I’m having trouble overcoming body dysmorphia though, where I just see myself as so flawed and gross and not good enough physically. Just wondered how people worked on overcoming that step towards self-love. Any insight is helpful. Thanks!",16Sep2019,1

I am independent in every aspect of my life bar this, I have my job and make my own money, pay bills etc.

I look forward to speaking to him and gaming everyday whilst I'm at work and I get a little bit of happiness during my day just thinking about it, at this point I think it's the only thing i look forward to. I feel like I woildnt know what to do if I didnt have him, my happiness etc

Weve agreed to start calling and playing only once a week now so he can game with his friends, I understand but it kinda upset me because I've become so used to it it's my routine and now I dont really know what to do. I have friends but majority dont game and I'm not going out as much because I'm saving up to go to canada on working Visa next year. 

I dont want my life to focus around him and finding happiness in only him, he does make me happy and I love him but I dont want to be overbearing and become reliant on him. I honestly dont know what to do..

So there’s this guy that I’m crushing on. He is literally super cute and tall and literally my type completely🤪😍. Problem is I’m not sure he knows I exist 😂

Basically I ‘met’ him almost two years ago, his mum and my mum know each other and they were talking at an event and kind of introduced us. We literally just said hi to each other and that was it🥴. A few months later I friend requested him on Facebook and he accepted it. Since then, now and again he’s liked/reacted to a few of my posts and stuff I’ve shared and I’ve liked/reacted to his too. (Side note he has never liked any of my photos so🤷🏼‍♀️ I don’t even know if he knows I’m the one posting and sharing all the stuff maybe he just likes the share/post?!).

I’ve literally wanted to message him since the day I saw him but I’m just so scared!! I don’t even know what I would say, as we don’t really know each other that well, i think it would be so awkward. I was trying to wait and see if he messaged me at some point but it’s been so long now and I just don’t think he will. Should I message him or should I not?

21,"TLDR 29 y/o female with no close friends in area but otherwise doing quite decently is stupidly sad and bored. help please.

Hi all.  I'm feeling quite frustrated with my situation in life.  From an outsider's point of view, I'm doing perfectly normal.  I have a steady job with a decent income ($68,000), I take at least one big international vacation each year, I weightlift with a team 3-4 times a week, and I've made some decent to great friends over the years.  Basically, whatever I want to do, I do.  Feel like going out to eat but no one is available?  I'll go out to eat myself.  Been thinking a women's self-defense class would be cool?  I take a self-defense class.  

I have maybe 2-3 girlfriends in the area that I will go out and have brunch with or take some art/fitness classes with, but no one I would consider a best friend. I'm also an introvert, so I really only go out and be social with friends every other week.  I find it hard to strike a balance between being social and also having time to myself that I need.  I still keep in touch with my close friends from college, but they are out of state and have their own lives.

Right now, I am going through a depression episode, so my feelings are a little all over the place.  I started a new antidepressant about a week and a half ago, and I've gotten a little better, but not great.  Basically, I'm sad and bored and don't know what to do.

My job is boring and I am not challenged, but I have a great boss and great worklife balance.  I feel painfully alone a lot of the times.  What frustrates me is I feel like I am doing all the things I'm ""supposed to do"".  I go out by myself and sincerely do enjoy my own company.  I exercise with a group of girls 3-4 time a week.  I try to meditate daily.  I practice CBT for my negative thoughts.

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong.  Like should I make more friends?  I've always been the type of person to have 2-3 close friends.  But I also compare my life to other people my age, and everyone else seems so busy on the weekends... when really all I will do is go to the gym, clean, read, watch tv, and maybe go out with a friend for a couple hours if we have a planned activity.  

People give advice to volunteer. And I know I probably should, but I look at volunteer opportunities around me and they are either available only during the work week, or I plain just do not have any interest in helping out.  I know that's terrible to say (I feel like a brat) - but volunteering for something I don't have a passion for just feels like work.  I don't see how I would get fulfillment from it.

I do have a small amount of social anxiety... but I've worked really hard on it via medication and putting myself out there to overcome it.  At this point, it's probably just a typical amount of shyness.  I bring this up, because sometimes I shy away from going to some events because I don't know anyone there... but I do really try and make an effort to step out of my comfort zone.

I'm just at a loss.  I'm frustrated because I have no goal in life.  I feel like I've checked the majority of basic boxes - education, exercise, trying new things (classes, mindfulness techniques, etc), traveling, saving for retirement, steady job.  But I'm still miserable and bored and sad.  Idk man.  If anyone could give some advice, I'd appreciate it.",16Sep2019,1

23,"I’m currently 19 in the beginning of my sophomore year of college majoring in biology. Im driving an hour back and forth to campus bc it’s the only way I could afford going but I really can’t do it anymore. The work is starting to get harder so my time is really stretched thin bc of that and the commute and it really taking a toll on me emotionally and physically at this point. By the end of this semester I need to make up my mind about what to do but I’m stuck between several options. I’ve thought about transferring to a community college and finishing out an associate degree it’s less money and there’s one really close to where I live. I’ve also thought about transferring, the university I attend has a second smaller campus that offers less (which is why I didn’t originally attend) but is closer and I could still get a bachelors but would still need to take loans to attend. My third option is dropping out all together. If I did this I’d probably not go back to school because I’d have to start paying back my loans and I’m paying for this by myself, I don’t think it’s possible to pay both tuition and loans together in my situation.  I’m not sure what’s right anymore, I want to finish a degree but it feels like I’m doing it just to do it at this point. I’m slowly learning to hate my major and can’t change it bc all my base classes don’t really apply to anything else. I wish I knew what career path I wanted to go down because I feel like the choice would be easier to make but I’m not sure what I want to do or what I even like at this point. 
TLDR I don’t have the time or money to make the wrong choice again. Should I transfer to a closer school I still need to take loans out for to complete my BS for something I don’t really like anymore. Finish an associates at a community college for way cheaper to actually complete schooling or say screw it and drop out all together.

27,"Hi All

I’ve (35f) have been friends with this girl (34f) for over 10 years. We are very close and talk every day and most of the time we have a good friendship filled with laughter and fun.

This issue I have is every so often she will (IMO) unreasonably blow up at me for silly reasons. For example, a few years ago she was talking about getting her boobs done and apparently I wasn’t happy enough for her and to her, that meant I was jealous (I had just been made redundant so I had other things on my mind). She stopped talking to me for a week and sent me huge long texts of her stating how I’m jealous and don’t support her (bear in mind I have a really large bust and there’s no reason to be jealous over something like this - I don’t know if that’s relevant)

Anyway, every so often she blows up at me. It happens a few times a year and it’s always over silly things. The most recent episode was today and it was over her friend asking me how I afford my properties and designer stuff. 

When her friend asked, I responded saying that I go with out and prioritize things, like I never travelled to Europe in my 20s every year and saved that money instead. Well, my friend blew up and thought I was having a dig at her and thought I was saying she shouldn’t travel as much as she does (I never would say that, how people spend their money is their own choice). I was asked a question and I gave my answer. I save and would prefer a new lounge or new ysl bag over a week in Bali and I’m not ashamed by that. She’s spent all morning basically abusing me, saying I’m jealous, saying I don’t support her etc etc. (she gets on this long rants)

Now here’s my question: I’m tired of walking on eggshells around her and I never know if I’m going to “trigger” her. Am I best to step away from the friendship for my own mental health. 

TLDR: friend blows up at small things and makes me question whether we should be friends.

29,"I've been unemployed for 11 years, there are very real barrier that keep me from working...not least of all due to my disabilities I need help job searching but there's no support available, lack of recent work experience (I volunteer) means employers don't want to hire me, and I'm only educated up to A-level (university is as difficult as seeking employment).  

As a result I'm socially isolated so I have no friends at all, it also means I've not been able to have a long-term relationship and barely able to date (when I do date it's not like I'm a catch and I often tolerate more than I should) so in turn at 36 years old it seems I'm not going to be able to have children. My housing situation is secure, my health is okay, but I've no career, social life, or even hobbies - thus no routine, no feeling of achievement or worth. Thus I suffer severe depression.

My major is entertainment technology, however I wish to persue a career in the film industry, whether it be me making short films, music videos, other commissioned works, or Hollywood.

However, my parents are really pushing me to get a degree. I do understand where they're coming from, as they want me to have safe alternatives that I can fall back on, as well as continuing to go to school because my dad has told me that once you take a gap year to work, it's hard to go back. I believe college isn't right for me though, especially with how costly it becomes, and I just believe it would be a waste of time, money, and energy for me to go. Other factors play into this as well, like how disinterested I am in general academics and how quickly they drain my mental energy.

Last summer of August, she overdosed on Fentanyl and had to have an EMS shoot Narcane in her neck, and revive her. She’s emotionally abused me for a prolonged period of time, and would have physical fights with my dad very often. At the end of the day though, my dad and her would just end up fucking as if nothing happened. That was the most twisted part of all, that he doesn’t see any of this as a problem. We’ve had many cps calls, and have an order of protection against her, and she has gone to a program for a year to help with her alcoholism. Now that she’s done with the program, she’s been drinking again. 

I told my dad that it’s either me or her, I’m not living with her anymore. He’s also told me he can’t stand her, she’s a complete bitch, it’s bullshit what she does, yet to her face he’ll kiss her and call her babe. After moving to my aunts, and making him realize I’m serious and having him miss me as his son, he understood and chose me. Him and I moved to North Carolina from New York, and have been renting a house. He recently told me that he was going to have his ex come over for Christmas. He’s also on a dating website, and she’s fucking other guys. He knows she’s fucking other guys too. 

I’m currently back in New York visiting, and got a text from my little sister ( ex girlfriends daughter) that she’ll be visiting North Carolina to see my dad in September. 

I was still processing the fact that she was going to be coming over in December, but now he’s buying them plane tickets to come even sooner and the kids will be missing 3 days of school for this. This is just a process of my dad slowly integrating his ex back into our lives, and before I know it she’ll be living with us again. 

I was going to tell my dad if he has her over for Christmas, I’ll be staying in New York until then. I don’t want to pretend like we’re one big happy family, and as if nothing has happened. Her kids will also be sleeping in my bed and using my basement and room as theirs for the time they stay. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’m finally 18, so I do have some freedom. I’ve been staying at my grandmas house while I visit because I have a surgery in October and planned to go back to North Carolina once I healed. After finding out that he’s having his ex come back, I don’t even wanna go back to North Carolina again. I’m currently working a minimum wage job, and if I go to college then my dad would have to pay for it. If I get on bad terms with him, he won’t do this. I’ve cut my mother out of my life, and I’ve been yearning to do the same to my dad, but unfortunately he financially supports me, so if I do that I’ll be screwed.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can live with my grandma forever, and I feel so done with my dad.",16Sep2019,1

I do well in school, have my own hobbies like graphic design. I have had a few jobs, quit them all because I hated them. As a teen you can't really find a job that doesn't involve working with customers. Or at least I don't know any. I'd love to work in graphic design, babysitting, or individual work. I can't seem to find anything of the sort in my area. I never hear the end of the ""find a job you lazy airhead"" talk. I'm starting to think I should just go into a job like fast food but last time I was in a fast food job, I was there for a year. Every time I had to go into work I wanted to hurt myself or take my own life. I know that I'd never do such a thing, I just don't understand why it's that big of a deal for me.

43,"I don't know why I am posting here as well. I couldn't figure out how to crosspost my original post. I am new to reddit.
​
I am a teen mom. It wasn't by choice and I am scared what the future will bring. My life has completely changed.
About a year ago, my brother forced himself on me. I didn't stop it nor did I tell anyone about it. It hurt and I was scared what my parents would think. It happened a couple times after that.
Eventually, my period stopped. I stole a pregnancy test from Walgreens and it confirmed what I already knew. I hid my pregnancy, the only person that knew was my brother and he was surprised because, he didn't think he could get me pregnant since he was my brother. He never told anyone either. I wore baggy shirts and didn't get real big.
A few months ago, I knew the baby was coming. I woke up with horrible pains and I couldn't keep quiet about the pain. I walked to our garage and set out some pillows and towels and tried to give birth. It was so scary and the pain was unlike anything I have ever felt before. I tried several positions I had read about and finally found a position that helped with the pain some. I am thankful there is books about pregnancy and child birth as I couldn't have done it without that information.
I honestly didn't really have a plan on what I was going to say or do after I had the baby. I guess a part of me just hoped it would all go away.
My dad heard me screaming, he came into the garage and was shocked to see me in labor. He called 911 immediately and helped me give birth to my son. By the time the ambulance showed up, I had already had my son. He is healthy thank goodness.
I still haven't told anyone who the father is. I told my parents that I was raped and the man had a mask on so I couldn't identify him. I am on birth control now. They have been really supportive. I don't feel they would have been as supportive if they found out the truth. I won't ever say anything either.
I am doing school online and I take care of my son all day. My brother goes to school and his life goes on. I feel like mine was stolen. It is a new life for me and I love my son but, a part of me wishes that I had never gotten pregnant.
I don't seem to have any friends anymore, they stopped coming around. It isn't fun to hang around a crying baby and talk about shopping and the boys at school. Homecoming just happened at our school this past weekend and I got to see all my friends in their beautiful dresses with their dates online. I know that won't happen for me.
I feel broken and I am grateful to be on birth control. My brother sees it as a pass to have sex more.
At this point, I don't feel like saying anything at all. He is the father of my son and he does love him and he says he loves me. I don't try to stop him anymore from having sex with me. I just feel empty inside.
I just feel like this is what our relationship will be since we have a son tying us together forever. We would always be tied together forever since we are brother and sister but, now it is on a much deeper level.
My brother is truly proud of the son we created together. He dotes on him and is such a happy and proud ""uncle"". He has mentioned someday having another.
My brother is smart and very popular in school. He gets good grades and has many friends. Life has never been difficult for him and I hope my son has a life similar to his.
I have always struggled in school as I have a learning disability and it makes it difficult for me to learn. I also feel that this defect led me to be coerced into a situation where I would allow my brother to have sex with me. I know I am just trying to find a reason for all of this.
I'm on autopilot and don't feel anything anymore. I just take care of my son and work on my school work. I am a shell of my former self. The only joy in my life is my son.
I suffer from aphasia, it is difficult for me to process what people say to me at times, it is more difficult for me to verbalize. I have gotten better since a child but, writing has always been a way for me to have a voice.",16Sep2019,2
45,"My friend invited me to do a wine tour with her and some other girls (who I don’t know) and told me the ticket price which I was OK with.  She also mentioned we would do a limo with the other girls which I was OK with too (no price).  Following a week later, she texted the group explaining the day, etc and that we 1. Are no longer doing a limo, instead having one of her family members drive us (for $30 a person, I might add) and 2. Need to put the tickets all on one order.  She then explains she doesn’t have enough money on her card to put down the money for the tickets (would be a little under $150), and instead wants someone else to do it.

I really want to do this wine tour and bond with my friend, however I don’t feel comfortable offering to put the tickets on my card if I don’t know anyone, and also paying $30 a pop to have someone drive only a few of us around is a lot.  I don’t want to make excuses either.  What should I do?  Tell her the truth?",16Sep2019,1

47,"I've posted this to r/relationship_advice but didn't know if it really belonged there.

So I got to give some context to what's been happening this weekend. My best friend lives in another country, we met 11 or 12 years ago on the internet and have been best friends since, with regular calls and facetime. We know each other inside and out, we talk about our boyfriends and our mental health quite a bit.

This weekend I had received two calls from her crying and stating she wants to kill herself, other times this has happened it's mainly due to her mental health. However this weekend has been down to her boyfriend (early 20s) cheating on her again. 

She knows how I feel about her boyfriend of 7 years and she knows that I think she can do better. 

They've had their ups and downs since moving in together a few months ago, not going to lie, I saw this as something that would either make or break their relationship; but I've never stated my opinion of it to her because she does love him.

The first call was saturday night, it was the usual crying and telling me what had happened and saying she wants to kill herself, I ask her where she is and she says she's near a bridge. Thankfully on snapchat she has her location on and i can see that she is near said bridge and its hella busy with people walking by and talking. This actually scared me as before she would always say she wants to die but would always calm down with some steady talking to her. I honestly felt really helpless and being in another country doesn't help. During my time of trying to get her to calm down she said she was going to hang up and maybe call me back. I was with my boyfriend and he suggested that I should call her every 10 to 15 minutes just in case anything has happened. She does actually call me back and said she'd talk to me tomorrow.

She called me back today, late afternoon saying she was okay and that she was sorry, her and her boyfriend had talked and they were going to see if they would end the relationship or try and move forward. 

Fast forward to an hour ago where she called me again crying and saying she wants to kill herself because her boyfriend had decided to leave and move out of their apartment. I could barely understand her and asked her to calm down several times, I could hear her boyfriend in the background saying that she was only telling the half truth to me; so naturally I asked her to pass the phone to him just to get some clarity.

He had told me that they were talking and he had made the decision to leave and she then had gotten upset over what was happening and ran out of the apartment crying and saying she wants to kill herself, he said he chased her down before she came a danger to herself, but had a physical altercation of some kind once back in the apartment. Her boyfriend said that she was acting erratic and felt like calling the police or ambulance was the best thing to do. 

Her boyfriend past the phone back to her and I reminded her of the conversation we had that afternoon saying that if her boyfriend was to leave then that would be something she would have to get used to, but she stated that she did not want to be alone, all her friends were leaving her - which isn't true and I get why she may think that. I told her that her friends aren't leaving her and I certainly won't be leaving her despite being 1000's of miles away, I am always free for her and will pick up the phone at any time. She just kept saying how she can't be alone and that killing herself is the best way out of this.

I am honestly emotionally drained and very worried about her.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? My boyfriend said I've handled it well to talk off the ledge twice but I just feel like that isn't enough.

Sorry for the rambling.",16Sep2019,1
48,"Let me just dive right in by saying that my coworker, well call her Ashley, is irritating to say the least. She acts like she’s better than everyone because she has her masters degree (no clue how) because she generally takes the wrong approach on all of her projects, she hyphenated the word ‘maybe’ (may-be) in a PowerPoint for volunteers at one of our biggest conferences, she never updates her calendar despite being told to numerous times, she cries when receiving constructive criticism, goes to meetings she was directly told not to go to, and interrupts me EASILY over a dozen times a day while I’m trying to work. 

We have a three color dot system in my office. Red, yellow and green. If you have your green dot on the outside it means ‘come on in’, yellow dot means ‘come in if you need to but I’m busy’ and red means ‘send an email, I can’t talk.’ She CONSTANTLY comes in when I have my red dot up and says “I know your red dot is up but real quick.....” and then she is not real quick. Even if she was real quick, I don’t want to be speaking to her. And it’s always about something completely non-relevant!! With all that being said, I’m extremely busy at work and don’t have time to worry about her or make a fuss about anything so I mostly just smile and nod as much as it takes to make her stop talking and move along. 

But..Last week she comes into my cubicle and asked me a random question. I answered her and then turned back around to keep working. She stood behind me for a solid four to five minutes. I must have read and responded to 20 emails before finally thinking to myself ‘why the fuck is she still standing there?’ 

Then some time later she randomly says...
“if you have a problem with me you can just say it.”

Like I said, I was neck deep in work so this threw me off guard a bit. Also that line sounded confrontational so I didn’t really know where she was going with this..

ME:  what?
Ashley: you know, if you have a problem just say it.
Me: Where is this coming from? 
Ashley: it doesn’t matter 
Me: well, it does matter because if I don’t know then I can’t understand what you’re talking about. 
Ashley: yeah it doesn’t matter 
Me: Ok. 

And then I turned back around and kept working and she walked away.

I work in a fairly small office setting. There’s about 15 of us and we’re in a cubicle setting. As you can imagine, there is constantly drama. 
I have managed to stay drama free (go me) until this incident. I hate feeling like I made someone feel like I don’t like them but I also feel like she might just be a little nutso. I feel like this is such a childish situation. 

This all happened in a cubicle setting so somehow word got back to our supervisors and they want to have a talk with us tomorrow. Any suggestions on how to handle this?",16Sep2019,1
49,"Short intro: I'm a 31yo queer male who is/was involved in a very open (sexually and otherwise) community of friends and acquaintances. I've been single for a year, work in an industry that is the complete opposite of my personal life, and am currently seeing a therapist for depression and other issues.

Up until yesterday I was best friends with a couple I have known for 5+ years. 29yo trans masc guy (lets call him R) who has been a good friend for a long time, and his 27yo male fiance (lets call him C). I had a major crush on R for as long as I've known him. This led to a few arguments and awkward encounters since he didn't feel quite the same way, but over time we mostly came to a mutual understanding of each other. I developed more of an interest in his partner as well over this period. We really started to spend time regularly together last year right about the time my BPD ex girlfriend broke up with me. R was always someone I was very active with outdoors, no one else could keep up with me or was as interested in regular hiking excursions as he was. C was someone who wasn't as physically active, but we shared a lot of the same interests and got along well. During this time we all became more sexually active with each other. But that started to fade after a while, especially when R had some health issues. Things got a bit rocky between us over the winter when some medication I was taking made my depression and anxiety worse, but we managed to talk through it and things started to get better. I helped them re-landscape their yard, along with a few other maintenance items on their house. We'd play board games almost every weekend, and when the weather got better in April R and I would go hiking at least three times a month. R's interest in doing anything physical with me continued to decrease though. We went on a long backpacking trip last month which was amazing, but the week before that trip I helped console C after a previous crush of his came back into their life and led to the three of us talking. I explained that I felt isolated when it seemed like they had no sexual interest in me, despite casually flirting with other friends and being in situations where things would come up. All my past relationships had the same thing happen where my partner would no longer be interested in me, but would continue to seek out physical gratification with other people. I told them how much this hurt me, and after some talking we found some common ground and figured out what worked for each of us right now. The month since then had been going well. We continued to hang out on the regular, play games, hooked up once, and even managed to get C out backpacking last weekend. Things were seemingly going fine. I hung out with them briefly on Wednesday evening to have R help me with some financial planning, and we talked about getting together this weekend to play games and generally hang out. Friday I ended up seeing another friend I haven't spent any time with in a while, so Saturday morning I messaged C to see if they were interested in getting together that night. He wasn't being very clear on if they were interested in getting together that night or not. I said I'd rather spend time Saturday night versus today, and implied I'd like to spend the night. I was checking one of my social media accounts at this time and saw a post from another friend that implied he had been over top their place the previous night and had hooked up with them. This triggered some anxiety and jealousy on my part, especially with how cagey C was being. He told me R had gone into work for a bit, but that he would be interested in making food and doing a movie that night. Cool, I thought. I apologized for being a little emotional and took my dog for a short hike. After I came home I saw another message from C where he had changed his mind and said he just wanted to spend time with R that night. I should have said ok and made plans for today, but I didn't. I broke down and confronted him about having the other friend over last night, and questioned why they weren't interested in my like they are with other people. There's three people I'm interested in physically right now, R, C, and the other friend they had over. My emotions spiraled and looped, and I started to argue with C over what my value was to them. I eventually regained enough self control to stop and went out to buy a pack of smokes, this is after I had quit smoking again weeks ago. I ended up going to a party at another friends place, mostly full of people who don't get along with R and C for various reasons. I had quite a bit to drink and that was enough to get me to forget about everything else, but not before I also sent R a wall of text explaining my feelings in the bluntest way possible. Later in the night I drunkenly messaged C again and he said he was playing WoW, not even spending time with R like he said he was going to. I called him out, he told me to stop drinking which I did and then went home. This morning I woke up with a hangover and the realization that I've fucked up my life in the dumbest way possible. I reached out to them and didn't get a response until much later in the day. C removed me from social media, and R sent me a long text explaining that I'm engaging in abusive relationship tactics. That my past interactions with him on social media had made him uncomfortable (liking things he'd post), that no one owed me anything, and that he wanted to see me get better and he'd gone through the same thing around the time we first met. He then told me that after today they were going to cut all ties with me, for my own good, until such time that it feels right again but that they'd talk with me today if I wanted to address anything. The only thing that confused me was the social media thing, because I do that with all my friends to show support or whatever. The rest I told him I agreed with his assessment, and that if they wanted time away from me it'd be best if I deactivated my social media and chat accounts and avoided our community for a while because we have too many mutual friends and at activities we had planned, such as a camping trip next weekend, it would be easier to remove myself entirely rather then show up and try not to interact with them. I said goodbye and did just that, cut myself off completely.

&amp;#x200B;

After crying, dissociating heavily, and going for a long drive, I came home, told my work I needed a personal day tomorrow, and decided to make this post. I don't know what to do with my life now. It'd two weeks until my next scheduled appointment with my therapist, and I have no other support network now. R and C were the two people closest to me, and who I trusted the most. I want to get better, I don't know how. I seem normal most of the time, if a bit quiet and shy. But around people I get close to this is what happens. So far past therapists haven't seen it, and what little CBT they've suggested hasn't helped as much as I'd hoped. I have no friends right now, not one to talk to, and don't know what to say to a therapist to give them a good idea of what's wrong with me. I don't know what to do with my life from here on out. I'm the most alone I've ever been and it's all because I can't get over certain things and just be patient. Help.",16Sep2019,1

54,"I don't really know where to post this so I thought I'd try here. Basically as the title says I've always struggled with coordination and numbers. In school I was not very confident in sport, kicking footballs and skipping ropes I found particularly hard. Also in dance I found it difficult to keep up with steps because I don't know my left and right. I have to put my hands out in front of me and make them into Ls to figure out which is which. So it makes it hard following directions verbally and even with maps so I do get lost quite a bit. I also find just normal instructions quite difficult especially when they're written down. Like say a chart explaining how to cast off for knitting, I find that really difficult to understand. I prefer to learn by watching something. 

With numbers, I struggle to understand the 24 hour time. It takes me a while to calculate it so I use am and pm on my phone as I'm worried I'll be late. But when I'm at airports or train stations I can become quite confused although I get there in the end it's not like instantly knowing. When I asked someone the time and they show me the phone and it's the 24-hour clock I always get confused. Apart from finding general mental maths hard like times tables for example it also affects how I understand money. Especially when it comes to change I'm not very good at calculating, when I do count I use my hands pretty much all the time. I don't struggle with reading at all I love reading I love books I just don't understand why I find such simple things difficult.

58,"Hi Reddit readers,

I need your advice about how to handle my brother. 

I'm heartbroken and need you guys to tell me what to do. This is a long rant:

I live 3000 miles away from my only, younger brother. I moved far away from him about 9 years ago.

During this time, he has gotten divorced from an emotionally abusive woman who cheated on him, and been raising 2 young kids.

We were always close when we were younger: regularly doing activities together, and regularly telephoning, texting and talking about life. 

5 years ago, after he went through his divorce, I thought that maybe I would get my brother ""back."" His marriage to his abusive ex-wife had taken it's toll on our relationship because, when I would go visit, she would invariably insult me or say something to hurt me.

However, things seem to have gotten much worse since his divorce: he has had an on-again, off-again relationship with a woman who seems wonderful on the face of things, but who has taken to sending me a nasty email every time I try to have a serious conversation with my brother. 

I have never met this woman, yet twice she has sent me emails telling me what an awful person I am, and that I'm not part of my brother's life anymore. The second time, there was a relentless barrage of emails from her.

The first time I tried to have a long-distance ""conversation"" with my brother (which ended with one of these nasty emails from said woman), is when my brother announced that he was trying to have a child with her, after 4 years of regularly and loudly declaring that he didn't want to have any more children. My ""conversation"" with him about this was literally 3 lines of text in an email. I apologized profusely to the woman for causing them any stress.

The second time this happened, more recently, my brother had announced that he was planning on doing something with his young kids that would have put them in harm's way. I love my niece and nephew, and couldn't sleep at night worrying about them, so I made the mistake of trying to talk to my brother again, again it was just 3 lines of text over email....resulting in a barrage of nasty emails from his girlfriend the next day.

At this point, my brother and I are not talking.

I don't want to interfere in my brother's life. I understand that he doesn't want advice from a big sister. However, I rarely get to talk to him. As above, I have actually tried to have only 2 serious conversations with him in the past 5 years. 

I would also have liked a more loving relationship with his girlfriend, although she doesn't seem to give a damn.

I love my brother. I miss him. 

I don't understand why he is allowing his girlfriend, whom I have never met, free access to regularly email me and tell me what an awful person I am.

Part of me wants to be more mature than all of this nonsense, and pretend that none of the nastiness from his girlfriend ever happened. 

Another part of me is heartbroken, and I don't know how to go on. I miss him and his kids. 

Myself and my kids are supposed to be flying up to visit my parents in April, and I don't even know if I will be able to see him, or whether he will want to see us. 

So stupid, all of it. 

Plus he now has a baby with said girlfriend, so she is not going anywhere anytime soon.

Advice please!!",16Sep2019,1
60,"I'm a second-year medical student (outside of the US). I was about to go to study in the US after high school, because my dream was to go study abroad, but ended up staying in my home country to study medicine. Even though I'm passionate about it, I'm feeling unhappy due to other factors and have come to regret my choice. I've had the opportunity to experience an American college for a few days and I really liked it, and I feel it would have been better for me. I've been seriously considering reapplying to the US for a while as a consequence (everything is in check regarding the application in itself).

I do have reservations however, mainly regarding post-graduation prospects. I'm aware of the fact that getting a job is a lot trickier for international graduates, and since my first choice is a pretty small college, I'll need to focus on the area around it. I don't  like getting ahead of myself but I feel that I need to have a clear plan. So if I get accepted and do end up going I'll be giving up a pretty much guaranteed job for something that's a whole lot more uncertain and riskier. I'm planning to major in economics or engineering if that's of any relevance. Graduate school is a possibility, but I can't base my choice on it.

To sum it up: I have to choose between either spending 6 more years unhappy but with a guaranteed job at the end, or go somewhere else where (I think) I'll be happier but with much more uncertainty regarding employment at the end.

I'm not necessarily only asking what you would do if you were in my situation (though similar experiences are more than welcome), but also if there's anything I overlooked.

Thanks a lot to anyone who takes the time to reply",16Sep2019,1
61,"Let me just dive right in by saying that my coworker, well call her Ashley, is irritating to say the least. She acts like she’s better than everyone because she has her masters degree (no clue how) because she generally takes the wrong approach on all of her projects, she hyphenated the word ‘maybe’ (may-be) in a PowerPoint for volunteers at one of our biggest conferences, she never updates her calendar despite being told to numerous times, she cries when receiving constructive criticism, goes to meetings she was directly told not to go to, and interrupts me EASILY over a dozen times a day while I’m trying to work. 

We have a three color dot system in my office. Red, yellow and green. If you have your green dot on the outside it means ‘come on in’, yellow dot means ‘come in if you need to but I’m busy’ and red means ‘send an email, I can’t talk.’ She CONSTANTLY comes in when I have my red dot up and says “I know your red dot is up but real quick.....” and then she is not real quick. Even if she was real quick, I don’t want to be speaking to her. And it’s always about something completely non-relevant!! With all that being said, I’m extremely busy at work and don’t have time to worry about her or make a fuss about anything so I mostly just smile and nod as much as it takes to make her stop talking and move along. 

But..Last week she comes into my cubicle and asked me a random question. I answered her and then turned back around to keep working. She stood behind me for a solid four to five minutes. I must have read and responded to 20 emails before finally thinking to myself ‘why the fuck is she still standing there?’ 

Then some time later she randomly says...
“if you have a problem with me you can just say it.”

Like I said, I was neck deep in work so this threw me off guard a bit. Also that line sounded confrontational so I didn’t really know where she was going with this..

ME:  what?
Ashley: you know, if you have a problem just say it.
Me: Where is this coming from? 
Ashley: it doesn’t matter 
Me: well, it does matter because if I don’t know then I can’t understand what you’re talking about. 
Ashley: yeah it doesn’t matter 
Me: Ok. 

And then I turned back around and kept working and she walked away.

I work in a fairly small office setting. There’s about 15 of us and we’re in a cubicle setting. As you can imagine, there is constantly drama. 
I have managed to stay drama free (go me) until this incident. I hate feeling like I made someone feel like I don’t like them but I also feel like she might just be a little nutso. I feel like this is such a childish situation. 

This all happened in a cubicle setting so somehow word got back to our supervisors and they want to have a talk with us tomorrow. Any suggestions on how to handle this?",16Sep2019,2

I have recently gotten my first job, and could comfortably for a phone bill in between my car savings (paying for my own car+gas+insurance) and my spending money. I have consulted my parents, and they are against the idea as they would not be able to monitor my activity as directly, and want to maintain control over my phone. This would be the first time I would be going against my parents wishes this blatantly, and would likely cause a lot of fighting, tension, yelling, and just me generally catching shit. I also don't think my parents would neccasarily respect my sovierengty over the phone, and would just take it anyway whenever they pleased despite the fact that it would be legally my property.

70,"So, I'm a 22 years old gay man and I'm currently in college. I've lived in an apartment near campus with this guy that studies the same thing I do and 3 other friends for the past two years. Since I live with him and we study together, we basically see each other all the time everyday. And we also have the same friends outside of university, so we hang out a lot and go to bars together on weekends etc. I have developed deep feelings for him over these past years we've spent together and, unfortunately, he's straight. There's absolutely no chance he loves me back, he doesn't like men. I thought I'd let my feelings grow because I haven't been in love for a long time and it feels nice, but I didn't think they'd be that deep. Now I feel the need of telling him I love him, otherwise I might go crazy. I hate keeping big feelings inside of me. I feel like I might explode if I don't tell him, but I also know that our relationship might be damaged by me doing so.

She occasionally will pick up shifts on the weekend for a little extra money. I just started working at a job that I have no interest working at and the shift is 3p-3a. 5 days one week and 2 the next.

75,"So 2 years ago I came up with this ""great"" idea durring my first year at college. I decided that I wanted to start my own clothing brand to spread my designs and make money. The more I planned for it the more I realized I could actually make alot of money doing this. The way I looked at it was this: what do rich people love more than anything else? Showing off how much money they have, how do they do that? By having expensive items, wearing expensive clothes etc. So why don't I start a new luxery brand that has a more formal, psychedelic vibe to it and play it off as the next big thing. I do actually have some pretty promising designs, it's just that I don't really give a shit about fashion. I never have and I'm really only doing this for the money. I'm at that point where I have designs ready I'm about to link up with a vender Im finally happy with and actually go through with it, but I have Soo much doubt and I'm starting to think about the long term of if this will actually make me happy or am I just setting myself up for a life of disappointment and failure. Idk I'm just not sure if I should throw in the towel after 2 years of research and designing and persue something id actually really enjoy, like animation. I've never asked Reddit for anything before but I seriously don't know what I'm doing and I don't want to find out I made the wrong choice further down the road when I've already invested a bunch of money into it.

80,"I am a 22-year-old female and I am finished with college and ready to move into a condo with my long term boyfriend of four years. Currently, my boyfriend and I live with my mom in a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house, there is plenty of space for all of us to live comfortably but there are issues.

I have been seeing a therapist in order to understand and grow from struggling with anxiety and severe depression. I have had a huge breakthrough and now understand that most of my anxiety is stemmed from the way I was raised and the way my mom continues to parent me at 22. Some examples to understand, my mom has always put a huge pressure on me to get good grades (A's and B's only or grounded until my grades were better) this was great for my GPA but it was awful for my anxiety and I constantly felt a huge amount of pressure to be the best. The words my mom uses to communicate with me normally make me feel not good enough, or something I have done is not the right way, like the way I reorganized the kitchen, or if I have completed enough chores and other things for the day.  I have taken the past five months to not work and not be in school and to have time to try to understand myself and love myself but now I feel I am at my growing limit for as long as I continue to live with my mom. She strongly disagrees with my time off and has continued to put pressure on me to get a career position and often tells me that I ""need to figure it out."" (side note, I had a lot of money saved up after school and this is how I could continue to pitch in for bills and live for the months without work, my boyfriend also pays money to stay here)

If I leave the house or come home, or I am gone to long I always get the ""who, what, where, when, why &amp; how"" questions. Of course, my mom can know about my life and be involved but the constant questioning and extreme lack of privacy are only adding to my anxiety. At this point, I always feel the need to lie to her about what I am doing to avoid the disapproval or follow-up questioning. It is exhausting and I have brought up these issues with her in conversation but she often turns the conversation to make it that it is my fault, or that she is right. 

I know that I would be mentally better off moving out and having that parental freedom for once considering I have never lived elsewhere. My biggest guilt and issue and the reason I feel stuck is that my mom does not make a lot of money, and I am afraid that she can not afford this house and the maintenance alone. She makes it feel like she doesn't think we will ever move out, but the truth is we can not wait to. I have been trying to stick it out and try to help out and fix things that I can around the house and make it easier on her but when is it ""not my problem"" anymore for lack of better words. 

I just do not know what to do, do I continue to stay because it would help my mom but ultimately my mental health is suffering, as well as the added stress to my relationship with my mom, and the relationship with my boyfriend. Or do I move out and have more personal freedom but knowing that my mom is scraping by. Help? Has anyone gone through something similar?",16Sep2019,1

82,"I made a character as a funny shitposter online who insults people as a way of bonding, but not too harsh of insults. Like friendly banter. That was fine and fun way to channel out the stress but recently it has changed. Ill start from the beginning.

I used to live alone with my girlfriend at the time. I lived with my uncle till later traveling the US until like 17\~. Family away and didn't care about my choices and I was successful in my career. I got hit by a drunk driver that would soon have me stop my first career and I spent the rest of my time with my girlfriend. When my ex passed away I pushed all the friends we had together away which was roughly 2 years ago like burning the bridges kinda pushed away. About 7 months ago one of them contacted me again and asked me to rejoin them. We played the games we used to all play together like Smash and Pokemon. I decided to create the character to be what I described above. It worked pretty well. Until I reached my breaking point.

Waking up alone, seeing that extra space in my bed not seeing that person anymore there asleep or at the computer watching her anime. I failed at my second career in the training program and drove back home. When I turned 21 and I picked up drinking to cope with it. I live alone and family wants nothing to do with me which I'm fine with. I started to use my character to vent out the stress. It was all going well my most recent interaction that made me rethink what I was doing. 

Now E (we will call him) wasn't the kindest person plus he was younger. E used to tease my girlfriend back then because he was an invited person into the group and younger of course. My girlfriend didn't take them too well because she spent most of her time in hospitals and never learned how to take it in or knew social skills to combat it. She only talked to 5 people most of her life so I stepped in most times and told her to stop playing with him and he would join most times and overtime it caused a huge drama of the group splitting off with the friends she liked the most which mostly ended in them going back anyways.

E was talking about going to homecoming and as a joke I said ""hope you go home alone"". Well knowing he has a girlfriend he went with. He says went to the girlfriend and he was happy. I said was high school relationships never last and E was furious. Okay maybe I did take it far because no one wants to hear something negative about their positive and I used it as somewhat payback that happened years ago when he was an edgy middle schooler and I was 16. He blocked me after bragging and saying congrats I'm the first one hes blocked (over discord so I could see what he types. E must unblock me to see) because I said I went too far thinking it was a joke but he said I went too far and fuck me. Then brought up that card I was holding it for so long like a get outta jail free card in monopoly just waiting to get back and brought up how ironic it was that when it happens to him E went all white knight. Honestly I don't blame him.

It felt good to say it. But... It felt good... I look back at all the things I said and it felt good to say it. I soon realized it was actually me and the face I put on for everyone else irl was fake. Honestly thinking about dropping the whole group. Not because I pissed off one person but every time I interact with the group... All I think about is the one I lost. I'm fine with dropping the group or discord.

I'm now 24 years old and after graduating from college I landed a job as a front desk agent in hopes of getting my foot in the door in the tourism industry. How school works in Canada after high school you can either pursue university or community college, and where my grades were shit because I stupidly didn't care about grades back then I was basically restricted to community college. I finished the two year program and from that  I ended up with the job I have now,  with a year of university that was unfortunately wasted as I hated Business and then i got extremely sick and had to drop out.

Over the last 6 months however I've come to realize that I really don't enjoy this field anymore.  And the thought of staying in it is very depressing for me. But I'm not sure if it is wise to go back to school after amassing so much in student loan debt already. My mom thinks it would be foolish to ""waste"" time on school again and build up my debt. But I don't know what else to do. How else can I get out of this field without going to school to pursue another area?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",16Sep2019,1
97,"Title pretty much sums it up. I graduated college with a degree that I don't intend to use (struggled with my mental health throughout all of college and got to the point where just getting my degree was the goal) and I moved to a new state to experience living somewhere else instead of staying under my parent's roof. I've loved being independent but now I am more lost and lonely than I've ever been.

I accepted the first job offer I got as basically a receptionist and I've been here about 7 months. I figured I'd take this job for experience and then start applying for something better but now I feel like I either have to stick this job out for a year and then move home or get a new job and stay in this state even longer (which is the absolute last thing I want to do with how I'm feeling depression-wise right now). 

I just don't know how to move forward with my life. I am putting myself out there and getting involved with church groups because I am so desperate to meet people but I just haven't made friends. I just started taking antidepressants again to hopefully help but every single day I am thinking about how maybe I'd like to move to a city I'd like better, or on days I'm really down I just want to go home and be closer to family even though we aren't extremely close. I don't really have people to talk to about this and I don't have a lot of extra money to put towards therapy right now although I am considering it.

All I know is I get very, very down on myself about my job and I am extremely unhappy at work or thinking about going to work. I keep taking over other people's leases because I am not ready to commit to a year with how rough things have been but I recently had to switch from living with roommates to living by myself and that has isolated me even more.

Any advice or insight would be very much appreciated.",16Sep2019,3
99,"So, for most of my adult life, I’ve had terrible anxiety. I have never travelled outside my home state, and haven’t been on a date in nearly 7 years.

I’ve been very depressed lately for various reasons, but I just had a crazy thought...

What if I just started traveling? I’ve never done it. I should travel. Better yet...what if I find a stranger on Tinder or something, and invite them to come with me. Maybe I could find a total stranger willing to take a trip somewhere. As I type this out...it sounds crazy.

102,"When I was a preteen I went from training bras to D cups before I was 16. I got scolded by my camp counselor when I was 14 because my swimsuit was too revealing and had to wear a shirt over my swimsuit. It was a conservative one piece but everything I wore was slutty cause of my breasts. I can see people staring at them all day. I was overweight most of my life but I quickly became a DDD even though I wasn't obese. 

I am obese now, partially because I can't slack on my routine or diet at all or I gain 20+ pounds. I eat extremely healthy and exercise more than almost everyone I know. I'm going down sizes but my breasts aren't getting much smaller. 

I eat less a day than some people do in one meal, I don't drink soda, I drink green tea when I crave soda or lemonade, I'm vegetarian and only eat bread carbs after breakfast if at all. No ice cream, no burgers, no fries. But I'm still 200 pounds. (5'5"") I'm gaining a lot of muscle, and my stomach is flatter but my damn chest is still huge, it's infuriating. 

I'm getting pain while jogging which is my favorite exercise. Also absolutely no jumping or it's really painful. I'm also getting sweat rashes and am forced to wear two sports bras during exercise, a sports bra and regular bra during the day, and a sleep bra at night or I get a yeast infection.

I'm tired of living this way, no shirts fit unless they're men's shirts or from American eagle or Victoria secret and then there's an abundance of cleavage. Also at one point when I had gained a lot of weight from eating at work, I literally thought I was going to be paralyzed or something horrible was happening to me. My oxygen and CO2 was low, my legs were so numb the doctors were going to x-ray my back. Until I could save up enough for the x-ray and to leave time for more testing in case I needed surgery they gave me a back brace that corrected posture. My breasts were so heavy I was slouching enough to make me think something was seriously wrong with me. 

Now my research tells me that it'll be completely covered by insurance thanks to all the proof it's affecting me. But I read the recovery time is hard for people not in good shape. I don't know what kind of shape I'm in, I don't have a good reference. I jog 6 days a week, I'm a waitress four days a week and get 12,000 steps those days. I do yoga 7 days a week (if I can.) I lift weights or do strength exercises 5 days a week. But I still can't go more than 3 miles in a constant jog and more like 2 miles on my bad days, also I can't afford a gym and don't have more than hand weights so I look up videos online and do weight training that way. 

I have no idea if I'm in good enough shape that the recovery wouldn't take long and I can't miss more than a week of work, for many reasons. I also lift a considerable amount as I am a waitress and usually am the only server my whole shift so no one can help me.

Also I read you have to lose a certain amount for it to be covered so if I was a DDD what size would I go down to? 

I hate living like this and the rude comments I get are annoying. People assume I want to have sex right away because I'm attractive and have big boobs. I can't explain how many people have been surprised when they start dating me that I'm asexual. 

Any and all help appreciated. My mom has offered to loan the remainder of what isn't covered by insurance as she knows how painful this is for me, but I really cant afford to lose more than a week for work.",16Sep2019,2
103,"**TW: Emotional abuse**

Long story short: My stepmother, god curse her soul, emotionally abuses me all the time. Have severed ties long ago but am forced to live in the same house as I have nowhere else to stay.

All afternoon today she goes on an insult rampage as she always does. She insults me, my medical conditions, my different-race SO with xenophobic remarks, and my birth mother, thinking she knew her better. I ignored her ramblings as advised by my dad (who knows my strained r/s with her) as she does this on the daily. He reasons out that simply ignoring her would not give her the satisfaction of a reaction from me.

In the evening, I topple over an empty detergent box by accident. She immediately yells at me to pick it up while calling me a retard. Unable to take it anymore, I snapped and yelled at her like a drill instructor at basic right in her face.  She then slaps my arm and threatens to punch my face and use a knife on me, and at the same time threatening to call my father and the police on me. Ironically, she was the one who laid her hand on me first, and I never touched her.

All this happens in front of my half-sister who is only 7. She bursts into a loud cry, unheard in a long time.

I walked out of the house to cool off, hell-bent on pressing charges for this. But I called my dad first (take that, bitch) and he advises me to bide my time let him handle it. He still gives me the option to make a police report but tells me I must do it immediately, since ""the cops will question why I waited to cone forward"". He also warns me to prepare for ""repercussions"" if I choose to get cops involved. Doesn't explain why, he simply says ""you'll know when you experience it"".

Now I'm left with a crying and traumatized 7-yaer-old as I have never raised my voice like that in front of her before. And I now have a huge decision to make to press charges. My father gave this advice as we wanted to collect evidence and pursue it as one BIG case (since the abuse is over time). I am also seeing a counselor on Tuesday, so I may wait to get her input (since she's a 3rd/neutral party)

What should I do? Wait for my counselor? Press charges, possibly screwing my dad over?

I'm 21 and don't have the means to move out yet. I have either the house I have to live with her or live on the streets.

P.S. my abuser would convince the cops by painting me in a bad light. Will she have any ground?",16Sep2019,1

106,"(Throwaway account) A little background here. I’m 16 and my brother is 19 and I’m college. My mother is a single mom and has been for 6+ years.

107,"So we got a roommate a few months ago who we were under the impression was not a drug user, not that any of us would be judgmental, but we wanted a heads up since we’ve had issues with that here in the past with other folks. Over the course of a few weeks, he gets EXTREMELY friendly with me (F) and my female roommate, he starts inviting himself to hang with us all the time and inserting himself in conversation. We didn’t think much of it because we figured he was trying to be nice and make friends. We soon start noticing that he’s nodding out a lot in our living room, slurring his speech and rolling back his eyes. I’ve known a few opiate addicts in my day so I’m not stupid, I just don’t know what to say to him. I figured as long as he’s being safe and not making anyone in the house have to deal with it, things will be fine. 

However, about a month ago he collapsed in the house while I was home alone and I had to call an ambulance and try to get him to breathe while on the phone with a 911 dispatcher. It was traumatic because I have PTSD from seeing someone die from drugs, so it was emotionally a lot to handle. He gets administered Narcan and goes back in his room to do more drugs. We talk to him about leaving in 2 weeks time (giving him ample time to find housing and figure his situation out) and while he’s upset, he says he understands and he is now going to a methadone clinic. I had a heart to heart with him and said I understand he’s going through a lot, and while maybe we can’t be roommates, I could be a friend to confide in while he attempts recovery. 

This is when he starts to get obsessive and crazy. He starts thinking we’re all best friends. He’s knocking on my door and blowing up my phone to hang out, he’s asking us girls for hugs when he gets home that last longer than a “friend” hug should be, he is forcing himself socially on to our friends. If he hears about us going out somewhere, he invites himself or says he’s going to show up.

Well, today’s the day we told him we need him to move out. Meanwhile, he’s been using more than ever and passing out daily but saying he’s “just tired from work”. We’ve had enough, in addition to stealing and lying about inconsequential things. I tell him kindly that today is the day and he needs to tell us his plan. He says we never told him he had to leave and that we’d take it day by day (three of us told him in a group meeting to leave by the 15th). He is now trying to manipulate us and gaslight us by lying and saying we were being his friends and that now we’re screwing him over because he didn’t think he needed to leave since he’s “clean” now and hasn’t stolen anything... he’s been leaving me messages crying and trying to tell me a bunch of lies. 

I guess my question is, how do I discuss this with him when he gets home today? His behavior has become increasingly erratic over the last few weeks and his obsessive behavior over us is escalating and although he tries to act like a “nice guy”, he tends to be a bit unpredictable and we don’t know him well enough to know how he will react. There’s a laundry list of things this guy has done in the couple of months he’s been here, but these are the ones that stand out most.

109,"Hi, idk really where to post this so I'll post it in a few places I guess (idgaf about the karma just want opinions). Ok so this has been bugging me for some time now and I guess I just wanna spill it and I don't really know if advice will help but whatever maybe it does? Anyways it might be a long read but here goes.

Ok so I have this female friend right (lets call her ""A"")? We have been childhood friends for years but 8 years ago when we were around 11ish (maybe longer than 8 idk exactly tbh) she left to Germany with her family (and her best friend went to Bosnia around the same time, she was also part of our family friend group, this is important later). So we lose contact for a few years as we were young and didn't use social media much. Anyways a year or two ago ""A"" adds me on instagram and this is where everything starts going downhill I guess but she got really attractive. I mean she was always a cute child but we were kids and I didn't look at her or anyone that way but now that I was around 16-17 then I was definitely interested. Guys, she is the prettiest girl I have ever seen like I mean absolutely stunning. So anyways we talk a bit as friends and skype (her best friend as well at times).

Note: I was also talking to her best friend who is also part of our old group but I'm saying her best friend to not confuse anyone. But she is also my good friend so we obviously all talked.

Anyways so fast forward a bit from talking and catching up on and off. I realized I have been crushing on her really hard. Like guys, I'm ashamed to say it but at the time I was dating my now ex I was still in love with this girl (would never cheat, I would however ended it if I could be with her but not cheat). She's the exact copy and paste version of me just super hot. We agree and like all the same stuff and it's just refreshing talking to her. Idk she just seems perfect... but she lives in Germany and I am still in Canada.

So her best friend moves back to Canada for university and I was hoping that ""A"" would too (her best friend mentioned it being a possibility when they talked) but it doesn't seem like it now. She loves Germany too much to leave and plans on staying forever. Whatever, i'll move right? Well she also has a boy friend and she says she would want to marry him later (we are 19 btw if its important so later could mean a few years or a while).

Idk, it's odd but guys I'm absolutely crushed... I can't tell our mutual friend as that will be awkward, I can't tell her ""Hey, I'm madly in love with you and have been for a while etc etc"" because she has a bf and likely will feel weird talking to me (so will her best friend).

But every time she posts a picture, a story a snap or something of her alone or her with her bf I feel like everything just collapsed. I know I have no chance, all the odds are against me but fuck what I would give to be with her is insane.

I dream about either her coming here to visit me and her friend and somehow something manages to happen like she isn't dating that guy or just falls for me or some stupid unlikely shit like that (Ik...Ik I'm a horrible person for wishing that she breaks up with her current bf but i'm not perfect) I would go visit her in a heartbeat if I could, even as just friends just to literally spend some time with her. But it makes no sense if she has a bf and is busy.

They did this knowing my fiance had purchased the ring to propose and was waiting for the right moment to pop the question. Because they did this my fiance felt pressured and felt he needed to hurry his along so I got a very hasty proposal, in which they were present for, within a week of their engagement.
They rushed the wedding to happen before ours, which theirs will be in less than a month now.

118,"Not sure what to name the title of this thread, because it has to do with a lot more than turning 18... I don't really even think a lot of people can give me an answer on this, but I'll ask anyway.

I just turned 17 last month, meaning I have 1 full year until I'm a legal adult. I've gotten my first job a couple weeks ago, and just received my very first full paycheck last week. I didn't get paid a lot obviously, I work at McDonalds. It just got me thinking, how the hell am I supposed to save up enough money to move out and go to college at the same time with this kind of money? 

My end goal is to be a theoretical physicist, which requires a doctorate degree. I've decided a while ago bachelor's degree is physics first would be a good start. I could get a decent paying job and I'd be able to sit comfortably with a middle class paying job. 

But recently I've come to the conclusion that college is just a huge scam for most people. Dorms cost too much, books cost too much, classes cost too much, and so on. Don't even get me started on what it'll cost to move out with the money I'd have by 18... Anyways, I've always despised school with a passion. I've never really thought of it as a place you'd go to actually get smarter. Just a place you go to learn how to be more obedient. Most the kids in school probably won't remember shit from school a year or two down the line.  

Anyways, I'm only 17, so I'll just assume I don't know anything about the real world yet, so feel free to poke holes in my reasoning for what is about to come. 

Is there a way to get a job without a degree? You can learn a lot of what colleges teach you online for free, so why the hell would I go to a college and waste time and money just to do something I can do on my own? It just doesn't make any sense to me...

124,"So I’ve been in college for about a month, when me and my roommate met we got along great. We have similar interests and keep out of each others way pretty well.

At least, until last week... I have to preface this by saying that when we met he asked me if I cared if he occasionally hit a dab pen in the room. I don’t smoke anymore, but I used to and I figured that him using a dab wasn’t a big deal because it’s small and it doesn’t smell. I told him that was fine and left it at that.

Fast forward to last week, this kid starts buying bud from somewhere and keeping it in the room. Now, I have no problem with this as long as he doesn’t smoke it in the building, someone on our dorm floor was already caught doing that only a few weeks ago. I told him about my concerns and he just blew it off like I was being silly and I didn’t bring it back up because I thought it was settled, no big deal.

So I leave for the weekend (this weekend that just passed) and when I came back today (Sunday) I found out this kid has been using a geeb to smoke in the dorm bathrooms since I left. Now the room smells like weed that someone tried to cover up with air freshener, the bathroom periodically reeks of weed, and he has his shit (grinder, containers, an actual geeb) just laying on the windowsill. I told him that was a massive issue and told him he needed to stop. His response was something like, “well this shits already packed (referencing the geeb that he just finished packing) so someone has to smoke it... and I won’t stop but I’ll do it less often.” That turned into a whole argument about why what he was doing was dumb and that he shouldn’t be pushing his luck especially considering how accommodating I’ve already been. 

So again, I think it’s settled. But no! Not even ten minutes after the argument this kid goes back to the bathroom to smoke. I’m not trying to be an asshole, but it’s important to my major that I don’t have any drug related problems, and since he’s 17 and I’m 19, I’d get in even more trouble if anyone found his stuff in our room.

How am I supposed to handle this? I’m considering going to an RA but I don’t want to be “that guy” and I don’t even know if I’m in the right...

TL;DR -  My college roommate is smoking bud on the dorm floor and smelling the place up. I can’t have drug problems because of my major and he’s unwilling to compromise even after talking with him about it multiple times.",16Sep2019,1

for context, i met this girl about two weeks ago. we were acquaintances, sharing a laugh once in a while. one day she pulls me aside and tells me her friend committed suicide. i of course try my best to comfort her and she tells me she feels better. now she constantly pulls me away from my friends at school (she’s a year younger than me) and asks me for help. i really try my best but it’s so awkward because i really do not know her well at all. also i am DEFINITELY not qualified to help her emotionally so i’m constantly worried that i’ll say the wrong thing and set her off. she constantly texts me and calls me, not necessarily for help, but just to call. if she needed help i would answer in a heartbeat. but i don’t even talk to my best friends as often as she talks to me. and it’s not like she doesn’t have other friends, she’s fairly popular. she posts about me constantly and she wrote me a song too. i just don’t know what to say to her. does anyone know what i can do to help her out? it’s just so awkward hanging out with her as a person. i also hate texting people and calling people in general as i’m more of an introvert and just prefer being alone.",16Sep2019,64
128,"I'm a pretty young dude who likes video games, reading, fishing. For a while, I've felt so lost because I can cope with what's going on. My father abandoned the family and I feel like I want to end it because of my sister, etc. 

My sister always makes me want to feel like a piece of shit because all she talks about is me doing nothing when I'm washing the dishes 2-4 times every day. whenever I don't comply with what she says she will always say her trademark ""Useless"", ""Can't do anything"", etc.

I love my mom but she is seriously bad at managing money responsibly and kind of bipolar. My family is primarily Asian and since I was born in North America and raised in a primarily Italian community I cannot speak my language and have difficulties with a language barrier with my family. This language barrier has severely impacted me since I can never convey my feelings properly. One time I tried telling my mom about how I will do what she says but to just give me like 5 or so minutes and I'll do it after. This conversation spiralled down into my mother and grandfather laughing at me since I was crying my eyes out. Nobody in my family can understand me except my sister and dad.

Right now my biggest passion is reading and video games. Whenever I play games something always comes up so I cannot continue playing the game and have to pause/quit. I don't want to quit video games but might have to since this kind of situation keeps on happening. 

Every day feels like a dead end because of school and being unable to sleep. I sacrificed a lot of my social life because I don't want to burden my family with driving me, etc since I'm kind of shy and afraid. School only feels eventful because of my close friends who have been with me since elementary school and right now highschool. For the first time in 3 years I went out with my friend and had to come home hours earlier because my sister wanted me to do the laundry because she was going out to eat with my mom.

129,"I'm in 8th grade and homecoming was yesterday. I was able to go with some friends in a group but I didnt have a date. I basically danced and had fun the entire time, during the last hour and a half I found my crush and ended up asking him if he was there with anyone, he said no but the  afew of his friends found him and took him away. Until I found him again, meaning my friend saw him, pointed him out to me, and told me to go over there and ask him to dance. The music was very loud so I had to ask twice, but I asked 'Since you dont have a date, wanna dance with me' he kind of looked around, said sure then we just danced and had fun. Of course there were afew times he had to talk to his friends so I was alone in the popular kids crowd (Hes a popular guy, I'm not popular AT ALL) The music was very loud, I ended up going back to my friends until they had me go over to him again and do the cha cha slide with him and the robot (which he started) it was fun. Still, hes a nice guy so I dont knowing he was just being nice and didnt get how I asked him to dance with me or... maybe i just didnt do anything right? 

I figure when it's around 8th grade formal I'd tell him how I feel, and in the mean time I'd just try to be closer to him. If he says no, then I guess I'll lose a friend maybe but still.

137,"I recently purchased and moved into a new townhome community. I live in a corner unit and the chick next door to me is renting. I know this because I met the actual owner (who I thought was going to be my neighbor) but then he rented it out. 

I’m fine with renters - but something is off this lady. 

First off, she’s got people coming in and out of her house on the weekends (random people) at all hours of the day. She technically should be living there by herself (it’s a 2500sqft townhome with 4bedrooms).

On the first week she lived there, she had a bunch of friends stay over who all parked their cars right in front of my home (instead of in guest parking) all of which were dudes minus 1 other chick. These ppl continued to stay at her house through the weekend until Sunday evening when they all left. The whole area in the evenings STUNK of marijuana. I’m not against the recreational smoke, but come on. 

My husband and I were super annoyed about this but brushed it off a bit.

Now ever weekend since then, things just get weirder, and weirder.

A couple weekends ago this neighbor comes and knocks on my door - I open obviously. She nicely introduces herself and says, “hi I’m your neighbor, I’m getting my security system set up right now and they said they need WiFi and I was wondering if I can borrow yours.”

I was a little confused. I said, “ummm, sorry but no, that poses a security issue for me, and you”.

She persist by saying, “oh they just need it for installation, the Vivint guys are here now, but it’s okay...no, I guess? Let me know if you change your mind.” 

I didn’t believe her and as soon as she left I took my dog out for a walk. Guess what? No security installation vehicle in the area. Only the typical cars we normally have. This made me feel really strange - was she trying to steal my internet? 

That same night she had a bunch of friends over - it was about 11pm and they decided it would be okay to yell on the whole neighborhood as they played Marco Polo. I WAS PISSED. 

in between these incidents, this lady has random men coming to her house. One leaves, another comes. Friday-Sunday. 

She has one particular female friend that comes and stays for 3 days in a row and just leaves her car parked right in between my unit and another unit (this is an HOA area - no street parking allowed). 

Well, this passed weekend this friend of herself slept in her car in front of our home. How do we know that? Well, my husband and I took our dog out for a walk at 9AM and I guess we started her beauty sleep. As soon as we were walking back to our house we saw movement in the back seat of the car and the girl was in shirt and underwear. We have a Ring on our front door and saw that as soon as we closed our front door the girl started to scramble and get ready. Wtf? You have a friend come over but they sleep in their car!!!??? TELL ME THIS IS WEIRD?!?????

This girl left after she fixed her hair, and did her makeup. But tonight we saw her again. She left in another vehicle with some random ass dude and our neighbor. I can say this is dude #10. Some our repeats but most are different.

I just get a weird vibe from her and I don’t know if I’m just paranoid or what. What would you do? Complain to HOA? Tip off police? There has been other small things but those are the main big ones.

Also, I’m not one to judge - but she doesn’t look like someone that would live in this home. Aka, she’s kinda “trashy”.

At the start of every year I'm motivated to do better, and then the first test grounds me in reality that I'm not capable of even coming close. So many of my friends are doing so well in so many areas it feels like I'm being shoved into the ground while they get even further ahead. I'm ashamed to even talk about college since I know I won't be applying anywhere comparable to the schools they're applying to. My parents are always trying to get me to do better but it always turns into an argument where they just tell me to study harder but it makes me feel even more like shit.


I don't know if I can do this anymore.

144,"I posted a few months back about a situationship I’ve found myself going back to over and over again for 4 years. 

Here’s the post:


https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cky91z/need_advice_on_a_4_year_situationship/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I got some good advice and spoke with him about things and he seems/seemed like he really was/is trying. But here’s the thing, I feel like it may be too late in my eyes for that. 

It’s so hard for me, I have never given anybody this much of my mind or soul. I find myself always wanting him regardless of anything that’s ever happened. I feel like even if I was to leave him, I couldn’t be anywhere around him. Not because of safety reasons but because honestly I feel like I would give in eventually at some point. I know I would. 

So here’s the big catch. I have a great opportunity to move to Denver, Colorado. That’s halfway across the country from where I live now. My best friend invited me to live with her, save some money, and start over clean. I feel like honestly this is the best choice for me, but I don’t know. I’m scared to pick up my life and move halfway across the country. I don’t know where to start. I don’t know how to have that conversation with him. I don’t. All of it scares me but yet all of it seems so exciting to me. To start over, meet new people, be in a new place away from everything. I want to feel like I can actually dictate my own life and not worry about anybody else’s opinion of it. 

So I question my question is, am I crazy for wanting to do that? Does it make me “running away from my problems”?

How do I have that conversation with him? How do I word it? I don’t want him to feel hurt or abandoned but I really have put so much into this I feel empty at this point, like a walking zombie.

146,"Sorry for the long post, I tried to explain the situation as best I could.

Basically, I started my first year of university about two weeks ago and I am already thinking of dropping out due to my mental health. I have dealt with depression in varying degrees for the past seven years, and for the most part I have been able to function relatively normally (I was getting mid/high 90s in high school and had many extracurricular activities); basically, I was that kid that everyone thought would have a bright future ahead of them.

Flash forward to university. I feel that since starting two weeks ago, my mental health has gotten significantly worse. I dread going to classes every day even though I chose courses that are within my interest area, and immediately after returning home (I commute), I simply cry and sleep until 2am, at which point I get so stressed out about the pile of work that I have to get done before morning that I end up frozen in front of my computer unable to get anything done. To top it off, I have irrational thoughts of ending it all even though I know it sounds absolutely ridiculous to do such a thing. To think that I was so eager to start off on the right foot on this new journey!

To be honest, I feel that university is only exacerbating my mental state. The social aspect of university only adds to the stress since I am not naturally a very open and outgoing person. I do not foresee the situation getting any better, and I don't want my grades to suffer in case I plan on returning to continue my studies one day. The problem is that I was offered a scholarship that covers nearly all of my tuition expenses and I don't know if I will have to pay it back should I choose to leave now. Furthermore, my dad is currently helping me cover what expenses were not included in my scholarship, and I am not sure what will happen if I choose to discuss this with him. I would have immense guilt for giving up such a good opportunity.

I never saw this as something that I would have to deal with, but family problems and mental health are really dragging me down and do not seem to be going away any time soon. I have thought about reducing my course load to part-time and begin looking for a part-time job just so that there is a better balance, but I don't know if this will just make things worse. Alternatively, I have thought if just taking the year off to recuperate and learn music, or enroll in trade school the following year.

Sorry for this really long post, but I would really appreciate any guidance that could be given at this moment. I don't want to seem ungrateful for this opportunity to attend university, but at this point, I don't think I can make the best of it.",16Sep2019,1

I have tried bleaching the bath many times. Then I read the smell of bleach encourages them to pee in that spot, so I bought a special spray from the pet store that is supposed to deter them from peeing wherever it has been sprayed. It doesnt seem to be working in the bathtub but has for other areas of the house.

The litter trays get cleaned daily for poop and urine, and cleaned thoroughly twice a week when we change the litter and scrub the boxes, so it's not a litter box cleanliness thing. For example, we cleaned the litter boxes thoroughly today and I have gone into my bathroom to find pee in my bath again.

I suspect it is the cat that is closest to me, as when I went away for a week she punished me by pooping in my bathroom sink and pissing in the bath. However, I've not been away at all and try to give her attention when I'm home from work.

157,"Throwaway Account as it seemed fitting.

A little bit of context I feel is needed so everyone is on the same page.

I'm the eldest of my many cousins shortly followed by my brother.

As a younger kid I was the quiet and nerdy firstborn who, at least I feel, was put on a pedestal over my younger sportier and social brother. I don't think he was often taken seriously, rather being the butt of many a joke. Which I'll admit, some of them he deserved after throwing a tantrum etc etc. I don't think any of these were particularly malicious rather a family having making lighthearted jokes. Yet as he grew up he made a point on car rides back from family gatherings how he didn't like it, particularly the teasing he got from his younger girl cousins. Over the years the teasing subject changed from 'throwing tantrums as a 12 year old' to 'relationships and girlfriends'. Nothing out of the ordinary for teenage cousins yet I think it's fitting to mention prior to the upcoming dilemma. 

For my 18th birthday I was given £1000 that had matured from a savings account my godparents (uncle's family) had set up, and a crazy £500 from my grandparents. I wasn't expecting it and was obviously very grateful. For my brothers 18th however, he received from his grandparents and uncle a super generous, yet measly in comparison £50 each. My brother took it like a champ and didn't complain or acknowledge the difference, yet it left me feeling angry on his behalf, and also guilty that I had previously been given more. I feel it has opened my eyes to previous similar scenarios where favouritism from extended family members.

I understand the reasoning behind his uncles £50, as my brother has a different god parents and thus a savings account was never set up for him, yet it still leaves a sour taste of favouritism that I don't want to be associated with and feels unfair. My grandparents are well off, and it kind of stumps me over the difference in gift amounts. My only line of reasoning is that with 7 grandchildren each 18th would be very expensive and so they nipped it in the bud before it became a problem. 

Over the past two years, having left for uni myself and my brother starting sixth form I've seen my previously hyperactive younger brother turn into a grown up young man that I can be proud to call my brother.

164,"To give some background information, I am a 19 F who lives in a small town. I have a 21 M boyfriend who just recently moved 4 hours away to go back to school. I live at home with my 3 younger siblings and parents. Money has always been a struggle but we have never gone without. Throughout high school, I was fairly liked and always made good grades. Senior year I became extremely depressed and almost failed. I got myself together and ended up making it by then took a year off to work before going to school. 

Currently, I am in the cosmetology program at a small community college. I do not feel happy with my decision at all. I have always done hair and makeup for people and am pretty good at it. I’m booked every weekend for weddings and enjoy doing it. I am not as happy as I feel like I should be though. I am afraid I settled for cosmetology my senior year because I was going through it and it seemed like the easiest/cheapest choice. Since my BF has left, I’ve become extremely depressed again. I am always upset with the fact that I am not at a big university actually having fun and making friends. The idea of having a dorm or apartment and going to class on a big campus has always excited me. Instead, I stay in the same building Monday-Friday for 9.5 hours each day with school. I recently wrecked my car and have to be transported to and from school by my mom and can’t leave the house whenever I want anymore. I do not know if I am feeling disappointed with my schooling decision because of being alone again and seeing my BF doing things with his life while I sit at home each day or because I genuinely just do not enjoy doing this like I thought I would. My anxiety has gotten out of control and I constantly feel like my work is awful. I am always disappointed with myself. 

Lately, I have started to cause many issues in my relationship as well. Granted, my BF has made some mistakes in the past, but I know that he loves me and is serious about me so I shouldn’t always be scared that he is going to find someone else. I can’t help but always feel like I’m not going to be enough for him. I am terrified that he is going to fall in love with this big university and his new internship and everyone around him and forget about me. I feel so small compared to his new life there. He brought up studying abroad this weekend and I immediately felt my heart racing. As usual, I feel like I am not enough. So I am terrified that he is going to look into it more and fall in love with someone or somewhere else. Not to mention, I genuinely do not think I could handle being apart from him for that long. I feel like I am unimportant. I feel like I am settling for the easy ways out here in this small town while he is going to do big things and end up leaving me behind. We had a plan of getting married in a year once I graduated and got my license then living together. 2 months ago he decided he wanted to go back to school and try to find a job he genuinely loves. I love him more than anything. I do not in any way want to hold him back. But I feel like I’m not going to be enough for him. The things he is interested in are so much more exciting and bigger than me. I also overthink a lot and feel like he is looking into the studying abroad program and more schooling because he is unhappy in his life with me. It seems like he is just finding new ways to put off getting married or being with me even though I know that’s not the case. 

To sum things up, I have always felt like I will never be good enough. I am scared I will not be good enough with cosmetology. I am scared I am not enough for a big university or a more exciting career choice. I am scared I will fail at everything I do. I let these insecurities ruin relationships. I am scared I will not be enough for my boyfriend to keep him happy, and I am very scared that I am going to sabotage my relationship with him with these insecurities like I do with every good thing in my life. I genuinely do not know what to do with my life and need some help.",16Sep2019,3
167,"Hi everyone. I have never been so consistently sad before.

Here are some contributors:

- I am far away from my closest friends indefinitely. I miss them like I am missing pieces of my heart.

- My first relationship ever ended. Solely because of distance. Meaning.. we are in love still. We’re 17. I know I’m very very very young but this shite was real man. Real enough to realize we’re too young to hold on to something that can’t go anywhere, at least not in the foreseeable future. It’s hard to let go since he was my best friend and I love him. We went through a lot together.

- I am starting to hate school. I just can’t bring myself to finish my homework. I can’t sit in a classroom anymore. I’m so tired of it. And this is the semester when my grades matter most. And I’m scared of where my life is gonna go and if I’m going to be happy.

- My SAT scores were terrible even after months of studying and tutoring. I promised myself I’d never take it again and I’m taking it again.

- I’ve been going to a college prep school my entire life and I don’t even know if I want to go to college anymore.  I have this sudden longing to go far away and meet people and see things and walk a lot.

- I have been crying every morning when I wake up and every night when I go to sleep. Sometimes it starts with a message from a friend and sometimes it builds up. Sometimes it happens for no known reason. 

- I get weird feelings during class. I go to the bathroom and stand in the stall and just breathe. And then I go back. Idk how to describe it.

- I have been telling myself that it’s just a little blip I’m going through. Sometimes that happens. But this is the longest it’s ever lasted. I don’t know how to pick myself up again. I’m out of motivation.

I’ve always been so happy. I never understood how someone could feel so sad. I just wanna be happy again. And I feel like I’m being ungrateful for all of the things I have, and all of the experiences I’ve had. 
What should I do? How can I get myself out of this rut?",16Sep2019,1
169,"We broke up 2 weeks ago. We agreed that we should still be friends atleast. Two days later she told me she needed space so I gave her space. A week later she texted me and it was all fine. We talked about or day and how we’re doing like how friends would. The next day I told her that I plan on joining the Marine Corps. I had plans of enlisting but gave up because I didn’t want to leave her and she said she would’ve left me anyways because I would be living my dream and she couldn’t be living hers due to her being worried over me. When I told her my plans she didn’t know what to say. The last text she sent me was “I’m so sorry for everything”. That was Wednesday. We haven’t talked since. It didn’t feel fair to me that on social media she seems to be having fun. It seems that she’s not grieving over me and it makes me feel like I’m easy to forget about. I feel like if I try to talk to her she would ignore me or text me dry and leave me hanging. I think of all the bad things she’s done and think I’m better off. How it felt that I was the only one putting effort sometimes and she did sweet cute things for me too, it felt like I did it more and it took me doing those things for her to do it. I still think about her everyday. I don’t know what she’s doing and I don’t want to know but I can’t help myself. Everything reminds me of her. I don’t know what to do. What do I do? I know she loved me and I loved her, and she responded to my instagram question but that’s not enough. We broke up because she said she can’t be with me if she can’t see me everyday. Our schedules couldn’t match and I told her we could make it work but she wouldn’t budge. We both cried but I felt I cried the most. I still do because it was so unfair. It is unfair.

172,"Hi, so I’m 22 years old and I still live at home with my parents. My dad doesn’t use social media but my mom does and her side of the family added me on it. Personally, I don’t like having them on my Instagram because any time I post I gotta be cautious even if I post something innocent (me and my friends hanging out). If someone sees me with *gasp* a boy with his arm around me or whatever even if we are ONLY friends or coworkers, my mom would freak out. My family is middle eastern so there’s a huge no no when hanging out with boys but honestly it’s ridiculous and also none of their business. So many times it upsets me that I couldn’t post a nice picture of me and friends because my mom would get angry at what I’m wearing or why is there a boy in pic (even she knows we’re just friends but “what will other people say”).

174,"So this will be quick and might not be worded the greatest because I just got home from work and I need to go to bed ASAP so I can wake up to go straight back to work, and I'm bloody tired...  


I (18M) would like to get exposed to office work to see what I might want to go to college for. Right now, I'm a material handler at a blown film factory.. 12 hour shifts, 3-2-2 schedule. I hate it. The only thing it has to offer to add onto my resume is forklift certification, and that's only within the company.  


I want to eventually go to college, but I have no clue what to go for... I thought engineering, accounting, business, but I know there's so much more and much more to think about thereby. I'm really at a loss. I have no office experience so I must go into some kind of entry level position. With that being said, I need a fair wage so I can still keep up with rent and save money for college. Right now, I'm making $14.75/hr in an entry level position (I just recently started this job).  


I can't ask my father for advice because he's totally against me going to college. I mentioned the places I've recently applied for and he scoffed! He's against me having my current job but it's all I could find after my CNC machining job fell (He wants me to pursue CNC machining). Although I did very much like CNC machining, I want something different.. But this is a whole different ballpark; it's impertinent.  


So, my request for advice is (Title), what jobs should I look for? I'm on ZipRecruiter, I have a resume, it has very little to do with office work, but it's something. I do have plenty of experience with computers and the such (Personal time, hobbies). I wouldn't mind linking a copy in here in case anybody is *that* interested, or if you think you could help me using the information therein (Excluding personal info', naturally).  


I have been looking for receptionist jobs, but I have no idea what that'll expose me to. I applied for 20-some-odd jobs on ZR and I got 11 calls for interviews. I couldn't set any up because that was on Friday and I was at work... By the time I got home, it was 22:30.  


I have so much cramming to do tomorrow just to get interviews set up while I'm on any given break at work. I have Tuesday/Wednesday off for interviews; I really hope I can get something going but I have no idea if this is even the right path!",16Sep2019,1
175,"My dad’s conspiracy theory lifestyle began in 2012, and has consumed his whole life and is damaging our relationship.

I don’t want to cut him out of my life because I'm genuinely afraid he has a mental health disability and he’s my dad. 


Now that I’m pregnant I don’t need the extra stress that our conversations bring. I’ve told him in the past I am not open to talking about these things and want to have a normal conversation and he gets offended and tries to guilt trip me to continue talking to him.

176,"I was trying to turn around tonight on a residential street and didn’t have enough space as I thought. I backed right into a parked car. Now I know fleeing the scene is illegal, and I would never do so, even though when I looked, it seemed as though there was no damage to either car. I still went up to the house and knocked on the door to speak to the owner. I let them know what I had done and apologized profusely and let them know that I didn’t notice any scratches or dents. They didn’t seem angry or thankful that I had told them. So I just apologized again and then left. We didn’t exchange information or anything.

My issue comes with the possibility that maybe I didn’t notice something. It was dark outside and I didn’t see any damage but I’m fearful that there is a possibility I could have missed a scratch or something. Since I didn’t give them my info, they have no way to contact me if they do find something. What should I do? Should I go back to the house and give them my information just in case? Or should I leave it alone? I’m feeling really torn up about this and I’m not sure if it’s a big enough deal to go back another day or if I should just trust that I didn’t see any damage when I looked.

183,"(18F)So I was kick out of home a few weeks after my 18 birthday, I’m in no means a “bad kid” athough my mom considers me that.

186,"There was an 'incident' where my partner decided to tell people we were in a relationship before we'd had that talk about whether we were just dating or in a relationship. I felt like I had to go along with it or else end things with him - I wanted to talk to him at the time, but when we finally got to see each other he was stressed my saying 'we need to talk' meant I was going to end things and he was ill, we didn't have 'the talk'. 

Since then I've not felt like this was a relationship as we don't see/talk to each other as much as I'd like, he doesn't show much interest in my life or integrate me into his life like I think is normal in a relationship, I also generally don't feel like he's attracted to me - I can't put my finger on it, but I just don't feel really valued by him. 

I've tried to just go along with it and stay chill but it makes me insecure - he doesn't communicate how he feels so I find I'm having to ask him if he still wants to be with me, I feel myself apologising for not being better in bed, etc. also I've tried explaining to him I want him to message more and he's tried but it's still not enough (plus insecurities are making it harder for me to maintain conversations with him due to anxiety). 

As I've brought up concerns so often, but still not gotten to the core of the problem of not knowing exactly what he wants out of a relationship in order to know where I stand, I worry he's going to get fed-up of this type of talk.

187,"I’ve known for at least 15 years that I was mad at my mom, but I’ve never been able to put my finger on it and this has caused me a lot of angst throughout my life. 
Today while meditating I realized that I have this deep anger with her because of her lack of personal drive. She has made a lot of bad decisions that I have advised her against but she didn’t take my advice and through her life-long series of bad decisions she is now in a place in her life where she doesn’t have a place to live and doesn’t have the money to get a place to live. She’s been staying with my husband and me for almost 2 weeks after she initially said she was going to be here for 3-4 days. I’ve helped her find a place and loaned her the money to allow her to move into the place but she didn’t speak with me about her move-in date and chose a later date than my husband and I are okay with. After she told me the news she saw my reaction and went back to the place a couple days later asking if she could move in earlier but they now will not have the place ready until the later date she said she wanted to move in. 
Today when I got home I made it very obvious how annoyed with her I am because I found her sitting on the couch (same as every day) and a dishwasher full of clean dishes. I asked her what she did all day and she literally said she just sat around all day. I feel like this is such a perfect reflection of how she’s been throughout her life: she takes what she can, wastes what she has, and doesn’t do anything to better her situation unless she is directly told what to do. 
I know that if I say anything to her she will mope and probably stop talking to me for months or years and she now has thousands of my dollars and is still staying with me for another week. 
To make things more complicated, she is truly making improvements in her life, but it’s only because she actually took my advice last year and went to a 10-day silent meditation. She has since taken my advice on a couple other things, but it doesn’t change a life of bad choices. Although these are good things, I still get annoyed by basically everything she does and doesn’t do: she is only doing what I tell her to do, and she doesn’t do anything (literally) unless I tell her to do it.

190,"Before you read the rest of this: I'm not asking how I need to build up the courage to ask a girl to the dance. I'm asking how I should physically go about doing it, because there are some things I need to work around.

Alright, so there's a girl I've been really trying to become friends with over the past few months. We've become somewhat good friends, and we text each other every once in a while, yatta yatta yatta.

School started a couple weeks ago, which means Friday night football games. We're both really active around school, but one major thing about her is that she's a cheerleader. I have plans to go to every game this year, and so does she (of course).

This past Friday was our first home game. After the game, I went down onto the field, like everyone does to take pictures and stuff, and was able to talk to her for a bit. We had a good time.

I was thinking a time like that would be the perfect opportunity to ask her to the homecoming dance.

I really want to make a big poster for her, so I started making one this weekend and nearly finished it. It's not the type of poster you can roll up; it's a board. Big and clunky.

It all works out in my mind, but there's a couple things I need to work around. First, our stadium doesn't allow anyone to bring in signs or posters for the game. I don't think I would want to hold that big poster all night long in the stands anyways, so maybe I could leave it in my car and get it when the game is finishing. But second, no re-entry is allowed. So if I were to leave and get the poster near the end, I would risk not being able to get back in.

If I somehow were able to get the poster inside the stadium, I don't know where I would even store it until the game finishes. So keeping it in my car is my best bet.

Here's a rough idea I have. One of my friends that goes to the games doesn't really care about all the photos everyone takes afterwards, so he'd be more than willing to help me out. I was thinking of having him go to my car when the game is almost finished and get the poster. When the game is done, he could probably hand me the poster over the fence if he's not allowed back in, and bam problem solved.

I REALLY want to ask her after a football game on the field, because I feel like that would make it way more special to both of us. Especially because she's down there cheering her heart out all the time, it just makes sense.

Do you guys have any other ideas of how I could do this? This is the only idea I have in mind, but please feel free to share your thoughts. If you think I just shouldn't do it down on the field, and maybe do it right after school in the parking lot or something, let me know too. Thanks everyone. &lt;3",16Sep2019,2

194,"I’m about halfway through high school (I won’t disclose my exact age) and today I think I just experienced a physical attack. 

I was walking down a footpath with my friends and suddenly a guy who I’ll just call Jake wrapped his arm around my neck aggressively and shoved me on my ass into a flowerbed. He leaned down real close and told me to “watch who I hit” and then ran off.

Now there are a few things I want to get straight.

· I know Jake. He is in the same grade as me and we talk sometimes. He’s a reeaall eshay, always joking about bashing people up, etc etc. He likes to joke around and headlock people but he does it in a sorta goofy way.

· Jake has a girlfriend who I’ll call Jill. Jill is usually nice to me, and my friends know her better than I do, but she always hangs out with the “cool group”.

This time, it didn’t feel goofy or funny. I actually felt physically violated, and it was embarrassing in front of my friends. I don’t interact at all with any eshay circles. I’m a B student, I usually keep to myself and generally get along with what I need to do. But this time I felt a little angry, I felt I’d done nothing wrong. So I went and confronted Jake, in a non-aggressive way. I was alone and he was with his pack. Jill was sitting in the middle of the table. I asked him what that was about, and he told me to think back a few periods. I was playing netball in sport class, and Jill is in my class. He says that I bumped her during netball, and that “if you hit my girl, I’ll bash you”. I was literally shocked because I’m 100% not an aggressive person, everyone who knows me at all knows I would never intentionally do that. So I apologized to Jill and said if something happens please tell me. I obviously meant that, and if she had told me I did something I would’ve apologized.

So after this, I was trying to think of ways I could stop Jake from doing that again. I was running through all the options in my head. I didn’t want to let him get away with it. I was considering telling a teacher but everyone knows that’s a terrible idea. But I was also even considering calling the police or just in general a higher authority because I know he will just continue to bully kids at our school. I know that if he threatens to bash me, he will follow through. He has a whole gang that is willing to destroy me if I try anything. I walk home after school so that doesn’t help things. What do I do?",16Sep2019,1
196,"My ex and I dated for almost 4 years. We met in high school and started dating when I was 16. Even though we were both young, we went through a lot during our relationship. We had discussed moving in together, marriage, kids, you name it. Then, one night, we got into a stupid fight. All of a sudden, a switch flipped and he said, “I can’t do this anymore.” It shattered me completely.

It’s been over a year since we broke up. My ex and I are on speaking terms and currently live in different states. He is working a federal job, while I’m finishing up my English Education degree. He hasn’t been with anyone physically or romantically since we have broken up. I’ve hooked up with a few people, but I never could make myself actually pursue a relationship.

I still love my ex. A huge part of me still wants to be with him. I have no idea why I can’t get over it or him. I’ve tried all kinds of methods, and nothing seems to work. I’m young, so I should be able to bounce back, right? I wish I could understand why I can’t move on. It’s not that I don’t want to. I miss being with someone. I miss the idea of being in a relationship. I just can’t see myself with anyone other than him. And it sucks that I can’t move past it. I hope that one day, I’ll be able to be with someone and be happy. I just don’t see it happening.

Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward or whether or not this is even normal?",16Sep2019,1

Anyway, the day of the sleepover, I go over to her house and everything is fine. We watched a movie, talked , and played a few games. Then once we get into bed, it gets weird. First, we’re watching Youtube on her laptop and she’s sitting RIGHT next to me. Our arms were touching and she was a little too close then i’d like. Then, we go to sleep. Near the morning, I wake up to the girl’s leg around me. Her body is right next to me. There is literally no space between us! I was also an inch away from falling off the bed.

205,"Even if things are going totally fine in a relationship, be it friendships or whatever... Even if I know the other person loves me and cares about me, naturally there'll come times when the communication between me and the other person becomes tired or strained. 

And even if I know the other party cares about me, I can't help but feel the urge to try and make things less awkward and I compulsively try to please the other person. Why? Because I think if our communication is becoming stale, tense, or strained they no longer care about me (even though I know this is not true). Basically I'm extremely sensitive to rejection. 

My current coping mechanism for these times is to try and think of times I felt loved by the person, and instances that prove the person cares about me. But it's ineffective because during these times I need to actually *feel* loved and I can't actually feel that feeling when I'm in that state of mind. 

I suffered from a pretty fucked up childhood and my family situation was and is pretty fucked up so I'm sure it's something to do with that. I've blocked out a lot of my childhood so it's hard to remember exactly why. But I feel so unloved at times...

207,"I met a girl on Tinder and we've been talking for a while but it's hard for me to gauge how much she's actually interested in me romantically. We started chit chatting casually and I asked her if she had any Tinder horror stories. She then told me about some awful and traumatic things she's been through because of Tinder and I comforted her about it. We kept talking and eventually she told me to add her on facebook so we've been texting back and forth on facebook ever since. 

We talk a pretty good amount every day and have been for the past couple weeks. Sometimes she doesn't text me back for a few hours but she always gets back to me and she'll often send multiple messages in a row. I should also mention that she has Asperger's but I'm not sure how relevant that is. I compliment her and flirt with her all the time and I've sent her some pretty sappy and romantic messages. She tells me I'm sweet and that I make her happy but never really compliments me back otherwise or flirts with me. I've told her multiple times that I have romantic feelings for her but she's never said it back. She does send me selfies without me asking her to do so which so far is the biggest indicator in my opinion that she does have feelings for me. I dunno. Part of me thinks I'm just being paranoid and that she's obviously interested in me. We haven't much talked about meeting up in person because she lives an hour away. I sort of think that with her bad experiences she just wants to take things slowly. But I have this thought in the back of my mind that she's not actually attracted to me and just talks to me because I'm so sweet to her and make her feel good. I'm not sure how to progress from here.

I can’t walk her after ~10-11 am, as the blacktop and concrete are easily 110°F+ by that time, or will be by the time I get back. 

I work the night shift and leave before the blacktop gets cool enough to walk on, and get back home at 3 am. 

I am a female, and we do live in a neighborhood watch area. I’ve thought about taking her out at this time, but I don’t want to give people heart attacks by “casing the neighborhood” or get the cops constantly called on me. Plus, I’m exhausted and just want to sleep. 

I have had horrible insomnia lately, partially because of my pupper, partially because of mental illness. I take her out every 2 hrs, as we are still working on crate training and potty training. Once I get to bed though, I zombie get up and let her out to pee twice and poop, and then directly back in. 

The other time that is really an option is 6 am. However, there’s a lot of cars on the road, kids waiting for the bus, things of that nature. My so also leaves at that time, so I wake up enough to tell them bye and wave anyway.

They're kind people, good friends, but they're overwhelming me.It's a bit like unpaid childcare, except that *I am also a child and have no idea what I'm doing and am running out of patience* and it's making me judgmental and mean in a way that I hate but can't seem to stop. I keep snapping at people and judging them without thinking and once I get upset it takes too much energy to calm myself down anymore.

((Also, the most stressful two people are the ones older than me, and I know it's only by 2-4 years but I'm starting to feel resentful. Like, I definitely don't have it together, so why do I have to prioritize *them? Shouldn't they have gotten it together a bit more than me? Shouldn't they be advising and helping me?* Well, that's what part of me is beginning to think. And I know, ***I know it's self centered****,* this is one of the problems I need help with.))

218,"Posting from a throwaway account because I have friends and family on here.

When I was 19, ( I am 23 now) I went on a date with a guy I met online. He was super sweet when I first met him: he held my hand, bought me coffee and gave me his jacket when I was cold. We sat by the water and just talked for a couple hours and got to know more about each other and our lives.

When it was starting to get dark, he offered to drive me home even though I only lived a short walk away. This was also the first time I had ever gone on a date with anyone ever. He was the first guy I ever held hands with, as lame as that sounds. 

Looking back on it, I probably should have said no to his offer to drive me home and just walked, but I really liked him and wanted him to like me too. 

He drives me home and pulls up in front of my house. My parents were out so the house was dark and empty. I leaned over to open the door when I heard a click and he said ""aren't you going to give me a kiss?"" I looked over at him and he suddenly looked very angry. I still remember the look on his face and I remember suddenly feeling very scared and uncomfortable. 

I reached for the handle to open the door on his truck when he said ""I've put the child locks on. You aren't getting out of this car without giving me a kiss."" 

I had never felt more scared in my life than I did in that moment. I didnt want to kiss him because I had never kissed anyone before and I didnt want this to be my first, but I was also terrified that he might do something to me if I didnt do what he wanted. 

So I kissed him. I kissed him and he grabbed my head when I went to lean away so I would kiss him longer and when he finally let me go he smiled and said ""that's what I was waiting for"" and unlocked the doors so I could get out.

I remember running to my front door and not looking at him as he drove away. I stayed in a relationship with him for a month after that, but it was emotionally and mentally abusive and I was so happy when I was finally able to get out of it. 

I haven't told anyone until tonight because I dont even know if I was overreacting or if something serious happened. When I told my friends, they kind of brushed it off as a ""well yeah he's a creep but it wasn't a sexual assault.""

My father passed a couple months ago and my mother is living at home by herself, unable to work (and she hasn’t in 25 years) with no money to her name. I’m planning on going to school on the GI bill which will pay a housing allowance while pursuing my dream as a professional fighter (been training since I was 15, but the Air Force is too time consuming and haven’t been able to train enough for competition). This is the only career that appeals to me unfortunately. Very hard to break through. 

The problem is figuring out a way to help my mom in some form or another, choose a place to live, be able to pass classes in school and entirely commit to training! 

I can choose to go anywhere I want. I have moved around frequently in the last 4 years. Should I go home with my mother, a different state, how do you figure out where to move when you could go anywhere but don’t know anybody? How do you prioritize family, self sufficiency AND passion for a career that’s unconventional and costs a lot to start up in?

225,"I'll leave a tldr at the end for those who dont want the entire book I'm about to write.

I am in a long distance relationship. I met her online, and soon after, joined the United states air force, and am now stationed in japan. This girl been an Angel to me since we met, and the few times we were physically together were some of the best days of my life on this earth. We have chemistry, we respect each other in ways no one else has, and we understand each other in ways I'm not sure anyone else will. One day not too long ago, Angel proposed to me over the phone (an act I will forever love her for, but never forgive, considering I wanted so badly to be with her in person at that moment.)

That being said, things are not well. 
I struggle with depression and anxiety, and have no effective methods to deal with it properly. Best comparison I can draw, is the movie inception. I find a runaway thought that quickly spirals out of control, a tailspin that inevitably leaves me isolated, quiet, and critically depressed. Over time, My mind has become just shaky enough to not be able to cope without a little bit of help. Maybe that's just me being weak and dependent, but I've always found it immensely helpful just to have someone there, someone to spend those dark moments with.
In the past, I've always turned to Angel, and shes always obliged. Lately, that hasn't been the case. Over the past few months, the distance has become stifling. We went from talking for hours daily, to maybe every other day, to what is now essentially a 10-30 minute phone call every few days, sometimes only once a week.
It's especially frustrating considering I'm trying to plan our wedding, and need her help with it. I work 10 hours a day, sometimes 12, and dont really have much energy after a hard days work, and I still have errands and chores to handle for myself, on account of us not living together at the moment. Sometimes I wonder if she really wants to get married anymore.
Angel has never spoken to me out of anger, despite my emotions getting the best of me at times. Nevertheless, I find myself struggling to keep it together, between the stress at work, and the lack of anything helpful regarding my other issues.
Cue the Wildcard. Well, I went out with a group of good friends and perfect strangers last weekend, and among them was a gender fluid individual who seemed more than interested in me. She was about the same age as Angel, and seemed genuinely sweet, if a bit awkward (which was honestly quite adorable). The times she was outspoken and animated gave me the impression she wasnt exactly scared to speak her mind when it was important enough. I guess she found it important to make it known that she found me very attractive, which, besides being a great confidence boost, created a conflict in my mind. I had hoped to silence it with a healthy serving of alcohol, but as the night went on, I discovered that my mental state was degrading fairly quickly. Wildcard is pagan, and had given me her ring as something of a protection charm for the night. It was comforting in a way, but by the time the 4th rum and coke hit my bloodstream, I was dangling by a thread. I dropped a 50 to pay for my part of dinner and a little extra, and stepped outside to crash and burn away from the group. I think I was rock bottom, when Wildcard comes out to join me. I was kinda staring at her ring, and i think she was worried it was bothering me. She knew I was engaged, and didn't have a ring, so I assume she thought I was mourning the fact that I didnt have one. I wasnt. I reluctantly offered it back, and she reluctantly took it. Wildcard filled the silence with some more awkward conversation, which was helpful, I admit, and then we all headed back to base once dinner was done. Long story short, I didnt stay away from the whiskey. She and I became a little closer as the night went on, both mentally and physically. That being said, I had another episode, and stepped away for another long moment. By the time I came back, she was gone, so I went home too. It was on the way back, and even more so as I sobered up that I realized I liked wildcard a little more than I originally thought. I ended up telling Angel everything that happened, I couldnt help but be honest about everything, top to bottom. It kills me that she still understood how I felt, never once blamed me or attacked me for my wandering eye.

I'm left shaken. I dont know what to do. I spent an entire day just trying to get a handle on my thoughts, which of course never happened. I figure my attachment to Wildcard might just be because of the neglect on Angel's part. Or it could be that we have a genuine connection. Either way, I can't justify running to someone else, taking a leap of faith on someone I met one time in a drunken stupor. I find myself arguing back and forth in my mind about what I should do, who I should go to, or if I should just check out altogether, and see if either cares enough to come to me. Any advice?

Tldr:
I'm engaged, struggling with depression. Fiance is a saint, but thousands of miles away and growing neglectful. Got drunk and met a new girl who tries to help.

A month ago I was in Australia and I was struggling for money. I was working construction and had an injury so I was playing it safe and barely spending. I had a dream one night I vividly remember while I was out there and I thought I had it because I was missing home. In my dream I was outside my house taking a photo of the sky because of a nice sunset but the photo was ruined in my dream cause the field had all these lights in it. 
Fast forward to yesterday evening I was out having a smoke and I looked at the sunset and decided to take a picture I took it but as I took it I saw the same lights which I now realise were part of a temporary car park for a golf competition near my home. But the photo was identical to the dream I had.
I’ve never experienced anything like this before and I didn’t know about this golf competition while I was away. How could I have cooked this up in my head. I’m genuinely scared because this is t the first time this has happened.

So a few months ago my ex-girlfriend of 5 years decided to call it quits. She told me that the relationship was done a year before. I honestly do remember her telling me "" You know what? I'm done of living with you"" and to be honest I only took that as "" Well. Okay then atleast I'll still be with her"" I didnt paid much attention to it. I honestly thought that everything was going to be okay. She was still affectionate at first but later on through out the months she slowly stopped. It honestly started with her saying "" Stop telling me that you love me every second"" in my defense I truly did love her and I just wanted to let her know. Things kept going sort of normal. We would go to concerts, have road trips and have intercourse. 

Here's the thing. Even though she told me that wanted to live by herself she was still sort of affectionate. She would hold my hand and ask me how my day was sometimes she would tell me she missed me. 3 months before the relationship ended we had a big argument. The reason was that we were supposed to refinance the car we had to under her name. My phone was acting up and I asked her for her phone to check something. When i get the phone she receives a message saying from a guy"" Check your snapchat ;)"" I honestly got furious. I honestly thought that she was cheating on me and raised my voice ( I got cheated on in my previous relationship) and she kept telling me she didnt do anything. I cooled down and just let it go. The relationship went downhill after that. She became cold and didnt bother to be affectionate. 3 months pass and we move out, she gets her own apartment and I go back to my parents. She stops talking to me for a good 2 1/2 weeks and i have to say i was devastated. Like how does someone become so cold after 5 years? 

One day I decided to leave her a voicemail talking about how I missed her and then she replies 3 days later. While she didnt talk to me I started playing Pokemon Go with my little brother and man did that help a lot. I have to say I stopped eating at work and decided to only eat once a day. I picked up drinking with my friends. I'll leave my parents at 8pm and wouldn't come back till 4 in the morning and this would happen every weekend even after she started talking to me. 

Days pass by after we moved out and all of a sudden I get horrible back pain. I couldn't work properly and would always be in pain. Out of nowhere shes like "" when can you come over? And me like a stupid person replies "" I can come over tomorrow"" I go over and nothing happens. She insisted on me to sleep on her bed. I go to work the next morning and I wanted to tell her I missed her so i send her "" I want to say something but its awkward"" she replies with "" What? I have something to say too...I miss you ...now that's awkward"" and not going to lie that made me really happy. Later on shes like "" I miss living with you...you should come and move back in. You wouldn't have back pain if you lived with me."" Long story short she tells me that shes depressed because she lives by herself. To be honest I didn't reply to that with what she was expecting. I honestly didnt want to leave my parents. 

All of that comes to the present. I told her I had a nightmare where we were getting back together and out of nowhere some other guy shows up and starts kissing her. Keep in mind I woke up with in emotional pain.  Out of nowhere she just stops talking to me. She would look at my messages and claim she would always forget. I understand but not for every message. So the question is. How do I keep my mind off of her? Every day I wish to talk to her and honestly my depression has been acting up because she hasn't replied to me. I was doing so well until she brought out the "" I miss you...come move in with me"".

I honestly think shes trying to use me. I honestly wouldn't be surprised for her to ask me to pay half the rent if I ever ended up living with her again.",16Sep2019,3

I didn't have many friends at the time (and to be completely honest I still don't have that many). So I met this one guy, lets call him Bill. Bill was a great friend until up to recently. One day he just started making fun of me for me and my family's past. Ever since I was young, I always had this issue where I would cry at the smallest stuff. Bill knew very well of this and started to make fun of me for this. He also made fun of me because I used to really, really like this girl. He started telling people all about it and about how I used to cry over her. He always made fun of me for these things. I didn't think it could get any worse until he learned some information about my sister from many years ago. He learned that she used to cut herself. My sister used to think she was abused so when Bill heard about it, he also heard about her being ""abused."" So now all the time he makes jokes about me being abused and our family having a long list of people with a mental illness. Whenever I said something back, he says, ""wow that really makes me mad, time to go cut my wrists with box cutters."" It got even worse when I was diagnosed with aspergers. Now he always calls me a ""spurg"" and it makes me feel really badly about myself. He's made multiple songs (jingles?) about me that goes something along the lines of, ""(my name) going spurgy x50"" He keeps writing stories about me and my family and showing them to people and I just dont know what to do. He's also lied to my other friends and turned multiple of them against me. I can't tell any adults about this because of all of the stuff he has on me. He is also very smart and can make it look like I'm the one in the wrong. Any advice is appreciated. Bless you all.",16Sep2019,1

Hello everyone,

I (18) have been doing a lot of introspection recently to better understand myself. I've noticed a lot about myself but I think my biggest problem is my inability to retain strong relationships and I don't really know how to solve it by myself. I feel like I get really close to somebody and then choke up and become more distant. I think a majority of this stems from me having to move every 3 years during my childhood to 18, and I think it could be a sort of defense mechanism that I have to keep others at a distance to try and protect myself and my wellbeing.

The catalyst I guess would be me and my relationship with my best friend. She and I have grown incredibly close, especially during the past few months. I love her with all my heart, and she loves me with hers. But as we grow closer (we talk every day) I can't help but feel anxious or even annoyed when I receive a message from her. And I hate feeling that way, especially about the person that I've been closest to in the past 4 years. How do I stop feeling this way about her and with other people in general?

Thank you

(Extra info:

I don't really feel anything for her romantically or anything, and she doesn't with me either; that's neither here nor there though

Despite getting it with irl people as well, I've noticed that this happens more with people I primarily talk to online. I'm not sure why.)",16Sep2019,2

So there’s this girl, let’s call her M. I started liking M at the end of grade 8 and around winter of grade 9 I found out she shared the same feelings as I did. I had originally thought she liked my best friend and that’s what kept me from ever talking to her. Although knew this I would only occasionally talk to her and we went out one time. Time went by really fast and by the time I knew it it was already the end of the year. On the last day of school she sent this paragraph talking about how she was thankful for having me in her life and how we didn’t work out and how neither of us were ready. I was really sad over the whole summer because I had planned on doing a ton of stuff with her and I missed talking to her. I started school a month ago and we occasionally glance at eachother but we haven’t talked to eachother in 3 months. I really want her back and I regret never taking that risk to become her boyfriend.

238,"Hello all, I'm a 22yo male I came out a 6 year relationship on November last year and have had numerous hookups with girls after nights out but only 1 sober date. The date went okay but there was no real chemistry in my opinion, so I called the next date off. I still kind of had feelings for my ex girlfriend.

Anyhow, fast foward to now. 

My mother has been very unwell over the past few years and I had quit my job and left my flat on the other side of the country on a whim. 4 days after moving back to my hometown, she had unfortunately passed away (tuesday last week). I was glad I got to spend her remaining days with her, it was as if something had told me to come home and I was prepared for her passing as she has been in hospital for the past month (sepsis).

On Saturday night, a good friend of mine's sister had her 21st birthday party. I wasn't going to go due to feeling down about mum but I felt pretty good on the night, so I went. At one point, I clocked this beautiful girl who is exactly my type and I had said something to my friend beside me along the lines of ""Who's that gorgeous thing beside the door over there?"" to which he replied ""Oh that's my big sister""
...
...

""Oh right.. I never knew you had a sister..."" 

We laughed about it and he introduced me to her. We talked a little bit through the night at the house party and at the bar we all headed to after. I was pretty drunk but I think it all went well. I talked to my other freinds at the time and asked about her and they said she is recently just out of a 6 year relationship! They encouraged me to go and talk to her.

Some of us headed back to my friends when the bar closed and she was there too. Her mother and father were still there (they are close family friends of my friend) and they wanted to head back home as it was pretty late. As she was leaving I went outside and asked if I could take her number, she smiled and handed me her phone and I put in my number with a silly name.

Today when I got up and about I followed her instagram account because I couldn't remember what I put the name on her phone as and thought she maybe wouldn't be able to find it. We started talking a little bit and she said she's only here for a couple days then she goes back to her city, fortunately I am visiting family for a few weeks in that new city at the start of next month! I asked her if she would like to go for dinner and she has agreed, which I am delighted about.

My current situation is that I was planning on going to Africa to stay with my sister for a month or so. I was left a fair amount of money from my mother but I do not have a job and I dropped out from college when the breakup happened. I have the rented house in my hometown for another few weeks until I can organise a removal ect. I'm hoping that if things go well I could stay with my family in edinburgh until I can get back on my feet again.

I would really just like some advice about life in general and I need advice for the date too. Anything I should and shouldn't do if I really like this girl? I don't want to mess it up with her. The girl is 24 and graduated from university.

243,"So, I'm not a native English speaker and I tend to not be able to say everything what I want to say when I'm nervous. 

My roommate(A) has been very offensive. We live in  a suite with two rooms inside, and she lives in the other room. She woke me up constantly in the morning when I told her I'm a light sleeper and go to sleep late. She lets the door close loudly at 7 am, walks around, talks to her friends on the phone, leaves the water run for so long without using it. One morning I left my door open slightly after getting annoyed by waking up to her loud ass speaker phone call with her friends for about 30 min right in front of my room. She brought her friend to say unnecessary things about me right in front of the open door, stuff like ""is that her boyfriend in her room? Why does she have a living room chair?"" (I brought the chair in cause I was working with my bf on friday night on my desk. We have three more chairs and couches, she does not need one nor use it really) I didn't want to hear about her talking about me in front of my face so I walked up to the door and closed it. As soon as I did that, she said ""omg she's SO RUDE. I don't even care about my roommates. They are so annoying"" and left the suite with her friend and slammed the door so freaking loudly... I went outside to tell her ""I don't care what you think about me but I think you shouldn't be that loud in the morning to wake me up to your friend's voice over the phone. And someone's still sleeping inside."" 

She responded with, ""but you and your roommate(the other roommie who lives in my room) are loud at night too. Who? Your boyfriend? He shouldn't even be here! I don't want to talk about this. I gotta go""  

We(me and my roommie B) weren't loud. But if A thought it was loud, it's understandable and I'm willing to fix it. But A never tried to talk about it before. What she said made me think she was being passive aggressive because she thought we were loud at night. And my boyfriend doesn't leave my room. A doesn't even see him at all until she goes to sleep, and we always followed the residence hall rule about bringing the guest. Like escorting, being quiet, respectful, and etc. I felt very offended after this morning and A started slamming the door in and out after that. I tried to talk about it on the text, she replied back ""I suggest you not messaging me"" 

So I went to RA and he seemed pretty neutral, he said we should redo the agreement. I tried to explain about how I felt offended by A's behavior(talking about me and my boyfriend, saying I'm rude right in front of me). He didn't really care about that part. 

Today we did the agreement altogether again, I asked A to apologize for her behavior before we proceed because I don't want to agree to anything when she can't respect me. She started saying ""I never said that. I was just fixing my friend's shirt and that's all. Never said anything you said."" And RA added, ""I think there was a misunderstanding.""

But I clearly heard and saw her and her friend looking into my room and saying ""is that that boyfriend(you talked about) over there?"" And ""how (dare) she puts the common area chair in her room?"" And the only reason I closed the door was because I don't like hearing about myself in that way. Of course A claimed I ""slammed"" the door and that was rude. She doesn't think gossipping about me was rude, but also denied that she said such things at all. At this point it felt like both RA and A think I'm an international student who can't even really hear or understand what people say right in front of me with the door opened. I'm upset and also just don't understand how RA was toward A's side, listening to her reasons like ""I'm a grown up lady and I'm in a college for a reason."" I'm a junior, 21, have lived in the dorm until now, had no problems with former roommtes. My roommie B was a random roommate last year and we even decided to live together this year... there's even more than this incident she's done and I just don't know how I should get through this. At this point I feel like everything I'll do will upset her and she would attack me with every single move I make. It's hostile, uncomfortable, not anymore sure if I'm overreacting to her actions or not :/",16Sep2019,1
245,"Firstly, my dad isn’t a bad man. So I’m not going to cut him off. I need help talking to him. 

He just doesn’t listen. That’s his biggest problem. We can tell him not to mix two bags of different brands of cereals together. He’ll say ‘yep’ and a week later, the cereals will be mixed. 

And it happens a lot.  He used to go through my mum’s phone to delete texts to save space. There’s heaps of space on my mum’s phone. He’ll still do it. My mum will blow up at him, he’ll shut down and stop talking. It’ll blow over until it happens again.

I didn’t really care. It never caused much drama. I wasn’t going to start fights over cereal. And the fights happened from time to time but they always blow over.

Until recently, my dad did something we told him not to do and it hurt our pets. Not going into specifics here but that was the final straw.

He did listen once. He used to struggle reversing the car. All you have to do to reverse a car straight out a driveway is hold the wheel straight, and do slight adjustments based on the side mirrors. You would turn his head which ruins his perspective and turn the wheel wildly to the left and right to adjust. We would sometimes stand outside the car to help him, scream at him not to turn the wheel and he would still do it. There was one time when I was in the car and told him to use the mirrors, very calmly, encouraged him to back out at a snail pace using the mirrors. I tell him he did a good job. It worked. I said well done and he does it from now on. I say well done every now and then again when I’m in his car.

I need to replicate this effect, but it’s hard. Like ‘thanks for not mixing the cereals’ and ‘well done not deleting mum’s texts’ and ‘well done for not almost killing our pets’. That doesn’t really feel like natural sentences. 

Help. I need help communicating in a way he will listen.",16Sep2019,1

250," So, my girlfriend and some girls in her sorority are in a Homecoming dance competition in a few weeks. They have an on/off rivalry with another group, and while they really didn't want to do this event, they were basically forced to so now they are going all in on it just to beat them.

My girlfriend was tasked with mixing the music for the dance. So she invites me to listen her cut today, and I am real excited to listen to it. She is getting a music minor so I figured it would be pretty good.

But it sucked. As in totally unlistenable and undanceable. The intro is this weird sad vocal thing, not creepy like they were going for. The cuts come out of nowhere, are not on beat, and have really weirdly timed fade ins and outs. Finally, she pirated all the music so it's compressed to all hell.

So, me being an asshole and one caught off guard, I basically tell her that it is awful. Catching myself, I politely offer some suggestions for making it potentially bearable. But she doesn't have time to fix it this week and said that she probably would just leave it like it is. I offer to make a re-cut, but she ADAMANTLY refuses, and she says if I do she is going to be really upset.

So, me being an asshole, I make the recut anyway. It's like 7/10. Not great, but loads better than what she made. It was actually really fun an only took about an hour. But now I don't know what to do with it. Should I keep it to myself? Should I tell her? Should I quietly send it to her group mates so they don't embarrass themselves? I'm actually kind of proud of this thing and I want it to be useful.

The only reason I remember any of this is by going through super old emails the other day when i was bored.

I know a guy at my Discord channel where we put all types of content, one of them memes.

Using vaccines is useless since other, new and more deadly diseases, will still be appearing in the future so what's the point. Vaccines are out there only so the pharmaceutical industry gets the money from us (the pharmaceutical part is partly true but they lose money by giving us vaccines, so...).

I really tried to calmly have a conversation with him about this topic, giving facts, graphs (all graphs are not real in his understanding, they are all forget for the best interest of the creator) and reasoning on why it's terrible to not vaccinate, not only for yourself but also for the whole community. In short, he doesn't believe in logic and hate our fact-driven society. He only listens to intuition and hunches and they tell him that if he ever had a child he won't vaccinate him. Black death, that wiped out 30-60% of Europe, is just a natural course of life and it what makes life life. I should be like this.

It's the first time I have stumbled with such a close-minded person and just won't budge his opinion and always tries to find a reason not to believe in it... I really feel that those kind of people need help to show them the consequences of their actions (being antivax not only hurts themselves but the whole society). 

How do you approach this kind of people? Is it even possible to change their views? I am really at a loss",16Sep2019,2

260,"this is so stupid and i don’t really have a train of  thought but i didn’t think it would be this difficult. it’s been 3 weeks and i’m changing my major. i don’t know what i want to do with my life man. i feel so lost and like such a disappointment. i haven’t wanted to actually kill myself since my junior year in high school but this week you know how many times i thought about doing it? every single second of the day. i hate being alive. i have no passion to do anything and if i do then i’m too scared to pursue it. i just want something i can be happy with for the rest of my life you know? 

honestly the reason i picked chemistry was to impress my parents. the reason i did AP and honor classes was to make them happy but they never gave a shit man. i became a pharmacy technician in illinois after taking a difficult ass class for a year but they don’t care. i did chemistry so i can go to pharmacy school and become someone my parents could be proud of but i just can’t. i’m miserable. i threw up out of nowhere for the past two day and you know what i ate in the past two days? one taco. i lost my appetite. i lost any sense of enjoyment in anything. i can’t even watch tv shows with crying about school. 

i just want to help people. i know that sounds cheesy and dumb but it’s all i want. you know that feeling you get after had a shitty day and you come home but you’re excited because your favorite show is having a new episode tonight and in the moment of watching the show, you’re just there. you feel content with life, no shitty day at work or school can take that feeling away. i want to give people that feeling. i want to make people happy. i’m not saying i want to become an actress but i just want to give people happiness.",16Sep2019,2
262,"College freshman, been here for about a month now. I don’t have many friends here, really only my suite-mates, but the strange thing is all of my suite-mates are only friends with each other. 8 of us in total. 

I go to a really top art school (literally not bragging at all, it’s relevant). Kids dress super out there and it’s sick. I noticed all kids that dress in a similar style all navigate towards each other and all friends. The goth girls who smoke cigarettes. The skater boys with dyed hair and painted nails. You get the picture. I just dress average. Basic jeans, casual sneakers and plain t-shirts mostly. I don’t really know why I went to an art school; I’m not really talented in the arts, but I’m going for psychology. I was conditioned in a very racist, sexist town and obviously that’s very different here. I went here for the change of that, as I’m bisexual and can be open about it, and I love the environment, I just feel like an outsider. I don’t want to keep this too long. It’s already a month in and all the freshman already have their own cliques, but I don’t really like my suite-mates. They’re nice and all but don’t make me feel too good about myself, they constantly make fun of me for just my laugh or my clothes and other arbitrary things. They’re more just treated me as a lackey. Any ideas on how to make this first year at college better for myself?",16Sep2019,1
263,"Okay , I need advice or a better understanding of myself. 

For some reason I have always been outgoing and made people laugh and comfortable wherever I go, people say they love me blah blah bullshit, but I notice  all of these friends and from all these different jobs I never really make any actual friendships from them? Not only in the workplace but when I was in high school as well, it seemed I always had a shit ton of people to laugh with and talk to but no one after hours, of that made any sense? Maybe I am just overthinking it but I just don’t understand what to fix with myself to turn some of these work relationships into friendships. 

I recently graduated high school (2018) and noticed who I really cared about and who I didn’t, but it is much harder I guess to make friends now that I am not in a fixed setting so any tips on how to make friends once out of HS. Not in college currently.

* There is an ice wall running all around the edge of the world, and if asked where it is, he will show you a video allegedly taken by the US military in the 1950's of what looks like the arctic... 
* There is a layer in the sky called the firmament, and this keeps everything inside the world (gases etc.)
* Above the firmament is water, and when it rains, its the water seeping through (he refuses to even consider the possibility of the water cycle)
* There is no such thing as gravity
*  The sun goes around the Earth
* No one has ever been to space
* AIDS was invented by the CIA to kill the blacks 
* There is no such thing as evolution (""We didn't come from monkeys! How come there are still monkeys then? How come we evolved and they didn't?!"")
* AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST
* There was no such thing as dinosaurs, paleontologists are just people who make fake bones out of clay to put in museums

And if you ask him why anyone would lie about these things, he answers either with...

1. Why would they tell the truth?
2. Because they are hiding God.

268,"Let me preface this with the info that I grew up almost exclusively in all-girls surroundings and have only dated once - I really don’t know what to do. TL;DR at the bottom. 

I matched this guy on a dating app two weeks ago. Conversations are great, he’s candid about the positive way he feels and he’s definitely trustworthy. 

We went on a date this past Saturday and spent a whopping 16 hours together. I enjoyed it. Most of it, at least. I found that in person, I’m not as attracted to him as I am behind the screen of a phone. I feel so bad saying this.. I tried to break it down and figure out why I don’t feel the urge to hold his hand or be close to him physically, yet weirdly enjoy spending time with him. Looks are ruled out cos he’s an 8 out of 10 in that department. I think it comes down to the way he speaks - he’s higher pitched, excited and animated and I’m more naturally attracted to quiet and calm people. That’s all I can think of. 

I need advice on whether it’s my problem that I should grow out of or if it’s something that is just within me, and I should end this so I don’t waste his time? I really don’t want to be wasting his time because he’s truly a great person.

TL;DR: Matched with a great guy on dating app, but not attracted in person (most probably) because of he way he emotes.",16Sep2019,1

272,"First, I’d like to ask if anyone has a list of symptoms that patients with lung difficulties due to vaping have experienced. I’ve been trying to compare my symptoms but haven’t been able to find any detailed reports online of the events that led up to people being hospitalized.

The pain in my chest has gotten worst (started on Friday) and I am terrified.

I went to the doctor today with my parents but couldn’t tell them my concerns with my mom in the room. I ended up getting prescribed something for acid reflux because I couldn’t tell them I’ve been vaping. 

I will be going to another doctor this Wednesday to get my yearly vaccines and would like to know how I can talk to my doctor privately/ if they would tell my mom my concerns. 

Who knows, it may be nothing. I hope to god it really is just acid reflux. But my symptoms just feel really strange. Please just give me advice. I haven’t even been able to talk to my close friends about this because I’m embarrassed for even thinking it. I don’t know.

I’ve realized recently that no one really texts me first unless they want something, or think I’m depressed (lots of stuff just went down and it was hard, I’m not though). I had two really good friends but I’ve inadvertently pushed them both away, one because I rejected her sexual advances and the other because of a dumb thing I said while sleep deprived. It seems like all the people I’m close with just kind of disappeared all at once. I’m so bored now. I want to talk to people, but I’m tired of feeling like the backup friend. I want to go out and do things, but don’t have anyone to do things with. College has started and that makes it a little easier, but I know it’s just acquaintances of circumstance. I’m working on actually befriending people I’d like to talk to more, and am doing a decent job of it, but that still brings me vack to the issue of not wanting to be the backup friend.

276,"The past few years my brother in law has started doing cocaine. My partner has been telling me it’s just casual don’t worry about it. Everytime we see his brother we fight as let’s name him Bill. Bill has offered and snorted the cocaine in front of me. He talks about drugs, has people coming around and he has been dealing. 
The fact is Iv been with Bills brother for 6 years and  the past two have been a downward spiral. He gets really agitated and extremely aggressive vocally. Any time something doesn’t go right he is always yelling and acting way to aggressive.  To the point the last encounter I was shaking and felt really scared. 

My partner and Bill are completely opposite, last weekend they were round visiting. Bill earlier that day had 23 beers. We picked them up from a party and as soon as he walked in to our house he snorted cocaine on our kitchen bench twice in a span of 20 minutes, when we asked him not to. He treated me and my partner like shit all weekend, walked all over us. Had no respect for rules in our house. My partner has started to understand what I have been trying to tell him for the past few years as he is addicted. 
Since that incident we decided before they left we would sit down and stated we don’t appreciate you coming into our home and belittling us and treating us like shit. We told our concerns to Bill he listened but when the drug talk came up he got angry and stormed off yelling and screaming. In that conversation Bill stated “I fucking love cocaine ” also “I built my business around it so you don’t know nothing”.  

Every time I’m around him now I’m on edge and don’t like the environment and tension in the air. He scares me. My question is since the conversation ended on his terms because of a tantrum. He is not wanting to listen we are now in the dilemma that we should tell the parents. If you had a son our daughter would you want to know if they are doing drugs?

278,"I've found a pattern in my life where I tend to give every ounce of care and attention to those who feel indifferent towards me. As someone who is extraverted, I am attracted to the loners and the introverts by default, the people who tend to blend into the background or like to keep to themselves. Many times, especially with guys, I have found that I will develop romantic feelings and strong attachments to them. I'll develop a friendship with them and get them to open up to me, often finding out they are severely depressed and carry a ton of baggage. I am insanely empathetic and I tend to carry other people's burdens on my shoulders once I learn about them. I want to fix these people, and I end up getting really invested in their lives to the point where I hurt myself. I want to be their person, but they never end up making any effort to show that they want the same. I give and give and give without them even asking for it, and I have a hard time walking away and keeping my dignity. I've found that these people are completely apathetic to whether I am in their life or not. This destroys my self worth and self confidence. I always wonder, why am I not enough for them? What am I missing? This trend keeps happening to me. How do I stop it?

\*\* I also want to add and say that these guys would make comments like, ""Everyone leaves."" and I'd be sitting there, thinking, ""I'm here! I won't leave!"" But it's not enough. I'm not what they want. I even asked one guy from my past, and frankly, he just said I wasn't pretty. Sometimes I think you can have the best personality, you can make them laugh and have long, deep conversations, but if you're not physically attractive, you've lost.

Well today, he ended up having to leave his house early, so he asked me to come at 4. We texted throughout and kind of updated each other (me about his dog and him about his date). It was around 9 and he said he was still out with his date, said he might be out for another hour. I said fine (thinking he'd pay me extra) and I wasn't just going to leave his dog alone and leave. He didn't get home until 10:30. I kind of casually brought up that I thought it was only going to be from 5-9 (twice). He just said, ""shoot ya, things got kind of hectic today. I felt weird pressing him since I brought it up twice already. The money isn't really the issue for me. It's the principle.

280,"2 months ago, someone I knew came to me and told me that they have a strong feeling that they were going to die pretty soon. Initially I dismissed this as anyone would.

They came around again and upon probing they disclosed information to me that they were going to die because they had left an occult whose members join ‘ for life’, meaning there can never exit and whoever exits will be killed.

This sounds like something out of a horror movie and if you don’t have the required knowledge, it does sound mad.

Moving on, (redacted redacted ) told me that if they do die in the next month or so, please be sure to tell my family about this.

I am a freelance SI ( Spiritual Investigator) pay is not good btw.

I installed pinhole cameras in the church that ( redacted redacted ) told me was the place where ‘meetings’ took place. (I did this because, my intuitive senses were going off, and they never go-off unreasonably)

On a full moon night (which for some fucked up reason, happens to always be when evil shit happens, idk why) there was the church leader, talking to a dark figure. It seemed as if though he was making some sort of offering. Upon seeing this, I immediately called (redacted redacted) and told him to meet me in the morning as I felt the waning moon would bring about something negative.

The next morning, he never showed up. I kept calling endlessly only for the mother to answer the phone is audible distress. She reported me to the police thinking I was the gang leader in which lead to her son’s ‘overdose’.

After being taken in for questioning, I was released because the coroner could not determine the cause of death. (there were no drugs involved at all, the kid was as healthy as any 18 year old).

I am now faced with this crazy task of telling the parents what happened. I do my work in private and I have not been able to solve this case because the church leader is well respected. What am I meant to do?

It brings me a great sense of frustration because I know I only have one shot at this so called 'pious church leader'.

My questions are.

Why did the kid die?

How did he know he was going to die?

What was the cause of death?

How did he join this occult?

How the fuck is a church leader going to live a double life?

What happens if I expose him?

I have so many questions and I need to ensure that I take the right course to fix this problem without sounding like a madman to the parents or the police.

What if I am ostracised for even being involved in such things, let alone planting cameras without people knowledge in a property that is not mine.

I wasn’t able to go to school because I didn’t have any stability in my mental illness. I am a miracle case because I healed from lifelong abuse with endless therapy and retreats and books and people who love me. I had 1 dream and it was to heal and be happy and I can honestly say that I achieved that. At one point I was constantly wanting to commit suicide and I cried every single day for years. For the last two years, I only cry when there is a situation to cry about. I’ve caught up to normal! 
I dedicated a year to facing all my fears and I was able to start driving, ride a motorcycle, walk across a suspension bridge, jump off a diving board, and live alone and independently. All of those which were impossible at one point because I lacked courage. 
I now work a stable sales job. I was thinking about how I have created the competence to do my job and a big client base. So it doesn’t cause too much stress to work. I’ve had the job for 6 years. I could go part time and still maintain an income. I have more mental space for learning. 
I’ve been thinking about going to school because sales jobs will always be available and now that my mind as cleared up, I think I can truly focus at school and do something with my life with purpose. I want change.

290,"Ok, at this point in life I have absolutely no idea what to do with her. People tell me siblings are supposed to not get along but she is INSANE.

Firstly, she is the oldest out of the sisters and my parents have bought her everything. A laptop for when she went to college, brand new study desks, beds and clothes. My sister would never let them buy me anything by always telling my mom that I had money because I worked. EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS A JOB. At first it was “but I’m in college” and she continued to never have money even though she works. So, I can’t even remember the last thing my parents bought me because she dosnt let them spend on me.

This continues onto my second point. She steals money from me. When I first got my credit card, I had a really good point system and she kept making me buy her things promising me she would pay me back. She became 500+ in debt to me. She ended up paying me back 100 dollars but I had to yell at her and I ended up getting into serious trouble because she victimized herself to my parents. I let go of the rest because but she said “the rest were gifts to me and taxes don’t count”. I just didn’t want to be in trouble anymore so I let go. 

Also, instead of actually working and making money, like she claims to be, she’ll go to clubs and stay overnight with her boyfriend. I always back her up and let my parents think what she wants them to think. Then when I do one bad thing such as go to a bar with my friends, my sister tells my mother all of it plus lies such as me sleeping with two guys in two days (never happened). This is to make herself seem innocent??? But till this day my parents don’t know anything about the lies that she’s said. For example, last night ( a Saturday) she came home at 2 am claiming she was studying all night. My mom then in the morning started nagging at me saying “why can’t you be like your sister and study harder?!” And I just sit there like WHAT THE FUCK MOM. But I didn’t say anything though I kept my mouth shut.

Thirdly, she has a very serious sense of entitlement. My parents have given her as much as they could through life. She cried for a BMW for months on end and my parents bought one for both me and her. She was supposed to teach me on the car but ended up making me drive one hour a week and fill up 90+ dollars of gas for her. When I would refuse to do so, she would blackmail me by threatening to tell my mother lies that aren’t true. But in order for me to get a little bit of driving I would pay. One time my mother said “Let’s go pick your sister up, you can drive there and back to practice”. When my sister saw me behind the wheel she said “Your paying gas next time” WHAT I WAS PICKING HER UP! But now her friend got a Benz and she’s been yelling at my parents asking why they got her a shitty car and how it uses so much gas and how she wants a Benz now. Also, when there isn’t food in the house that she likes she’ll start screaming saying “ why isn’t there anything to eat, mom and dad your so shitty you don’t buy anything”. My parents told her to start helping with rent and grocery bills and she said “no I will buy my own food then”. I payed my mom 100 bucks for some goodie and then in the end my sister ate everything I bought for myself. When I yelled at her my dad told me I had to learn to share... She talks to me some days and says “imagine if our parents were filthy rich and not the shitty lazy parents they are, I deserve a rich guy in the future like I’m attractive I’ll probably get one”. I then get pissed off that she says those things and then she’ll start going at me.
ADDITIONALLY, my sister goes for guys that I talk to if she thinks they are attractive. I used to date this guy and my sister said he was shitty and made me break up with him. He then asked for her snap and... they started talking. She would then laugh in my face and say, I’m bored should I go out with him? And taunt me. :( Every guy I talk to she’ll always make a comment on how they would dump me for her or how they wanted her at one point.

Also, I’m not allowed to copy her style... so basically wear anything trendy. If I wear all black, she claims I’m trying to be her. If I wear makeup she yells at me because she dosnt want me copying her. So, I don’t wear makeup or wear black because Im not allowed. For example, when we were kids I wanted to snowboard. She denied me of snowboarding because she wanted to do it. Then today, I’m going through my closet and see every single lulu item I have is gone. My sister has been eyeing my joggers for a while and I know she’s taken them. When I confront her and ask to look in her closet she yelled at me and threatened to beat me up if I walked into her room. So there went all my lululemon items.

Additionally, my friends told me to stand up for myself and not let my sister shit on me. When my sister found out she told me to stay away from all of them and talked so much shit to everyone and told me blood is blood and I shouldn’t allow for anyone to say hurtful things about her. She ended up destroying all my friendships and this summer I ended up having no one to be with. Then she began to hang out with a group of very very not nice girls who I used to be friends with in high school. They claimed I was an entilted bitch who thought I was cool because I was in university and I had an insane attitude. My sister would proudly tell me that she thinks that too. Plus every day my sister makes a comment on how ugly or fat I am.. even though my weight is perfectly fine. With her I never say things like that but rather tell my sister the truth. For her to get her act together. She almost was kicked out of university twice, but when I tell her to study instead of hang out with her boyfriend and go clubbing she calls me an entitled brat. Then when she sees my GPA she claims it’s not fair that I was “born smart”... I just work hard!

So in the end here I am crying about how my sister loves to take everything good away from me. From spitting on my mom, to her stealing my clothes, a lot of my anxiety, stress and low self confidence roots from my sister just torturing me my entire life, my psychiatrist even told me that. But she couldn’t comment on what I need to do for my sister to leave me alone?

So I need advice. Moving out or leaving the family isn’t an option. I don’t know how to deal with her. When I yell I get in trouble but if I do nothing I lose money, clothes and the ability to do things that she does. She’s throwing away her life and when hers gets shitty she drags me down. Am I just crazy? Are all siblings like this?",16Sep2019,2
291,"I have so many questions. Mainly, how do I move up from being broke-ass as fast as possible? I plan to rent or lease a house or apartment of my own while also working to provide myself income &amp; attending community college for a 2-year business associate. I plan to live in either Kauai or Oahu, Hawaii. I grew up in Molokai, but it's so ghetto/rural so making it here is so much of a struggle that it isn't even worth it.

I've worked one job as a summer day camp counselor this past summer and plan to work there again next summer (boss really likes me) so I'd have about $2500 saved, and that's my only job experience.

Everyone tells me I'll be making minimum wage ($10.10/hr), or just *barely* above that until I'm like 25, and I'll be dead-end, living in the projects, barely able to afford a house, car, and food, never be able to travel or go out to venues until I'm making $100K. Please tell me there's a way out of this, I don't wanna be living on the edge, paycheck to paycheck, never able to afford anything fun until I'm an old man.

I'm not looking for an *easy* way into having a good quality of life, I'm just looking for a *fast* way to get there with the plans I have.",16Sep2019,1

I actually have a Master's degree in cybersecurity and that's the field I want to get a job in. However I had a little experience in digital marketing and I was badly in need of money so thats the reason I took this job in the first place. Its been a month and I have learnt that this company has no vision the owner is very rude and completely un professional and doesn’t know how to run a business. On top of all this its been a month and I am the only person wokring in this office and he has been telling that he will hire people but hasnt hired a single person until now due to him being a miser and the business running in loss. Also, even though he hired me for digital marketing he is making me do all the works except that. Our office is connected to the warehouse, so he asked me to lock all the warehouse doors all the gates and check all the equipments and trucks and report if anything is missing before leaving everyday which takes an extra 30 minutes for me. Apart from this I need to handle if any customers come in and do the job of a sales man as well. So I got fed up and finally decided to quit. But the problem is there's a 4 week notice and if I quit without giving that I need to pay 3 weeks salary as a penalty. Also, I don't know how long I can manage with the finances I have right now as I am unsure how long will it take for me to get another job.

I wanted to get some advice about application for universities, specifically in canada. I am a senior in high school and the thought of applications are scaring me. For advice, specifically, I want to know how to answer the personal profile section of the application. Questions in the section are questions like what is important to you or who are you?

294,"Alright so background info to start this off, we are both 21 and live in washington state and have been planning to move to maine for over a year, we live with my fiancee's two parents and her two sisters (23 and 19) my fiancee has been planning to move to maine for over four years and its been sort of this dream for her, and I'm also very much in love with it after doing research and looking into life there. her original plan was to move alone but her family eventually decided they want to go as well and actually made plans to sell the house. Growing up her father was very emotionally abusive, he would get extremely drunk, break down doors, scream at his kids, tell them he hates them and wish they were never born and that they're the source of his problems, my fiancee used to barracade her door every night to keep him from breaking in and screaming at her in the middle of the night, eventually he got somewhat better, I moved in eventually and within a couple months he was drinking heavily again and eventually a night came where he freaked out again, tried to break into our room while screaming about how much he hates his kids and when his wife came home he was screaming so much I ended up calling the cops out of fear for her. after that he quit drinking for about a month and is now drinking again but nothing quite that bad. now in another situation my fiancee has been sexually harassed by a longtime family friend her entire life and neither of her parents have ever stood up for her, it got very much worse this last year while she was working with her mother and said family friend and when she tried to get her mother to help her out, the response she got was to ""stand up for herself or get over it"" but she honestly had a hard time doing that because after years of this she's just terrified of the man, she eventually quit cause it wasnt worth it. Recently her parents invited the family friend who has sexually harassed her (and her sisters as well) to a going away party, my fiancee was understandably upset but her parents told her to get over it and her father especially made a big deal of it saying that he wouldnt let something like that bug him so much. Her parents recently sold the house and are making a purchase on a multi family home maine, me and my fiancee would have our own unit with cheap rent but would have to rely on her parents for quite a while. Alternatively we can stay in washington and live with my parents until we find an apartment (i have a large supportive family here)  I have my gauranteed job here but rent prices are higher here than we would pay in maine. At this point neither of us can make a sound decision on what we should do and need the opinions of strangers to help us think clearly.

298,"Sorry, this is a long one...

So my ex and I have known each other for about 8 years. We had always been just friends and both of us were also in relationships with other people, until last year around this time when we started dating. We had a pretty serious relationship, said I love you’s, talked about our future, where we’d live, kids names, etc. Well we were in a long distance relationship for part of our relationship because I transferred universities and moved an 8 1/2 hour drive away. (Had plans to transfer schools before we started talking, this school has a awesome program that I’m in). We broke up during summer, partly due to not knowing if we wanted to continue with long distance the next few years until I graduate and partly because he said he didn’t want a girlfriend anymore. Well I got over our relationship and so did he. I am best friends with his cousin and close to his family so I saw him many times after we broke up, hung out once alone and talked often after we saw each other. Still stayed just friends because we knew I was leaving soon. So I left for school and pretty much since a few days before I left we have been talking constantly and FaceTimed multiple times. He gets jealous when I mention that I am going to hang out with guys and constantly flirts and tells me that he still cares about me. I told him that I didn’t want to flirt anymore because I didn’t want to develop feelings again and I think I am starting to now. We still talk because we have been friends for so long and he is coming to stay with me in December to attend a concert together that I got us tickets for, for his birthday when we were dating. I don’t want to stop talking to him because I don’t want it to be weird when he comes to go to the concert but I also don’t want to develop feelings because I feel like it would take away from me being able to pursue anyone else if I’m still flirting and talking to my ex (which I know is a bad idea/unhealthy) I just don’t know what could make me stop developing feelings for him again and what would be the best way to go about it to where we can stay just friends.

He is quite a few years older than me so obviously he has dated a lot of people, but me being the introvert I am made him my first. It has however been very difficult for him to make me cum and I know it hurts his self esteem but there is nothing I can do. Now last night he wanted to try something new so we decided to try bondage earlier this week. When the time finally came he opened a shoe size box in his cupboard and pulled out this whole bondage rig and it actually broke my heart. Now I know he is entitled to his past and all but the thought that he has done things like this with his ex and maybe even more probably with no trouble making her cum just makes me feel... Useless.

302,"Background: Few weeks back I started talking with this girl who went to my old school over text and we have a bunch of great discussions about topics we like, so I decide to ask her to join me for a bit of golf. For one, this was a big mistake, b/c she'd never golfed before and 90% of the date ended up being me telling her how to improve her swing after every shot.

We weren't able to have a halfway decent coversation because of how akward it was with my brother around. Yes my 7 year old brother, who my mom dropped off with the two of us while she went on an errand. (She did this on purpose and later said I should've been glad my brother was ""looking out for me,"" and not out of necessity b/c she didn't have anyone to watch him.) With him there, I psyched myself out with how akward it was with him standing around. i asked him so many times to go sit on a nearby couch but he would just not piss off. Anyways I kinda froze up when it came to convo topics which was why I was only able to focus on the golf, and by the end of it I was so pissed at myself for that and at my mom that I just told her off to her car when she asked what we do after we hit all the range balls, and just dipped. 

Anyways now I seem like a total dweeb to her, and I tried fixing it by asking her to see a movie by a director we both love, the same weekend, but she tells me she has a ton of hw and she'll get back to me, and the day when I ask to confirm whether she's coming or not she ""fell sick."" Tbh I get it. I totally see why she'd pull the ""sick"" card, can I really blame her after that first date shit with my brother? My friends told me to jokingly mention my brother not being there when I pitched the idea, but my literal robot ass couldn't find a smooth way to play it off as a joke.

Anyways I can guarantee she's every single iota of respect or interest in me, b/c ever since, what little text convos we have now are way more vapid, compared to the actual paragraphs of genuine enjoyable discussion we had before.

303,"I went through a somewhat transformative breakup a few years ago that led me to work really hard on my personal and mental health. Through that, I eventually started getting out and dating again, nothing serious, and had an opposite baby. Both of us made a bit of a pact to put the kid first at all times and try not put our relationship in the way of raising this kid the right way. That being said the relationship hasn’t really had any issues. Unfortunately, I’m just not really head over heels for this woman.... don’t get me wrong, she’s way hotter than I deserve, she’s smart, and can be very funny sometimes, but she’s also kinda needy, and very codependent, and I find myself hiding my annoyances just to avoid ever actually fighting. 

Before we had our kid, I found out that my Ex’s mom was essentially dying from a degenerative disease and that she was in a terrible mess in her life beyond the death sentence. I rushed to find and talk to her the same day I found out and, of course, my ex was there... we embraced and talked about what was happening with her and her mom and honestly it just felt right being together talking again. She was my best friend for 10 years so turning off those feelings I guess had not happened in the year that passed since we last spoke. 

We met a few more times, never in secret, and just talked about where life was going for her and her mom. Then she told me that she still loved me.... and my world fell apart. Very soon after we had my child. And I put all of my energy into giving my son everything I didn’t have growing up. He’s almost two and I’ve tripled my income, provide 100% of the stability financially for our little family unit and I spend every night laying awake, just like tonight, thinking about how I’m not living my life for myself anymore, and that, maybe, I don’t get to have a love story. We moved across the country for the job opportunity of a lifetime, and I have never felt so lonely in my entire life. 

I don’t know what to do... I don’t want my child raised in the turmoil and pain that I did in a split family. But i know that I will never love my girlfriend the way I love my ex. Aside from my child, my ex is the person I love and have ever loved above all others. I’ve spoken to numerous therapists and they have all said that time heals such wounds, and yet, more than three years later I still cry secretly. I take the long route home and just sit in silence not wanting to return to the lie that I’m living.... how can I stop feeling this way...",16Sep2019,2
304,"I’m 21F have been in a relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years, 21M. Our parents do not know about us, we are not allowed to date anyone. We are authentically Indian and our parents expect us to date/marry people from same caste*, we belong to different castes, but same religion and same city back in India. I moved to the US, two years back, we have been in a long distance relationship for 2 years now. I spent my whole summer with him, I lied to my parents and he lied to his. We miss each other way too much.  This summer was the best thing ever, that’s how with envision our life. The distance is almost 8000 miles and we can’t yet afford that sort of air fares regularly. He recently proposed me, and I haven’t yet said anything to me. I want to marry him and I want to live with him. I’m a pre-med and I want to go to med school in a year or two, he recently got his BA in game design and is an amazing artist. We really need each other at this point in life, I don’t have much friends because I’m shy and introverted, also the result of my parents behavior towards me. I feel so alone about not being about to share my thoughts, I’m on the verge of getting depressed. We wouldn’t have felt the need to get married this soon if we were in the same city. I will have to lie to my parents and he will have to lie to his parents, we will have to get married secretly and keep lying to our parents about us. Career wise, I need someone to live with I’m under so much pressure I’m a senior and will need to give MCAT and application process soon, nobody supports my dream like he does, my parents think that I’m wasting my time and I won’t be successful, for him, he just completed his bachelors and is working as an intern right now. It will take us two years to get him here if we get married, he will have some experience in the field and can easily relocate, get part time master’s degree and a good full time job. Fast forward 4 years, when I have my MD and he has a better paying job in the US, we plan on telling our parents and do the whole thing again for their satisfaction, if they will ever agree. Note that there is no way we can come clean to them, they will disown us that very moment. 
He understands my family background and my insecurities and he not the one to bluff he is the man of his word, and we completely trust each other and we’re very open about importance or conversation and being vocal, and expressing feelings the right away. This is the message he sent me when we were discussing this topic:
“we cant ever be divorced we wont cheat we wont beat each other up i wouldnt  rape you after marriage i wouldn’t be working snd come home watch tv while eating your cooked food and then call you to bedroom after you wash dishes and then take your clothes off lay you down and cum inside you in 5 minutes and get off u and sleep and expect you to take pills responsibly next morning snd sleep and i wouldn’t ask for money from your parents i wouldn’t leave you after greencard i wouldn’t steal from your father i wouldn’t bitch about you to my friends i wouldn’t go out have sexual relations with anyone i wouldn’t want you to quit your doctor job/study and be home cooking and cleaning for me, an under paid employee”

This is literally the opposite of how most women in my community are treated, he is saying everything so that I feel comfortable and so that I know that I’m right choosing him, and that I will not go through what my sisters and aunts go/went through. I’m very proud of him for doing it, it tells me that he thinks about me so much and that I don’t have to be sacred and I’m safe with him.

I need your suggestions, please understand that we love our parents and are very grateful for everything they’ve done for us, but we also love each other. We also think that we’re missing out on a lot of things, only because of our oppressive, overprotective and conservative parents, and that it’s not worth sacrificing us or our career flow.",16Sep2019,1

310,"I know the title seems a bit absurd and silly, as I obviously should use my degree to get a job in that field.... Which lies the problem.

Background:
I am currently a graduate student in computer science. In my undergrads I got 2 degrees in computer science and business management. Currently I've had 2 summer internships with summer teaching programs across the east coast where I was the net admin and taught lots of kids programming and tech stuff in many different states and cities. I also have an assistantship with a completely different department than comp sci where I do everything from handle marketing and promotional material for student retention throughout the college, to handling events and staff organization, to teaching staff about new technologies to be utilized in the classroom. At the same time I run 3 clubs and I am extremely active around the University by helping faculty and staff plan large events frequently. In my free time I have lots of small projects at home involving Arduinos and lights, or game projects in Unity, and making music. I do alot of different things all the time.

Which there lies the problem. I have a general understanding of most things as I really enjoy figuring out how everything works, I feel like there might not be alot of other people that fall into my shoes, but I have a passion for problem solving. I literally want to do every job from being the software programmer that sits behind a desk for a day, to the Organization manager that restructures entire businesses, to the event coordinator for huge events involving thousands of staff and vendors all coming together for attendees. I want to teach at a university level where I can help students learn about tech and programming. I want to teach audio engineering and production. Etc....

There's so many things I want to do, and literally there is no job for such a wide range of stuff. Being a university professor was always gonna be a late game profession, but I want to do a bunch of stuff before I go to teach at least, so I have that much figured out. I've talked to lots of different career center staff and lots of resources around my university. They are all encouraging in ""you'll find it soon."" But like, there's not a lot of time left for me. I'm graduating with my masters in comp sci next year.

There's an opportunity coming up where we students have tables setup and we get to talk about our projects as employers come around to see who's the best. My resume is stacked so I'm not worried about them thinking I'm not qualified, but it's like ""wtf job you goin for here son?""

We're ready to start doing some no-holds-barred real-world testing on this baby. And we need serious testers who are going to be willing to do beta-testing with our app.

There are absolutely NO strings attached, nothing to buy. We just need real-world feedback from people who are finding the ways to capture Articles, Videos, Screens and anything else on the web. If you are looking for a tool that will significantly SAVE all your Researches, Web Clippings, Screen Captures, Links, Stories from (Flipboard's, Kindles, Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitters, Instagram, Youtube) and all in one App then this may very well be it. But we need to put it to the test, and that's where you come in!

To qualify as a beta-tester, you need to meet these requirements:

\- You have to have a Chrome Browser only.

\- Or you could be a Kindle User

*Note: At this stage, we are looking to get a total of 50 beta-testers using the platform. Once we see everything is running smoothly, we'll add another round of beta testers in the coming days/weeks. So if you don't get a spot initially, you'll be added to our waiting list, no worries!*

If you're interested, please PM me and I'll give you the next steps!

313,"To start things off I used to have a really toxic friend group that would constantly exclude me from a lot of things and would often ditch me. This obviously left a dent in my self-esteem (which was already low) and gave me insecurites. Some of the insecurites I have were about my wieght and image. On top of having all that, I was also quitley (and still am) suffering from depression. I never got any real help for it so it damaged me. I have a friend group now which I love to hang out with and arnet toxic like that other friend group but I still feel like they don't actually like me and are going to ditch me. We have plans to go hang out later in October for a festival but I'm having second thoughts because of my issues. These issues already almost made me miss out on going out with my friends to the movies. I just always have a thought lingering there that they're going to ditch me.

314,"I'll try to keep it short, I can be long winded. If I need to be specific in comments that also works.

Around January of 2018 I started talking with a girl from work (a coworker kind of ignited things between us) and over the course of the next year we went through ups and downs. She was in a relationship at the time, and I, having little experience with women and low self esteem ignored a lot of red flags and also misread a lot of things as well. Some of the time it felt like a genuine connection and others like I was being led on.

Anyways, fast forward to the beginning of this year, after a couple of bids on my part to keep her in my life she cut me out completely. Some of the things I did, in a way I'm proud because it kind of validated for me what I would do for someone. It sounds weird but I think I loved her, and I say think because I'm not really sure what love is at this point and I also feel kind of stupid for loving someone who didn't feel the same way.

Anyways, um...over the last 8 months I've tried really hard to get over her. And for some reason, I just can't seem to shake it. I deleted everything that had to do with her from my phone, I tried dating which didn't go well because dating in this age sucks. I also tried just going with the flow and that's not working either. And I want to say I'm over her but I keep having dreams with her in them so that makes me think I'm really not. I can't afford therapy right now, and have some positive influences and people in my life, but it's really hard to move on.

She works in the sales department while I work in the cafe on the other end of the store so we don't actually work together, I just sometimes bump into her (not literally :P) as we're entering/exiting the store or occasionally in the main break room if our breaks happen to coincide. Won't ramble on about it but I have a big crush on her, and I suspect she likes me (that or she just really wants to be friends... which is fine by me too!).

I'm terrible at picking up on ""signals"" and think it's pointless reading too much into them anyway, but she's so friendly and sweet and talkative to me in particular. Whenever she sees me she shouts ""hiiiii &lt;my name&gt;!"" and jogs over to chat a bit, asking how I'm doing and what I've been up to etc., and whenever I'm standing in a group with others she always comes over to talk to me in particular (I notice she plays with her hair a lot when talking to me, whereas she doesn't with others).

We make a lot of eye contact and smile at each other when we cross paths or happen to be in the same area. She's also super apologetic to me over little things and I have to constantly reassure her it's okay and make a joke of it. Finally she laughs at all my terrible jokes :P (trust me, I'm not very funny...). I just don't really know why she talks to me; I'm pretty shy and introverted (especially around her lol) whereas she seems the opposite, very confident and chatty... but I can't complain about the attention :P

Anyway, I confided in my buddy about this crush, and how I've been meaning to bite the bullet and ask her out but haven't had the right opportunity with her and no one else around... he said, why not see if she's on Facebook? I searched her first name and as it's pretty uncommon she was one of the first results (also as we have mutual friends and she lives nearby). I want to reach out to her (not tonight though as I'm really tired, and she probably is too...) but I'm afraid it'll be seen as weird or creepy...

Should I add/message her, or should I just wait til I next see her in person and try summon the courage to ask her out (it's just awkward with other coworkers and such about), or at least ask if I can add her on Facebook which is a bit more casual?

Didn't mean for this post to be an essay... Help me Reddit! =P Thanks for any replies in advance (:",16Sep2019,1
321,"Long story short, a week ago I became intimate with my crush for the first time, and before i left his house he invited me to watch a movie in the theatres ""next week."" I was so happy and really looking forward to spending time with him etc.

Two days later, he texted he never wants to see me again. I've been devastated since.

But I really wanted to watch It Chapter 2. Would it be sad if I went ahead by myself...sitting alone in the theatre with popcorn, no date? 

It looks sad but could it also be liberating? Like all I have is myself in this world, might as well enjoy my own company?",16Sep2019,10

324,"So earlier I posted about my coworker who was acting kinda pervy. I'm M17 and he is M45 we work at a grocery store. Im not sure if I should report him or not so I made a list of the things he has done/said:

1. He bragged about how much ""pussy"" he got when he was in a band

2. As we were walking together the 2 black women walked by us, he turned around and stared at their butts and said ""Usually I'm not into black women ,but damn they got the body""

3. He made a joke about drilling a womans eye out and skull fucking (to make this one sound better, he clarified he was joking, but still very inappropriate work talk imo)

4. He told the story of how he lost his virginity (I have proof for this one)

5. He made a joke about teaching me how to get laid ""see what you do is you put your pee pee in her..."" and stopped.

6. He showed me a revealing picture of his wife. No nudity was shown. The picture was of his wife naked but her chest was against a wall and you couldn't see anything from the waist down.

7. Talked about how great sex is with his wife

8. Said the ""N"" word twice

9. Made a joke about how a customer complained that I touched her butt, there was a customer nearby when he said this.

10. Said ""I like women young, when you get my age you will too""


I'm sure he has made more jokes than this but I cant remember them cause my brain is shutting down cause it's currently 3:51AM. He has made some more minor sexual jokes and comments but I didnt think they were worthy of going on this list because they didnt really make me uncomfortable.

I'm all for jokes and raunchy/edgy jokes too. But its uncomfortable having a 45 year telling me, a 17 year old, about sex and sexy women. Especially since he is a married man.

325,"Hi everyone, I'm posting to ask for advice on something.

Am I being selfish if I want to spend more time with my SO?

We're distance (about 5-hour drive) and rarely see each other in person. instead we call on messenger for entire days at a time. We're both 18, and she has two jobs and horses.

I understand that she has things to do there, from caring for two horses to her jobs, And I know that those take time out of her day, but even on days off it feels like she spends the whole day out and the little time we do spend she's on her phone or watching TV. She is under a ton of stress and often tells me she's drained.

So is it wrong that I want to spend more time together? or even just more time talking over text if she's out? I feel like it's selfish but at the same time I think maybe I'm not selfish, maybe barely talking all day isn't good... I dunno.",16Sep2019,1

328,"I’m a first year in college, and need some help trying to figure this out. 
In high school, towards the middle of the year, I had a string of mental health issues that led to me nearly failing a class and in turn dropping it. 
This year, I allowed my parents access to my college account so they could help me with bills, tuition, etc. as well as my email account since that was necessary for some steps in this process. Once school started, however, they continually checked my inbox and would question why I wasn’t either opening or responding to emails. This to me feels like a gross violation of my privacy. 
As I am an adult now, I legally have the right to bar them from the account. However, I’m afraid to do this as they are helping me avoid a good amount of debt and I love them. I don’t want to strain our relationship, and I definitely don’t want any debt to deal with. 
Every conversation we have eventually leads to talking about this issue and the most recent one got very heated towards the end. I even offered to help them set up a parent account so they could still view grades, bills, and such, but they refuse, saying that I’ve not yet proven trustworthy enough to be left like that. 
This doesn’t feel right to me, and I don’t know what’s left to do in order to convince them to stop other than pulling the plug. 
What do I do?",16Sep2019,1
330," So in my school, we have morning roll call where for 15 minutes before classes, we gather up in a classroom. It's a mix of year groups (7-12), and it began last year. I didn't make any friends because last year I had the worst social anxiety and the girl in my year group already had a friend and I just didn't feel the effort and I didn't feel comfortable befriending anyone.

Anyways so I spent a year alone, which I didn't feel bothered by because it's only 15 minutes everyday where'd I sit alone and I'd usually just scroll through my phone and stuff. But recently it's been bothering me a lot, Morning roll call would be the dread of the day and I'd been feeling such a sinking feeling about it and it's been awful.

I think somehow my professor caught on how unhappy I was with my situation and pulled me aside and asked that I get more involved with the class, talking to more people and she suggested who I should talk to, to become more social. I don't think she was being rude by pushing me to be more social because she's a really nice professor and only wants the best for me. Although it's odd because they're like 3 other lonely boys in class but she never bothered with them.

Only problem is.. I don't know how? Solid groups have been formed and I feel rude intruding in them. I have two groups that I got my eyes on.

1. A girl named Lily. She's always been super nice to me because I'm her sister's friend but I've never been able to become her friend. She also sits next to another girl called Mandy but I've legit never talked to her in my life.
2. Two girls, they're okay but I've had very brief conversations with them, it was mostly about one of the girls crying and me wanting to know whats up. They'd be the easiest to be able to talk to because they sit behind me, but I don't think they're that nice.",16Sep2019,3

334,"My professor assigned a 3-4 minute personal narrative speech due this Wednesday. It can be about your best day ever, your worst day ever, best/worst date stories, a family traditions, a good/bad job experience, or an embarrassing moment. I decided two weeks ago that I was going to talk about the day I found out my dad passed away.

This is the story I'm telling: Basically, I grew up without my dad and it was my childhood dream to meet him one day. I finally got in contact with my half brother to learn about my family and especially my dad, but I found out that my father had actually died 6 months earlier. I isolated myself and fell into depression, but I pushed myself back up. After years of healing I realized how much there was to appreciate in my life and this summer I felt ready enough to reconnect with my dad's family. I was surrounded with nothing but love, and I feel like I've finally completed that part of my identity.

This is obviously a deeply personal story but it's one that I really identify with and am happy to share with the class. But I realized yesterday that in the outline she says ""When selecting a topic, consider your audience (your classmates and me). I encourage you to select a lighthearted topic and to maintain a positive, upbeat tone."" Now I'm reluctant to share this in the first place, since it's kind of a grim topic even though it ends on a happy note. Right now I'm writing a backup speech. Tomorrow is the first round of speeches, so I'll get a glimpse of what everyone else is presenting.

Thanks in advance, pals.",16Sep2019,3
335,"I'm not sure where to post this. Story is, I find myself constantly having to lowball myself in salary/earning negotiations, while others at my age/position seem to be doing much better at it.

One example is I take freelance interpreting gigs every so often, and there are 2 kinds of pay: some agencies pay 50$/day, some pay 100$/day (after they take around 20% of the pay). I have worked with both in the past, and in these gigs the agencies do the negotiation with their partner themselves. But when an individual company approach me personally,  I tried the same approach: offered 60$/day (50$ + 20%), but it still failed. Is there something I'm doing wrong, even when I'm already lowballing myself?

Another example is with full-time job offers. Others at my age, at executive level, are earning 200-300$/month higher than me, for the same job, same level (mine is sitting at around 459$/month, so that's almost 50% higher). Is it because I chose the wrong companies who tend to lowball employees? What should I do?

At my level of earning, every 50$ of extra salary/earning is worth a lot, so I would like to know how I can be better in these negotiations. Thanks in advance!",16Sep2019,3
336,"My best friend moved all the way from California to New York for college and I don’t know how to be there for her. 
She sent me weekly updates through apple notes, but I haven’t responded to all of them. They’re usually long and dense, jam packed with a week’s worth of her struggles and emotions. I’m also having a pretty rough time, not quite myself and always just on the edge of ok. Having read her notes, I feel so frustrated and powerless that I can’t help her more, which drains my motivation to write her back. So she confronted me about that, and was rightly upset. I propose that we do a video call to catch up and she rejects the idea. Later she says that it’s unfair of her to ask me to respond to her notes without letting us call and unshares the apple notes.

341,"Hi, 
I'm 23 yo and recently I've had ablation that failed. I'm having strong heart arrhythmias for almost 3 years now(it's noticeable for most time every day). When it gets stronger I'm feeling like I'm having a heart attack. It makes me extremely stressed out and takes away all the happiness from my life. 

Last Friday I've had ablation. Before it every doctor told me that it's going to be easy and that success rate is about 90%. During the surgery when they entered my heart with an electrode I've got artial fibrilation. This is normal but it should stop after short time. It didn't in my case. I've had it for more or less 20 minutes and then they diced to give me a drug to stop it. It worked but also completely hid the arrhythmias and after 2h of waiting for them to reappear being constantly on drug that forces your heart beat to be very high they decided to stop the surgery. 
It depressed me extremely hard and I can't get a hold of myself. 

All I keep hearing from my family is whining about manning up and guess what, it doesn't help at all. I tried thinking positively but when arrhythmias come all the positive feelings I have just shatter into pieces. What should I do? 

BTW. If anyone is curious I'm not having any kind of suicidal thoughts so don't worry about that.",16Sep2019,1

For some context, I'm a 21F at university. My uni is very protected - closed gates at night so only students are inside, have a bunch of security around ""campus limits"" (inside campus and outside campus where students have off campus housing at), etc. For the past few years, I haven't had to worry about my safety since I've lived on campus. This year, I have off campus housing, only a couple of blocks away from campus. I didn't run into any problems until recently.

First incident it was a football game. I left early with my roommate who was pretty drunk. We took a long way back to the main path, but on the way we passed by two old guys who were in conversation. They stopped and overtly stared us down. When we turned the corner, they started following us. They eventually went across the street, but I was terrified trying to figure out how to defend myself and a drunk friend.

Second incident was today. Went to a laundromat. Coming out of the car with same roommate, this older man probably in his 40s with a bike stares at us. He saw us struggling with a lot of laundry and gave us a cart. We thought that was it. We go into the place and he says ""do you want to be my friend?"" We noped our way out of that situation. Roommate leaves me at laundromat to go to work and I'm stuck calling another friend to come help me. While struggling with figuring out the car (it's an older car so we weren't very familiar with all the buttons), we turn on the headlights. Same guy passes by with his bike and stares us down. We eventually get back to my place (across the street from the laundromat). While opening the gate, the same man bikes up and says ""hey ladies, what are you guys up to"". He eventually left after no response, but later when my roommate came back at around midnight, the guy followed her again while she was on her bike and she ended up calling the cops.

I've had guys that were really wrong for me treat me so good you would have thought we were perfect. I don't like the falling in love part of being in love. You never know what you are signing up for, and most people don't want to wait around and find out. I'm not perfect myself... But I also don't think I want to open up to anyone like that right now.

363,"Hello Reddit, this post is gonna be somewhat long so bare with me. 

I’m 19 years old, and I’ve never been in a proper relationship. I had a few 1 week relationships in high school but nothing serious. I don’t know if the fact that I was living in an Arab country (Jordan) contributed to that, since i was in a very open minded high school that had nothing to do with religion. I spent my last two years in high school stuck up on one girl who didn’t want to be in a relationship with me, and now that I’m over her I want to meet other girls. I should add that I’m a virgin, and that the furthest I’ve gone sexually with a girl was making out, which happened in a club in Cyprus during what me and my friends call ‘senior trip’. 

I moved out of Jordan Last year, took a gap year and now I’ve started university in Istanbul, Turkey. I haven’t had a sexual experience or approached a girl with the intention of hooking up/ dating for almost a year and a half. Now since I’m in a new environment I don’t want that trend to continue, I want to put myself out there and live a little. 

I’m not unattractive, however I’m not really that handsome, I’ve been told that I’m a 7/10 in terms of looks from an unbiased source although I don’t know how true that is. 

How do I put myself out there? How do I go about approaching girls? Walking up to a girl I don’t know and talking to her always seemed like a scary concept to me. I was hoping someone can provide me with some pointers or techniques that they’ve used that have worked for them in the past.

Thanks in advance.",16Sep2019,3

367,"I have a previous post on r/rbi about this website, cthulu.com, when I didn't know what the website was but after investigating it for a few weeks I am almost certain it is a cult or an operation running 
something illigal.

 The website is locked but I discovered about 20 emails related to the website. all were inactive but I managed to track one down a specific person in Italy. I messaged him asking whether the email was his and he replied very vaguely stating. ""no to the extent of my knowledge I do not believe the ancient ones have given me an email"". This shows it was clearly his email. I found a Google groups chat with him in it and according to an Internet friend there was a recording that was hard to make sense of but it had something to do with prostitution, flesh and a school in Italy. And aparantly it sounded very creepy. And the man that I had previously messaged or one of his friends replied to that stating ""you shouldnt of posted that, perhaps you should disappear for a while"" I have all the exact details but it would take to long to write.

After all of this I am only more curious to what is inside that website and I will try to brute force attack into it. Knowing all this would it be safe to try to brake into it? Or continue to message these people?",16Sep2019,1
369,"So, yesterday was my kid's birthday party. The day before I'd been sick with what I thought was food poisoning, but the night before the party my kids were also a bit sick. But the morning came and they seemed fine, and I was also better so we went ahead. Six families with kids of various ages came. 

Tonight one of my friends called me and said they weren't happy that I didn't let them know ahead of time that we'd been ill so they could've had the option not to attend (but so far they are all ok), I apologised and then messaged everyone else who came to apologise for not giving them the heads up and seeing if they are ok. 

Another friend wrote back and is (justifiably) pretty upset because their eldest is sick and they are worried their other kids will get it, one of whom has a very expensive, very important trip booked this weekend. I apologised profusely and have offered to cover any out of pocket costs of it comes to that, but acknowledged that it's much more than just money to them. 

Two others have written back and are ok so far, and I haven't heard from the other two (potentially because they are bent over the toilet, who knows?)

My question is, what else can I do to make this right? I feel so terrible for being thoughtless and not sending out a message the morning of the party to let everyone know we'd been ill. How can I make this up to the people who are sick and/or very unhappy with me?

Tl;dr: I fucked up by holding my kid's party the day after we had a stomach bug. People are sick and/or pissed at me. How can I make things right?",16Sep2019,3
370,"Just as the title says, my dreams are better than reality. I always wake up with dreams that are exciting, pleasing or entertaining, meanwhile having not much of that in real life.

371,"basically I heard a voice last night. I was wide awake, it was only 9pm and I'd taken a break from my phone to day dream. I don't know what time it was when I heard the voice but it immediately shook me. it was completely unlike my own thoughts, it was clear and strong like an actual person was inside my head. normal thoughts don't have a volume and you can't think/speak over your own thoughts ( try and say tulips over each other in your head, it doesn't work) but this voice did. it was realer than any thought I'd ever had, and it spoke over my own normal thoughts that were somehow so quiet in comparison. the voice was masculine and reminded me of something that I couldn't recognise. I can't tell you what it said because I don't know, it was completely incomprehensible. again like the voice I recognised the sounds and words they used, it was like they were speaking English but using words I'd never heard before, it was a completely different language that I recognised almost innately- at first I thought I could understand but after each word was said I no longer did-  it was unfathomable. there are no words in our human language to describe this voice that spoke or the language it used. the tone of it's voice however did appeared confused, as if it had accidentally spoke. this probably sounds crazy and I need someone to tell me I'm not developing some mental illness and that I don't need to be institutionalised. is there a rational explanation for this?",16Sep2019,1

I have made a decision to try and stop my depression which is harder then I thought and idk what to do about it. I barely have any friends mostly just people I talk to.

Right now I'm spending a month abroad with my family and I'm on my second week out of 5 here in Spain. Just before I left me and this one guy hit it off and we've been texting for a couple months now, we've gone on a couple dates and the weekend before I left we had our first kiss. I'm very certain he really likes me and I would feel terrible for ditching him,
However, while here I met this other guy who is literally the nicest guy I've ever met and I find him incredibly attractive. We also get along great but the biggest problem I see is that he lives just so far away and
in not sure if it would be practical to start up a long distance relationship with him.

383,"I became bestfriends with the girlfriend of my best friend about 5 years ago. And both of them have been my best friends since then. But now I’m scared of losing her as my best friend.
They got together at that time and we liked each other a lot from that point and we became really close and she called me her best friend a couple times. She texted me quite regularly for years ( about 3-4 times a week). And we would text about random stuff and making plans to hangout together and what not.
I don’t really text my other friends about random stuff, especially not multiple times a week, since they are all guys.
We used to talk a lot and also hung out together a lot sometimes multiple times a week.
Which is a lot for me because my other friends don’t like hanging out on weekdays as much because they are busy with work.
She and her boyfriend even wanted a threesome with me last year.

Anyways she became friends with another guy who hangs out with us sometimes about a year ago. And every time he was with us she always sat next to him, talked and joked with him all the time and basically ignored me. They even started texting daily. 

And since about a month or so she stopped texting me altogether, she barely even talks to me and we see each other like once a week maximum.

Her boyfriend (who is my other best friend) and her are going through a rough phase in their relationship because he is also very jealous of the other guy and doesn’t want her to hang out with him. Because she stayed at his house once and spent the night there ( nothing sexual) despite the fact that he lives close by.

So nowadays she hangs out with this other guy in secret(not just the two of them, our other friends are also there). Because her bf gets so jealous. She says that she still loves her bf. but he is leaving for 4 months soon and will only be here at weekends.
I fear she’s gonna break up with her bf and get together with the other guy. These 2 people have been my 2 best friends for years now and I couldn’t handle them breaking up and her being together with this other guy.

I’d be devastated to lose her as my best friend.
I wanna tell her all that but since she doesn’t really talk to me much lately, I fear it’s a bad time to tell her that.

I just don’t know how to handle this situation.
I don’t wanna cut her out of my life because she and also her boyfriend have been the most important people in my life and it would absolutely destroy me. I want my relation with her to be like it used to be a year ago.",16Sep2019,1
384,"Soo, I think I‘m in love with a girl - again. That‘s the story:

I have the first day at a new school. New class and everything. It‘s great and I actually do find some friends in the first months (I‘ve never really had friends before changing schools). Then auround autumn (the school year starts in august) I noticed that I had a crush ob this one girl in my class. By springtime I was totally certain and told her about my feelings. She didn‘t reciprocate them and kind of ignored me for the next three months. It was really, really awful. 
After those three months tho we started chatting and in winter next year we were chatting daily until like 3 am. We became very good friends in that time and she knows more about me than anyone else. I slowly noticed in the next spring/summer that I didn‘t love her anymore and we became even closer friends. She also got a boyfriend (she‘s bi) that summer and it was epic. 
We are now best friends and it‘s great. Because of our history we just know each other in and out even tho we‘ve only known each other for 3 years (1 1/2 or 2 years I was in love with her). 

Now I feel like I‘m falling in love with her all over again and I absolutely hate it. We are best friends and I still don‘t know how we did this and we know each other so, so well. I feel like this will destroy our friendship so I have to try everything I can to not fall in love with her again.

Does anyone have an idea how to not fall in love with someone? Or how I can distract myself? Or has someone experienced a similar thing?

P.S.: I do not want to talk to her about it because it would totally destroy what we have and I don‘t think I could live with that. She‘s the only person I really talk to (like mental health and everything).",16Sep2019,1
385,"Hello guys, new to this, but somehow I felt like I had noone who could give me an objective opinion on this, so any thought would be appreciated.

My story:

Until june this year I was working as It service technician in Germany, where I was born and raised. It was a fine job and I really enjoyed doing this. Then the company I worked for got kicked out of the project, but the tech-giant wanted me at the site so they offered me a new job with identical conditions. In the meantime, the company I worked for offered me a job in Los Angeles for 1 year, a time limited project (which looked like an awesome opportunity because I would LOVE to live abroad for a year or so).

Now this is where it get's tricky:

Since I didn't hear from either of the two companies that wanted me for more than a month, I applied for different jobs and managed to get one I really love. I have all the freedom and exactly the work I wanted to do, and as it looks like that wont change in the next 20+ years.

The thing is, I have a girlfriend, she's studying we just got engaged BUT I still want to live abroad for some time. See the USA, live there, get to know people, etc. My now fiancée studied abroad aswell for half a year and it seems it was a great experience for her.

I just feel like I will feel stuck in 10 years if I don't at least try to live somewhere else than my hometown for a bit.

What are your thoughts? Should I, although I LOVE my job now, quit and search for something in another country, or stay in work and start building family etc.

I'm really feeling weird about making a choice here because I can't have the one without the other. But I don't really know what I will regret not doing in the long term 5+ years.

386,"okay, long story short, i found a lost dog and in the few days i knew him i became incredibly attached. when i found him he was scared and shivering, and his fur was way too long and matted, not to mention it didn't seem like he'd eaten in days. i took him to the vet to check for a microchip and he had one, but he was microchipped in a different area so we had to take him and leave him at the pound so they could search further. they told us that if he wasn't claimed by the end of the month we'd be called to adopt him, and i can call whenever i want to check on him. i feel incredibly selfish, but i hope i'm able to keep him. i know the chances of his owner finding him are high, and part of me is happy for them. he was the sweetest dog i've ever met and he was a great companion for my mums 10 week old puppy, it was so nice having a calm, docile dog around after spending quite a while with a hyperactive, bitey puppy. i'm a cat person, and he was everything i'd want in a dog. so basically, i need advice on how to deal with giving him back, while knowing that there's a small chance i'd be able to keep him.",16Sep2019,1
387,"I haven’t been feeling like myself lately. I feel like the light that used to once burn inside me has been stolen (I’m not even joking when I say this). I’ve been having weird experiences that have shown me that I am no longer the same person I used to be. I act colder towards my friends and sometimes find myself thinking of how annoying they are. Now, a majority of the time I spend with them I feel like an outsider. Some days I don’t even look forward to spending time, some I do. 

Before December 2019, I remember looking in a mirror at home and staring at my own reflection but not recognizing who was staring back at me. This was the most terrifying experience I’ve ever had thus far. I even told my mom who laughed, but this experience has occurred two other times now (not recently though). My mom has always been hard on me even tho she does everything and anything to be there as support. However, she doesn’t really support my ideas, thoughts, and feelings. If I were to tell her that I’m feeling sad, she would brush it off and tell me to pick myself up. I can tell her anything, which I do, but not when it comes to my feelings about life. 

A similar feeling I had to that of the mirror was when I was walking on my college campus and had an out-of-body experience where it was as if I was looking at my own life and not recognizing it for what it was. I was questioning what I was doing at the moment and felt like I was aimlessly walking around. I feel like that often still: that I’m aimlessly wandering with no purpose in life, although I believe there is much more the world has to offer.

I think my main struggle is that I feel like I’m trapped. I believe there is much more that people could be doing with their lives, but we’re stuck having to live our days exactly the same as every other. It’s almost like we’re stuck in a loop (like a hamster wheel) society has created for us. 

I also feel as though I expect a lot from the people in my life and because of that, I give a lot to the few I truly care for. For example, I give advice to my cousin all the time, help her with her homework, and am the shoulder she cries on, but I never receive this in return. I think it’s because I put up a strong front, so no one ever really asks me if I’m okay. I know I’m not. I’ve been feeling so sad and alone, but don’t really know the reason why. I’ve become so cold and I was never like this before ):",16Sep2019,1

Ive blocked out most emotions for the reason that she is too emotional, which isn’t a bad thing in reality, but has turned me off to it completly.She plays loud music, her friends come over all of the time, and i cannot stress the amount of times that i have been woken up due to loud music/ the tv/ her on the phone.

We have very diffrent concepts of life and very different personalties, but instead of just respecting that as i do to her, she never does it to me. So, at this point its completly fake so that i dont get in trouble for being disrespectful. I have very little respect for her in general. All she ever does to when i try to explain  my feelings and how I feel disrespected is cry and say “where did i go wrong god?”

It was a game of Russian roulette and i was the brain that could be potentially splattered on a wall ..

I still go to school and see most of my friends there and go to the gym with some of them, but I feel like I've got no one left to party with. I've got a problem I see mentioned a lot here that is I don't really have a mutual 'best mate.' The dude who I thought was my boy has a hyperactive social life ie. is good looking so he gets invited to random parties every weekend which often has me left in the dust. I have the best banter with this guy out of anyone I know but I feel like he always thinks there's better options out there. Like if I'm trying to arrange something instead of just saying no outright he'll wait till 2 hours before whatever I have planned and then if something better comes up he'll just bail. I get that this is probs just a phase and he'll soon realise that it's a bit of a shitty move. Rambling here but there is this other group of which one of my oldest mates belongs to. These guys party every weekend and I'm never left in the dust. Only problem is they skate which I have lost passion for over time (not really a prob for the friendship) and are absolute bongheads. I'm not the biggest fan of weed; tried it many times but it never really grew on me. When I used to hang with these guys everyday I was proud of my social life. As much as I would pretend to like bud and and they would often be too stoned to hold a decent conversation, I could get on the drinks with them on weekends and have fun instead of wasting the best years of my life.

407,"Tl;dr: my father was (allegedly) a drug addict and hopped hospitals to get pain pills. I need to know what conditions he had/died from so I can complete my medical history and don't know what to do or where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting this off by saying that this isn't very cut-and-dry and is a complicated mess. Because of this, I'd really appreciate more voices in this conversation to hopefully get this sorted out.

&amp;#x200B;

My father died when I was 13, in 2012. My parents divorced shortly after I was born for reasons I didn't know other than the fact that my mother could not trust him. Growing up, he was in and out of hospitals constantly for a myriad of health complications. I was never directly told why he was in a hospital for any of the visits (probably because I was too young to understand anyway). I don't know what took him. My family doesn't like discussing him or his passing. I know of a few minor conditions he had during his life, but that's about it. My mother's side shit talked to me about him constantly, so I might have an idea of health problems stemming from rumors I was told.

Recently, I finally saw a doctor about my growing health concerns. I have an incomplete health history because I only know, for sure, about my mother's side of the family's health issues. She recommended I do some personal research and find out what my dad had so we could find starting points to test for. Upon talking to my family about this, I started learning more and more about my dad that I didn't know about and might've been intentionally kept from me. The issue is, my mother is prone to overreacting and lying so I have to treat each new piece of information with a healthy dose of skepticism. My aunt is a good middle ground, but she seems hesitant to tell me information.

I know that my dad was an alcoholic. It was drilled into my head that no one on my mother's side trusted him, and I thought that was the reason. As I dig for information, my family has been trickling to me the idea that he was also a drug addict. My mother *just* told me that he had a tendency to hop hospitals to get prescriptions for pain medication. My aunt dropped on me that he would use babysitting me as an excuse to get drugs and was usually on something during the time they knew and interacted with him. My aunt thought I knew all of this, which makes me think my mother is intentionally keeping things from me about him. I can't go to anyone in my family for information, I think I've gotten everything I can from them.

Everything I've done so far (before I knew about the drugs):

* Filled out an application for his death certificate.
* Called the hospital he died in and two other hospitals I know he frequented to see what I need to collect his records.
* Making note of all this information so I can piece together a narrative with the help of health officials.

After the drug thing came out, I feel overwhelmed and am at a loss what to do. I feel like I've been sent back to square one. I don't know what hospitals to contact or if I do, what to say. If they have information about him that is incorrect because of the possible lying and manipulation, I'm not sure how to pick out what I need. I don't know if the information I'm being fed is truthful or what is an overreaction and if to even bring up my concerns with any hospital I contact. He died from something that ate him from the inside, that much I know to look for. Anything at all that could help me make a plan on what to do about this mess, I would greatly appreciate.",16Sep2019,2

* we both worked retail, and hated it. His new job literally starts today sfter six years, and I got out back in April after being put in Zoloft due to how bad that job affected me. 

* he attended a certification school, where I had to become the primary breadwinner so he could go (due to the location and the subject studied, our workplace couldn’t find a way to mane a schedule work). We ended up bringing in a roommate who has now become permanent. 

* I have a condition that requires me to have insurance to drop the cost of the medication to an affordable rate. With it, $40/month, and without is over $1,200. Even then, I have some pretty severe social anxiety/depressive tendencies that haven’t gotten properly treated as of yet. 


My bf just got a new job that’s supposed to pay pretty well (not 6-figures, but definitely not bad by any stretch compared to before). And he suggested I do what he did earlier this year and take some time off to breathe and figure out my path. A “reset year.” 

I’d love to do this. I want to become a writer and the idea of being the one to stay home and take care of the pets and write and write and write sounds so much better than the current job I’m in, or even just working around others in general. We don’t currently have the space to work in a remote job, else I’d do that. 

I don’t have a completed degree in anything, and I’ve tried college several times. I don’t have the mental fortitude to do it. I just don’t. I’m at a loss of what to do. 

Would the reset year be a good thing to do? He’s even offered to put me on his insurance for this new job too, but I don’t know if I can use it for my medication since I’m not the primary user of the card.

When I heard the surgery date I figured ok, six months is completely manageable.

Today, I was up and on the move from 5 am onward, and between driving between places and all sorts of necessary errands, I had exactly one (1) hour to sit down and relax before going to work.

I told this to my family, and said that I am going to sit down in silence and draw.

My mother decided to spend the entire hour talking my ear off. And not about anything important, either, but about packing for a trip she didn’t need my help for, about inconveniences of the clothing design industry, and what her cousin’s husband’s youngest sister’s nephew had said last weekend.

No part of ”I am going to sit in silence and relax” translated to ”please do not disturb”. When I asked her if she could please just let me sit in peace, she agreed, of course, of course, and then kept on talking at me.

SM: Suicidal Male friend
F: Female best friend
SB: Smart friend/Smart boy
W: Guy with ego
Friend A: friend

My friend (SM) is apparently suicidal and whenever something doesn't go his way he gets mad (like mad mad and can't think straight) and starts to threaten to kill himself to get his way. 

I'll admit. Yes, he's not the richest, best looking guy out there but he's pretty smart but he will talk about wanting to kill himself regularly and our friend group will try to y'know do what you do when someone talks about that stuff. At first, we were like okay please don't we love you as friends and that stuff but recently damn he went I guess over board. 

We have three super smart people in my friend group including him. There was this guy who's kinda new to our school (W). His ego was bad and ppl disliked him but recently he's genuinely been working on that ego and has toned it down a lot. He's improved. But the friend and sb (smart boy) like to critique him in anyway possible. 

At first, it was reasonable because yeah his ego was sky high but now his ego is good. He's improved a lot. Last week, they were critiquing him on him why he has two fucking math lessons a week. Like bitch. That's just dumb. 

I told them that I thought that now they were just finding the most miniscule things to critique him on. They obviously got bat shit mad and yeah. They left the table we sat at. 

Then they learned that wow surprise a friend (friend A) in the fg had snitched on them cause W was infact his good friend. They went mental. That evening, they messaged my bff (F) and said:

""We will come back to the table on one condition. Friend A leaves"" 

Obviously, F said no, Friend A isn't leaving and that they're the ones who can leave if they have a problem. 

I honestly don't think anyone's completely correct or completely in the wrong here but idk. 

SM got mad once again. He started to threaten to kill himself (once again) and saying that if he kills himself, it's on us. It's our fucking fault. 

He then told F to never talk to him ever again and blocked her. 

Now, I messaged him. I honestly don't know if what I did was correct but it's already done. 

I said that Friend A didn't do anything wrong. We then argued for about two minutes over this and then he said it again - what about I just kill myself?

I was speechless. I didn't know what to say anymore and just let him on read. I don't know anymore. 

Then today. After school, F was having a normal day when she got a text from M saying some B's about killing himself again. 

He said that she's stupid and dumb. He said that he'll be more successful than her when he grows up. He called her bad names and shit. Bitch. I was furious. 

He then sent her a fucking photo of his wrist with fresh, deep cuts on them. It was horrible. I was disgusted. She was disgusted. I don't know what to do anymore.

I can't really explain it but everytime I think about these relationships or connections that I have it makes me think how loved I am but something inside tells me that they're just using you and it makes me want to cry.

Which, to be fair, I *do* have a strong tendency to just *stay* in my apartment. I've only been there a little over a week, but unless I specifically *needed* to go out and buy something for the place, I generally just stayed home. It's nice, but maybe I'm setting myself up for bad habits, as I'm definitely not the most social person.

My apartment *technically* has a ""gym"", but it's basically just a few treadmills and a sauna. Which, hey, those are good things to have around I'm sure. But I actually never liked treadmills to begin with, and these are worse than most because they're basically just all facing a brick wall.

I dunno. Like I said, it's more just a random thought that creeped up. As much as I like the idea of making my apartment feel like ""a nice, home-y sort of apartment"", maybe I should consider just instead focusing on making it a place of self-improvement?",16Sep2019,2

438,"Hi. So, my father is unemployed. He has been for almost 10 years now. It's only me and my mom working and before I could work we received social assistance. My childhood and teenage years were hell. We never had any money, I didn't go out with friends or to school trips. All because he 'cant' work. The thing is, I think he's depressed for a long time now. And I know that depending on how deep your depression is it's harder for you to do certain things. So he doesn't have a job and don't help at home, and on top of that is very strict. That's his second big problem. When I was younger he would beat me for things like, I spilled milk on the floor, or break my mp3 player because I didn't hear him calling. He's a little better now but still very strict. I'm 21 and I can't close my bedroom door or talk on the phone with someone in my room, have to tell and convince him when I'm going out (in advance) and sometimes he just decides I can't go anymore so I have to cancel a plan I made a week in advance. Recently I got a new job and will have to move out, and he made me rent a 3 bedroom apartment because he and Mom may move in on the future.

So I work in the oil field and right now I'm supervising a job to make sure that everything running good so most of my day is sitting in a truck and occasionally doing a walk around to making sure my guys are doing there job properly. I have this issue where I can't just sit in the same spot for more then a couple hours because I get really sleppy and no matter what I do I catch myself falling asleep.

I feel that because my mom always said to graduate college, that was my sole purpose for living and now that I’ve done it I’m really lost. The transition from school to a job has been a little hard and I’m looking at the good things about no longer being in school, but some days are hard to adjust.

442,"I've always had this social anxiety over conversations, when I've been on dates my only worry is that it will be awkward and it will be obvious that I'm struggling. The thing is, I'm always extremely curious about the other person, so usually ask a lot of questions, but I feel like this only works for the first date, to prevent an interview vibe.  


My last relationship ended over a year ago and one of the main factors was basically because I never started many conversations, so she felt distant. I never didn't want to talk, I just never know what to say, and there's only so much asking about the other person you can do.  


I recently went on my third date with someone and it was obvious I was uncomfortable. I still asked questions about herself, but there were definitely more silences than last time and she even said ""you're going to run out of things to ask me soon"". The worst part of the date was at one point she done an accent, and thinking I was 'banting' I said ""That's probably the worst accent I've ever heard"" to which she said actually offended her (obviously I apologised)  
We skyped later that night and again, sometimes felt like a full minute of silence, whilst I rapidly tried to think of a conversation.

We've been talking online for over a month and I have a huge crush on this person, I've been trying to work out if she feels the same, but my social anxiety is once again playing a major role.

444,"So I’ve been friends with this guy for a couple years now. We have a ton of common interests, and generally get along really well. However, his political views are absolutely abhorrent. He’s about as far right, Trumpist, alt-right as you can get. I don’t think political views should ever get in the way of a friendship, but goddamn, if there ever was a case, it’d be him. Some of his views are just so racist and cruel that I don’t know how to explain to him he should care about others and treat everyone with basic human decency. Other views of his include being anti-vax, believing that the “liberal mainstream media is just a bunch of fake news” (this is his go to whenever I prove him wrong) and not believing in climate change. I try to just avoid politics altogether, but he keeps bringing it up. 

I really like him though, and don’t want to end the friendship. What should I do?

(Btw, I don’t worry about him seeing this, because according to him, “Reddit is just a bunch of libtards”)",16Sep2019,2
445,"I'll try and make this short! 

3 months ago my girlfriend and I broke up who I was head-over-heels in love with. Our relationship included a lot of long-distance due to my work. This was the most stressful event of my life. She and I still speak - I'm unsure if we'll ever have a chance at being together again, but I hope so. In the past, I've always been in monogamous relationships, and for the most part, I've practiced safe sex / gotten tested regularly. 

2 weeks before I left the country again, I found out I have genital herpes type-1 (GHSV1). Generally speaking, this is a lucky type of herpes to have because there is an 88% chance I will not have another outbreak and the virus sheds very very infrequently from the genital tract. I could go into much more detail - but I'll direct you guys [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Herpes/comments/41u6g3/how_long_did_you_wait_to_be_intimate_after/cz66hvh/) (or google) if you'd like further information. Ultimately this isn't a very serious condition to have, but I do need to disclose to partners. Obviously, this event was pretty horrible awful, however, I moved onwards. 

After that, I started checking myself regularly, and one day about a month later I realized that some small bumps which had been present for quite a long time (\~5 months). I consulted my doctor and she suspected a minor case of HPV (Genital Warts). These spots are almost invisible to the naked eye, but none-the-less, I am now treating them with a topical cream and waiting to return home for better treatment (I'll have them physically removed via cryotherapy). To summarize, genital warts are a low-risk type of HPV (not the type that can cause cancer) and in many cases, the infection is cleared by the body in less than 2 years. If you'd like more information on genital warts here is a good [Q&amp;A](https://ehealthforum.com/health/info-on-hpv-t173358.html).

Unfortunately, herpes isn't usually tested for, even on full-panel STI screenings, and neither is HPV. In men, HPV cannot be tested for unless there are visible symptoms - it's a similar story with HSV (High rate of false positives and negatives). 

Now, if you've made it this far, you can probably see where this is going. I feel like moving forward, between the two issues I'm having, no one will ever want to be with me, or give me a chance. Unfortunately, we live in a hook-up culture, where sex often precedes intimacy and love. I'm devastated by the loss of my ex, who I loved deeply, and I'm feeling intense shame about my own body and fearing for my future. 

My ex was 100% comfortable with the herpes diagnosis, she didn't care, and that made me feel wonderful and hopeful. But now I feel like I have a double whammy, why would anyone want to take a risk on me with TWO issues like this? Not to mention, I miss my ex horribly and wonder daily if we can be together again. Anyways, please give me some words of advice and wisdom, help me to move forward while thinking more positively. 

Also, please be gentle, these are sensitive subjects for me that I'm still learning to cope with.

Tl;dr: My girlfriend and I broke up and I developed both herpes and HPV.",16Sep2019,1

449,"I have a friend I've known for nearly 20 years, and while I love her dearly, she's not always the most tactful person / doesn't have a lot of ability to see beyond the end of her own nose. I know a lot of times it comes from a place of insecurity, but she literally cannot stop putting people down. People we know well, people we rarely know, it doesn't matter; literally every conversation begins with ""Did you hear about...?"" or with her color commentary on someone's Facebook post.

I've told her many times in the past that I'm not super comfortable talking about other people; when we were 13, sure, that's what teenage girls do, but this has only really been a problem in the last 3-4 years, and it's just not how I want to spend my time. I've repeatedly told her in no uncertain terms that I'm not comfortable with this, but she keeps doing it anyway.

I'm usually pretty good at steering the conversation toward a different topic, but since she got pregnant with her second, she can only talk about two things: how great of a parent she is, and how terrible everyone else is. She was recently going off about something along these lines in public (how moms who work are evil and don't understand the value of precious time with their babies), and of course, because of Murphy's Law, the girl she was talking about was sitting two tables over from us and heard everything.

I apologized to the other girl privately, but of course, she's a single mom who \*has\* to work, and she's devastated. I feel terrible, even though I was defending her.

How can I tell my friend she needs to focus on her own life rather than everyone else's? Or I guess, how do I make her understand, so that it sticks? I'd cut ties with her but I've tried that more than once during our friendship and she's threatened to hurt herself over it.

455,"So backstory, we got engaged in November of last year after I accepted a full time position to work for our state government (I was waiting on getting a full time job to propose because I graduated that December).

At the time she had no offers and a week to decide to take it or not. I told her to take it because right now she has no job after school and she should get some experience. Flash forward to now and she literally hates it. Her boss makes her work 60-80 hours a week, travel every week out of state, we never see each other (we live together so I am practically home alone all the time), and when she asked to leave early on Friday so she can come to me see me her boss told her that it isn’t her call (she is literally the leader of the project right now and they finished all the work that morning with nothing else to do) and all of us have to make sacrifices for the job.

457,"I asked the same recently but the way I worded it led to misunderstandings so I'm trying again. 

I have no social life and no friends whatsoever, and i'm really sexually frustrated. I recently had to cut contact with my only friend because it hurt me too much when she talked about her sexuality, all ending with a panic attack when she told me she was dating someone now. I can't find people to bond with; I can mantain a normal conversation but it never leads to a friendship. It feels like my brain is on a different level, not above nor below but distant. I can speak to people nornally and show interest in what they like or what they believe, but I can never share an interest, neither mine nor then. I can make small talk, but i can never get understanding. I can't bond. 

The problem is, this seems to extend to therapists as well. I come to then with specific issues i want to address, but they seem to latch on something different and force me to speak about that topic and that topic alone. I used to believe that I was to impatient and that I should let them get to a conclusion, but the conclusion they arrive to is that I'm very healthy. And even then they insist on latching on the same topic for sessions on end. And it's not like it is a single topic that **I'm** refusing to address-each of them seem to cling on a different topic unrelated to my suffering. I know I sound impatient. But its gotten to the point where I had to discuss with my last therapist whether I'm mentally healthy or not. And of course i seemed healthy to her if she insisted on talking about nothing more than my job, where I'm doing fine. Meanwhile i was having panic attacks each time my friend would talk about her crush. Yes, i know its disgusting that a supposed friend can't handle that he has no chance with her supposed friend. I know its psychopatic and despicable of myself. But each time I tried to addressed the issue with my therapist I was handwaved and forced to talk about how well I'm doing at work. It got to the point where I lied about my job to get her to help me with my behavior. But she wouldn't. Stop. Going. Back. To. My. Job. 

So it is sort of a vicious cycle. The same lack of social contact, the inability to make a meaningful connection, its what keeps me from getting the help I seek. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and I'm on antidepressants, and don't get me wrong, they help, but there is no pill for having friends or for not obsessing over every single woman that gives me the slightest attention. I feel like i need some sort of specialist psychologist; someone who specializes in particularly asocial personalities, or obsessive personalities, or whatever is ultimately wrong with me. But I'm financially unable of just going to random psychologists until one of them hits the nail. I need to make some sort of filter. And i don't know how.",16Sep2019,2

He's been good with his training in all aspects except for his separation anxiety. I'm trying my best with him and even contacted a dog behavioralist to come by and help because I've tried everything I could and it doesn't seem to be getting better. He doesn't cry at night because I keep his crate in my room and he's fine because I'm also there. He's crated during the day while we are both gone (we work the same schedule) and I even have a nanny to come let him out after 3 hours and I come home on my lunch break to let him out and give him a quick walk. 

His anxiety is so bad that he pees and poops in his crate, tries to break out and screams a lot (I have a camera watching him) but otherwise will not have an accident in the house. 

My roommate will sometimes come home if she doesn't have a lot of work and complains that he's screaming and won't be quiet. I told her that when he sees her that his anxiety starts up again and that he pees and poops because she comes and goes without letting him out.

 Now I don't expect her to take care of my dog because he's mine but she won't even take him out quickly to pee or poop if she's home.

Ever since then, I can tell my crush for 1 is depleting rapidly. But today, I met another guy (3). Same things happened. I started to fall for him and my crushes for 1 and 2 are disappearing. Why am I posting this? Well, I’m afraid that when I get in a relationship that’ll happen, that’ll fall for someone else in a matter or weeks or months.

Is this normal? I know that these are real crushes as my heart flutters and get extremely nervous (and blushes rip) and not like ‘oh he’s hot, I like him.’ Please tell me this normal and does anyone have any tips on stopping this wavering?",16Sep2019,2

His dad owns a shop, it’s all he’s ever done for work, and all my guy knows. 

We are getting married soon, and have zero money. He’s looking for a job that pays a bit more and also has the benefits of 9-5 and not hurting his body everyday.

I am trying to think of jobs outside of his realm that he could get entry level, around 20-22 an hour. I’m not sure if this is possible. I’m looking for anything, guys.

470,"I require advice regarding my work schedule. First, I’ll give a run down on everything that’s happened and hopefully get some solid advice afterwards. So I started a new job at a supermarket, working the front end. It’s a nice environment and I’m genuinely looking forward to working there. Two days ago, after orientation, I was told to call my front end supervisor so we could sort out my schedule. So when I called, they asked if I would be available Thursday and Wednesday (there were more days, but they didn’t interfere) I froze up, as I realized I had drivers ed practically all week for at least 4 more weeks along with school, and working Thursday and Wednesday just couldn’t work for me. Despite what she said, I agreed and said that would work just fine. Afterwards I realized my forgetfulness and lack luster communication skills, and hastily called back. A different person picked up, and I asked for my supervisor after explaining the situation, but they said they’d be able to help, and I was fine with that. After explaining I couldn’t work most weekdays, they said they’d call me back with my new schedule in a few hours, but they didn’t. I tried calling them after realizing they probably wouldn’t get to me, and I was told my supervisor had gone home, and that they would call me in the morning so we could figure this out. And now here we are. I realize that they are a supervisor, and their priority is not me or my schedule, but I really want to figure out this situation. I don’t know if I should try calling again.

471,"Hi. I'm going to try to keep this short (I talked about this to some female friends, but I wrote almost an essay)  


I'm a 25 yo shy boy, and very very bad at picking up girl's signals (Probably why I'm still single) I went with a friend to a Loewe's style shop to buy stuff for each. I go get my stuff and he goes his way. Then we notice we need help from a clerk. When I'm getting out of my aisle I see him going to the one next to mine. When I get there he's asking the girl clerk about his thing.And then after that I ask about mine, while going to his thing we pass by my thing and it's she's very helpful and nice and ends in kind of a ""awkward"" pause lul When I'm alone with him he tells me that she was talking with him regularly and when I showed up she started to get all smiley. I doubt him because he's a joker and also I'm not used to that (his gf says he wouldn't lie about that)  
Later we need another clerk and I'm going and ignore others because I wanted to be her also to try to know if he was right. After she helps us we go out to pay, and she sprints to catch us and explain some thing about prizes. Fast forward a week and we go there again and she's on the register and remembered she explained to us how the wheel worked.   


Could it be just a friendly clerk that remembers interactions with clients?  
A female friend told me to drink a beer to open up and then go there and ask her out. But this is all weird to me.

472,"Every time I leave class, he would shout saying “bye (my name)!”  He would stare at me a lot and pretend he didn’t. My friend said he was pretty loud when he says my name. Also my friend said he would turn around too much to look at me and wanted to ask him what was he looking at. 

One time I was walking to out class and he was behind. He told me how he saw me from outside and decided to talk to me here in the hallway. He likes to smile at me a lot. He teases me in class sometimes. His friends always smile when I am near him. One time in the lobby part of the school, we were 50 feet apart and he recognized me but I was staring at him wondering if that’s him while he did the same. Then he came by to talk to me. He held a 10 second stare with me. Lol. Another time, I was talking to a random male friend and he was looking at me. Second time this happened, I was with another male friend who was hugging me, he seemed so uncomfortable. When I left the classroom, he asked him if I was his girlfriend.

One time, he was looking at me and he seemed so nervous. When other women are around him, I come near, these women tend to then vanish. Lmao. I’m like what the heck? There’s a girl who hit him on the arm playfully and left. He got super hyper when I walked into the room.

477,"I was at my friends house getting my hair done yesterday, it’s a long process and I was there for 4 hours. I’ve been friends with her and her man for over 10 years, and her husband has always told me I’m beautiful, especially while his wife is doing my hair, he says it in front of her, but yesterday he crossed a line. At first, he was normal, but idk what he did, he was definitely on something, he wasn’t drunk. I haven’t done many drugs so idk if it was some kind of pill, or coke, or ecstasy, but he was sweaty and slurring his words and repeating himself a lot. I’ve always suspected he does something because I’ve never been able to really have a conversation with him because he just circles in conversations and keeps telling the same story over and over, and never really has any input into anything else. The wife was also doing laundry and other household chores while my hair was processing, and anytime she walked away he would start hugging me, which is normal for him, but then he kept looking me up and down and going “damn girl, you are so gorgeous”, the tone was different than the other times he’s called me beautiful and it made me uncomfortable. At one point he was dancing kind of around me and I was playing along, but then he tried to kiss me and I just pushed him away and give him a look. Later he touched my butt as he walked by, and again when I was leaving. I have a boyfriend who I’m very serious about, he knows this. The husband and wife have an “open” relationship, and sometimes see other people, and it works for them, but I don’t want to be apart of that. This couple have been very good friends to me, always helping me when I need them, and I don’t want there to be any issues. I’m afraid if I say something to the wife, she’ll just defend him, and that would cause tension. I don’t want to confront him directly because he was obviously on drugs and might not remember or just think he was being playful. I can’t talk to my boyfriend about it because he already doesn’t like my friend’s husband since they got in a nerd fight about computer programming, but I just don’t want the husband to think I’m ok with him touching me inappropriately.",16Sep2019,3

481,"Alright I’m going to quickly go through this first part. I’m now a sophomore in college, when I was a freshman, so last October, my father unexpectedly died and then two weeks later my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Basically it fucked me up hard. I only took one class my second semester cuz I couldn’t handle anything, the slightest of commitment and task from gives me a breakdown cuz I feel like I’m incapable of doing anything. I understand this is irrational and dumb and I know I can do better.

A lot of my pain if from loneliness/ abandonment, my girlfriend at the time of my fathers dead and mothers diagnosis broke up with me and it killed me I loved her so much and I had even less. I want to feel loved and accepted and I haven’t for a long time.

About two months ago I got a job and I work with this cute girl 5 hour shifts we work together for 2 months. During this time we flirt and get to know each other I also work on my self over that two months I start working out and I lost 20 pounds I start using CBD for my panic attacks and my extreme depression. School starts and I decide to ask her out and she says yes, boom my confidence is soaring I’m doing so much better I get my self up at 7am to run a couple miles every Morning. First and second date go well, I ask her to a formal we go together, long story short at the primer she tells me she just wants to be friends and i take this really hard and just start pounding liquor and black out. To my knowledge she did also and I dropped her off at her place before the formal started. 

Now she won’t talk to me at all, the only girl I got to even fucking talk to me doesn’t like me, she got to know me and decided that I’m not good enough to talk to. I’m just hurt if anything I want her as a friend back, or even a coworker.

I have a problem. I’m seemingly unable to stop thinking about how much I desire a romantic relationship with someone, and I feel like I’m basing all of my accomplishments in life on my ability to pickup girls. For example, I’m considering getting a job (I’m a teenager in high school) and one of the reasons that keeps appearing in my head for getting a job is that it serves as a perfect way to meet new girls.

485,"I need 8 door knobs total and the cheapest route is to buy a 10 pack. The drawback is they have to be either all passage locks or all privacy locks. Ideally I'd order 3 privacy and 5 passage. I have never actually used the privacy locks on the doorknobs I have now. If I were to have guests over, would they expect a privacy lock on the bathroom or would a normal passage door knob suffice? 
(I usually don't use them even at someone else's house)

Which makes most sense from the options bellw?:

- 10 pack of privacy locks $119.69. I will use 8 and have two to resell at our annual yardsale. (Which makes the net price even cheaper)

-10 pack of passage locks for $119.69. Same deal, 8 for my house, two for the yardsale. 
I'm kind of leaning towards this. Although, if I ever have kids I'd like to have a privacy lock on our bedroom/master suite but I wouldn't want a lock on the kids room.

- 3 privacy ($47.24) and 5 passage ($69.29) for a total of $116.53.  This is actually cheaper out of pocket right now, but the cost per knob is higher &amp; no knobs for the yardsale.",16Sep2019,1
486,"Ever since I can remember I've literally had no self confidence, I'm always the person that sits in the corner of the room and says nothing until someone else approaches me at gatherings because I feel like I'm a crappy person and I'm not interesting enough to talk to. I don't have masses of friends, but I am very close with the ones I do have, though I don't feel like I'm a very good friend to them. I'll try and be there as much as I can for them whether it's physically or emotionally, and although financially up until now I've not been great I'll cover their expenses if they need me to, but I always feel like I could be doing more. I've had to turn down so many invites just because I don't have the money, and most people are understanding but there have been a few people who think I'm just making up excuses to avoid them. I'm finally earning a decent wage now so I don't think it'll be the case in the future, but I hate letting people down and I'm worried that my friends think I'm avoiding them or just being a generally gloomy person (I do suffer from generalised anxiety disorder and it can be a pain in the butt, but I do everything I can not to bother them with it because I don't want to be a burden to them).

I've been so unlucky in romantic relationships that I'm pretty sure at this point I'm the problem. I've maybe only had two or three relationships that I would consider ""serious"", and they were a little messy. One guy was an ex drug addict I met on tinder who pretty much had me on lockdown and made me do everything for him while I tried to finish my studies, he never got a job and I had to cover his half of the rent for the entire year and a half we were together. Another guy just basically acted like I didn't exist, like he was nice and sweet to me when we were together in person but it would take him forever to reply to messages (like 2 or 3 days, or sometimes he wouldn't even reply at all or just ignore my message and ask for nudes on snapchat) and he was always rescheduling plans literally minutes before they happened. We lived 10 minutes away from each other and I was lucky if I saw him for 2 hours a week. He studied medicine so I just put it down to him being busy with his course, but I saw other friends who were on the same course as him in the same year so much more often so it was triggering my anxiety a lot because I felt like I was being a nuisance to him and he didn't want to spend time with me. He broke up with me a few months back because he ""couldn't be there for you and for me"" (his words) but now he's trying to worm his way back into my life and I don't want anything to do with him because he made me feel so worthless and berated my studies and achievements (his comment on finding out I got onto a PhD programme was ""well you're not going to be a *real* doctor are you?""). I know for a fact I've not been perfect in either relationship as my anxiety has made me get mad and upset at little things, but I did the best I could to make both guys happy, whether it was cooking meals or sending dumb messages to make them smile or giving them space when they asked for it, or other things... (I always let them do the dirty with me even if I didn't want to, which I know is wrong and I should not have let that happen).

I just can't help but feel like I've been a burden to everyone around me and I don't know what I can do to stop feeling like that. I keep my head up as much as I can and help out when and where I can but I don't feel like it's ever enough. I've tried speaking to therapists and counsellors about it and it's helped a little but every time I make progress something happens that puts me back at square one (the recent breakup with medical guy ex being the current trigger, and I'm so done with him weighing over me).

487,"The sooner you can advise the better; I only have the next 2 weeks to decide.

Growing up, I loved art and studied it up until college. It was there I discovered that in order to really excel in a job I'd want, I'd not only need to be better than the competition and I'd need to leave home for uni; something I wasn't mentally prepared for.

I studied IT because it was something I was kinda interested in which also allowed for more options. Once when I spoke to a career advisor, I considered studying an art course at the college which would give me the UCAS points needed for uni. I decided against it however, as I was afraid of ""student loans"" at the time.

So I've started a HND course; an extension of the IT course I did. I have 2 weeks (with only 4/14 days actually being at college) to back out,). Doing so past this deadline will see me pay an additional £200 on top of my loan.

While I don't mind IT and I've made friends with people on the course over the last couple years (I know that means little in deciding my future) but I can't help feel i have no excuses not to pursue art like I wanted.

It's been awhile since I've drawn on a large scale. But people have always seemed to enjoy my artwork. But would I be good enough to compete in such a supposedly cut throat industry? I'm not sure...

I'm living at home nearly rent free right now (my parents are very generous when it comes to my living situation) and working at a part time job, about 25-30 hours a week.

I feel miserable.  I don't like my job and I want to quit, but I don't know how.  My plan for this year was to work on a grad school application and maybe take some language classes somewhere and then start grad school next year, but I've done next to no work on either of those fronts.  I get so hung up on my job that I can't focus on anything else other than wanting to leave, and when I have free time I just blow it online or watching TV.  I keep telling myself that if I had more time I'd be able to put an application together and take some classes, and I think that's partly true, but I know a big part of it is just my complete lack of motivation and discipline.  

My mental and physical health are pretty shit right now, and I want to focus on improving both of those, but I also feel like I'd just be more stressed out with stuff like that on top of my inconsistent and really erratic work schedule.  I feel worthless and hopeless, like I'll never have any direction in life and might as well just give up.

The immediate ""solution"" to my problem is to quit my job and focus on rebuilding my mental/physical health and maybe focus on the things that really make me feel fulfilled and give me a sense of purpose, but even that feels hopeless.  My parents are open to that for a little while, but it's not sustainable forever.  I'd need some kind of money at some point, and I think another job like this would just drain me all over again.  I've looked into freelance work or beer money or whatever (I HATE inconsistent schedules, and working for myself on my own schedule would be amazing at this point in my life), but it all seems super foreign and inaccessible to me, even if I only really need 1000 a month.

I don't even really know what the point of this is.  Sure, maybe I should quit my job and focus on myself, but I don't even know what I'd say to my boss when I have nothing lined up on the other side.  And again, I could spend a month or two really focusing on myself and my interests and everything, but what would I do for money?  What if I don't end up going to grad school next year?

I deal with minor bipolar disorder which means I tend to  have a shorter temper than most plus im an only child. (So I am definitely a little bit bossy, I tend to want things done my way because thats how I was raised. I get frustrated so easily. My s/o has said i’m not bossy often but it’s definitely a trait i want out of my life.) I also have a short attention span. I will hear someone talking but i struggle to acknowledge what they have said. Its very hard and I think this may have to do with my bossiness) 
I can acknowledge my personality flaws. I am struggling to change them or help myself make them better. I am on meds to help with my temper and its helped my frustrations although it’s still there. I used to be friends with someone who would constantly just say he was a horrible person and think that was enough. He would never try to change himself. I don’t want to become him. I want to keep the friends that I have and I don’t want to frustrate my partner in the long run. He’s very good at acknowledging that he knows its not like me? It is my mental illness but I still feel there’s something more I can do. Usually I’ll see things I do and stop them but these things  i am truly struggling with.

494,"Hi,

As the title says I'm 37 years old.  I do not have a college degree.  Due to circumstances beyond my control I missed most of my senior year of high school, and rather than be the only 19 year old at school, I opted to get my GED at age 18.  I left home at that time and have been on my own ever since.  I have been moderately successful and have been able to provide for myself ever since.  I currently work in accounting / auditing.

Anyways, although I perform well at work and am well liked by my superiors, it has become clear that my options for advancement are limited by my lack of a degree.  My CFO has encouraged me to return to school and pursue a degree in accounting.  He thinks it would be good for me.  I'm not so sure.  I guess I kind of fell into accounting.  It was a progression that I never intended but happened out of necessity.  I just moved along where my employers needed me and ended up here.  I'm good at it, but I'm not necessarily passionate about it.  If I could go back to being an 18 year old and chose my career path I probably would have chosen software engineering or something along those lines.  Also, if I were go to back to school it would have to be an online school.  I have no back-up plan or anyone to help me.  Period.  I have to work full-time to support myself and my hours cannot be changed.  My options are more limited than some.

So, what do you think?  Am I too old to go back to college?  Should I pursue something in accounting, where I have real life work experience, or should I pursue something I am more passionate about?  Am I too old to start a new career?  If I were to go back to school, what would be my best options for colleges or universities that offer online courses?  I looked up University of Phoenix at it was like $48k for a bachelor program.  I don't think I can ever afford something like that.  Are there any other well-regarded schools that are more affordable?  I live in Southern California, in case that helps.

Almost like paranoid, it drives me crazy and i can be very pushy and im not really me anymore. Dont get me wrong i can still be cheerful and laid back but if theres any sign of her leaving or somthing off i start to freak out.

Im really hoping someone can shed some light on this. These feelings are new to me and i hate it so much. Ive asked a friend who has anxiety real bad how she manages it and she said she just crys herself to sleep. I chuckled and said fuck, she was like ""pretty much"".

So is there anything anyone else does to help this, or at best completely get over it. Thank you",16Sep2019,1

502,"I had a rough first four weeks at college. I got a double kidney infection and was in the hospital for around 3 weeks.

I’m in a math class that is “hybrid”. Meaning there is virtually no instruction, you just show up to do a problem set, and then to a computer lab two days of the week.

I was in the hospital week 3, and came into class week 4 and decided to take the test on what I was working on. It was a bad mistake. I just took my medication so I was kinda out of it. 

I failed. 7/15 questions I got right. I was really embarrassed because I do know the content. I just got frazzled. 

Should I ask the professor if I could retake or anything? I feel stupid solely because I made the choice to take the test when I could have waited a week. The professor was aware I was in the hospital.

I also have a 53% in that class right now. So I’m kinda stressed about that.",16Sep2019,1
503,"Ok a little context, me and my brother share a mum but have different dads since his dad died after a drunk driver head on crashed into him, brother was 5.

Only a few month later our mom got with my dad which eventually led to my birth, we were always close growing up.(me and brother)

Well He now has a business that he started with 3 of his friends with them all taking different courses so they’d have every angle covered.

Well long story short the business is successful and he’s making good money.
He asked me to move in since it’s a better neighbourhood, I wasn’t sure so I talked to his gf and she told me something’s.
1) he gives my mom rent money.(cause I live there).
2) he hates my dad, calls him ‘the parasite’ to his friends and gf.
3)He set up a trust fund so I can afford to go to university. 
4) he’s very bitter and resentful towards our mum for getting with someone so quick, with me being ‘only good-thing to come from it’

The thing is that his gf reckons he will stop paying my moms rent if I move out of her house.
So she could go homeless, which I of course don’t want.

My fiancee is my first MTF, not to say I'm any good at aiding FTM dysphoria, but I always struggle with words and I feel like I am not good at comforting my fiancee as much as she promises that I'm doing fine by just listening to her and letting her rest on my shoulder/cuddling her.

She's in pre med and when we met she was a virgin and unexposed to a lot of things. Once accepting her virginity, I mad sure she was exposed to certain things ontop of that in a very safe and comfortable fashion. 

The issue however is that she seems too attached. She's always compromising her school work for me, she's always begging to see me, if she annoys me a little bit she'll start getting teary eyed and even when we have sex, she thanks me after. 

I get that she loves me but I feel as if Im distracting her life. I have to literally abandon her and force her to go by herself to do her work so she can.

514,"TL;DR: e.g.  put down toilet seat after pee, dirty clothes in bin, pay bills on time, check engine oil or water container in the vehicle, buy milk, etc.
In my case, I still fall into the harsh reality that none of my partners ever answered me for their whereabouts after a formal departure.
Thanks to the insecurity in the city where I live (kidnapping, assault, etc.) it is almost an obligation to offer my whereabouts or let know to my family, friends and partner I’m OK.
Sadly my family, as well as many other neighbors, acquire that “toxic” behavior to share almost exact geographical location and time whenever possible.
I do always try to share my whereabouts to my family and partner, and viceversa I kindly advice them to do the same as soon as possible, however, as much as my current partner as the previous ones seems not to care at all and this is something that causes me anxiety and  sometimes even upset (not toxic upset) because it is something important not only for me but it is generally common sense.

516,"So I'm just out of college and working at a part-time job that I don't particularly like.  It's not horrible per se, but it's stressful and inconsistent and not really my type of work environment.  I'm living at home with my parents right now, nearly rent free, and so while I do need money, it's not like I'm in any danger of going broke or becoming homeless or anything.

My mental health is pretty bad right now, as is my physical health, and I feel like I need to focus on myself and my own interests for a while.  There's a lot of stuff I was planning on doing this fall in terms of pursuing passions and future schooling, but I feel like I can't focus on any of it in my current state.  I think time to myself to focus on my wellbeing and passions would be good for me, but I don't want to fall into laziness and uselessness or anything.

Would it be a bad idea to quit and take some time to myself?  Like I said, I have some money saved up and there's no risk of homelessness or anything, so I kind of figure this is the best time in my life to do something like this.  On the other hand, I will need to start saving SOME money and looking for a future path/career, so quitting this job is making me a little hesitant.

517,"This is a really long story that began about 9 years ago while I was still in high school. I got introduced to this guy by a friend and he was obsessed with her in a weird unhealthy way. Said guy, who I will call Joe, claimed he had a brain tumor. We talked online a lot because he claimed he was in the hospital all the time. The more I got to know him, the more I began to question everything he told me about himself. I won’t go into details but nothing he said was credible. It became clear he was a pathological liar and I don’t think anything I actually know about him is a fact. Upon realizing that he was probably lying about everything, I began to distance myself from him, but then he started showing up at my high school. He didn’t go to the same school as me but he knew what school I went to because of our mutual friend. I clearly did not want to be associated with this person anymore and I tried to let him know it a polite way. He then began following me on my commute home. This is where I started to become scared of him. I one day just blew up on him and told him to leave me alone and stop following me home. I blocked him on social media and his phone number because I just didn’t want to be associated with this person. I ended up graduating high school and moving shortly after that interaction and I didn’t really hear from him again. I should add that when I first met him in person, it was clear that he probably had some kind of developmental delays. I don’t know if this is due to his alleged brain tumor or if he had other disabilities I was unaware of, but he presented physical symptoms of some sort of disability. 

Over the last 2 years, I’ve been getting texts from different numbers with messages either inviting me to some event or a person claiming they met me somewhere that I’ve never actually been before. The messages are always addressed to me and it always turns into some elaborate lie of how this person met me. I’ve stopped responding to the messages I’ve gotten as of lately. I’ve always assumed these messages were coming from Joe. It’s become evident through these messages that they know where I work and it’s starting to scared me. The messages are not threatening by any means but I feel like this person can be potentially dangerous. 

I want to know if it’s possible to report non threatening messages and if there’s some kind of legal actions I should take against this person. Despite the messages not being threatening, I believe that this person could be dangerous. Any advice would help. Also just got what to add that I’m located in New York.

524,"Sorry for the rant I'm still pretty upset about it. 

I have to have my wisdom teeth taken out because the top two have both for periods of time shifted while coming through in such a way that they hurt my cheeks. They shifted back so they are fine again but it happened more than once and one time the wound got infected too so the dentist said to get them taken out.

Apparently they hospital's policy is to always take out two at a time at either side, and I already had the right ones taken out. Because the bottom ones aren't through that much they had to make an insicion and break up the right bottom one up and it took way longer than the top one. The local sedative did work pretty well so my jaws and teeth didn't hurt that much during the process, but my cheek did hurt like hell from holding it open with tools for that long. It hurt so much I felt it was about to rip. I bet it wasn't really but that's how it felt. Beforehand when they were giving me the injections I told the doctor that I was really scared of it hurting and he assured me that the sedative worked really well, but then my cheek ended up hurting A LOT and he was just like 'well yeah we can't sedate your cheek duh'.

I was hoping that after I got the first two taken out I would know that it wasn't that bad and I wouldn't be scared for the other two but it actually was that bad and now I'm just terrified to go back... Is there anything I could do to prevent it hurting that much? Is it normal that the cheek isn't sedated at all and they pull at it that hard? I was thinking maybe I could ask to only take the top one out but I don't know if they'd do that if it's not their policy... (my right and left sides were pretty symmetrical in how far they had come out so I think the process would be similar too) 
The bottom wound also still hurts pretty frequently after three weeks and I still can't do without ibuprofen. On top of that I'm also pretty sure that when I rinsed my mouth after a week or so I spit out another bit of broken up tooth that I guess was just still in there too...

I'm half thinking it just isn't worth it and I won't go, but I'm scared to face my dentist at my next regular checkup if I haven't gone...",16Sep2019,2

I was trying to defuse situation but at one point my bro in law called her f***** crazy at which point she stormed off crying. He had been drinking a little at this point so he was slightly intoxicated not overly. 

I then said prior to going after my wife you need to calm down and watch how much you drink. He then said to me in an aggressive “you want to start with me too”. I am typically a calm and respectful person but I snapped at this point and called him a b***** and got in his face in front of everyone. He didn’t say a word.

I immediately regretted it as i felt very immature and childish. Out of 10 years of knowing this family i have never snapped. I immediately apologized to the entire family. I spoke with the parents and they said this is not how we talk in this family, i stayed quiet and bit the bullet. I did mention that lets not forget he also swore but they pretty much ignored it.

The brother in law didn’t want to even speak with me for a few days which is understandable. I sent him a long message indicating my apology. His dad then forced him to speak with me. I apologized profusely and sat there while he fed me things about the last person who got in his face he knocked out. Also if this happened with his girlfriend he would be kicked out of family etc. i sat there and took it because i did not want to enflame the situation. 

In essence i apologized to everyone, did not receive an apology and his part in the matter has been neglected as if it didn’t happen.

Also for his entire life his parents have always overlooked things as he is the only boy in the family and my wife and I had to live up to gold standards.

We’ve been chatting for a while, more than 6 months. We’ve talked pretty much on any topic, besides romantic relationships. There hasn’t been any hint of something romantic or sexual, not even flirting. Our relationship is purely platonic, at least that’s what I think.

1. He asked me if I was okay about him visiting my country and seeing me. I didn’t think that he’d actually buy a ticket anytime soon, so I said that it’d be fine. So technically, he didn’t do anything without my permission. He said he was interested in seeing my country and also (obviously) me.

2. I checked his facebook and everything he’s ever said to me about his friends, work, family, etc. was right. I didn’t find anything suspicious.

Here’s my question: Why did he trust me that much? He didn’t even ask for my social media accounts (he doesn’t know my last name so he couldn’t have searched). He still doesn’t seem interested in that.

Isn’t it a bit weird from him to take a 16 hour flight just to see me? I don’t even know if he likes me. Should I be worried? Or am I being paranoid?

As there’s not much time left before this trip, my social anxiety is getting worse. What do I do? Should I pick him up at the airport ?

In this case, it’s my stepsister (31) who’s 7 years older than me. Whenever she has an issue, she cries to my stepdad and then he tells my mom. My mom has chronic issues with her body which is why I’m still living at home, to help take care of her. 

I have a great job and I love my life. I think this upsets my stepsister because she will snitch about ANYTHING. I left food out on the counter, hair in the bath (my hair is short and hardly sheds), and today she went overboard and snitched about something I was wearing on the way to the train to work that my mom particularly doesn’t care for.

Mind you, she’s not perfect. She does all of the things that she complains about and even worse around the house. But I DONT SAY SHIT!! Why? Because I’m not a snitch!!! And guess what?! I know she’s going to clean up after herself... just like I do (if I have time between the 5 seconds it takes her to start opening her rotten mouth)

We’ve known each other for 10 years now and I’ve never particularly cared for her (probably my instincts telling me that she was a SNITCH) but now this is getting ridiculously petty and I’m pissed off. I’m focused on my career and personal goals, I don’t have time for this elementary and childish bull shit.

Also... SHE CAN COME TO ME!! I tell her ALL the fucking time, come talk to me if anything is out of order! And the one time she did come to me, she sent a ridiculously disrespectful and condescending text. Despite that, I fixed the issue immediately and apologized. 

What do I do??? How do I get her to mind her goddamn business? Clearly she never had real siblings cause they would’ve taught her good growing up.

546,"Hey guys, some background info to know is that I live in Australia, northern queensland

So my chihuahua disappeared around the late afternoon of yesterday and I haven't found him since.. I stayed up until 3 am deep searching my whole property and house + the roads around where we live and the beach as well. I I live out rural on a quiet farm where I get maybe 5-10 cars passing my house daily, typically because of the beach at the end of my road. My dog loved going to the beach. We have a few predators around such as dingos, goannas, hawks/eagles, snakes and I am afraid that one of those got my dogs yesterday. It is not in his usual behaviour to disappear, he has ran away but not far at all, like 50 metres and he just watches and waits for whoever has left to return home. Around here it can get very cold (10-15 degrees Celsius) for our dog, he usually gets cold from the fans inside our house. I've asked and informed neighbours of my lost dog and posted on lost pets forums but I don't know what else I could do.. I have searched my property twice today and probably twice tomorrow too, but I cannot find any traces of him.. I don't know what else to put guys I'll answer every question you ask I just need some advice on what else I should do or maybe some coping methods because I am not handling this well mentally.

549,"I recently graduated as a dentist, and I’m working in a small community a few hours away from my hometown (where my fiancé lives). I rent a place out here and work Monday to Friday, and go home on the weekends. I have been working 2 and a half months so far.

Dental school was really hard on me, but by the time I was in 3rd year, I felt like I had no option but to stick it through. Now I am second guessing my profession but I feel trapped financially and emotionally. It’s not that I don’t like doing dentistry (most of the time). My issues with the profession come from me being a very anxious person. I have trouble making decisions without second-guessing myself, and most procedures are so meticulous that I find myself spending most of the day stewing in self doubt and I am in a near constant state of nausea because of it. 

I honestly try my best and all I want is for my patients to receive the best care they possibly can from me. But I can’t help but feel that my patients don’t deserve me... sure, most things turn out fine, but it absolutely destroys me when I doubt a treatment plan or feel that something didn’t turn out perfectly. I am losing sleep, I have difficulty eating until the end of the day, and all I want to do is roll myself up in a blanket when I get home.

I can’t quit and start over because of how in debt I am in from school. I just can’t jump ship and transition to something else at this point, as much as I would love to. 

So getting to the point - here are my questions:
- (to any dentists reading this) will I eventually start to feel more comfortable as a dentist? Or is this just my life now?
- (to anyone) I know partaking in things I enjoy, eating healthy, and staying active are important for my overall wellbeing. How do I motivate myself to take care of myself when I feel too tired to do anything?
- (to anyone) how do I not bring bad feelings and negative emotions home with me at the end of the day?

557,"To lay the groundworks for this, before anyone jumps down my throat, I want to say that I was raised in a loving household that supported diversity. I was never taught to hate anyone for their sex, gender, sexual orientation, skin color, nationality, ethnicity, etc. I have no quarrels with anyone because of those things. 

I am a 22 gay white male struggling with my preference in other guys. I am attracted to primarily Latinos, and then other white men like myself, though I find many people of all colors attractive, but I do have a type. I'm being called racist by people because of my preference. I have never once said or thought that I am not attracted to people outside of my preference, because that simply isn't true. The skin color isn't what attracts me physically: it's actually usually their faces. I know that sounds utterly weird (and utterly appalling to those more liberal than me), but I have a preference on how someone looks from the neck up. Though, I want to clarify, I am not saying other people are ugly or unattractive in any way or that I am not attracted to them. I do have a preference, though. Straight people in general are allowed to have preferences based on the same concept, but as a gay man, I'm racist? I grew up with my white family and my best friend's family. My best friend is Dominican and I love the culture I grew up around with him. I believe it's one of the reasons that I am primarily attracted to Latinos. Your childhood environment can affect things like that according to psychologists, so there is actual evidence behind what I am saying as well.

To continue with that, I have a preference in the personality type that I am attracted to. I myself am a mixture of masculine and feminine traits, though many people believe I am straight when they meet me, and I have nothing against more feminine people (male or female) and I love those people for who they are. Though when I date someone, I look for someone on the more masculine side of the spectrum. I don't have preferences with height or weight or body size, but I do like a guy who's more ""masculine"" when it comes to personality and demeanor; simply because we get along better and I want to get along with my lifelong partner. The two more feminine guys I have dated constantly belittled me and were very selfish and controlling. The more masculine guy I dated actually talked with me about things and was in general more supportive. I know that the situations can be easily flopped, with feminine guys being more supportive and masculine guys being less so. But I felt better being around someone who made me feel like a normal person, because at the same time, being with someone who is masculine has more of the same interests as me. The one masculine guy I dated would play video games with me, go hang out at my two favorite bars (one a sports bar and one a pizza bakery/bar, both of which I had previously worked at and know several of the employees; neither of which were gay bars), and our conversations were always more entertaining and fun to me. I want someone with at least some of the similar interests as me and I typically, not always, find that with more masculine guys. I see nothing wrong with feminine guys and I want them to live their best, happy lives; but I want someone a bit more like me in the end. 

I don't want to be called homophobic or racist because of my preferences in guys, because I don't exclude other guys outside of my preference. I am allowed to have a type, whether specific or broad, and I don't feel it's wrong to seek what makes me happy; though that is not to say someone outside of my preference won't or that I will never find someone outside of my preference that ends up being my soulmate. I am open to looking and dating beyond my preference, but I am being told it's wrong to have a preference. I just don't know how to feel about this. I want to support and love everyone, just like how I want to support and love myself. 

But I don't know how to verbally express myself to other people when talking about my preferences. I do not believe it is wrong and I know people are going to attack me in the comments, but I just want people to understand that it's okay for me to be me and to like what I like. 

TL;DR I'm being called racist and homophobic for having a preference/type in more masculine Latino/white guys, though I am attracted to people outside of that as well. I just want to be supported in that is what I find most attractive and I don't believe I should be slandered for finding certain qualities in someone attractive; especially when I don't limit myself to my preferences. How should I best explain myself so people think otherwise?",16Sep2019,1
558,"Girl I’m friends with bought a cat, but she lives in the dorms and can’t have any pets, so she kept it at her bf's house. When they had asked his roommate if they could have a cat her told them her was very allergic, but they secretly kept the cat their for a week. When the roommate found out he was, understandably, pissed. She asked if my roommate and I could keep her temporarily until her permanent sitter neutered her male cat (the kitten is already spayed). We took in this 4 m/o kitten for two weeks, the girl never asked about the kitten the entire time and told us only that she’d pay for anything the kitten needs, so this began to seem like she was trying to get us to watch her cat long term (which we were not ok with because the cat did not like other animals which we had a cat and dog). 
Earlier this week she had called my roommate fat at an event, and when my roommate was upset about it refused to apologize for saying it, only that she was “sorry she chose to take it that way”. My roommate is very self conscious so hearing this coming from a “friend” was very upsetting to her. The girl had gotten mad at me for not getting in between the two and telling her what she did wrong instead of asking my roommate. She also made some questionable decisions within our campus group causing her to be called into a meeting (I brought up what she did, but the filing of it is anonymous).
Last night she texted me (after I asked her if she would bring litter for her cat) saying she bought more litter but she’ll be picking her up ASAP last night. I told her I’d be home in an hour and and after an hour passed she still hadn’t showed up. She claimed she had stuff to do and could come at midnight, showing up instead around 11. When she arrived she did not acknowledge my roommate or I and immediately walked into my bedroom and picked her kitten up by the collar. She grabbed her litter box and the bowls my roommate offered her to take and left.

She offered no thanks the entire time we watched her pet and refuses to acknowledge either one of us in any setting, and it is pissing me off because we’ve done so much for her. I’m not sure if I should confront her or not or even how to....",16Sep2019,2

I came out of high school with a 2.5 gpa 23 act. I got accepted into college and had no idea what I wanted to be so I spiraled. I drop out and got arrested for taking a 12 pack of beers and running a red light. The records were ""sealed"" because I met my requirements. I joined the military and I was arrested for drunk and disorderly and managed to stay in and the cops dropped the charges because my court date was pushed until after a 9 month deployment. I got in trouble with alchohol again because of a fight with a ""friends"" roomate. No charges because of the absolute ridiculousness of the situation but I did get admin separated. 2 years in the military. Then I applied at Dish network and quit because I just wasn't cut out after about a month in a half. Then I worked under the table for about a year in another city until I just wasn't able to anymore. So basically no job history for a year but I was able to leverage the reference for a job in my city above board and I worked there for about 8 months. I ended my employment because of a potential divorce and speeding tickets. I had a cop who had my number and I was a delivery driver. After that I got caught up in an MLM for a couple of months until I wised up. Then my and my wife got in a huge fight because I was in an accident. She basically said a bunch of things and walked away and I chased her. I pushed her down and we were both super shocked and the fight ended. We tried to get back home but the cops came and apparently there were witnesses. The court did some kind of thing where they drop the charge or something if I was good for a year and I was unemployed the entire year. I was watching a child alone because of her deployment.

My girlfriend is having a hard time with the workload. We're both about 4 weeks into our first semesters and while I'm staying afloat just fine, I've watched the stress eat away at my partner, and it really hurts to see her like this. To start, she tested into a French course she really wasn't ready for, which has been a ride of its own. She would stay up 3 nights a week spending damn near 5 hours on her homework that others were spending roughly an hour on. She's already looking to drop that class, but even then, the rest of her classes keep her up at night too.

I only have a few homework assignments a week and they're usually easy, tedious but doable at their worst, so I really don't have any advice for her there. I've been trying to help her with what I can to take the load off of her, but I'm about to be working and it's rare that I have the prerequisite knowledge to help her in any meaningful way. 

She's very clearly depressed. Her parents aren't terribly sympathetic to her and she doesn't have the best relationship anyways. Her grandmother is her bastion of support and it seems like even she's struggling to help my girlfriend through this. I've tried to encourage her to seek help but she struggles with her attachment to her old therapist, who moved his practice out of state a long time ago. She was on antidepressants for a short while (Zoloft to be specific) but had bad reactions to it in the first two weeks. I've suggested she try some non-SSRI medication but she's still hesitant to see someone.

I don't want to see her drop out. She's so smart and she has so much potential. She doesn't know what she wants to do and I think that's contributing, but I also wonder if she has the life skills to handle the workload of a prestigious university. Not to mention the depression. She says she doesn't care anymore, that she just wants to come home but she doesn't know what she could do without a degree. 

I want to so badly to see her succeed. I just don't know how to help her. I live 2 hours away and I'm under the thumb of my parents who are somewhat controlling when it comes to where I go and who I'm with.

Whenever we talk I'm not into it because it's the same conversation 
""How was work"" 
""Was ok""
""When will I see you""
""Dunno whenever""

I'll be honest I had never turned sex down before with my ex more so because i thought it was something that i couldn't do like how i'm still trying to learn to cry if i need to, but for the first time ever I turned down sex (it was a long week last week and I just wasn't feeling up to it) She was in the mood and thought it would be a good way for me to unwind from the week saying she could do all the work this time. Like i said before i just wasn't in the mood and all I wanted to do was put on some Netflix and hang out on the couch with her. 

I don't know if we are just not past the honeymoon phase and it concerns her that i was able to say no or what but now i'm feeling really guilty that i said no. She's not trying to guilt me into it but i can tell she is upset.

The past month or so my 17 year old daughter has definitely lost weight. She's always been a healthy weight, but she looks borderline underweight now. She wears baggy clothes, doesn't touch dessert, and whenever she does eat something I notice her looking for the calories on the menu, or box at the grocery store. We went shopping for some healthy foods just for her, because I thought that might get her more interested in eating something. She wanted 5 calorie sugar free jelly, rice cakes, chicken broth, and a bunch of low calorie fruits. Every time we go out to eat she refuses rice (she love rice), meats, breads, and everything with over like 20 calories in it, giving the excuse that it makes her stomach feel upset.

My mam died last month and it's put many things into perspective for me. Two weeks ago I was referred by my doctor to a counselling service in my area. Today, I called to make an appointment, gave them my dad's number for consent etc. All that was sorted, I got a call back minutes ago, I was asked a few questions including ""do you, or have you ever engaged in self harm / do you think about harming yourself"", to which I replied with the truth.

I self harmed 3 times, none of these times were serious cuts at all, but still counted as self harm, the first time was nearly 4 years ago, the second my 3 years ago and the last time was 9 months ago. As I'm under 18, my dad will be present during my first session, after which I can ask for him to leave. I know I didn't self harm consistently, I've never inflicted huge damage upon myself. Unfortunately, it's just hoe these things work I suppose.

But he will be informed of my past self harm, I don't want him to find out from a stranger, I'd rather tell him myself, question is: how? I've hid this for so long and all of a sudden I need to tell him this. 

What do I do? How do I do this? How will he react? I don't want him to worry, he has so much on his plate already, I don't want to add to it.

An old job of mine (which I left because I wanted to take an extended career break more so than not liking it) just had a position open up and they would “love” to hire me back on. I would like to be back there. So, I feel fairly confident about my decision and my ability to return there as I enjoy the work and culture.

I feel guilty continuing on, knowing I will leave soon, but I also know it’s not smart to put in my notice until the position on my old team is more firmly in my hands.

A little backstory, sophomore year, biology, i met this girl. At first we would just wave in the hallways or smile at each other in class. Somehow quickly turned into texting all night, Getting breakfast before school,  
Well someone decided to catch feelings ( This guy!! )
We talked for awhile, told me all about her ex and how he was emotionally abusive, then all of a sudden she got a boyfriend and left. She would act like i was invisible in class and left me on read when i tried to text her. 
Magically that summer she came back, randomly started to talk to me again like nothing happened. I went along with it for awhile and right when summer ended she blocked me. Junior year we would walk past each other in the hall and no reaction from her. 

After a couple months of junior year i dropped out and enrolled into night school as day school just WAS NOT my thing. But i will admit one of the major reasons was so i wouldn’t have to constantly see her every day, but still to this day at least once a week i think about everything and just shut down.

I liked my current job, and the benefits are great, so I decided to find another part time job. 

So I get hired to this new job, and on my first day my new boss very proudly shows me this manual she has created for the purpose of training me. And not to be unnecessarily critical, but it's not good. To give context, in the last six months of my last job, I have worked on creating processes and procedures to do my entire job, and they are awesome.

599,"I'm a single 26 year old Christian and never had a relationship much less sex. In my faith you don't have sex until you are married. I have a plethora of health problems including mental health issues and so finding a mate is pretty hard if not impossible for me. I'm undesirable by most standards. And most of the men my age are already taken. I refuse to hook up with a stranger or hire a prostitute. That leaves me with no other option but to masturbate. And in my beliefs that's a sin too. And I feel horrible about it.

In spite of my fucked-up-ness I have a very normal and working sex drive. I've been addicted to masturbation and fantasy for a year. I don't look at pornography (yet, thank God). I just want someone to love and love me back. I want the emotional connection that comes with sex along with the physical. I guess it's like when you've never had something you just want it so badly and then when it comes you realize it wasn't that cool. I get that. But my reproductive system doesn't. 

I feel very depressed because I have no one to talk to about this. I don't go to church because of severe social anxiety and even if I did I don't think I would want to share this perverted struggle with a community who subconsciously thinks women aren't sexual until they get married. I know there are exceptions but the risk outweighs the potential embarrassment.

I'm disgusted with myself and hate myself for feeling this way. I don't know why I can't just ignore it and go on with my life. I'm not supposed to feel this way. It's distracting me and is pushing me away from God. I can't pray when I feel so ashamed of my recurring habits. It'd be different if I sinned maybe one time but I'm sinning couple of times a week.

I have worked in this restaurant for a long time now, and have seen all kinds of crazy people. I have gotten plates and even desserts thrown at me before, but this situation made me angrier than anything that has happened before.

A Karen called to complain that her meal was not up to standards, which I completely understand. Whenever people are not satisfied with the quality, we gladly replace their meal with any other choice of their liking or simply cook everything fresh again. I listened to her, and even repeated back the information to her so we would both be on the same page of what exactly happened. Essentially, every time I would repeat things back, she would interrupt by screaming at me about how upset she was and she would start explaining everything from the beginning. Perhaps she thought I was not understanding her and this made her more flustered, which is why at this point (once I made sure I understood everything properly) I just said that I could see why she was upset. Just as I was about to offer replacing her entire order for free, she started interrupting me again. She threatened to call corporate, and told me to “listen carefully because she would only say it once” (she repeated it five times). She explicitly mentioned coming by today to get her refund, and that I better inform every one of my higherups to let them know she is coming. Our store has a no refund policy, and that’s just a rule. I was irritated at this point but I tried warning her about the no refunds, just to save her another headache the following day. She hung up on me for the first time.

Three minutes later, she calls again (lol). To remind me what her terms and conditions are, four more times. I did not want to be rude, so I just wished her a good night. This made her super irritated, but I still wished her the best.

I felt like I had to go along with it or else end things with him - I wanted to talk to him at the time, but when we finally got to see each other he was stressed my saying 'we need to talk' meant I was going to end things and he was ill, we didn't have 'the talk'. 

Since then I've not felt like this was a relationship as we don't see/talk to each other as much as I'd like, he doesn't show much interest in my life or integrate me into his life like I think is normal in a relationship, I also generally don't feel like he's attracted to me - I can't put my finger on it, but I just don't feel really valued by him. 

I've tried to just go along with it and stay chill but it makes me insecure - he doesn't communicate how he feels so I find I'm having to ask him if he still wants to be with me, I feel myself apologising for not being better in bed, etc. also I've tried explaining to him I want him to message more and he's tried but it's still not enough (plus insecurities are making it harder for me to maintain conversations with him due to anxiety). 

As I've brought up concerns so often, but still not gotten to the core of the problem of not knowing exactly what he wants out of a relationship in order to know where I stand, I worry he's going to get fed-up of this type of talk. I feel pathetic but I can't help but feel insecure in the relationship. 

I feel I need to lay this out and figure out where I stand, for weeks I've been contemplating ending things with him due to all this but I want to talk to him to see if it's worth salvaging - I don't think we can work long-term but I don't want to lose him from my life. I'm just worried if I try to talk to him about these things yet again it'll be too much.

**TL;DR** We didn't have the relationship talk so I feel I don't know where I stand, that and he's not very communicative means I feel insecure. 

My insecurities have seen me try to talk to him but in a less than great way, ie asking why he's with me rather than really sitting down and talking. Now I'm scared of bringing the issue up yet again as it seems every time we're together I try to talk about things to ease my anxiety.",16Sep2019,1

Anyway, I like cold. I maybe keep the apartment at 18 or 19 degrees celcius/ 66 fahrenheit. I usually keep it running at night because I like feeling cold and snuggling under my warm blanket. 

My landlord sent a very strong worded email saying that she can tell I keep my apartment freezing cold because the other apartments next to mine are getting wet and moldy. She also said my door feels damp (from the outside). It doesn't feel this way to me... I have no idea if the mold in other apartments is because of me?

 Because since the apartments are AirBnb and only temporarily occupied, doesn't that mean the air isn't getting circulated because no one is using the air con or apartment in general? And I don't know if they have dehumidifiers in each apartment, even if they do I doubt it's constantly running. 

So wouldn't that mean that because the unoccupied basement apartments are just becoming extremely humid because no one is using them would be the reason they are getting wet and moldy? Or is it really because of me? I need to know if this is really my fault because if so, I feel terrible.  She asked me to keep my apartment at 25 celcius or highee / 77 fahrenheit or higher. That's not the issues, I just want to know if me keeping my apartment cold can really cause this many issues for the apartments next to mine.

Thanks.",16Sep2019,1

613,"I’m not sure where to start. I guess it doesn’t really matter.

I had surgery this summer that caused me to miss the first day of class. I made sure to email my professors and let them know I couldn’t make it but I’d be there the next day. They were understanding and I showed up.

Now it’s week three weeks and I’ve barely been; to clarify, there have been (way) more days I missed every class than I attended even one. Lots of factors, I guess. Depression, a break-up with my longtime girlfriend and only friend here, general stupidity on my part, most recently a broken-down car.

I don’t know what to do. I had one professor tell me to not miss again or else I’m done. Then, I got sick and couldn’t take my car, so I just emailed her and told her I’d be there today, finally with the textbook. And then, after not sleeping last night, I passed out and missed the fucking bus. Class is ending as I type this.

I just feel so fucking useless and don’t know where to start. I can not fail this semester. I can not wait around longer. I want to start working and move on, but it looks like I might be out of luck.",16Sep2019,2

I ask my professor, ""where can I find a list of translated works of the author \[x\]?"".

""Wikipedia"", he said.

So I went, made a list of the translated corpus, went comparing them with the whole body of texts, picked three and started working.

Two years and a trip to Japan later, a friend told me, ""Hey, the [Japan Foundation](https://www.jpf.go.jp/JF_Contents/InformationSearchService?ContentNo=13&amp;SubsystemNo=1&amp;HtmlName=search_e.html) has a pretty neat list of translated works!"".

616,"We are about one year into this relationship - it is quite serious. 
He is my first love and first proper relationship.
(It has been tumultuous and rocky, but a very deep and intense love.) 
Where we are right now is very solid.

After an argument last night he went for a walk. 
I immediately felt insecurity and anger and picked up his phone and went to his Instagram straight to the DM’s. 
I found a name that i felt compelled to check out the message. 
Then there it was , hearts, and flirting, and interest from about 2 months into us dating (mid last year) and then brief more ‘banter’ type ones earlier this year in March with this girl.
I would like to think of this being innocent Instagram flirting or banter but it just isn’t. 

The thing that got me the most was that he had an ‘Instagram story’ (he is silent on social media. And so when he posts something, it means a lot) of a quote:  “dope souls need dope souls” and tagged this girl in it. He then hid this story from me and my account , because obviously I followed him and would see it. That was the move that hurt the most.

I am not petty. I am not dramatic. But I sure felt the earth move when reading these things. It made me feel sick to my stomach. 
We always knew we really liked one another from the start, and from my side there has been no one else (as per usual monogamous relationships) . From his side, he is more serious in this relationship than I am, and so I never worried about another woman. 

I am aware it is a breach of privacy and trust on my part. And that is why I don’t know what to do. 


If this is worth bringing up? And if so, how ?
If it hurts so much then surely it means something?

I feel like just showing up at his place and asking for them or maybe trying to find them and take them back. I don’t want to confront him over the phone because he will just deny it and probably block me. Or should I just let it go, cut my loss, and buy him another pair? These are $170 sunglasses.

619,"I don't even exactly know where to begin.

My mother (59F) has always been an exceptionally difficult person. Her own mother killed herself in front of her when she was 10 and she never really got the necessary mental health treatment that she needed to get over it. She always has self-medicated with food, drugs, alcohol, and more recently cutting.

She is exceptionally overweight, has nearly out of control diabetes. Around 10 years ago she stopped working entirely, has no friends, and barely leaves the house. 

No, I haven't been to the house to see her in 9 months, which she hangs over my head. She has managed in fits of rage, to say some pretty nasty things about my husband (32M), since he earns less money than I do and was trying to convince me that as soon as he didn't need me anymore financially that he would leave me. He now refuses to go to her house. We live in opposite ends of the same city (NYC, I am in Queens, she is on Staten Island). I do not drive. It would take around 2 hours each way to see them.

Oh and I work 3 jobs, around 68 hours a week. I work 7 days a week. My husband recently needed to have an emergency medical procedure that came with some fairly hefty bills.

So no, I haven't been able to carve out the time to see her. To sit in the dusty house and not do anything because her health is so bad she can't even walk for 15 minutes.

Oh, and on top of all this, she claims domestic abuse from my stepfather. That he has thrown her against a wall/down stairs. She had a broken leg and a broken shoulder 2 years ago from this. 

My half-brother as well has had violent tendencies towards her. While my method of dealing with her rage and anger was to move out. 

My mother refuses to ever get the police involved (except for one notable incident where she tried to trip the police officer and she ended up getting taken to a hospital against her will, to which she screamed and argued to get the patient advocate until they called a cab and let her out).

I received a phone call from her on Saturday evening, close to 11pm where she said she started cutting herself, that she had a terrible day out with my stepfather and she has no one to talk to. I asked how bad it was and did she need to go to the hospital. She said ""it's bad"".

I called my brother, I figured maybe he could talk to his father (my stepfather and I are not close) to make sure she is checked up on. My stepfather was asleep and no answering his phone.

My mom then got super angry at me, that I had ""dared"" to call my brother and that it was embarrassing.

I said that I am not equipped to handle cutting or this sort of situation and she needs to get some professional mental health treatment.

I don't know what to do any more. 

I don't know how to be ""a good daughter"". The aggressive ""you're a piece of shit, you never see me"" emails and voice mails don't help.

So, people of the internet, what do I do? How do you help someone who won't help themselves?",16Sep2019,14
623,"It's my second month at outbound telemarketing center. Due to the job, unlucky dating, pointlessness of life, and other things, I constantly feel depressed. 

You know it's bad when all I can listen to are songs like[ this one](https://youtu.be/83VmiaB-x2A) to keep my sanity and to keep me from having mental breakdowns. 

I tried visiting the psychologist few months ago because I was also feeling a bit depressed for a while (Until I found a job). 

She made me feel weird. It was like she was playing minde games with me. She would ask questions and then stop for literally half of the minute in the middle, creating awkward silence intentionally. I even told her that she is making me feel uncomfortable. Later she told me how it takes at least 10 sessions to reach any results and that it would be absurd to assume that you will get better from few meet ups, like it's a thing you have to do for the rest of your life almost. 

I studied marketing and I like to read psychology books and it felt very weird to me. Like she was trying to get me addicted to her sessions without actually helping me. 

Maybe she was trying to help and it was all in my head, I don't know.  (besides first thing about silence)

So now I have an anxiety to visit one. There are tons of psychology centers or mental help centers in my country but they don't list psychologists normally so I tried to find individual psychologists, idk how it works at all. (Lithuania). 

So now I have anxiety even thinking about visiting a psychologist.

But I understand most people don't even know what K is or if they do they think it's some crazy drug that's really dangerous.  I'm not here to sway anyone's opinion but please do research on it if you feel the need to tell me how bad it is, I don't feel like arguing in the comments.

Her past boyfriend was into drugs (I'm guessing pain killers and weed), and she thought it was super lame.  I've told her my history with drugs (which used to be way crazier but I've since cleaned up).  To her knowledge, I don't really do anything any more except maybe at a party.  I don't think she even knows what K is, and I'm not sure I want her to know... I don't think she'd want to try it, but on the off chance that she'd be interested I **really** don't want to be the person to introduce her to drugs (even though it'd be nice to get high together).  

So I'm torn on whether or not I just don't tell her about it, or if I do tell her and have to explain what K is and why it's enjoyable but then also tell her I don't want her to try it because I don't want to be the person responsible for introducing her to it (even though I really don't think it's bad, it's more just the optics on the situation).

I’ve never posted something like this out of embarrassment or fear of someone i know seeing it.
Anyways.. 

So here’s some back story I feel is crucial.
(TL;DR at bottom)

We dated for 5.5 years out of high school. Dated through college. 
We got into a heavy routine of doing the same thing every week on our last official year together, and we slowly drifted apart. We never lost the intimacy between us, but in public some stuff she mentioned was I never held her hand anymore and little things like that. Also I would go out with my friends a lot (which I did, and I never really took her.. shitty i know). 

(2017)
Anyways we ended up agreeing to take a break in October and  this is after I asked her to move in with me and saying she was afraid of our weekly routine not changing. I understood that and reassured it would but we still went on our break. December rolls around and this is after numerous texts between us, mostly me asking her for an opportunity to change. We meet up and this is last time I saw her. We officially broke it off and I was devastated. 

(2018)
A year rolls around and we’ve started talking a little bit, making random conversations on Instagram when stories get posted. Eventually we were chatting more and more and I asked to re-add her on Snapchat. 
This is when things started to feel better.
We would actually talk pretty frequent and she would tell me about her day and what not. 

(2019)
At this point in time we’re talking almost everyday.
She said she’s down to meet up and get food or drinks, but every time I ask her she never responds.. almost pretends that it never happened..

Her dog recently passed away, and I sent her and her mom flowers for their loss, she loved them and thanked me for being there for her, 
But I still can’t get her to agree to hang out with me, she still pretends like I never ask..

 I’m different than how I was back when she broke it off, and I’m still in love with her. She’s an amazing human and I would love to spend my life with her..

TL;DR: dated for 5.5 years, broke it off, been almost 2 years since and we talk a good amount, says she’d be down to hang out, but every time I ask she pretends it didn’t happen.

What do I do???",16Sep2019,1

642,"So I am currently dealing with a very weird and difficult situation right now.

It’s a girl. We both met about 6 months ago at dental school. She was a international transfer student from Jordan, but has been living in the states since 2013. When we first met, we really hit it off. We’ve gone out a couple times and had movie nights and kissed..etc...

Nothing else though. I must also mention that this individual is a very attractive woman however, she is is a Muslim and I am not. She does have a middle eastern name but I would not have guessed that when I first met her because she doesn’t wear a hijab. Apparently she told me that she used to wear one years ago, now she doesn’t anymore because of personal preference. 

Now obviously people that practice Islam live by very strict guidelines when it comes to interacting with people of the opposite sex (i.e. no sex, kissing..etc.) 

I am fully aware of this. 

She was actually dating non Muslim guy for about 2 years before me who ended up cheating on her for reasons unknown (probably because she was limited on things she’s allowed to do)

As of right now she is 31 years old and she says she is not “emotionally ready” to date or be in a relationship with anybody due to this guy that screwed her over and/or religious culture barrier.

We’ve been in a weird relationship. We’re friends but she tells me all the time how she misses me and likes me, thinks I’m very attractive, and how I’m a good kisser and she would want to date me in the future etc..however at the same time, she just wants to be friends?

I have feelings for her and her and I want to hangout with each other because we both like to go out to bars and stuff but she never drinks.

She is a awesome person who genuinely cares about me and likes me for who I am. She has feelings for me too but just wants to be friends and she doesn’t mind it.

It’s just difficult for me to be friends with someone who I am attracted to, but I want to be friends with her without feeling that way.

How would I go about doing this? 

Should I keep my distance for a bit until my feelings are gone or should i consider throwing this friendship down the drain? I don’t want to just cut this person out of my life though because she has helped me through a lot.

Any advice/input would be great. I just want to hear different people’s perspectives on this.",16Sep2019,1
644,"[I tried to post to r/relationship advice but wasn't ""allowed""..? Maybe bc I only joined that community like 5 seconds ago]

Up until Friday I (31F) was exclusively dating A (35F). A few points.

This would be my first serious relationship with a woman (I'm bi as is she but she leans more lesbian).

We were ""exclusive"" for 3 months but only met up a couple times because we live about an hour away and couldn't always meet up on the same weekends. 

We mostly texted and there were a couple phone calls. 

We had a tense misunderstanding moment texting late Thursday night. We ended the conversation as we were both tired. Well I needed a little space so I did not immediately text her early the next morning like I usually do and waited until I knew she was off work and asked how her day went. She ""read"" my message hours later but didn't reply.

Later the next day I just texted ""Ok well I hope you're having a good weekend.""
We text/talk EVERY single day all throughout the day. We haven't gone a day without talking for 3 months. We're invested enough (I thought) that I drove LD to her and she insisted on paying for everything we did together. 

I guess my question is...should I call her or send a more heartfelt text? In my heart I don't think she'll respond but this relationship is/was a little bit of a bigger deal to me. So while its killing me to swallow my pride and risk looking desperate as she is clearly not responding, it's also killing me to not try once more.

Theres a lot more to add as to the dynamics of our relationship and what the misunderstanding was about. If  you want to know more, I'll answer in the comments. I just really want unbiased/other opinions to either go for it or walk away. Thank you! Please be gentle.",16Sep2019,17

So back on May 11 I started to feel off. Like sick. And I had a severe panic attack. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with GAD. They put me on Fluoxetine which I was on for a month with no changes. So they then put me on Sertraline. It helped, but with terrible side effects. Now I am on Effexor which I think is helping with my anxiety a lot. Okay, so in the midst of that I also was diagnosed with a severe deviated septum which at the begging of Aug. I had surgery to fix. I thought that might be the cause of my brain fog, feeling fatigued all the time etc but I still feel off all the time. I had blood work done and everything came back normal, my thyroid was also tested which also came back normal. So now I have all these medical bills stacked up and still feel the exact same. Some of my symptoms include: brain fog, trouble with short term memory, tension headaches, fatigue, poor concentration, frustration, lack of sleep, occasional stomach aches. And the list goes on. 

Also side note, my stool is very inconsistent. Usually in the mornings I have diarrhea and later in the day it's harder to have a bowel movement. 

I want to have the energy and strong memory I had before but I can't seem to get back to where I was before and it is literally driving me insane. Idk if I should change doctors or what but after about 20 visits and nothing has come up I'm getting tired of it. I mean maybe there isnt anything wrong, but it sure does feel like it...",16Sep2019,1
646,"Hey everyone

Long story short, my wife and I have investments that we are gonna transfer into our joint account fora Mac.

The Mac is going to be mainly for her use, although I will be using it for school also, and it would be nice to have a home desktop for personal/recreational use.

Anyway, if I use MY student email, to which I AM still a student, would this be considered immoral? We are married, so it’s not like I’m getting a friend and using their email to snag a discount.",16Sep2019,1
647,"So, I'm in a relationship but my boyfriend allows me to have sex with other guys, since sex doesn't interest him much. I visit my boyfriend often who lives a couple states over and was looking on Reddit for FRIENDS to hang out with in that area when I come visit because I plan on moving there and want to get to know people. 

I came across this guy on Reddit who seemed interesting and we started chatting, I've even had some cool conversations with his girl. They are poly, not really familiar with the term. But his girlfriend is a virgin and they have some sort of issue when it comes to sex (it's impossible for him to get inside her?). They don't have an agreement that they can fuck other people, she wants to wait until they have sex first before considering that option. 

I really click with dude we have awesome conversations and share a lot of common interests, we started talking about our sex life and struggles. I'm very open and have no issue talking about sex with anyone, it doesn't mean I want them. BUT we got drunk together online and just clicked on a sexual level which escalated to us talking about BDSM and having a 3 sum with another dude which are things I want to explore! 

We've talked about hooking up but I'm cool with his girl and mentioned I don't want to ruin their relationship or cause an issue and I'd prefer she give him the 'Okay'. He said he doesn't think she'd be down for it and we could just not tell her. He said he NEEDS sex and is not getting it due to their personal issues and struggles, he said that if it's not with me it's bound to happen with someone else.

I don't condone cheating, but at the end of the day it's like if he's going to do it anyways why not? But I'm still torn because I'm selfish as fuck and super turned on that he wants to control me and take advantage of me haha! Their relationship seems pretty strong, and I'm not looking to steal someones man because I have my own. I just want a good friendship and someone to fuck me haha!

648,"So my girlfriend and I go to the same college (we met at freshman orientation and just clicked a few weeks after) and she is currently living on-campus while I am commuting half an hour to an hour and a half. I wanted to live on or near campus so I did some research to find inexpensive options. I found out that living on-campus is very expensive (~$4000 not including the required meal plan (~$2000)) while living off-campus would be cheaper even with the extra charges of bills. I also got to point out that living on-campus prices are per person and not per unit. the place I found has a max occupancy of 3 people. I am not really comfortable with living with others but I am comfortable around my gf. Splitting the cost between us will save each of us ~$3000 from what it would cost for living on-campus. 

We both talked over it and think that it is a good idea but when we mentioned it to our parents, they were not very keen on the idea. First and foremost, we have not been together for very long. It's a concern for both of our parents; we don't know what the future holds for us. I get that they're trying to be helpful and I respect that. But, as stated in the title, we are both legal adults at this point. There is also a concern that we will become TOO invested in this relationship. We are young, too young to have a family. I doubt this should pose an issue anytime soon (she claims she will die a virgin and be happy about it) but it's still a reasonable concern. My parents have also stated that it's inappropriate due to the fact that I don't have a job or any way to financially pay for the place, but if I were to live there, I could actually get a job without the risk of me being late as well as I won't have to waste so much time &amp;amp; money on driving.

I have been typing this with my girlfriend watching and helping so she knows that I am posting this. What should we do?",16Sep2019,1
649,"Before anyone say that I overthink or overanalyze or something, please answer my question. 

So I recently started in university, and believe it or not, we had a name game in our class to remember everyone's names.  The first person just said his name, after which the second person had to remember the previous person's name, and then say his own name. The third person had to remember the two first people's names, and then say his own name. The fourth person had to remember the three first people's names and then say his own name and so on until the last person  had to remember the names of all forty or so people's names, after which he had to say his own name. The thing is, almost no one remembered my name, while they remembered almost everyone else names. I know I have often been called ugly and I know that most people think I'm very unattractive, so I wonder if it could have had something to do with that? Is it that I don't look like a person that is interesting to be around or something?",16Sep2019,1
650,"Mobile Disclaimer

I’ll try to summarize this best I can. I’d also like to add a disclaimer that I’m not trying to humblebrag or seem elitist or anything like that. I know my circumstances aren’t universal and that i’m very privileged and fortunate.

The actual issue I need advice on is this. I feel guilty whenever I spend money, even if it’s just buying something frivolous like two starbucks in one day. I work 9 to 6 on my current gig, and come from a fairly substantial background, meaning I could not work if I wanted to.

But despite all this, I feel guilty both spending money and taking days off from work. It’s not that I’m cheap, ill pay for dinner with a friend or loan someone a couple bucks in a pinch. But the thought of ordering anything more than water at Chipotle makes me literally feel immense guilt.

I’m not sure how to overcome this. I understand financial responsibility, but I can never really treat myself to small things without feeling sad after. 

All advice welcome",16Sep2019,1
652,"Only brief information about us: We actually came to Gainesville, Florida, in 2001 from Iran, I was only a few months old and we came to the United States because my father got a good job offer here that he couldn't refuse. Sadly my father passed away in 2006 due to speeding. My mother raised me alone and worked really hard to give me a good life as possible. We used to own a gym before, so mom would always train there, she cared alot about her body and health, she has a very good athletic body, she is also quite tall, 5ft10, which helped here strength even more. Today (2019) I am 18 years old and my mother is 44 years old. The guy that is also involved is 19 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

So it goes back to April of this year (2019), when my mother's best and closest friend Linda came over to our house, she had a young guy named Garry with her. Mom served coffee and we all sat in the kitchen, I usually do not attend when guests come over, but Linda came with a stranger, a male, so I couldn't leave. Linda's son is a year older than me, but a good friend of mine. She first presented Garry to us, said that he was a friend of her son, and has recently moved in to a area here in Gainesville, close to our house. He left his parents to live on his own because he had gotten a new job here.  Then she started talking to my mom about a trip she, her son, his girlfriend and Garry would go on, and Linda tried to persuade mom to go with them.

&amp;#x200B;

The trip was to Ibiza, and they would stay there 4 weeks, mom refused and explained that she couldn't join them on this trip because of me, because my graduation was in May. So Linda told mom that they could stay 2 weeks instead, mom was still unsure, but after a long discussion and pressure by Linda and Garry, mom finally accepted. I wasn't pleased because I didn't like the idea of my mom traveling to another country alone and with men in the trip as well. Garry was quiet but stared at my mother very much, I felt quite uncomfortable. They then left and I talked with my mom about this trip and she told me that it wasn't a big deal, she also spoke to our next door neighbors and made sure they would check on me now and then.

&amp;#x200B;

I drove mom to the airport, hugged her and wished her a safe trip. She met with the the rest of the company and they all left. This 2 weeks were a pretty hard, I wasn't used to be separated from mom. But I focused on school because it was not so much left, and I wanted to graduate with as good grades as possible. I called mom a few times the first week, from what I learned, she was happy. Then a picture from Linda's son's mobile was sent to me, it was a picture of them in the beach, I was surprised when I saw the picture. Linda, her son and his girlfriend were standing close to each other with their hands over each other's shoulders, then a few meters away, my mom stood with Garry, she had her hand on her hip and Garry had his arm around her shoulders. What made me disappointed and very annoyed was how close he stood next to her and that the others were in a place while Mom and Garry were a few meters away. I tried to not make a huge deal out of it so I forgot about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I got a call from my mom, she told me that they would arrive tomorrow, early in the morning, she told me that she didn't need a ride home because they would all order an uber. The next day when I woke up I heard sounds coming from downstairs. I quickly dressed and walked down, there I saw my mom drinking coffee and chatting with Garry, they were laughing out loud and smiling. I joined them, it felt very awkard with him in our house, then I asked what he was doing here, and mom replied that he came over because he wanted to borrow something and that she invited him in for coffee. I just nodded and drank.  He then left and I started talking strictly to my mother, where I said that he can not come over, that he has nothing to do here, if he wants to hang out with me he should come to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day when I was driving back home from school I noticed Garry walking on the side of the highway, he walked out of the area where I live, and it was strange, because he doesn't live here so it was abnormal for him to go here. I then got an idiotic thought that he maybe was at my house, but that was impossible I thought, my mother would never invite a stranger in to the house if I'm not home. I got home, mom was in the shower, I went upstairs to my room. When mom got out of the shower I asked her if someone came to our place, she said no.

Then the day was here, I graduated, I had very good grades and mom looked very happy and proud. Linda and her son were there, they both congratulated me. Then Garry came, he greeted us all and hugged Mom, I saw Linda grinning strangely.

&amp;#x200B;

Then came two very calm months, (June and July) where I did nothing, then in the beginning of August Linda's son and some of our other friends decided that we would travel to Mexico and be there for a week, Mom looked incredibly happy, normally she usually doesn't like me going anywhere alone without her. The thing that worried me while I was there, was mom, she was alone. When I got back from Mexico while driving back home, I saw Garry, this time, leaving my house, he closed the door and left. I was shocked, the thought of a stranger in my mom's house and she is allowing it made me angrier. I walked in and mom immediately hugged me, Linda was also there. That was a big relief for me. Then almost every single day I saw Garry always walking out of our area, I didn't suspect anything then, because I thought he went to Linda's house. Then for almost 2 weeks ago, I walked in to the house, mom was not there, I could tell, because her shoes wasn't there, I then saw that Linda was there, talking on the phone. I tried to calmly and slowly walk up to my room so that I don't have to greet her, while walking upstairs I heard Linda talking with somebody over the phone, it looked like she was talking to a male and was congratulating him for getting the woman he wanted. I understood nothing and kept walking up to my room.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day I had work, so I drove, but took a different road this time, a quicker one. While driving I saw a woman, looking exactly like my mother leaving a house, she kissed the guy that was walking her out and hugged him, then started walking away, I started to feel an emptiness and fear inside of me, I had to know something. The day after when mom left the house, I followed her from behind, without her knowing it. We walked a bit, then reached a house, she went to the house and just opened the door and walked in, the door was open, so I walked in after her. I wished that I would never see what I saw, and I hope that no one will ever see what I saw. As I was walking to the room there, I saw my mom making out with Garry, then he laid her on the bed and they both started undressing themselves, I couldn't watch and left the house. I have never felt this abandoned, forgotten, betrayad and destroyed.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have known mom's dark secret for about 2 weeks, i'm a hundred percent sure that they have been sleeping with each other for a long time, since that trip to Ibiza in April, I believe. Mom doesn't know that I already know everything, and I haven't spoken to her yet, so I turn to you here in reddit for help and your advice on what to do, because I don't know what to do, I need help to figure it out, I hope you all can help me during this difficault time.",16Sep2019,1

658,"First I should say my building is HUGE. 36 floors and about 30 apartments in each floor. This is in NYC. 

So long story short I was at fault for flooding my apartment, which according to my buildings management damaged three other apartments. Without assessing damages, they already wanted to replace the wooden floors. (My floors look great and normal, none have risen or anything!!!). 

This is where it gets fishy...


- They had a ""floor guy"" come look at the floors. He only measured my living room.... 
- They kept reminding me how I'll have to pay for the first couple of weeks it happened
- They then learned I had insurance... Silence ever since....

I haven't received not one update regarding the incident. I do have insurance and last time I inquired about it to the superintendent (a month back), he said ""We're just waiting for you to tell us if your insurance covered you.""

The super was also very curious as to if my insurance sent someone to inspect the floors, which I just told him, ""I need an estimate before they send someone in"".

They also closed the work order ticket that was created bc if the flood with a comment of ""waiting for estimate"". Not sure estimates take this long... 

I don't want to reach out incase they forgot about it or something, but I feel like I should because I don't want to leave my claim open for so long.

Law requires them to offer lease renewal, as long as I pay of course, so I'm not worried about that....

Only thing I can imagine, they're waiting for me to move out to then keep my deposit or something. 

My question is, should I inquire about it or continue waiting for them to reach out to me? 

TLDR: Flooded my apartment, building management hasn't provided updates in over two months and not sure whether I should jog their memory by inquiring about it.",16Sep2019,7

I was really good friends with her. We used to talk in person side hugs and basic friend stuff. That was 8 months ago. Now she doesn’t even say hi to me when we walk past each other in the hallway I dunno why. We stopped talking in person completely but when I reach home I am usually the one who starts a conversation over text. But when I do she always replies pretty quick and our school is holding an international trip and she’s like why don’t you come just outta the blue. And to be completely honest it’s overpriced as shit, and the country is is nice but aren’t taking us anywhere good in that country. 

I just realized that she kinda blew me off many times in person not like not showing up but more like not keeping up with her promises and shit. She’s done that to many other guys in my grade and the grade below. She made another promise, if she keeps up to it(highly unlikely) I’ll keep her as friend but if she blows me off again, I’m gonna do something I should’ve done ages ago, lose her as a friend. 

She asked me to go to prom with her 9 months early. I don’t think I want to go with her so I was like I’m not sure if I’m gonna go at all. Then she was like wtf you better come cuz you are coming with me. Then I was like alright alright. I feel like she just asked me as “safety”.

I am trying to get a grip on my mental health, and my habits and actions are not healthy.

679,"So my world just got flipped upside down, and I’m trying my best not to panic. I’ve (23) been dating my girlfriend (24) for a little over a year now, and we have been sexually active. She missed her period in February so she took a pregnancy test in April to see if she was pregnant. ( her period is irregular, that’s why we wanted until April.) the results were negative so we decided that we were going to stop having sex. Her period never came back and for the past couple of weeks she’s started having a baby bump show. So last night she took another test and this one came back positive. 

Now this might not sound so bad, but the problem is that we still live with our parents, she’s in school, both of our parents want us to get married before we have kids. 

I just wanted to know if there is anybody here that has been in my situation, and how they managed to be able to not feel like a nightmare that doesn’t end. Also how did you tell your parents?",16Sep2019,1
680,"so I was i was parked in the school garage and I was kinda crooked but I was in the lines so I thought it wasn't a big deal so I left it as is. when I came back to the car, there was this girl that was a little close to my car so I couldn't get in through the driver's side so I went in through the passenger side. I tried backing out but I didn't want to risk hitting her. I noticed the girl was in her car and I asked her if she could back out so I can and she was like sure. I wasn't really paying attention so I didn't think anything happened. When I got home, I noticed that there was scuffs, a scratch and a little bit of the paint came off near the tire. What exactly do I do here? I don't want to tell my parents as I'm sure they'll blame it on me. I cleaned off the scuffs but obviously the scratch and paint are still there.",16Sep2019,1
681,"So there’s a part of the refrigerator that’s broken, and I realized it but I didn’t say anything because I honestly was overwhelmed with all the work I had for school. Anyways, I’m in my room a lot and I’m really quiet so sometimes they don’t know I’m there. So one of my roommates texted the group chat about the broken fridge, and I replied ""oh wow"" and then I hear in the living room one of my roommates say ""what does she mean by oh wow"" and so on. So I went outside and I cleared everything up and told them that I would email the RA about it and see what would happen. At this moment I shifted back to high school survival days because there’s 4 of us, and I know they’ll get the 3rd person to side w/them or talk about how I broke the fridge (which I didn’t). How do I handle this w/o coming off as a bitch?",16Sep2019,1
682,"The title is basically TL;DR    

Now let me tell my story a bit more in depth. 

I spent my afternoon alone in my room or, at least, I thought I would. My sister occasionally comes in without even knocking, some time ago, it got so bad, that I set the rule that she would have to give me 50 cents every time she opens the door and additional 50 cents for every minute she spends there (time will be rounded up to the next minute). I recorded it all in a sticky note on my PC. I never expected her to give me the money, but at least she comes less frequently to piss me off by now.
 My mom comes in my room as well from time to time, but I haven’t had that much of a problem with it, as she would come to check if I had enough water to drink and so on. 
The issue I am having is that everybody just breaks in. 
My understanding of doors is the following:
If it is fully open, you can just walk in. If it is only partly open, you may open to door, but be careful and if it is closed, you knock on the door before just breaking in. 
Why is it so hard, no matter what I do, nobody understands that I don’t want to break in all of that sudden.  
I was just doing more of a secret hobby of mine, which I never really told anyone of my family about (yet(?!)). I was drawing something on my notepad, when my mom came in, I quickly pushed it under my table, as I got scared, she said something along the lines of:“What are you doing there, I didn’t mean to interrupt you“ I was just like:“Nothing“, but she kept asking, I came up with an excuse, which she believed, but she was asking, if she could help me, it sounded difficult to her... Now I do understand, that she didn’t have any bad intentions, unlike my sister, but these situations make me really uncomfortable, because of my anxiety and so on. 
I can’t just come up to her and say:“Would you mind knocking on the door the next time???“ 
Earlier this day, when we were having lunch I was telling her how the day at school was, when my dad came home from work she wanted me to tell him one of the stories, which I then did, but nonetheless I feel really uncomfortable when having to tell a story from school when everyone is in the living room?

If it matters, I am 16M, my sister is 15 and we are both still going to school.",16Sep2019,1
683,"From a young age I have been expected to learn spanish and the pressure has made me not want to do it. I don't have a choice, of course, but I at least want to make this easier. There are plenty of subjects that I am not good at, but none of them cause me as much stress as spanish does. This is very triggering for my anxiety, especially since I have to focus on improving my speaking ability.

I can understand others just fine, but when I speak I freeze and I forget many words. I am very self-conscious about my accent and I don't want to sound like a two-year-old when I talk. 

I don't understand how other people find learning a language fun or enjoyable. For me it is terrifying and I wish there was another way around it.

684,"I'm sorry if this seems rushed, I'm in a bit of a situation. 
I've been contemplating doing this but I can't find anywhere else that can help me. 
So my best friend who lives halfway across the earth away from me, I've known her for a year and a half now. she's 15 and I'm 13, and we used to talk a lot. we grew distant for a bit, and we're now in the same friend group (it includes her and her girlfriend and a few other trustworthy people) she reached out to me about an hour ago, saying she needs to vent. she basically told me that she wants to escape her toxic and abusive family. i talked to her for a while, everything seemed to be controlled, but then she told me that she wanted to ""run away and end it all"" I talked her down and told her how much I love her, and that you'll be out of there soon, and that there are people that love her

I think she isn't in that state anymore, and hopefully feeling better, but I don't want her to hurt herself. what should i do? should I tell her girlfriend or the rest of our small group? should I not tell anyone? should I tell my parents? what the hell do I do? Franky I'm just scared for her and want her to get help. 

clarifications: no, she wouldn't be lying. Ive known her too long for that to happen. also, she isn't telling me to do anything or guilt-tripping me, so it is very much not for attention or anything, she vented to me and I'm 100% sure it's because she's genuinely hurting and that's it

687,"Okay so I went in for a Starbucks interview and I think it went really well since I already have tons of experience in that area, but the manager told me she won’t get back to me until a week from now to decide who she will be taking on. I also had another interview with a movie theater and they offered me the job on the spot. I would much rather have the Starbucks job since there is a full time option, benefits, and better pay, but I don’t want to be left jobless if I am not chosen. The other job wants me to start the hiring process on Tuesday. If Starbucks wants me I will quit the theater to be a barista, but what I’m wondering is how to go about doing it. I don’t even know when I would officially start at the theater and I assume I would still be training. 

I know to be respectful and quit in person with the manager, but do I have to put in two weeks notice if I am so new and still training? I wouldn’t be putting this job on a resume and don’t see myself working at the company again, so does it matter if I leave so suddenly?",16Sep2019,1

689,"So I (24F) was recently single and I'm talking to this guy (24M). We met on Reddit and we go to the same university. We were talking online for a month or so and when we first met, it wasn't too bad. He's really nice and awkward, imagine Micheal Cera. Like its cute and funny at the same time. and he's really smart. so we met at his place, stuff happened lol. anyway, before that he mentioned he liked me, although i'm not entirely sure to what extent. lately he's been doing weird stuff that i'm obsessing over and I don't want to be THAT girl but I am beyond confused.

Here's some things he's done:

\- When we were texting he said he was going slow because he didn't want to ruin whatever 'it' was.

\- When we were together he said he didn't want a relationship and he didn't want to be stuck with someone for a long time. Which was completely fine and I respect him for saying that upfront.

\- after saying that \^, when I got home he texted me ""hey do you want a relationship?"" and I really couldn't answer yes or no because 1. he already said he didn't want one, and 2. we didn't know each other THAT well. so its a NOT YET at best. 

\- I'm Asian and my parents are really strict about who I date and he asked me if my parents would like him (he's white)

\- He didn't want me having sex with anyone else, only because of STD's, he said. and i'm like okay, no one's ever fucked me raw anyway, and everyone I've had relations with were clean. 

\- He's still in Tinder?????????? aka STD-Central?? (per his words???)

\- He ignores me all day but looks at my instagram stories almost immediately

\- I didn't talk to him for a day, because he said he's busy and he DM-ed me ""talk to me please""

I AM SO CONFUSED??

Like I've messaged him and told him if he didnt want to talk to me or if he didnt like me anymore, just tell me. dont make up excuses that youre busy and dont ghost me. be more mature than that. UGH.",16Sep2019,1
691,"I was recently got laid off from my job and have been entirely stressed out about money. I am attending college and it's very hard to find a job in this college town. I got a job at a chain tire store I use to work at in High School. It was a fine job then so why not now? 

Well there has always been a strict dress code but it didn't really apply to me as a high schooler. Basically I have to cover tattoos (which I understand) remove my earrings (even though females can have similar ones) and shave my beard, I have to be completely clean shaven. For some reason this has really upset me but I did it anyway. 

Another thing has to do with the management and work ethic at this store that bugs me. All this cumulates into me feeling entirely upset, unhappy, and frustrated at work. I really want to quit already, but I have no back up.  I'm not sure what I want out of this post but ya",16Sep2019,1
692,"Obligatory English is not my 1st language + mobile.

Lurker for years, finally snapped and decided to post. Thanks in advance to whoever takes the time to read this post

On paper, I should be happy and have no reason whatsover to complain, and heres why:


I (26M) live in the best city in our country, go to the most expensive uni, I have recently been accepted to one of the FAANG (facebook, amazon, apple, netflix, google) companies as a software developer student, which was the ultimate achievement for me. I also have very good grades. I've been told by both genders that I am attractive, and work out and diet to mantain my health.

My parents have money and some property, and I am in a healthy relationship (4yrs). Her dad happens to be one of the most famous musicians in our country, so they are set as well and I am loved and appreciated by her family.

I also have managed to keep a group of friends from high school, they're not the best for emotional support but we have a strong bond.


Sorry if I come off douchy, but these are all facts and I realize wayyy more people have got it way worse than me and I know I am fortunate in nearly every way...

So it baffles me why I have such an empty feeling. I used to play music but I quit when I started studying, when I tried to that up again, it wasnt the same anymore - come to think of it, nothing is.
Nothing excites me these days - listening to music, playing games, socializing barely does it for me. I feel less confident in myself than I have in years. Its like I developed such a strong sense of insecurity, even though I am ""peaking"".
Today was awful, I have hyperthesosis (increased sweat in my palms) so I always get anxious shaking hands since they are always a bit moist. A co worker shook my hand today, I gave her a half hearted hand shake and then she asked if I was gay in a disgusted tone. I have no issues with the LGBT+ community, and have gay friends, but it did hurt me a bit, or my self percieved masculinity. My girlfriend is abroad and we couldnt really discuss it properly, so I felt like Im bursting.
This social anxiety came from nowhere, a few years ago I was working bars and was very active socially and in the nightlife, Ive dated several women and had many different groups of friends.
However, now I feel that if I were single or were looking to befriend someone, then I would never be able to do it, and instead succumb to video games (which really suck right now for me anyway). I am like a shell of my former self sometimes.

But its more than that, seriously I feel apathetic and cynical towards everything, and feel void of meaning. Its starting to take a toll and I dont know what to do... No suicidal thoughts I just feel alone and misunderstood and have to tough it up since I have all those great things going for me in life...",16Sep2019,1
693,"Right now I'm stuck in the cycle of:

1. Have lots of work to do.

2. Stay up late to finish work.

3. Wake up tired. Work poorly. Take longer to finish work.

4. Return to 1.

If I could function on 6 hours, this wouldn't be a problem. I really need 8 or 9 hours to feel awake during the day. Less than that, and I risk falling asleep in class, making me need to spend more time catching up on what I missed, etc...

694,"In order to achieve the things I want to achieve in life, I have to sacrifice some years to the work. Unfortunately, that's just the blatant reality of it. All the cards are laid out for me; I know exactly what I want, how to get there and what is needed from me. For the most, what is needed is my time. Lots of it.

Now, I don't have a problem with devoting years of my life to this specific thing. Everyone needs to ""pay their dues"" at some point. The hard part is dealing with the blandness that comes with: the painfully consistent and stale routines, the isolation and lack of friendship, the lack of inspiration at times to keep going, the borderline dangerous levels of stress, anxiety, and insomnia, the feelings of ""FOMO"", and, well... the boredom.

It was a little easier to deal with over the summer, but now that fall and winter is underway, it's about to get really tough. Last year was really hard and I already see myself slipping into some of those bad habits again. If anyone has any advice on dealing with this sort of issue, I would greatly appreciate it. Accomplishing my goals mean more to me than anything else, but I've run out of ways to deal with the dullness of it all.

695,"So she moved in 5 months ago and the beginning of our new lease. Two other guys in the house i’ve lived with for a while. 

Her and I got drunk one night and by the end of it we were fucking. For the first few weeks we only occasionally hooked up and weren’t that close. Didn’t hang much otherwise. We were both bringing other people back and it wasn’t an issue. We both felt slightly bothered when the other person brought someone back but we discussed it and laughed about it and thought no big deal.

But a couple months ago we started hanging out a lot more. More outside the bedroom, watching movies together, cuddling, going out to eat together, going for walks, sharing life secrets. We weren’t just being physically intimate, we really became emotionally intimate. I shared with her a lot about my life and past. Told her things i’ve never told other people. Most nights she was home (she often slept at her friends house, she gets some work through their family so it’s easier to stay sometimes), she would sneak into my room and we’d sleep together. 

She told me how she was falling for me and how she really liked me. I told her i liked her too and expressed my interest in dating. She clearly was reserved about it, she said she felt scared she was shitting where she was eating. And she was going through a lot with her ex st the time, blocking him out of her life and him blowing up over it. I figured i’d be patient and didn’t press it, i still got to see her all the time. I stopped hanging with one of my other friends with benefits and told my roommate so. (She has asked if i was still hanging with her)

One night a few weeks back we had plans to go see a movie. She cancelled last minute because her friend was coming into town and wanted to go out drinking and they haven’t hung out in a while. No problem. “It’s not like i’m ditching you for dick” she texted.

12am, her friends come home without her. Says they don’t know where she is but she’s safe. Whatever. I go to bed. 1am, she brings a guy back from the bar and they proceed to have very loud sex in her room, where we share a wall. There’s no insulation in the walls, so i heard it all. At one point the guy walked into my room thinking it was the bathroom (i had gotten in the habit of leaving my door unlocked).

 It really fucked me up. Next morning i called her out on it. We hashed it out, whatever. I wasn’t happy but was moving past it. But i learned a couple days after they are now officially dating. That really fucked me up. I feel humiliated and betrayed. I feel worthless in that she went to a bar and found a random guy “better” than me. 

I find myself getting over it, but the second i see them come back to the house, i get really uncomfortable. Im very unhappy in my house and I want this all in the past. I told my other roommates i’m going to be moving out for other reasons (but they probably know), and she’s getting really upset. Doesn’t want me to move, says i’m overreacting. Doesn’t want to force me out of the house when i’ve been here for years. She’s afraid as well the other roommates will just see her as a “whore” (her words).

On some level, i agree with her. I think i’m way too upset over this than I should be (although after typing all this out, maybe i’m justified ). Her and I weren’t a thing. We weren’t official. She’s rarely home anyways, especially now that she spends most extra nights at his place. So we don’t see each other much.

But i’m just so uncomfortable. Am i over reacting by wanting to move out? In a lot of ways the house is perfect for me and my hobbies and job, but idk if i’ll ever get over this and move past it. And what happens when i bring a future girlfriend over? When they learn i have a roommate i’ve slept with?

I’m just really conflicted and confused what to do. Everyone’s telling me i’m overreacting.

TL;DR: Roommate and i hooked up a couple months after she moved in. Over time we became not just physically intimate, but emotionally. We expressed feelings for each other. Around the time i thought we were gonna become official, she brought home another guy from the bar and had very loud sex. Now they’re dating. I’m emotionally wrecked and want to move out, but everyone’s telling me i’m overreacting since we weren’t officially a thing and we were just “fuck buddies”",16Sep2019,0
699,"My partner is a very kind man and he generally does not hold any problematic views (in my opinion) but a few days ago we were talking about makeup and he said how I'm very beautiful and don't need to rely on makeup. 
The more I talked to him about makeup, the more I realized he holds the idea of ""I like you because you're not like other girls"" and that's not a bad thing on his part. Most girls go through that phase where we hate the color pink because we don't wanna be like other girls. But generally we grow out of it, learn being like other girls is not an insult, other women are amazing as fuck!

The neighbors are very nice but also keep to themselves for the most part besides the waving hello and small chat when we do see them. Our neighbor directly across from us have a boy of about 9 or 10, he has taken a liking to our dogs and always wants to play with them. This particular child will come and walk over if he sees us in the backyard(we dont have a fence yet) and will just invite himself over and has scared us numerous times by just walking up, obviously we aren't expecting him. The catch is this kid has at least 2 dogs of his own that they keep in separate outside kennels 24/7. We have told the kid he cant come over everyday and he still does. We have even tried to limit him to twice a week. This weekend he came and knocked on our front door since I guess he didnt see us outside and asked it the dogs could play. I told him no and that they wont be able to today but maybe one day during the week and he left. Not only did he come back hours later by walking into the yard when we were out back and wouldnt leave when we confronted it but I also reviewed the camera and it shows him walking up and looking into our window. Again... we have no kids and he really has no reason to be over at our home, especially when he has dogs of his own. We have talked with his mom but she just doesnt care or corrects him and then repeat a day or two later. We don't have the funds for a fence yet considering it's a massive yard but we are out of patience. After a long day of work you dont want to watch someone else kid, not to mention he could get hurt in our yard or catch us in inappropriate clothes seeing its OUR home.

703,"I'm at a low right now. I'm struggling with building good work and study habits and in general am lacking drive to do well in college. I'm only at week four so I technically have time to recover, but the question is WILL I? Here's a little backstory, I had to withdraw from college last year due to depression related issues, I had the option of returning anytime within the next five years but I chose to return this semester because the bottom line is without college I'd be a deadbeat right now (I don't know how to drive, I've always had trouble holding down a job, I'd be financially dependent on my parents). The process of going back to college wasn't easy, due to withdrawing I initially had my financial aid revoked as I hadn't completed enough credit hours to qualify, this brought me and my entire family into a scare for about 3 weeks as I had to petition to a committee to get it back. Someone from a previous post I made told me that if my previous scares and failures haven't been enough to motivate me to do well in college then this isn't the place I should be at this point in my life right now. That got me wondering as to whether or not I should just drop out, deal with the consequences and let life shape me from there. All I know is that if I do decide to drop out, my life is going to be rough as all I've ever known for so long is academics so all my eggs were in this basket, I haven't taken time out to learn how to do anything else, but maybe this is what I need.

704,"As a preface I just wanted to mention that I’am not a Redditor. I don’t go on it, nor do I make posts, except for today, in fact I just signed up today to make this one. I just thought it was important to mention this as the only experience that I have on reddit is watching spooky Reddit stories at night on YouTube.

So about a couple of months before I finish my first year of UNI I find a house that I wanna rent with some random people for my second year of UNI (and yes I had to look for one late cause of reasons). When I first went there the landlord was very nice and we got along.
The house too seemed nice.
I paid my deposit for this house, let’s call it house A.

My halls of accommodation contract ended on the 14th of September, before then on the 11th I grab my bags as I told him on this day I’d be moving in over the course of the three days that I had left in my halls contract. He tells me to meet him at a different location, the next street over and so I do. He stands there by another house, say house B.  Just from the exterior this house looks way worse.

I asked him why did we meet here instead of house A, he replied: 
There’s been a change of plans
I replied that I wasn’t aware of this
And he proceeded to tell me this was much better and that house A was gonna go to a group of people and that there was nothing he could really do. I couldn’t reject him as my course starts in less than 3 weeks and I only had less than 3 days in my halls contract, at this time there is no way I could find an entire new place to live in sub bar 3 days.

I get into house B which is supposedly much better to try to settle in only to find over the next couple of days that the walls of the rooms in the entire house look like they have been abandoned for years:
They have black and orange marks all over them, some of them look like some one had pissed on them, hundreds of little blu tac tears and cracks all over them. 

Some windows are broken, you can’t close them, it’s hella cold at night, the bed looks like it’s been picked up from the street, dead bugs on all window sills, huge brown spiders everywhere, the taps in the bathroom are corroded and rusty, showers leaking, utilities are all super low class and prehistoric, everything is dirty, most of the furniture in the rooms is broken and moulded, the back garden hasn’t been lawned in at least a few years, the shed in the back looks like it’s standing on its last legs and there is a little wooden patio near the big glass window doors from the kitchen that looks like it’s been smashed up by hammers. Long ass story short if house A was like a decent 7/10 house B was at most a 2/10.

Here’s the kicker, two of the random people (really cool German students doing a year abroad) that I was supposed to live with in house A also got the same deal as me, one of them moved in yesterday and said in all the houses he has lived in this one would have to be the semi dead hobo hangout one. We agreed that we’ll talk to the landlord about this and if no dice we’ll talk to the UNI.

TL;DR:
Landlord lured a bunch of people in with nice house then put them in a really shitty one.

708,"Hey,

So, I was a student at at a good university out of state. However, due to financial issues, I wasn’t able to afford to pay for the semester. I think I may continue to reside in the area instead of going back home as well as get a part time job until next semester when I plan to transfer to another school. 

Despite withdrawing though, there are some really good extracurricular activities I want to be involved in on campus including one that pertains to one of my hobbies and a career I aspire to in the future (TV/radio station), as well as to maintain social contact in a new area. Would it be weird if I asked to be involved in this activity, even though I’ve already withdrawn from the school?

712,"Hi all.

(Disclaimer, I'm a bloke). 

I was never very sporty growing up. In fact, I was pretty terrible at almost every sport I tried. This, as things do when you're a kid, led to me being mocked in games class, avoiding it whenever possible and developing a lifelong phobia of doing sports in front of people.

The irony of this is that I actually love playing sports and getting active! I just never had the opportunity to do it in the way that I wanted. 

I recently moved to a new city and I don't know anyone here. I decided that I'd kill two birds with one stone, get active and meet new people at the same time, by signing up to play a new sport I've never played before. I paid about £100 for it and it starts next week, at a supposedly casual level.

The problem is that it's only a week away, and I'm already seriously regretting signing up. I've been having nightmares about failing and people shouting at me for it. I'm thinking about it all the time, building it up bigger and bigger. It sounds pathetic I know. I just want to get over this and give it a go. But I already know that everyone there will be fitter than me, more experienced than me, better than me - because who signs up to do a sport as an adult unless they're already sporty? I'm not too fit and sucked at sports at school, I feel like I have made a terrible mistake.

Anyone have tips for getting over this kind of thing? Experiences to share?",16Sep2019,1

Today he cornered two kids and laughed when they said they were scared. What do I do?? My mom wants to get him into therapy and we've taken away his phone.

He has autism and idk if that affects it, I have friend with autism who gets angry sometimes but he just isolates himself for a bit until he feels better, my brother screams and hits so I think it might be more than just autism. He is high functioning too.

There is no yelling in the house or violent language, it is just me and my mom. He was only a few months old when our parents divorced so it can't be that. Majority of our family and our other 2 siblings live in another state but they call often and we are moving to them soon. I know he doesn't really have friends but kids in school still talk to him and my friends talk to him when they come over.

716,"So last year i did my internship for 3 monthas at a company that sells working clothes. I kinda enjoyed it but 3 months was enough. 

The following year i needed to choose another internship. This time for 6 months. I was really busy with my exams and was in a depressive state at that time. It was already hard for me to focus on school at this time so my only focus was to graduate and to pass my exams. I didn't looked at workingplaces for my internship.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I needed an internship to graduate so i made the dumbest mistake ever. I didn't had much time anymore and choose to follow the internship at the same company. The first day i was there i already knew i made a huge mistake. I needed to do boring repetive computer work the whole day. I can't sit still and i need to have more social contact at worked. I was awful. In the last 3 months they where getting a new website. I needed to copy paste products from a database into excel. The 3 months where over. I graduated but they told me that i needed to finish my job at importing the products at the new website, because they can't work with computers. It's true that i promised it but i didn't know that i would take so long. I got paid by hour. 

So last week i finally finished it. It was the most awful job i ever had. I'm becoming more depressed every week. Sitting in a office and doing nothing else then copy and paste. I had a excel file of 25.000 lines.  I need social connections around me. I only have one collegae that is a woman who is 48 years old. I'm 21.

The worst part is yet to come. Last week they bought a clothing management system. I needed to be at the meeting with the owner of this company. They directly said during the meeting with 5 other people that i needed to put all the products in het system because i they can't work with computers. During this point i couldn't say no because all the other people where there. They really pressured me in this. 

The owners are very pressuring and say to me that i need to finish this because they don't want to do anything with computers. They buy a program but don't want to learn about the program. It's a week excuse because this work is so easy that everyone can do this.

After all these months of copy and pasting products i now need to insert products into this program. I need to insert the image, the article number the price, the size and the colours. It's awful. I really can't takes this anymore and i litterly become brain dead with this work. 

I think this is the ESTP worst job you can ever imagine. I'm litterly dying at my work. I don't know what to do at this moment. Should i quit or finish this? i think it's going to take another 4 weeks to finish.",16Sep2019,1
717,"There's a lot to unpack here so be prepared.
I came out to my mother a couple years ago and she claims to be okay with it but her actions say different. She didn't like that I was cuddling with my girlfriend even though we stayed in my room, didn't bother anyone, and didn't do anything other than talk, watch YouTube, and listen to music.
She also insists that I wear a dress instead of a suit to homecoming even though I want to wear a suit. She isn't comfortable with my gender identity and has stated that I should just be a girl.
She's asked me many times if I'm sure I'm pansexual as well. ""You don't want to look back later and be like, 'What was I thinking, trying to be gay?'""
Her boyfriend (lives with us) and my brother like to put me down as well. It's not always direct but it's subtle and I've been always been able to pinpoint that because I grew up with a narcissist stepfather.
I'm only alive because she's been through a lot and I didn't want to add onto it but I don't know if I can take living here anymore.
Should I move somewhere else, even if just temporarily? I'm only 14 so it's not like I only have less than a year before I can be independent.

There's this guy, with who I share a friend group. From the day we met (a year ago) he keeps on making comments about me. Last year it was just a few stupid remarks but these past weeks it's become so much more. He makes these comments about everything!

Like I said, last year he just made the usual comments from a rude guy I'm (unfortunately) used to, like about my appearance (I'm a ginger so you know what happens lmao), but lately he notices every small, nearly unnoticeable habit of mine, to a point where my friends and I joke about him having an obsession with me. Whenever the teacher calls my name, or when we're watching a movie, I know he's watching me, and confirms this afterwards by making a comment about my behaviour. This bothers me, because they're never nice and a lot of people laugh about it.

I find his 'obsessive' behaviour really weird, and it kinda freaks me out. So, I've tried a lot: ignoring it, laughing about it, making it uncomfortable for him by saying he's in love with me or something like that, and nothing works. He just goes on. But if we talk alone, he's actually nice and he doesn't make these comments.

tl;dr; A guy in my class usually makes mean comments about me, but these comments have become really detailed about me. He only does this in front of our shared friend group.

Why does he do this, you think? What should I do?

 This place has one main orthodontist and a bunch of students, not to bash on them because they work hard and I appreciate that, but they seem a little shady.

After that I went home from school almost everyday and recorded videos on my old laptop of me just talking about my interests and stuff while playing the xbox. I posted 13 out of 60 videos that I made onto the youtube account and left the rest on the computer. Sometime when I was 11, the computer broke and I lost everything on it. But I was ok because I was just thankful the videos were still on youtube. After I moved from the school with the email I used, the google account got deleted, but somehow the videos were still there on YouTube. I was stupid and didnt think to just save the videos in case something were to happen. Just recently, the youtube channel was completely taken down either from the school or from someone reporting it. Those were the only videos of me from when I was very young, and now that they're gone I probably wont hear my voice from then ever again.

The backstory here is that my daughter is 3 turning 4 soon and we recently had a death in the family( an aunt/uncle to me)

Me and my wife are non religious and we are raising our daughter in a non religious setting, but I think she would be well behaved in a church setting.

I am concerned about taking her to a funeral that young and what impact it may have on her. She’s very bright and pretty advanced for her age,(at least in this  bias fathers eyes) 

My daughter and the person who passed were not close, there’s no bad blood between the family’s it’s just their health was declining for years and was bed ridden, they have met and seen each other but I doubt if I asked her she would be able to name the person.

I don’t want to offend family members, and I also don’t want some of my more religious family members trying to explain their view on eternal life, I don’t believe in such things and that can make death hard to cope with, I also feel I can’t tell my daughter what my opinion is a lie (afterlife). 

I also want to have some talking points when discussing this with my wife, but I’m also open minded, if this is something she should go to my mind is not made up either way I just am sitting on the fence that it’s a bad idea.",16Sep2019,10

One of our sessions was in her car, and we were both extremely sweaty. This was maybe our 4th or 5th time having sex—again, this time I was wearing protection and had not previously had sex with her without it.

I woke up the next day with some small, painless, pinkish bumps in my pelvic area. I knew right away that some of them were ingrown hairs from shaving, and I thought maybe the others were pimples that formed as a result of our sweaty skin rubbing against each other. 

Even though the bumps didn’t itch at all, and were completely painless, I put a topical ointment on (Benadryl, if I’m not mistaken). I woke up today and the spots are starting to diminish and clear up a bit. Again, not painful, no spots on my penis (just thigh/upper pelvic region), no itching, no discharge from my penis, but I do have common cold symptoms (postnasal drip, slight headache). 

These spots seem to be harmless, and might even be pimples, but it’s still hard to tell. From what I’ve heard, most STI/STDs appear around 10 days - 2 weeks after intercourse. Its been 1 week since we first had intercourse, and about 3 days since the bumps first appeared. This leads me to believe the chances of it being some type of STD or STI are extremely small, but then again, it could just be me trying to rationalize...

Should I see a doctor immediately, or give it a couple more days to see how things heal up?",16Sep2019,1
753,A girl I met two days I sort of fancy needed some help with getting a cab home I handed her 10£ and said you can pay me back with a drink sometime she said “ of course and we’ll have a good time!” The next day when I was visiting friends she was there and we were having fun and laughing and playing pool and ping pong having a really fun time and she talked about her family and goals after uni! But when I snap chatted her today she isn’t imitating a conversation and is just answering and so I just stopped trying and have just thought she isn’t interested anymore and was just being nice.

754,"First of all I am not a native speaker so I can make mistakes. 

I think I should start from the beginning. When I was graduated from secondary school I entered an entance exam of a highschool. This exam had 3 stages and the last stage was 1 week camp at the school. So I passed first 2 stages and attended the camp where I met with her. We couldn't spend much time at the camp but after the camp attendants created a whatsapp group to keep in touch. Thanks to this group I started to speak with her and afterwards I think I kind of liked her. I thought confessing about my feelings but she was living in another city so I gave up.

It's been more than 4 years since we met and we always kept in touch and actually became really good friends. This year she entered university and moved to a closer city. So she is now much more closer to me. Therefore again I started to think about confessing my feelings. But now I can't decide that I should do it or not. Because if I get denied this can also ruin our friendship and I don't want to lose it. So what should I do?",16Sep2019,1

756,"For starters... I'm not very good at this whole dating / relationship thing. But I've been talking to and hanging out with a girl from tinder for the last month or so. I've tried my best to weed out the hoes.. hoping there's a few decent girls left on there... which is pretty fucking rare.

&amp;#x200B;

More or less me and this girl hit it off very well. We're basically clones of each other and It's like we're in fucking middle school when we talk / hang out. It'd make others cringe. She knows my goal is to find someone to spend time with for a while, I wasn't looking for a hookup. She said she was looking for the same exact thing... So awesome. I might of made a grave mistake of committing to her and trying to make things work with her. I'm just not the type of guy to play around once you find someone you click with. 

&amp;#x200B;

She tells me how much she likes me... she's said she's all mine. I barely know you, but you have no idea what i'd do for you. I asked her recently if she was committed to trying to make us work one day (No rush, it needs to happen naturally) We're on the same boat as far as that goes. Every impression I've gotten from her is we'd be committed to each other on trying to make this work. But I know for a fact she's talking to other guys, pretty sure not just from a friend standpoint. She entertains fuckboys on snapchat etc...  The thing that bothers me.. is she said she wasn't like that when we first met.. and now it's starting to come out. 

More or less am I in the wrong for expecting her to be loyal per say at this point? Am I just so stupid that I decided to commit to someone that I clicked with extremely well? She said she really likes the fact I'm only interested in her but I don't think she's returning the same favor...

757,"I live in a house with a bunch of people. I'm essentially the 'head of the household', the landlord coordinates repairs and discussess house related things directly with me, as my roommates are either not responsible or responsive enough to get things done. If they need something they ask me to talk to the landlord. After two of my roommates brought home animals without asking or telling my landlord about it for months, she straight up said that they CANNOT renew the lease. I was planning to stay at first and have my friend move in. This girl who lives in one of the rooms is NOT on the lease (she had a verbal agreement with the girl who lived here before me) saw the application for my friend and said that she won't live with my friend, who she's met as seemed cool with. This gal told me she WASN'T staying because she was moving in with her bf, but I guess they recently broke up (hence her most recent hospitalization). I didn't know she was staying, she said she wasn't multiple times so I went ahead working with my landlord to process the application for my friend, who was approved since as far as I knew I was the only one staying, I didn't think it was her business who was moving in. She basically said 'it's me or your friend' and I was thinking 'it's between my friend, who I trust and is responsible or you, a person who can't be on the lease, smokes inside, doesn't clean up after yourself, is nothing but drama and can't pay rent? M'kay, lol' so in think she's assuming that I'm going to pick her since she's 'already here and should have a say and who lives here'.

This gal and my former roommate said she could live here month to month because she wouldn't have been approved for being on the lease because she can't hold a job down for more than a few months, has horrible credit, and a criminal history. She doesn't clean up after herself, smokes inside the house (even though I've asked her nicely to take it outside) and she's been forcibly institutionalized three times in the few months I've known her and loses her job(s) because of these absences. I've worked with her when she had a hard time paying rent and utilities (every month), but I have zero interest in having her move in with me and my friend, not that she would, even though we'll have an extra bedroom at the new house we found across town. I don't want to throw her out, either.

She isn't on the lease, the landlord doesn't know she lives here (I didn't know this until after I signed the lease), and I'm worried she'll freak out and damage the house if I tell her she can't stay. I don't want her to be blindsided either thinking she ""won"" this situation, either. How can I give her notice while protecting myself and the property while ensuring that she leaves?",16Sep2019,1

770,"So I’ve been experimenting with the same sex hookups for quite a while. I’m pretty much classifying myself as heteroflexible for the time being since I more than likely have sex with men due to how a lot of them find me attractive enough to sleep with compared to women, anyway I found myself in another sexual encounter with someone who was really feminine and thicker. At first I was kind of expecting it to not like it but it was kind of one of the best sexual encounters I’ve had. 

The person wasn’t really uptight or rude (although there are some concerns) and they were very sensual to the point there were several periods where we just cuddled and talked in between the sex about our occupations, our lives (age gap), etc. It was a really good time but like always I come down from it and I don’t really want to meet this person again. Not because they were bad but because I can’t see myself being in a relationship with another man and with the way they were treating me, it felt like they were kind of looking for a partner. I hate that this is how I feel but I am very firm in my preference when it comes to an actual relationship.

Anyway my concerns come towards specifics acts during. There was a point where the person wanted to ride me and kind of hotdog my dick between their cheeks. I stupidly agreed because I am stupid and can’t no for an answer, there were several times where it appeared that they were trying to make me penetrate them without me knowing and every time I questioned it, they said that they’d never do that and that I was overthinking it. I definitely do over think things a lot and I want to believe that they didn’t forcefully push me into them but with the way they were pushing into me and how I felt, I think it could be likely that there were points were this person was riding me raw so now immediately I’m freaking out about my STD/HIV status. 

I see women talk about how they have to deal with guys who fuck them and just ghost/move on to the next and I’ve always told myself that I’ve never wanted to be the guy who does this but now that I am in the position, I want to do it as tactfully as possible even if just one day of sex isn’t as serious as I’m making it.

Her son and I split 5 years ago now, and it was rough for everyone. He has moved on and is now married. it's caused a ton of strain on their relationships.

His mom prefers me, she's flat out said that to him and myself. Which has made things worse for him and I trying to coparent our child. 

I've done my best to not involve myself and keep a distance, so they can patch things up and she can get to know his wife. 

All she will do is call me, and if I don't answer she calls him and his wife upset I will not come around or talk to her, asking where I am or why i wont come around any more. 

Previously he was mad at me because it was all my fault i tried to be nice and stay in contact with hern she was lonley and they didn't take care of her like i did. He told me i needed to cut off contact with her and to mind my business.

She is still calling them upset that i don't go around anymore and he is now telling me he doesn't care what i do, he doesn't want to deal with her drama anymore.

She decided to end things just after 7 weeks and said she didnt want to try work things out. I was broken and was essentially pushed out very quickly. 3 months later she is apparently in a relationship with the cook she works with,I found some messages shortly after the wedding which was questionably but it seems she was cheating on me(especially since they were saying ""i love you"").

It stings but I know it's what needed to be done cause I'm sure its what I deserve. I feel I need some type of new job. But retail is out I just can't do that anymore. And I need a job so easy a monkey can do it because of my poor intelligence. And somewhere where you don't really work with anybody else but yourself. I aslo lied to my wife when she finally noticed my face yesterday. I just told her something hit me at work. I just feel I should share with someone even if no one reads.

I don't have anything physically good going for me. My voice sounds strange, my head is a weird shape, my hair colour is an instant setback in any part of life(ginger, but dark and not light orange), I'm short(probably 5'7), and I'm generally ugly. I live with my mother and she doesn't have a lot of money. I can't dress extravagantly and wear super nice expensive stuff, so I don't even have money going for me. I'm a bit overweight, and I have pale skin. Honestly, my life is just fucking awful because of how I look.

From the moment i get up to the moment i get home. 

I get so tired that it stands in the way of my ability to finish out the day with anything other than laying in bed, blankly staring. 

The ultimate problem I have found is that i used to live an incredibly healthy lifestyle 
- avid mountain biker 
- ate phenomenally 
- hydrated a lot
- slept well

But still suffered the same issues. 

As of right now, I'm living a more...leisurely lifestyle. 

Went through a rough break up and kind of let healthy habits go. 

Now I'm at the point of having a social life back, putting in the effort to walk around a bit more, just now starting to eat better and quit vaping. I drink on the weekends but nothing out of control (maybe 2 drinks on a saturday) (I'm a small female so that gets me out pretty quick.) 

I feel like most of it has to do with mental wellness as I do have diagnosed depression (but then again who the hell doesnt) . 

I'm just interested In seeing if anybody has any great life tips for staying alive and awake throughout the day rather than feeling like an actual zombie the whole way through?

794,"So I was binge drinking again last weekend and I got my friend to pick me up. I had very serious, genuine feelings for said friend but when he took me back to my place we needed up having sex. I was 2 giant bottles of arbour mist in already and I don’t remember anything of the event. I remember taking my shirt off, and his face when he was done. The thing that’s been bothering me is, he was stone cold sober. And I didn’t want to have sex with him. If I was sober, I would’ve said no. I was blackout drunk to the point where I couldn’t speak anymore and I was ready to pass out. And again, I didn’t want to have sex. Especially not with him even tho those feelings were there. I just don’t know what to do. I talked to him about how I was feeling but he never really apologized for what he did. And I don’t want to acknowledge that it was rape because if I do then that makes him a rapist. But it was, by definition, rape. I know he didn’t want to make me feel like this but I feel like he used my body. He didn’t even use a condom. I can’t get pregnant so that’s not the issue but I just haven’t been able to shake the feeling of being used and violated. I just needed to vent but I also just want someone to tell me how to deal with this situation because I have no fucking clue what I’m supposed to do.",16Sep2019,1

I (26F) had left the bed to go to the bathroom because we were planning on going to bed early in order to drive early to a boat cruise for my mother’s 60th birthday. When I came down he was out of the bed and started yelling but I didn’t really catch what he said because he slapped the water I had gotten after using the bathing out of my hand and pushed me down. When I tried to roll over and get up he kicked me and knocked my wind out. I heard him bang around upstairs (my room is in the basement) and leave. My mother and someone I consider a mother to me both said that it’s unacceptable. And I’m not blind, I see the severity. It’s just that he’s the most gentle person and I do love him. He finally contacted me today and apologized and said he never meant to hurt me. He apparently saw old texts between an ex and myself and it made him extremely angry even though they weren’t recent. I guess my only question is whether I am being so dumb and this is actually a huge warning sign, or that he is the person I love and something just went wrong that night.

No guy has so much as even genuinely flirted with me. I’ve been approached one time in my life; I was like 17-18 y/o walking in Home Depot looking confused as per usual, some guy (probably in his 40’s) asked me for my number.  That’s it.

If I’m not at school or work, I’m usually home helping my mom with the younger kids. I try to get involved in clubs at school in order to meet people but it never works out.  This is not a situation where I think nobody has flirted with me, but I really am just rejecting the guys I don’t like—I’m talking NOBODY...not even conventionally unattractive guys have talked to me.

I’m very friendly to everyone, and I try to be outgoing.  I have some mild RBF, but if I remember I try to smile more.

I’m thinking the cause of this is one of three things:
1) I’m hideously unattractive/very average looking 
2) I look very unapproachable and mean
3) I’m at home too much so I don’t meet people

I feel wrong because I know their dads, I've been in small groups with older men and understand more how they think as a dad, and maybe it's because I'm getting older and maturing, or maybe it's because I'm being wimpy thinking about their dad?

I took the very nosy step of peaking into a bag of recycling, wondering whether the address of the culprits would be visible. Surely enough, the trash had been left by someone in my apartment building. I left a note on their door, asking that they place trash in the bins rather than directly onto the curb. I understand that this was a bit aggressive (especially peeking into the bag of recycling), but their leaving garbage out really irked me. Later that day, I noticed that the note had been removed from their door but the garbage remained on the curb. As I write, the garbage has now been sitting on the curb for over four days.

Yeah I need to find a girl like her
Oh like Gabby (a girl like her)

But a picture can’t tell you how loneliness burns
And I’ll give every bit of my heart
To a girl that’ll love me right from the start
And I’ll be eternally true
If I ever can find a girl like you

Oh Gabby (I need a girl like you)
Yeah I need to find a girl like you
Yes like Gabby (a girl like you)
When will I find my girl like you?

Oh no
I don’t know
I wish God would just tell me so

Oh yes
Forgive me
Because I don’t know how much longer I can be without

Sweet Gabby (I need a girl like her)
Yeah I need to find a girl like her
Oh like Gabby (a girl like her)
When will I find my girl like her?

Oh Gabby (I need a girl like you)
Yeah I need to find a girl like you

TLDR: Brother and SIL are super gross and unsanitary, nephew deserves better. Should I call CFS? 

My brother and his wife have a beautiful 4 year old son and I love him to death. He's a great kid. My brother and SIL are pretty alright parents for the most part, but they are slobs and there house is very dirty. I'm not talking just cluttered and messy. It's filthy. Dirty dishes piled up and left everywhere for months, garbage everywhere, rotting food, clothes on the floor, diapers left laying about, dog pee left on the floor until it dries there, etc. They don't sweep, vacuum or mop. They don't wipe counters or clean up spills. The bathroom is so nasty, they don't clean the toilet or nephews training potty. It is so unsanitary and gross that I can't even stand being in their house. Several times I have come over to clean their house and cleaned it completely. I'm a former maid for very rich people, so when I say cleaned I mean freaking spotless. Spent 18+ hours each time cleaning it. And the next time I come over it's a freaking mess again. I've talked to them several times about how unacceptable this is, I've written out basic cleaning schedules, lectured them on how they need to do better for their son. I've told them that they a negligent and that if they don't get their shit together they could lose their son. But I can't seem to get it through their thick skulls. They show no signs of changing. My nephew deserves a better life than this. I've given them so many chances, I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm seriously debating calling CFS on them. They'd probably get a warning and have someone come regularly check in on them to make sure they are taking care of nephew properly. Worst case, and probably equally likely, they'll take nephew away. He's likely be taken in by his grandma on SILs side, or his other grandma my mom. Either would provide a better life for him. But there's a chance he'd be taken away completely.

He invited 3 of my friends, the ones he follows on social networks and talks the most with. Now, it may seem cool because 'yeah I'll party with my best friends on my brother's birthday party!'. 

But I don't know why, I can't help but feel a bit annoyed and upset because of how well they're getting along with each other.
Is it because I don't like/want to mix family and friends or if it's some sort of jealousy??

I was hired when no one in the family had time (or wanted) to take care of him. I work weekdays and his children uses to take him on the weekends. The family had to hire CNAs to stay overnight when the disease progressed to the point he was wandering when I wasn't around-- no one else would stay with him besides me. When his kids were found stealing from him and selling his tools, etc. he kicked them out, took them off his will, and gave power of attorney to his sister. She then had to hire CNAs for weekend care, because his kids weren't allowed to stay with him according to his wishes. There was also a court-ordered restraining order due to some things they did. 

So it's me caring for him, trained specifically for dealing with his specific culture regarding dementia, and a few CNAs. My pay got dropped from what equaled about $20/hr in salary to $16hr non-salary because his sister decided I was being paid too much to take care of him and run the house on weekdays. Money isn't an issue for him or the family, and my job duties have gotten much heavier as his progression has gone on. I do everything from cooking, cleaning, accompanying him to the doctor's and events, giving medication, taking care of his dogs, utility bills, bathing him, helping him dress, helping him wipe on bad days, etc. You get the idea-- I'm basically an extension of everything he needs done during the week.  

He's nowhere near outside of my range of abilities. The family has always said they plan on keeping me around until he has to go into an assisted care facility, because he and I get along so well and I've worked with him for so long so I know the ins and outs of his dementia.

My problem is this-- lately my boss (his sister) has been ignoring me when I tell them he's having certain issues. She said his reoccurring stomachache/headache might be any feelings I'm carrying with me from home disturbing him, because he can sense feelings even if I'm not talking about them (I've been in a great mood lately, I just got a new apartment and got engaged, so there's nothing negative going on with me. I'm not easily frustrated or agitated, and generally a chill individual.) 

I was also told that maybe it's because I'm on my cell phone ""all the time."" I read books on my phone while he does crafts I can't participate in, and when he does those he doesn't want to be talked to/interacted with. He's never mentioned it, except to ask me what I'm reading. He reads too, when he's having a good day, and I've brought him copies of books I'm currently going through. We also go to antique shops, burger places, and all around the little town he grew up in. We walk his dogs, try new recipes, and do all sorts of stuff together. 

His other sister is a nurse and was asking him how long he had been sick today; I had to correct the information since he doesn't remember at all and she snapped at me for giving her the correct timing. I could either correct the time with him in a gentle way, or correct what he said directly to her, which I feel would be insulting to do in front of him. The nurse sister refuses to respond to texts/calls so I can't get ahold of her later to give her information. While I know the majority of the time you never correct a dementia patient, this sister has a lot to do with his health care and I felt it was very important that she know the scope of how sick he's been.

His two sisters often ignore me when I say something needs to be fixed around the house (or even that something needs to be done for his comfort that I am unable to do, ie get a copy of his bank account info so he can look at it when he stresses about money. 

They also treat me like I'm a child and act as if I don't understand simple things. A couple days ago we were having lunch and I mentioned my mother-in-law, and one sister told me it was insulting to call her that because my husband and I never got married through the church.

There are tons of little things I don't have the space to write. Basically I want to leave my job because I feel undervalued, but the family I work for is friends with my family-- and on top of that, I like my client a lot and I don't know how leaving would affect him. I don't want him to be upset, and nothing that's going on is his fault at all. I don't want to punish him for his family's actions and I don't know what kind of care he'd get if I quit. 

I don't know what to do here.",16Sep2019,1
826,"I'm 21 years old. I have been in college for the past 4 years. This was suppose to be my senior year of college but I got kicked out from my university for having low grades. I ended up in community college because I didn't want to completely drop out. So far my grades have been decent up to this point but I always find myself disinterested every semester. I'm trying to get my associates in computer information systems but I find it so hard because I feel like everything that I'm learning I can learn on my own time and the jobs offered for my degree don't require a degree for the most part. I don't want to drop out though because I have this pressure of being the first person to go to college and everyone has these expectations that I feel are not me. But I can't get the pressure off that they will disown me if I drop out. I've only had two passions in my life, computers and fighting. I've built my own computers, coding and have been in martial arts since I was 15. I want to land an IT job and still train whenever I can and I feel as though school is wasting my time.

I guess what I'm asking is should I continue in school? And if not, how do I come about to my family that school isn't for me and I'm not happy and disinterested there?",16Sep2019,1

(And i am grateful for that she cares about me) It really makes me sad when she asks about my friends and I have to play it off, so she won't find out her son is a failure. Actually I am not too shy to talk to people.
 It's just people don't like me. That's it. It's probably because I have nothing to offer socially. 

I have no lexical knowledge, so there are times when I can't add to the convo. Altough I usually come of as obnoxious and loud. Also have a childish and very bad humour. (I usually make people cringe.) I can't help it, I am just like this. I am not even good looking to pull this off as ""quirky"".

I have a few people that I talk to, but even they dont invite me to social events, only if there arent any people who could go instead of me. I feel like I am not even hated (..I mean. Not so much) I am just an npc for people. If I leave nobody cares, if I come they are like ""Well.. okay.. but i hope he wont stay long.."" or ""Who invited this guy and why?"" (actually heard it. I dont make this up)

I know there must be like a ton of threads like this, but they didn't help. They only answer something like ""improve yourself"". Its easy to say, but how? I cant even start a conversation like a normal person. What are the first steps to make myself a likeable person with social life?",16Sep2019,4

831,"(Kinda long, sorry, tldr at the bottom) 

Hey, so first post ever and I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any formatting issues.

So, the backstory is I've had pretty severe agoraphobia, depression, and anxiety since I was 12-13 leading to me stopping going to school, not leaving the house at all for 6 years, and almost getting my mother into some pretty serious legal trouble due to her getting the blame for my lack of attendance. On top of that, my mother is a hoarder with pretty severe depression, leading to a 'non-traditional' upbringing to say the least.

Cut to now and I'm a 19 year old who has no idea how to actually be normal. I've been working on my agoraphobia with everything I have, and over the past couple of months have actually left the house 7 times (!!), which sounds like nothing, I know, but I'm pretty proud of myself tbh. 

3 of those 7 trips have been to a doctor who has me on medication. I'm feeling better than I ever have, and basically I want to take this good energy and enthusiasm to try and make as many improvements to my life as possible.

I don't have the money to move out (nor do I really think I could at this point), but I know that if I want this house to be livable I'm going to have to be the one to change things because my mother just isn't ready to do it herself yet.

I get £146 every two weeks (disability allowance)  £35 of that has to go towards rent, and £10 goes towards the electric bill. The rest of my money is mine to budget and, to cut this whole Ridiculously Long post short, I have no idea what I'm doing. How much should I be should be spending on what things, how to clean things and how often they should be cleaned? Etc, etc.

Literally any help with budgeting/tidying/general life advice you wish you'd been given would be so insanely helpful! 

tldr: Absolutely no idea how to be an adult, may as well have been in a coma for the past 6 years. Desperately need budgeting/life/tidying advice.",16Sep2019,1

This year, upon returning I feel weird towards the friends of mine who never reached out the entire year I was sick. I was very involved my first 3 years of college, it was very well known that I was having an emergency and was in the hospital across town. 

I’m mostly a little bitter with the sorority sisters of mine who never texted to check up/ask. I have a small chapter of 30, was VP for two years, and coming back everyone is hugging me and says they missed me. 

But like: I have the same phone number, I was only 20 minutes away. Part of me understands the world doesn’t revolve around me, and everyone has a lot going on.

TL;DR - I like a guy who lives across the country, and I can’t decide if I should say something to him or not. Pros and cons, and such.

I’m totally in love with a friend of mine whom I work with, who lives across the globe from me. 

It’s getting bad and I’m comparing dates to times I spend with him. 

He also doesn’t know I like him. Or at least, I don’t think he knows... I’ve certainly never said anything. He’s coming out to visit this week [for work], and I’m super excited to see him. But I’m also really going back and forth about stating my feelings. 

We talk a lot. Inside of and outside of work. When I go to visit the office he works in we make sure we get to spend a lot of time together. 

My company doesn’t have a policy against dating co-workers or anything. But like, long distance sucks, and he’s about as long distance as it gets. And if I do tell him, what good comes of it? Like, yes, it’s off my chest, but does it make a difference? What is the possible good to come out of the situation?

I mean, grand scheme of things, would I be willing to leave the life I have behind and relocate to move to another country with this person? Right now, at this moment - Yes. But those aren’t the kinds of decisions you make when you tell someone you’re interested in the romantically. 

I’m kind of at a loss.

840,"I met a guy at a barbecue seven years ago and saw him twice after that. I've been in contact with him over the years only by email/gmail chat, hearing from him about once a year, and haven't seen him in person since 2012.

 He always seemed a bit odd, but on Saturday he entirely lost his cookies. I woke up on Saturday morning and found he had left 127 messages, starting with him saying he just got out of jail. I didn't read all of them but saw enough disturbing text that I replied leave me alone. Then I did some shopping and later found 65 more messages, with pornographic images. I found the option to block him but feel concerned he might pursue me in another way. I contacted the police and showed the officer some of the messages, but he said they couldn't do anything.

A sampler of some of the messages:

""I want you to demand experimentally that your feet be worshipped.""

""You're like my sister. I always wanted you to develop your ability to be seductive and powerful, and I want to train you at all costs.""

""Document your feet. Paint your toenails. Do not tell your husband you decided the color with your brother. You're keeping him happy for me because you're in training.""

""Allow me to restrain you as needed. We will both live as virgins until we are forced by the universe and people to procreate. But it will feel extremely oppressive and completely traumatic and suddenly it will feel absolutely perfect.""

""You're my baby in all forms of the family growth process now.""

""I'm giving you a huge responsibility to implement and it's one you can't reject. I'm in danger of not being governed and doing great damage if I go unloved.""

I could go on and on. I feel like he's a maniac. He doesn't have my address but knows my full name. I have an uncommon name so I'm worried he can find me. We live in different states.

And a couple of times I would be looking up the window and notice she’d look straight up from her computer and as soon as I move to look to the other side of the room she’d look down at her laptop again.

I have been dying to talk to her but she seems antisocial, and I only see her after school. about a week ago I asked her what the time was, that was the deepest conversation I had with her up until now.. so since last Wednesday instead of being in the crowd like usually she moved and waits for her bus right next to me, we make eye contact a lot more now.. so anyway today I told myself if she stands next to me I have to talk to her. Well thank God today I was waiting for the bus and she just walks to the left of me and stands there, looking at me through the corner of her eye, I'm just standing there awkwardly until I just suddenly think  ""fuck it."" I turn my body to the left and just started talking to her. So I say 
""do these buses have a set time they get here or do they just show up randomly""
 she turns to me and says 
""they just show up randomly"" 
and she has this look on her face like she knows what I'm doing, she is smiling and blushing and instead of leaving it at that she asks something along the lines of 
""so where are you from originally"" 
I tell her I had just moved there (to texas) from california in feburary of this year, and then say something along the lines of 
""Its crazy here""
And we talked for a few seconds until it somehow led me up to asking for her name, she tells me, then asks for my name, I tell her. So I reply 
""What grade are you in"" 
She tells me she is a junior then asks for my grade, I tell her that I am a senior, so then it leads up to me telling her that the only reason that I asked for the time was to here how she sounded and that she had me very curious. ""You never talk to anyone"" I tell her, blushing she says ""I know"" around this time her friend walks up and it ends the conversation.

843,"Hello, so first some backstory:  
My dad works long (7-6) and often isn't there to help. My brother is agressive, a bully and egocentric (steals from my parents, beats them rarely, insults them constantly). I'm out of the house studying but still visit my parents often. My grandmother is not understanding, controlling and often plays people out against each other (though a great person and her behavior comes from my parents not wanting to visit her often. She is very social and like me, criticising).  
My mother had a illness leading to constant pain over several years. She doesn't work a lot and isn't doing much (sports, hobbies,...). Because of a lot of stress (to some degree caused by herself by caring to much), the pain and bullying though my brother, she got a psychosis. Medicine leaded to her being quite tired and doing even less things. She never took a lot of time for cooking, but then started to only get take out, drink quite some amounts of alcohol and eating more sweets.  
With our dog getting older, she does even less sports. Also, the medication and eating habbits lead to weight being gained. Lately, she got cancer but seems to be cured. Now, she does even less, drinks more, is moody, has though side effects of the chemo another illness leading to severe pain. The doctors aren't that helpfull, tell different things (take opioids and stop antidepressants, take CBD oil, do sport, do no sport at all, alkohol is okay!!!...).  
Her psyche got worse, you can't talk to her about anyting important / stressfull, while she also tries constantly new jobs, putting her though a lot of stress. I'm one of the few persons, whose advice she listens to and mostly ignores instead of getting stressed/angry. She often shows signs of her psychosis, but her medication cannot be increased. Her liver isn't well because of all that alcohol. She trusts everyhing on facebook (alcohol isn't bad, this week sugar is terrible and canabis is a cure-all but she isn't taking anything so far). She doen't cook, only gets takeout, bread and no vegetables plus about 1-2 glasses of whine per day. She is burning though a handable but high amount of money with fake medicine, toys, whine and takeout.  
She is tired (maybe anxous) of going to the doctor, even some weeks ago with an emergency situtation, where acording to her medicine an ambulance would've been necessary, she just ignored it and luckily everyhing went well.  
When I'm visitting, it always puts me in a terrible mood and affects my well-being even when I'm back at university. The house is quite dirty (she isn't allowed to clean because of operation but my dad has no time and doesn't really want to pay more for a cleaning service). I fight with my brother about the way he treats my parents and blame my mother for only laying in bed, drinking and eating unhealthy. My dad just ignores everyhing, he also went though a lot with the psychosis, chemo and changes in my mothers personality. She destroys herself, needs help, but I'm at university and my family isn't there for her.  
I feel like, my brother behaving nicer and someone being there to help her with cooking and every day tasks would get a long way, but I don't know who to contact to get help. My dad will certainly not do anything that isn't straight forward, like call this number or sign here.",16Sep2019,1

847,"My boyfriend and I are both korean and have been thinking of having a baby. During our discussions my boyfriend brought up the case that maybe we should use an attractive Caucasian sperm donor because then our baby will be mixed and be more attractive than a non-mixed baby. He says he doesn’t mind if the baby has none of his genes and that a mixed baby would have a higher chance of growing up to be attractive enough to pursue a career in entertainment since Hollywood does not often cast asian actors / actresses in movies and tv shows. He also says there are very few asian professions athletes, literally no asian pop stars, and that currently many Ivy League colleges are now making it harder for Asian Americans to be accepted because there are too many qualified Asians applying and Affirmative Action is working against them.

His argument is that over the long run a mixed baby would have a greater chance of success in life and that it’s better to raise a happy kid than to raise an unhappy one.

Keep in mind he is completely healthy and we are both fully capable of having a baby together.

Though I do agree one some points he has made, personally, I am against the idea because it doesn’t feel right for the baby to not have his genes. We have been having heated discussions over it and can’t seem to resolve the disagreement.

849,"I’ve been working with a company for just over 2 years now. I was in one position right out of school for 1.5 years then switched to another role 8 months ago. When I was told I got the job they said they wanted someone who was committed to the role for the long haul. This is an entry level position that pays just above minimum wage — not something I want to be in for a long time.

I recently saw a job open up within our company (at a different location) that I’m dying to apply for. It would be a huge step forward in my career if I got it. It’s highly competitive so there is a good chance I won’t get it but I’ll kick myself for the rest of my life if I don’t at least try.

My problems are as follows:
1) I just got this job 8 months ago.
2) They wanted someone to stick around for the long haul and I don’t want to burn any bridges by applying to this job considering I haven’t even been in this current role for a year yet.
3) My company has a policy about internal applications that requires you to tell HR and your manager that you’re submitting an application

The advice I need is really just whether I should tell my boss NOW that I'm looking for another job so she can have time to find a replacement or should I just put my 2 weeks in? I don't want to tell her in advance if its going to start some shit so idk I'm very conflicted",16Sep2019,1

852,"So I recently went to the seaside and I stayed in this beach for a week. At the beach bar there was this very nice waitress and she usually served me, so we chatted a bit because she is very outgoing. We even talked during some of her breaks and we got along well. But then I left and I Just said goodbye and haven't asked her anything (IG, phone number) because I thought that she was doing her job by being nice to me and asking her sonething more would make me look weird.
Then I followed the Beach Instagram page and her account popped up in my suggested list (a friend of mine who knows her is a mutual follower). She has a private profile. Should I follow her or would it be weird/creepy?",16Sep2019,1
853,"So here's the thing, I am afraid of traveling by airplanes because I am 

1) Scared that the airplane will stop working
2) Someone will explode at the airport or in the plane
3) The pilot will kidnap the plane and crash us somewhere 
4) Something deadly will happen 

Like this limits my destinations so much because of my fear.

Then I'm scared of traveling anywhere where the sea is because 

1) Sharks might eat me
2) Something will eat me
3) I'll step on some poisonous shit 

What do i even do?

Then I'm afraid of traveling to popular places like France, US, London and such because

1) I'm afraid someone will feel like exploding or shooting

854,"It's not that simple for me, but basically the question I have. Dropped out of college to try and play LOL professionally. That was 2 years ago, and although I got close on a few occasions, it never happened.

Chess, on the other hand, is a hobby that I've had since I was little and I used to be very good. I recently picked the game back up and have been really enjoying it. I can easily make a career as a chess coach or tutor.

I don't want to put my last 7 years playing LOL to waste, as I could always pursue chess once I'm too old and awful at video games mechanically speaking. At the same time, it's been so long with no progress that maybe I should move on.

Today I overslept and missed a class. This is the second time in two weeks and it’s like the third week of school. I never miss class so I feel stupid and guilty.

860,"I realized I literally have not a single person in real life to talk to about serious issues. Hope you can help me out. 

So at my workplace there is this older man who I used to get along with quite well, nothing out of the ordinary though, we had the usual small talk and joked around a bit. Whatever normal type of contact I have with any other of my colleagues. 

Well, until last week. He wrote a little note in the morning shift and left it for me to find in the evening shift. I wrote something remotely funny on it. The next shift we had together he made sure we got to be alone in a room together. He said that the note made him so happy that he had to grin about it all day long. 

This already confused me a little because his reaction was over the top for our type of relationship and we dont have the level of intimacy to share such feelings with each other. But I tried to brush off the confusion and be happy about the positive Impact I had with my little joke. 

Then he quite shockingly said that we both have to be careful about how we act around each other because the other coworkers are watching him. To which I asked what they are watching out for.   
He said that he has a thing for younger women. Always liked them. It's not in his power. He just can't control it. He told me how he once had an affair with a coworker many years ago who was 20 years old back then. Now she is 32 and apparently too old for his liking.  Anyway, this is the reason people are watching him and watching how he behaves around females of younger age.  
 Also he said he very much likes girls with dark hair (I have dark hair). And he was going on about how he needs to restrain himself when he is around me because I am his type. 

All this time I felt sick and my stomach started cramping up. But I felt super awkward and uneasy and didn't know how to react because all of this happened so suddenly. Usually, I am very outspoken and rebellious, but in this situation all I did was to act shocked about his affair with the coworker and ignore the rest of the remarks. Finally, someone called me out to get something done. 

Now to understand the main problems here, I need to explain some things about me first.   
In my teens I got sexually harassed quite a lot, including mutliple times at work. It happened more than once that I told someone off and then they went and told everyone some made up crazy disgusting sexual stories of me. I guess they do that because they are afraid of legal problems and think this way they can make believe I wanted it. This is not the only reason I don't want to tell him to leave me alone, though.  
Also I have quite a problem with dating men. Whenever I realize they have any sexual expectations (no matter if they intend to act on them or not), I get very anxious and normally start to feel some kind of aversion against the person.   
So when in this case some sickly, old ""nobody"" makes quite forward remarks about his sexual preferences regarding me, I feel extra grossed out. 

Now I don't know what to think or do.   
I don't know if he acted badly enough for me to really call him out on his behaviour. Or if it is simply my automatic response of disgust to approaches by men that makes me uneasy.   
Even if it is okay for me to call him out, I wouldn't know how to deal with the consequences: I still need to work with him.  
Regardless of anything, I don't know how to keep facing him at work.  
Today I saw him and planned to act normal towards him, put on an act so to say. But it was almost impossible for me. So I acted like I was busy all the time. But he caught on to it. At the end of the day, he asked if I didn't like him anymore. I answered that I am only very tired.   
I am at a point where I am disgusted with my own behaviour but don't know how to change it.",16Sep2019,1
861,"Note: The people in this story will have fake names for obvious reasons.

So around a month ago I met this dude named Nolan through my best friend, Ash. He was always nice to me but after a while, we started getting closer. Once he even called me! Completely out of the blue! (This may not seem like a big deal but I never get texts or calls from anybody except Ash.) And whenever the three of us (me Ash and Nolan) hung out, I would feel happy. Nolan made me feel like he cared about me.

But one-day tragedy struck. Ash had left her boyfriend Kyle for Nolan. The catch was she knew that it wasn't going to last long with Nolan, and told me that when they broke up she would go right back to Kyle. I warned her that this was a bad idea but promised not to say anything to Nolan.

The following night Ash sent me pictures her crying, telling me that Nolan broke up with her. Before she could explain why I got a call from Nolan, it was basically him saying that he couldn't afford to be with Ash because Kyle was trying to fight him and he couldn't get another strike or he would be off the football team. I told him that I understood what he was saying and asked him if he knew about what Ash was going to do. When he said no I broke my promise and told him that Ash told me that after they broke up she would go back to Kyle.

As soon as the words left my mouth I knew I fucked up. Very badly.

Nolan said that this information changed everything and I made him promise not to tell Ash I said anything. Well he said he wouldn't say a word and proceeded to call Ash (after we hung up of course.) Only a few minutes later I started getting texts from Ash, saying things like ""FUCK YOU"" and ""NEVER TALK TO ME AGAIN."" I was furious, I knew exactly what had happened and started to try and call Nolan. After several minutes of trying, and him sending me to voicemail, the man finally picked up.

I wanted to chew him out so badly, but I couldn't and just started sobbing. He told me that this wasn't worth crying over and that I needed to calm down. Trust me, I was trying my best to calm down but the tears wouldn't stop. He told me that he was going to block all of us and hung up. I was left a mess on the floor of my room.

When Ash called me a few hours later she told me that she was sorry, and she understood if we didn't want to be friends anymore. We made up and it seemed like everything was ok.

The next day I got a call from Nolan (he must have unblocked me.) He told me I should stop being friends with Ash because she doesn't sound like a good friend. I told him I didn't have many other options and that she was really my only friend.

I'm considering texting him, just to check in and make sure he's alright considering he didn't sound too good over the phone. But I'm not sure if I should Ash absolutely despises him and if she finds out I'm talking to him she'll flip out. But then again we got along really well and he made me feel like somebody cared. Should I message him?",16Sep2019,0
862,"o I've had a crush on this girl since I noticed she kept stairing at me (we take the same bus home) so she will either be in the middle of a crowd of people stairing at me or sitting in the seat to the left of me staring at me through the corner of her eye. I have been dying to talk to her but she seems antisocial, and I only see her after school. about a week ago I asked her what the time was, that was the deepest conversation I had with her up until now.. so since last Wednesday instead of being in the crowd like usually she moved and waits for her bus right next to me, we make eye contact a lot more now.. so anyway today I told myself if she stands next to me I have to talk to her. Well thank God today I was waiting for the bus and she just walks to the left of me and stands there, looking at me through the corner of her eye, I'm just standing there awkwardly until I just suddenly think  ""fuck it."" I turn my body to the left and just started talking to her. So I say 
""do these buses have a set time they get here or do they just show up randomly""
 she turns to me and says 
""they just show up randomly"" 
and she has this look on her face like she knows what I'm doing, she is smiling and blushing and instead of leaving it at that she asks something along the lines of 
""so where are you from originally"" 
I tell her I had just moved there (to texas) from california in feburary of this year, and then say something along the lines of 
""Its crazy here""
And we talked for a few seconds until it somehow led me up to asking for her name, she tells me, then asks for my name, I tell her. So I reply 
""What grade are you in"" 
She tells me she is a junior then asks for my grade, I tell her that I am a senior, so then it leads up to me telling her that the only reason that I asked for the time was to here how she sounded and that she had me very curious. ""You never talk to anyone"" I tell her, blushing she says ""I know"" around this time her friend walks up and it ends the conversation. I am kinda standing there awkwardly for about ten seconds before my brothers walk up and start talking to me and our boss pulls up and we all get on, in my opinion, that went really well, better than I would have ever expected ( I have no experience in talking to girls, I had just ended up losing 70 pounds and am feeling more confident in myself) so what do i do from here?

Tl;dr I finally talked to my crush, she went from just staring at me to straight up standing next to me while we wait for the bus, I never talked to her before, I thought ""fuck it"" and talked to her she led on the conversation by asking where I'm originally from, this led on and we exchanged names and grade levels, we kind of both made it clear we were both into each other it was going really well until her friend walks up and cuts us off, I dont know what to do from here.",16Sep2019,2
863,"Hi all.

So, yesterday I was getting ready to go out when a large black spider crawled under my door and into my room. I'm pretty arachnophobic so there was a commotion. I went to get one of my housemates to kill it but by the time I came back it couldn't be found.
Fast-forward to 2AM when I'm going to the bathroom and see it on my wall. It crawls into the gap between the wall and bed and I spray it with some deodorant. I think I got it, and unfortunately I lost it again so I can't confirm if it's dead or alive.

864,"When I was in my first year of college, I was made to attend a family wedding where I bloody well knew almost nobody. It was a week long retreat and a fucking bore until I met this wonderful woman way fucking older than me whose company saved my sanity. I googled her that first night in my room and I find out she's a model who acted in ads for Lynx Dry doing sexy car washes and really fucking suggestive acts in lingerie and tight tank tops for the ads on youtube. I google her some more and whaddayaknow she's modeled fucking topless. Not porn but lad's mags and calendars. Using all the fucking willpower I had I did not jerk off to her but I couldn't stop scrolling all night. I blueballed myself to the point where I couldn't fucking walk properly the next day. 


I couldn't talk to her without thinking about her topless photos. I'm not lying when I say she had the biggest fucking knockers I've ever seen in my life. The dresses she wore at the wedding did her no favours hiding them. My blue balls were killing me and I couldn't even fucking stand up because I had an unwanted boner that wouldn't fucking go away. I couldn't last the rest of the fucking week like this. I jacked off 5x a day that week, 3x every night, once in the morning and evening showers. I was draining my balls dry to make it through the days without thinking with my dick. 


After we flew home and I heading to bed, my mum asked me if I liked the wedding. I told her I met some nice people and would be sending them friend requests before sleeping. She hesitated wanting to tell me something but decided to anyway. She told me I should know something so I wouldn't partake in anything I would regret later. She told me the older woman I spent so much time with was my auntie. She's my mum's second cousin or whatever but still my fucking auntie. Mum told me to send her a friend request and leave it at that and not torture myself by googling her.

880,"Throwaway account and names have been changed.

Not really sure where to start. My older brother (31M – John) and his wife(22F - Sarah) just got married this past summer. Since then, they have confided in me and my other sister in law (25F - Mary) that they have an open relationship, and that they are both bisexual.

Mary and I warned Sarah that, while we are trying to be supportive of everything they choose to do, it could end badly. John is out of town a lot for work, and I guess they have an agreement to have relations with other people while they are apart from each other. Mary and I just wanted Sarah to know the dangers of fooling around with random people, and how we can’t help her out if something goes wrong and we don’t know where she is.

Well recently a family friend’s daughter, who is a lesbian, was swiping through Tinder. She all of a sudden was shown Sarah’s profile, and our family friend’s daughter freaked out wondering why Sarah was on Tinder even though she was married. They called my mother immediately to tell her what their daughter saw. So now my mother (50F) knows that something weird is going on.

My mom flipped and had a million questions and called John immediately. John basically said, “Thanks for your concern, mom, but we are going to do what we are going to do. We’ve talked about all the risks and we still want to do what we want to do. Please understand.”
My mom is trying to be supportive, but is ultimately having an extremely hard time. She’s ashamed that family friends saw it, and she’s worried that something bad will happen. My mom has had an extremely hard time in life and has had her ex-husband’s wife come after her and our family in an obsessive rage. She is terrified that if John and Sarah encounter someone equally as crazy that the same thing will happen all over again.

Mary and I have tried to talk to John and Sarah, trying to get them to understand where my mother is coming from, but they won’t budge. We all feel a little duped as well because we all spent a lot of time and money and care on their wedding this past summer, and it feels like a lie since they are seeing other people. I’m struggling to feel supportive, but at the same time, I think my mom has a few valid points, if anything. Sarah has blown me off a few times in the past several weeks to go do whatever she does with these people she meets up with, and that kind of stings too.
Maybe me and my family are being old fashioned. I’m not sure. I want to be accepting and open… but at the same time I feel like they’re going the wrong way about this. It’s certainly not my place to tell them what to do… but I feel like I might be able to help them and my mom.

Tl;dr: my mom found out about my brother and his wife’s open relationship. She’s ashamed at the way she found out, and I’m not sure what to tell either party. My mom feels like their new marriage is now a lie and isn’t sure how to feel about them anymore.

884,"Background: About a year ago my car died on me and I needed to buy a new one. Luckily, I have a decent enough job and could afford to take on payments and got a certified used car from a dealership. But with no car to trade in I had to come up with the money for a decent down payment so my monthly payments weren’t so high. My dad let me borrow $4,500 to put down and I obviously planned on paying him back eventually. I want to be able to say I bought the whole car completely on my own. 
Fast forward to now and I just came in to a good amount of money from winning a lawsuit for getting bit really badly by a dog. I plan on investing most of the money and putting some towards my car to get it paid off faster. My mom also asked if I would be paying her and my dad back for the down payment for my car. I do plan on paying them back with the money but in the past year my mom has asked me for $2,200, a couple months later she asked for another $500 and I paid to get her pool fixed for her(I don’t live at home) which cost about $300.

893,"So, the backstory is that this guy in my complex got a cat, who is sweet as hell. The cat was inside for a month, then was outside roaming around. After that, the ""owner"" seemed to forget his cat even existed. The cat was SUPER skinny after about 6 months, so I started feeding him.

The cat now comes over for food, shelter, and water to me, not his ""owner"". This so called ""owner"" doesn't even come looking to calling for his cat. Since, I basically own the cat now, I'd like to take him to the vet. However, the cat is probably chipped with the ""owners"" information.

I'd like to write the guy a letter saying I'll buy his cat off of him. When the cat was skinny, others said they would adopt him, but the ""owner"" said he loved his cat and wouldn't give him up, which is clearly bs.

909,"Throw away account..

I  come from a pretty low income background. My Dad was a farmer and my  mother was a nursing assistant in rural Iowa. Despite this I grew up in a  happy and loving family. I was never exceptionally smart growing up and  was very average in high school (\~2.5 GPA), which was probably a mix of  being directionless and prioritizing partying and a social life over  academics. I got rejected from most of the colleges I applied to and  went to a large state school. During college I actually became much more  focused on studying and getting good grades because I was paying to go  there. I majored in finance and ended up doing well and also had some  solid internships on my resume.

I  got my first job out of college making $48K a year which at the time  felt like an enormous amount of money and was already more than what my  parents household income was, so this felt odd to me. Over the past 7  years I’ve navigated my way through the corporate ladder in mostly  finance and strategy roles. Did a few relocations for my company, took a  leap of faith on a new company. Got my MBA part-time from a reputable  university. Ultimately moved to Los Angeles. All the while my income has  increased to $180K. I’m fortunate to have zero debt and maxing out my  401K and other investment accounts.

I  was recently headhunted by a major, and highly reputable company and  they have now offered me a role for $250K (all-in nothing based on  commission or anything), which feels like absolute insanity to me and  part of me feels like I lack confidence to actually accept the role.  Throughout my career I’ve felt like a fraud, even at the first job I  felt like it was only a matter of time someone realized I was being  overpaid and needed to be fired. I know I do have hard work ethic and  good attitude, but I know I’m not the smartest person in the room and  this kind of money almost feels stressful in the sense of do I actually  deserve this?

I’m barely 30 years  old and my parents (and honestly most of the people I know from home)  spent a lifetime just trying to make a fraction of this kind of money.  Thousands and thousands of people are living out of vans or in the  streets in LA. People can’t afford food, education, or healthcare. And  to be making that kind of money makes me feel like part of the problem.

This  honestly is not meant to be a brag thread, I’m just curious how others  internalize their success. I still in my heart feel like I’m a clueless  22 year old, and making this kind of money scares the shit out of me and  I’m constantly worried someone in HR/management will discover what I’m  being paid and say “what the fuck are we doing with this guy? Get rid of  him.” Is this normal?",16Sep2019,2
910,"I'm friends with a few people, but very often I find myself wanting to ghost everyone and live a life without friends. I like their company, and I know they at least somewhat like me, but I can't handle my insecurities and I just want to throw everything away. I know I won't feel very upset if I went through with it, but only because I'd stop feeling much.

I know it sounds awful, but if this were to happen, I have a plan made to take care of myself and set an environment where I can emotionally open up again. It just begins with losing all my friends and closing myself up, which I always felt was inevitable.

However, a part of me is afraid of doing it. Very afraid. And I feel like I lose my friends because I haven't tried my absolute best. So now I have made a bet with different parts of myself. I won't make new friends, but I'll try my very best to stick with my current ones. If the friendships die anyways, then it was always inevitable and I can fully support myself doing that whole ghosting thing. If they stick around, then I would have found a better way to feel secure and happy without going through with my plan.

But months in, I feel like giving up very often. How do I get myself to keep going? How do I know when to give up? I want to at least make it past the first week of January so I can give most of them a gift for their birthdays at least once before I can't anymore.",16Sep2019,1
911,"My 12 year old son just started 6th grade. He walks home, and every day, about 2-3 blocks from the school, he's often ambushed by a small group of 8th graders.

They used to just call insults and say stupid crap, slurs and whatever.  He just rolls his eyes at that stuff, plus he's no angel himself, and you can't control what assholes say, anyway.

But today, they took his phone and ran off with it, eventually throwing it in the grass where he retrieved it.  This does not make me happy.  They crossed from words to the physical realm.  No one walks the same way he does.  In fact, no one walks much at all.  Everyone gets picked up, so finding a group to walk home with isn't really a viable answer.

913,"First post here; thanks in advance. 

I have a friend who's going through some rough stuff. She's 24 and life isn't really working out. Never had a real relationship (she's 'not conventionally attractive,'); can't get a real job in her field (despite a masters degree and 300 rejection letters); family is full of abuse; financial troubles and housing instability;... the list goes on. I've never seen somebody who tries so hard get so little back out of it. 

We've been friends for five years and it's worth noting that there's an element of unrequited love here. She thinks the world of me, but represses it because she knows I only really see her 'as a sister,'. That obviously makes it hard to adjust her sense of self-worth when I won't take her as a lover. 

Now I'm dating and she's jealous. She's lashing out and blaming herself for being alone. I can't convince her to stop comparing herself to my new date, and she's getting more and more wild with her episodes each day. 

I don't think I can help her anymore. I know it's not my job to help her (don't be a fixer!), but she's a good friend and I want her to succeed. I'm afraid that if I give up on her that she'll give up on herself, but at the same time I know it's killing her to see me with somebody else.

tl;dr: my friend is miserable and I don't know how to help her. I'm afraid of what might happen if this continues on. What do you do when you're in over your head when trying to help a friend? I don't want to commit her, and therapists aren't cheap.",16Sep2019,1

Well shes the same age as me (19), and I knew her name and we seemed to hit it off- I didnt want to proposition her to hang out or anything since she was my hairdresser, I was client and that would be inappropriate.

a few months after we started dating (earlier this year) i noticed they were friends again on snapchat.. i asked him about it and he said that he never deleted her so when she re-added him they automatically became friends again. he said if it bothered me he would delete her but i brushed it off and he never did.

924,"I’m currently watching my neighbor’s cats, one of which loves to go outside. I let him out a few hours ago but he refuses to come back in! He’s already wandered off now and I’m panicking and trying to figure out how to 
a) get him to come back
b) get him to go inside the house.

Please help!",16Sep2019,1
925,"Fairly common problem in high school, even College, now happening in private college.

One member of our group isn’t pulling his weight. I posted about him earlier; he seems to have some unusual quirks, &amp; is having trouble with the material.

I’d be fine with all that, but he’s not even trying to commit anything. He sits all day, reading our notes or stuck in minor problems. Last week I spent 2 days trying to help him out, today I just ignored him or said to ask the professor. I was so behind I spent all weekend catching up. As far as I can tell he did nothing.

What is really frustrating is after class he starts acting all friendly, like nothings wrong, &amp; wants to ride the bus home together.

I feel like he’s either stupid, lazy, or is taking advantage of us 3 putting in work. We only have 2 days left in this project; is it worth causing a stink over it?",16Sep2019,1
