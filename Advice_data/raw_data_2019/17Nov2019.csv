0,"So I just had a baby. Yay! I also just started getting my period again and it’s awful. I didn’t have a period for almost two years Bc pregnancy and birth control. It’s hitting me hard. Now to my dilemma. My husband just turned 22. We celebrated his birthday Wednesday and he had some friends over and they hung out. I went to bed. He usually takes care of the baby at night. He’s supposed to be having an actual birthday party tonight at our house. Back to me feeling awful. I’m currently currently curled on the couch in the fetal position rocking the baby in his bouncy chair Bc that’s all I can muster up to do.  Baby goes to bed soon but since husband’s going to be throwing a party, I’m supposed to take the baby tonight. But I really and truly feel god awful. What do I do?",17Nov2019,1

2,"Hello. I learned I have OCD which is a bummer. I always knew I had something, but OCD doesn't quite fit? But the professional said it. I'm tryna get a second opinion.

So, I'm attempting to be an illustrator and I have a small amout of followers on social media and people saying I can do it... but I feel they're very unenthusiastic about it. I compare myself a lot with other illustrators I know and went to the same class at college. They are much more outgoing and likeable. I feel like no one can really relate to me and that never anything big happens. I'm not very daring and I always play it safe. I've been working as a teacher but I finally wanna be a designer/illustrator. I don't have too many contacts besides the people at college, they don't seem to care that much about me or about what I do, except for like 4 people who always cheer about what I do. I know, I feel like I'm complaining without a big reason. But that feeling that never anything great is gonna happen doesn't leave me. I ALMOST got an internship, I ALMOST got a job as a designer, it's always ALMOST. I know, I can't just give up. I'll keep trying but I feel guilty for being envious of my co-illustrators and I feel exhausted for working so hard on bettering my drawings and studying, etc. I have trouble dealing with criticism or rudeness, it makes me shut down immediately. I know what I should do, I would just like to feel a bit less troubled.",17Nov2019,1

5," 

I live with 2 other roommates; we'll call them C and S. \[ Important backstory; I have a disability and a service dog living with me to help me manage it as well as a cat, who functioned as an ESA (emotional support animal), before my doctor decided a service dog would be more effective. My dog is sweet, very quiet, well trained, and always with me.\]

I have lived here for a while with C, and together we have never had any household drama. That changed when S moved in. She initially told us she had 2 ESA dogs that were silent, good, well cared for, etc. We took her word on that, especially since our leasing company would verify the paperwork. We of course still introduced the animals before letting her move in. S showed up to our home with her dogs in harnesses, both leashed to her, and she actively corrected their behavior. It went pretty good for the animals meeting, so we said she could move in; she just had to give the ESA housing request form to our leasing company so they can verify. As soon as she moved in, C and I started suspecting she lied entirely about them being ESA's, which is a really really awkward thing to question. I started seeing that S was neglecting these dogs, and slowly C and I began taking care of them ourselves. If S is at home, those poor dogs are locked in her room away from her. If she is in her room, you guessed it, she locks them downstairs. But she leaves them here alone for 5-72 hours spans at a time., and that's the most obvious act of neglect. And S won't even tell C or I that she is doing it, so we know to takeover. So there are times I don't know they are trapped in there until I hear them cry. So after she did that enough times, C and I have just started checking her room periodically. That is clear neglect, and not at all okay. Additionally, she is trying to sell us on 'these dogs are emotional support that help relieve my condition', but at the same time, she does everything she can to never interact with them. She is honestly kinda mean to them when she is around them. Because these dogs are ignored by her, they act out. ESA's are expected to be decently trained, at least well enough not to bark and poop inside. But they poop/pee on the floor every day (no matter how many times I let them out. It's a training issue, not a chance to potty issue) and bark so much we've gotten noise complaints from our neighbors. She also lets them bother my service dog while she is working, which obviously affects my dogs ability to work in shared spaces.

Now, another more serious way these dogs have acted out, is aggression. S let her dogs chase my kitty around the house, trying to bite her. I confronted her about it, S said literally ""oh i didn't think about it"", and then changed literally nothing. So my cat started living in my room for her safety. Now, S's dog bit off a chunk of my fucking service dog's ear off. A fucking chunk. Obviously, that's pretty bad. And my sweet angel of a dog, didn't even attack back, just got away and hid behind me. When I tried to talk with S about it, all she said was 'sorry, we can separate them if u want' but she wasn't going to stop having them live downstairs, meaning she was telling me to keep my service dog in my room for the rest of the lease. So obviously I wasn't like ""sure girl! Xoxo"". My dog needs to go where I go, and that would still give her dog the ability to attack mine on the walk from my room to the door. It's not a viable solution.

There are a few other reasons we want her to move out, but the dog thing was most important to us. S also has a habit of taking and ruining our things, like our towels, sheets, blankets, our flatscreen tv,hydroflasks, stealing my dog's expensive puzzle toys, and never replacing the stuff her dog's ruin. There was also an incident where S went crazy on C because S was drunk, insecure, and convinced her boyfriend found C pretty. Complicated story made simple, S threw C out of the house they were staying at after a party. C was black out drunk, hours from anyone who could help her, and it was 2 in the morning. She never even apologized to C. I am starting to think she's an awful person. Then there's petty stuff, like S uses 90% of the fridge so we can't stock groceries, eats our food, and throws kickbacks without telling us. Obviously we brought this stuff up as it happened, but She just wouldn't stop doing it.

We set up a roommate meeting for the three of us, and we told her we liked her as a person, and it was not a personal attack, but we didn't think we were all meshing well as roommates. We think it would be better if you took some time and moved out. She asked if it was the dogs, and then said she had been trying to give them away for a while so that's not an issue. Would she be able to stay if she got rid of them? C told her that our personalities aren't really meshing.

S: So, what, you're kicking me out?

C: No, we're telling you that we'd like you to move out. Maybe you could take 30 days or so to find somewhere else that's a good fit for you.

S: What?? Like, I have nowhere to go! What am I gunna do?

Me: We're not going to just throw you out, we wouldn't do that. I could help you search. \[I genuinely will help her if she stops raging and takes me up on it\] We wouldn't let you be homeless. That's not happening.

S: You guys can't kick me out. I'm on the lease. You guys can't do that. I'm not moving out.

Then S called our leasing company and told them we were throwing her out right now and served her notice. So I called them to explain that we asked her as people to move out, to which they said 'yep, great, that's totally fine' and I told them about all the things her dogs had done. They seemed surprised that there were dogs here, making me think maybe she never gave them any paperwork. They said if I could give them evidence, they could evict just her. But also said if this all became too much, they might have to evict us all.

In the meantime, while this all gets handled, S is getting hostile. She is definitely the type to damage our property in retaliation. I've always just let her use my stuff whenever she wants, but I want to revoke that privilege because I'm afraid for my things. I'm a college student, i'm not loaded. I can't replace what she breaks/takes. Is that a right I have?

Do you guys have any advice on how to proceed from here? Sorry for the crazy length, and thank you if you got this far.",17Nov2019,1
6,"My family (including my mother) agree that he has and continues to ruin our lives. He constantly follows my mom around and has verbally abused us and physically and verbally abused her (btw by physically abused, I don't mean hitting, but I'll leave it at that). My mother has been diagnosed PTSD because of him. My family wants him to leave, but they are afraid that if she divorces him, he'll do everything in his power to fuck us over. Some of them are even convinced he would kill my mother (which doesn't sound very far-fetched). Also my mother doesn't think we'll be able to make enough money without him in the family (there are 5 people in the family other than my parents). If any of you have been through this sort of situation, it'd be great if you could give some advice. What should we do?",17Nov2019,1
7,"A year ago, my mom was very suspicious of her boyfriend smoking. He’d occasionally smell like cigarettes, and he always covered it up. He would say that my mom should trust him, and got mad when she kept pressing. 
Around two summer ago, I was in an Uber and saw him in his truck, lo and behold, smoking a cigarette. I kept it to myself, and have never told my mom. I know he still smokes occasionally judging by the way he faintly smells like cigarettes when he comes home (he lives with us), and how he rushes to get in the shower.

So he emailed everyone implying that I was wrong without mentioning my name or anything but everyone knew who gave the wrong answer : me

14,"Hello guys. I will try to put it as shortly as possible. I am very concerned about looks. My looks to be precise. Im a 5’11 male. As a early teenager I was considered Hollywood level attractive. Girls literally would drool for me etc. as I grew up I noticed they were less and less into me like that. But still I could always get a girlfriend , hookup and all else but as time went by I noticed that it was going downhill. I think my appearance changed dramatically and all my friends tell me that I just grew up and its all in my head and I am overthinking. Anyways all this affected my private life.whenever I see a girl I can not get interested in her. I feel like I’m not interested in her but I’m interested in whether I am cool or handsome enough to get her and when I do, I immediately lose all my interest and if they dump me , I get super insecure and have the redpill incel thoughts in my head. It makes me miserable. I feel like Im a narcissist. But as a kid I was always told that I was so so handsome and I know how good it was. I really may br hust overthinking, really may be attractive and all my glow down theories are just thoughts caused b anxiety. But the problem is that I can not keep a genuine attraction to women, I just see them as a way of measuring my handsomeness and coolness and to give validation to myself. I know how bad and destructive these thoughts are, I know how badly this affects me and those all around me. I know that this may all be in my head. I just want to be able to feel genuine connection to girls and not just view them as a challenge for my looks. LOOKS. Even when Im in a relationship I am always always paranoid that I will be dumped for my looks. I hate being likethis. I want to stop.I want to look good again as I did as a child or at least stop worrying about it. The bitter part is looking at the old pictures and feeling like during that times I was the best version of myself and I peaked early. I am a 19 y/o male .and my “Hollywood” phase was in 14-17 years. I know its easy to hate on me. And I know I deserve it. I just wanna stop being like this. My mother is not supportive in anyways she just tells me. You did not change at all and are still as attractive as you were before. i dont know. Please tell me something how do I stop this thoughts. how do I stop this all. this keeps me up at night. Its 4:19 AM in my country right now. Am I sociopathic? Am I a narcissist?  I feel empathy I really do. I have a close friend circle and am very impulsive and emotional.",17Nov2019,1
15,"I’m really not sure if this is the right place to post but I needed some help/advice trying to figure out this feeling? Its very hard to describe it but I’ll try my best, and I’m sorry if this is unclear or if it doesn’t fit into this sub but I’m not sure where else I might be able to post this. Anyway, lately everything that I see has been kind of triggering (I’m not sure if this is the right word in this context but it’s the best thing I could think of). I know it sounds odd, but literally everything, from the words that I see on my social media feeds, to regular items around the house (something as simple as a lamp, for example), are all giving me a very odd sense of ... familiarity? I guess that’s the best way to describe it. ‪Everything I’m seeing is looking oddly familiar as if I should be remembering something, like as if there’s a memory that should be coming up in my brain but it’s just not happening but I KNOW it feels familiar. Sometimes with this feeling I’ll remember some insignificant things from childhood, like one of the houses I lived in, or a piece of bedroom furniture I may have had, or something along those lines. It’s very very difficult to describe this feeling but it’s almost as if all these little things I’m seeing that are “triggering” me are creating a kind of connection in my mind of all the times I’ve seen these things repeatedly throughout the course of my life. And now seeing these things are creating a weird, unsettling feeling for me and I’m not sure why. I’m not even sure if I’m putting this into words properly, or if I’m making any sense at all or if maybe I’m just kind of losing it, but it’s been making me feel uneasy and anxious and I’m not sure what’s causing this. Any kind of help, advice, suggestions, would be so greatly appreciated. And I’m really really sorry if this didn’t make any sense at all, or if it’s too confusing or unclear. I just needed a place to put it into words and possibly get some insight.",17Nov2019,1
16,"A few months ago, my very good school friend and I agreed to find an apartment together in our new city after graduation. She mentioned that she wanted a cat, and I thought nothing of it. I said ""sure, why not? It'll be cute.""

Well, fast forward to the present. The cat is an incredible nuisance to be at home with. Whenever my roommate isn't home, which is often since we're both in relationships and often spend nights away, the cat begins meowing in the saddest, most pained way. Her meows get even worse overnight-I have to sleep with earplugs in now and white noise at full blast. I've brought this up, and my roommate replied with ""it means she's lonely, can you just spend a little time with her?"" 

The thing is, my job leaves me very tired and wanting some peace and alone time at the end of the day. I didn't buy a cat, my roommate did, and I don't want to be responsible for playing with her when I come home, because I often don't want to. The cat has also taken to clawing up our furniture, it drives me absolutey insane.

On top of this, the neighbor with whom I share a wall has an extremely eccentric schedule-she'll often be up at 3 in the morning in her room talking on the phone or moving about and making noise that is VERY present in my room. She'll do this, and then leave for two hours and come back around 5AM. I know this because I can hear every loud step taken in our stair hall from my room. I have also approached her patiently and in good faith about it, but she refuses to budge. The thing is, I know for a fact that my neighbor sets her own work hours and has absolutely no real reason to have to be making noise at those hours. 

So between the cat and my neighbor, unless I have white noise on at full steam and earplugs in my ears, there's no guarantee I'll have a full night's sleep on a given night. I can't rely on coming home to be relaxing anymore.

One of my other friends from school, a former roommate with whom I lived without issue for two years during school, has a much nicer place than ours for about the same rent not too far from where I live now. No pets, in a building full of working families. Their apartment has a very nice, very large, and very peaceful bedroom possibly opening up in a few month's time, and I really want to take it if it does.

Should I leave my roommate? It would mean paying for movers again after having just settled in. It would also mean having to ask my landlord for permission to sublet, and then going through the ensuing process of finding an acceptable subletter, paying my share of the deposit at the new place after just having paid a deposit, and so forth. It would also mean a broker's fee I paid for this current place of about $1500 would go to waste. Lastly, and most painfully, it would mean having to put my roommate through this process. Again, she and I are very close friends and I'm afraid of what doing this might do to our friendship. Should I stick it out?",17Nov2019,1

19,"This may be lengthy, so I apologize in advance, but would really appreciate advice on what to do next.

For some back story, we're a friend group of 4, and are now roommates in an apartment. My roommate and her ex broke up about a year ago, and their relationship was..... interesting. They'd always fight and have arguments, and she would always get mad at him over small things like not texting her back immediately when he's on vacation. She would always complain about him to us, to the point where the rest of us were fed up about hearing about it. We told her it's not worth it to be someone who doesn't make you happy, and soon enough they broke up.

Around the second/third week of October, she got a text from him. He said some things around the lines of ""I'm sorry for being immature, can we talk if you're willing to"". She showed that text to us, and asked what she should say. Obviously none of us like the guy, and we knew how many problems they had in the past. We told her to not respond, or be a little grown-up and mature and move on with her life. Exactly a week later, she told us he was coming over to the apartment so they could ""talk"". I immediately had my doubts. I have known my roommates for 10+ years, so slight changes in their behaviors and personality immediately stands out to me. The week leading up to that Saturday he was supposed to come over, she didn't mention him once. But I noticed she spent a lot of time in her room on her phone, and when we all sat in the living room together watching tv, she would be constantly texting someone, and purposely slanting her phone so none of could see.

The day he was supposed to come over, she asked me in the morning what my plans for the day were, what time I was leaving, and what time I was coming back .I told her one of my roommates and myself had plans with our club. Then when she went to go throw out the trash with my other roommate, she asked her the same thing. Already this seemed a little suspicious, because we knew he was coming over, and her questions felt a little intrusive. When me and my other roommate came back to the apartment, she brought her ex over, and they went straight to her room. As she passed mine and my roommate's rooms, she said ""we're gonna talk, so if you hear arguing that's why"". The entire time he was there, they barely talked, and instead we heard sexual noises coming from her room (won't go into much detail for respect out of my roommate lol). A couple hours after we asked her what happened, and she said ""nothing happened, we just took a nap"". Anyways, after that, he started coming over every other day, but she wouldn't tell us when he was coming, or what their relationship status was. We all kind of figured that they were back together.

Then things started getting weird. She kept lying and joking about their relationship. She said she's only getting back together (or thinking about it) with him because she's bored and doesn't do much at home anyways. One time I came home early from work and found them in the living room laying on top of each other on the couch. She immediately asked ""aren't you supposed to be at work?"" so things like this kept happening.

Until yesterday. My other roommate and I have club meetings On Fridays around 5, so we usually leave at 4. Yesterday, while we were getting ready, she kept lingering around us and asked us what time we were leaving, what time we were coming back. She walked us out the door (which felt strange because she usually just says bye to us from her room. I shit you not, literally 10 min after, she said her ex was at the apartment and he brought ice cream, and they were gonna nap. It felt like she was just waiting for us to leave, so she could sneak him into the apartment. My other roommate (not club one), told the rest of us she came back and found him laying on top of her in the living room again.

When I came home, I found a Target receipt on the kitchen floor, that had 2 items, ice-cream, and condoms. The couch was also a mess. she was asleep in her room, and he wasn't there. It finally clicked how suspicious and sneaky she was trying to be, and I found my hard evidence that she's been having sex with him. I put it back, thinking she would throw it out this morning but its still there. We also saw a knotted target back in our garbage with a condom wrapper in it.

**Let me explain why I am a little pissed off.**

She's lying about her intentions with him, and every-time we ask her, she always jokes around and says she doesn't like him like that, but then he's coming over every other day. She's being intrusive to mine and my roommates personal lives and keeps asking what we're doing, where we are, what time we're coming home/leaving. Everything just feels very sus and it doesn't sit right. Especially because we've all been friends for so long, and we usually tell each other everything. It also occurred to me if he's over so often when we're all home, how many times did she bring him over when none of us were at the apartment. I understand if she's embarrassed that she's back together with her ex, but clearly not embarrassed to let him sleep over every other night.

I'm just sick of the lies, and her acting oblivious, and pretending everything's okay. I also feel like she thinks we don't know what's going on, and she feels like she's getting away with it. I really need some advice on what to do, or what to say to her/my roommates. Anything would be helpful, thank you!",17Nov2019,1
20,"Hi! I’m 17, I messed up, and my father found out. 

There were three incidents that he heard about. 

The first was, a couple of months ago, I said I was sleeping over at a friends house, when in reality I was hanging with my then- boyfriend. Nothing happened either, I didn’t even sleep with him. My mother found out the next day, and I suffered her punishment for lying to her. 

Second was that I was supposed to meet an online friend at a mall and it turned sour, and it ended with him threatening me, which I later reported to the police. This happened a week and a half ago. 

Third was that I met a great guy at the library, and he got my number. We chatted a bit and then he told me he was 42. I promptly said bye and blocked him. Also a week and a half or so. 

He found out through my mother, which she told everything. He found out the week before, but didn’t say anything until yesterday, to me. 

We were in the car, and he said the following things. 

- I don’t believe you anymore 
- I will never lift a finger for you ever again 
- If you mess up, I won’t help you 
- You are never allowed to leave the house 
- Don’t ask me for anything, you won’t get it from me 
- I will never trust you again 
- I’m ashamed to call you my daughter 

And all the other things of me being an idiot, that I’m ruining my life, etc. 

Now I understand if he said all of that in the heat of the moment, but that wasn’t the case. Any tips on how to move on from this?",17Nov2019,1

28,"i’m mainly writing this because i’m hurt and annoyed at myself for being hurt and i have no one to talk to and i think there’s something seriously wrong with me for being so affected by something so unimportant.  

i have long, naturally curly light brown hair. i love my hair - it’s the one feature about myself that i feel confident in. the only times i ever had short hair was when i was a toddler and when my mum made me get it cut when i was 10. i was so insecure that i was a genuinely miserable preteen. but now my hair is long, and i get compliments on it very often.

my boyfriend always says in passing that i should have short hair. he’s never said it in a demanding/forceful/mean way ever. but then i realised that his last girlfriend had short brown hair, and i asked him is that why he wanted me to have it. he said no and seemed appalled that i would think that. but then he said that he just thinks short hair is so much nicer than long hair. and then i looked at every one of his ex’s social media. and i saw that every one of them had short brown hair. 

i want to cut my hair because i love him and i want him to think i’m pretty and i want him to like my hair. i want to be even almost as pretty as his ex’s. i want him to think i’m pretty. 

i’m aware of how immature this sounds but i’m so, so hurt that the one thing i like about myself, he doesn’t like. 

i don’t know. i know i’m being dramatic and annoying. i’m sorry",17Nov2019,1

Its like I am not allowed to be unhappy doing things for her because if I say yes but not in a tone she likes I will get the can I have a word with you chat saying she doesn't ask for much but when my cousins and uncle says no to her she accepts it. I am looking to rent a room somewhere to escape her, on the weekends I walk around town for hours on end so I don't have to be in the house with her, she wont let me go upstairs and relax in the room I pay rent for because I get told oh your going to bed early when I just want to watch a bit of tv and she will come upstairs and ask me what I am doing and I tell her watching tv. I really have no idea how to cope anymore I tried confronting her last year after work and she yelled at me for 3 hours straight there are times she will quilt me by saying if you love me you'd get me a present and things like that. I don't know if I am crazy but to me it sounds she is treating me like a child but at the moment my will is so broken I even gave up the things I love doing because she would have a go at me , thank you for listening sorry for the post I Just don't know if I am overreacting or whether my feelings are correct",17Nov2019,1
31," I've only ever told one soul about this, because I'm truly ashamed of it.

I'm a white male in my junior year of high school, and this has been something I've noticed in the past two years.

I have a troubling personal bias against asian people, particularly women that are korean or chinese for some reason.

They make me really angry and I don't know why.

Of course I would never actually hurt someone else's feelings by telling them I hate them because of their race, it's been deeply drilled into my skull by my parents how unfair that is.

Generally I would not consider myself a discriminatory person; I grew up around three little sisters, a few learning disabilities, as a white kid in a heavily latino-populated part of Orange County, and my parents brought me up with liberal ideals. The majority at my school is Asian. I'm very passionate about the history of slavesong, blues and jazz, and, though it's a stupid point, my best friend I've ever met is black. I interviewed a Chinese immigrant who is a fellow student and friend to possibly get some insight on the disconnect. It didn't help.

If course, that sounds like I'm trying to excuse it and make myself sound less guilty. But really I'm trying to wrack (wrack? rack? wrak?) my brain as to where the hell these feelings came from and why they're so specific.

I wasn't raised this way at all.

33,"So me (29m) and her (31f) met at college and dated throughout. We had a very turbulent relationship due to her having drug issues at the time and after college when I deployed for the army I got a dear john letter. I was absolutely heart broken at the time but the years went by and we both moved on (or so I thought).

 7 years later I suffered a bad breakup and spur of the moment sent her a connection request on linkedin of all places. I sent out a message complimenting her on how shes grown (great job and everything). She responded by giving me her number and after texting and calling over the next few days we agreed to meet up. One thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together.

34,"We rent the second floor plus a finished attic on the third floor. Last December I caught a bat in our apartment. This bat had made its way down from the crawl space above the attic to our bedroom on the second floor. I freaked out, managed to trap it under a Tupperware container and put it outside. My boyfriend let our landlord know and they sent someone out to check the crawl space. The person they sent out claimed he looked into the crawl space and didn’t find any signs of bats. We have two small doors that lead to the crawl space which they taped up. Literally just duct taped the doors closed. We let it go, thinking it was just a one off thing and didn’t have anymore problems until now. We can very clearly hear that the bats are back, they are scratching on the ceiling above our heads. I know we need to contact the landlord again, but I don’t want them to come out and “look” again just to tel us it’s nothing.

35,"Don't wanna relive this so I'm gonna be brief.

About 5 years ago I found a message on my sister's label maker,I gave it to my mum and it turned out that my sister had written out how my father had sexually abused her (she was 9 at the time).long story short he gets deported back to his country and life goes back to being normal.Recently my sister just starting dealing with her emotions on the subject and it's been a hard time for her.

My sisters just told me that our mum told her that on Monday a guy came to our door looking for I'm 15 and he's just not so it freaks my mum out to see a fully grown an asking for her son.He tells her that his friend knew a guy in prison and that the guy (my dad) asked him to give me his phone number(I can only assume he's doing this now cause my 16th birthday is in a matter of days and that he thinks he can get to me now that I'm technically an adult). Thing is I despise the man.He robbed me of the chance to have a father growing up and he fucking abused my little sister.im gonna cut to the point now cause just typing this I'm getting mad.
My mum thinks he'll try to contact me again since this attempt failed (I wasn't even home to get the letter this makeshift courier had) and since he sees me as a weak link;my mum clearly can't stand him and he knows what he did to me sister yet he thinks I'm gullible or stupid enough not to let the atrocity he commited affect me.

Anyway I don't know if I'll be able to stop myself from talking to him in some capacity the next time he tries something.I don't want a relationship with the bastard but I want to see what makes him tick as from the stories my mums told me she makes him out to be a sociopath yet I hardly even remember his personality since I last saw him the night before we found out about what he'd done.If I ever saw him in person I know I'd at least try kill him (it's been my motivation for getting stronger for 2 and a half years now and I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't at least try to make him pay for what he did) but that's unlikely since he's been deported to Jamaica and I'm in England.

So I guess what I'm asking is just what to do in general from here on out,my sister seems fine on the outside but she's always been good at seeming good.im still processing this and my mums dead set on moving house now that she's realised he still has our address and since my sister hasn't slept in her room consistently since the incident.

36,"Tl;dr parents didn’t know I was dating someone, got caught with hickies and now they’re upset and my dad is responding horribly. He says, among other things, that I’ve utterly betrayed him and his trust.

I’m in my early 20s, in a rigorous grad program and started dating a classmate.  We’ve only known each other for a few months (in person). I didn’t expect to meet anyone or to even be into him, but we spent a lot of time together studying and turns out he’s a great guy and we realized that we’re attracted to and like each other.

I wasn’t ready to tell my parents yet because we basically just had the “so we’re dating conversation” and they always blow things out of proportion and ask a million questions. 

Unfortunately, I made a rookie mistake and have hickies on my neck. (We’re both pretty inexperienced and I had only made out before, he had never kissed anyone until we met.) I went to bed when I got home and went to talk to my parents the next morning before I took a shower so I didn’t notice them and they both saw. 

They were grilling me and I’m a horrible liar so they pretty much know we fooled around in my car and they’re both upset. My dad is furious with me, cursed, kicked some shoes, and said some pretty hurtful things about me (called me a dumbass, silly girl, said that’s why I’m always secretive/ don’t want him in my business, have been gunning for a relationship for months, etc.). He keeps texting/ saying things like I betrayed him, I’m shitting on him, etc.

I commute to school and often choose to drive rather than take the train (dad pays for train pass I pay for car gas/ maintenance and repairs) and so now they pretty much think I stay late to hookup and that’s why I drive, which is not true (he has an apartment so if I wanted I could just go there.) and we haven’t been dating long at all.

They think I’m ruining my reputation, gonna distract myself because this semester’s really important, etc. The last guy I dated we only went out twice, never kissed or anything, but he was in his late 20s and we met online and my dad stopped talking to me and essentially forced me to stop seeing him. There was also drama because I wanted to move closer to my school so I didn’t have a long commute and he thought it was just so I can date that guy (who I barley knew!!). So I ended things before they could even start and I’m commuting about an hour each way to school everyday.

I like this current guy. He’s kind, smart, funny, respectful, etc. and I want to keep seeing him. I also messaged him that he left marks and that I didn’t notice before it was too late, he saw the message and still hasn’t responded. Was waiting for a reply so I could tell him the full story. I also told one friend earlier in the day before I told him because she has strict parents and would understand I was freaking out as this was all unfolding. Suffice to say, I am stressed.

I just need some general advice on how to get through this/ proceed.",17Nov2019,1

38,"My dad grew up being neglected and being physically, emotionally abused by those around him and his prostitute mother. I was very close to my dad but living with him and his mental illnesses was so toxic and so unhealthy. Schizophrenia, PTSD, depression. His moods would go from livid anger, degrading me to telling me I was the best thing that ever happened to him and treating me like a princess. I admired him so much for who he was: an ex soldier, a survivor, an open minded and good person. He went through phases of barely leaving the house, smoking weed (giving it to me too), binging on food and TV and sometimes doing coke. I am trying to sum up this relationship/ experience but just can’t, it was so strange, so toxic and so different one minute to the next. He would sometimes be so depressed and suicidal, he told me that I was the only thing that kept him living and I felt a lot of pressure. 

I woke up one morning and got ready for school. I went downstairs to meet my dad, still awake from the night before, as he sometimes was and under the influence of a concoction of weed, coke and booze. Seeing him like this was bittersweet; deep down I knew it wasn’t healthy but whenever he was in this state he was pleasant. It seemed my dad was many people. Sometimes he put on the responsible dad act “we’ve gotta go shopping” “stop getting detentions”  but times like these he was just my mate who wanted to have a good time. I hugged him goodbye and left the house, he stood at the door and waved while I was walking down the street. Little did I know that would be the last time I saw him. 

Finding out my dad had been arrested for child porn turned my life upside down. I had to come to terms with so many things. My perception of everything completely flipped, my whole belief system, thought process changed. I had to reflect on how I had been living, what my dad was like and how I was so brainwashed. Coming to terms with who I had really been living with. Sometimes when I think back I think how scary shit was sometimes. Whenever my mum has suggested or brought up my dad beating her I dismissed it and shut it down immediately. My dad had convinced me what went on was merely passion, both of them getting physical. The same day i got the news about my dad, my (quite insensitive mother) told me a graphic story of how he told her they were going shopping, drover her up onto the moors, beat her, left her, came back, beat her again and took her home. The story still fucks me up. My dad hit me a couple times. Once leaving a big bruise on my arm that I had to cover up all holiday. 

I hadn’t always lived solely with my dad. I used to spend equal time with my mother and her husband and my dad. My step dad is a nasty control freak and him and my mother would always slag my dad off, they were against me always and I was against them. They saw me as his daughter and it is true because I was always so loyal to him and never to my mum who I could never get along with. I would rather live with my 

I am now living with them permanently and it is hell. My mum allows him to treat me like shit. He is nice to me sometimes but is really highly strung and is absolutely venomous when angered. “Go get fiddled by your pedo dad”, “you’re a freak, you’re from a family of freaks!”, “slut” etc. He is so controlling. I am only 15 and can not move out yet but I want to so bad. 

Sometimes I think about the good times, the great memories and the freedom I had there and miss my old life, miss how blissfully ignorant I was. Then sometimes I think about the terror, the sadness, the pain and wonder how and why I ever put up. 
I could tell you a thousand stories about my dad that are 100% true and you would think he was the most interesting, experienced, funny, generous, chill, kind person ever. But that’s only half the story.

my father came back the beginning of last year and he would hit me over little things like when i forgot to keep the cat out of the room. or when i talked back once after he said i deserved to get bullied in high school. i’m sure he abused me because he was angry that he couldn’t live the life that he wanted to (away from us and cheating on my mother) he cheated on my mother for 7 years and came back like nothing happened. he literally lived two different lives, while he was gone he never even picked up the phone. we were almost kicked out of our home and he still never picked up or cared. my mother was always on his side anyways. 

i always help my mother and try to prove to her that i’m a good kid but it never seems enough. i don’t ask her for anything, im scared to ask because i know she won’t be happy. i clean the house the best that i can and i’m trying to start online college but it’s difficult without a teacher around and it’s hard to stay motivated. today my mother yelled at me because i was too tired to clean a few dishes and i told her that i try my best to do everything she tells me to. i told her that i don’t even clean my room really anymore because i feel stressed out with a lot of things and she said she doesn’t know why i’m stressed out. she knows why but refuses to realize that what happened to me before is why i’m stressed out. i never even got any help. and i always try to live up to her expectations and do things by myself but it’s never enough. i’m sorry this is long and messy.",17Nov2019,1

Well. To make it simple, my girlfriend and love of my life is A, my ex is B. We’re all polyamourous and activist in our town. 

3 years ago, I was dating B, then A, at the same time. A and B dated each other, we were some kind of trouple. We were all 17 and having our first relationship. Then, A and B broke up, I stayed with both of them. 

1 year ago, B told me that she has been raped by A, at the beginning of their relationship, at 17. I talked about it with A, who tell me they were drunk this night, and she don’t remember it well. B asked me to make a choice, it was A or B. My relationship with B was really complicated and maybe toxic (we had lot of fights and borderline situation her and I), and my relationship with A is almost perfect, so I told her I would stay with A. 

Then, few month later, B told me she wanted to do something against A, to feel safe, to not see her again in any of our activist place. I supported her with this, because she really needed support, and anyway A agreed, she don’t want to make her uncomfortable so she wasn’t going to these places anymore anyway. Even if, now, she can’t go anywhere, she kind of gave up being an activist because of this story. 

Then, it wasn’t enough, maybe B wanted me to get back together with her and breack up with A, maybe she’s feeling way to bad, maybe I did something wrong, but she wanted A to be banned from almost every places she go in town, and even some where she’s not going, like some cultural places, just in case she wanted to go there too. I supported her as well as I can, but at a time, it was too much for me, so I asked her to take her distances from me. It was already too difficult to be the emotional support of both of them, and she was my ex after all. B didn’t took it well. Now, that’s me she don’t want to see anywhere. She talk about me on social media and now, I can’t even see my friends, because I can’t go in my usual places in town, I fear to find her, we have lot of friends in common, and when I see her, she talks behind my back, convince everyone that I’m some partner in crime or something like this. 

I want to go back there, and see my friends, and keeping my activist life. The only fault I did was going out with the woman I love, who happens to being accused of rape. I really don’t know what to do. I have some friends who support me, even if, in our activist world, rape victims are the one to listen to. But I realise things are way more complicated than just a ”Me too” movement. Maybe I’m in fault. I would really take an advice here, even if it’s not from our feminist - lgbt activism world.

45,"I was wondering what kind of help I can give to my friend who is suffering from (what appears to be be) moderate to severe mental heath issues at the moment. She shows signs of and has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and some form of psychosis. I insisted take she seeks more serious forms of assistance, such as a psychiatrist. However, she is not able currently due to a waiting list to see a specialist. She also has told me that she has self-harmed in the past and gets urges to continue, after a prolonged hiatus.

I'm worried for her as she says she has reached an all time low. She has also told me about letters that she has written 'in case anything happens to her'. She is a teenager and comes from a country in which mental health has a negative stigma surrounding it and therefore her parents show dismissal and anger at her problems.

I was wondering if there was any support that I could provide for her or any places in which she would be able to seek help.

A  bit of a background I am studying at university and ATM living with my  aunt and uncle and my cousin just keeps annoying the living hell out of  me. He had done the most disgusting and obnoxious things ever.

This includes:

2. Playing loud music when I'm trying to work on assignments or study.
3. Telling blatant to his parents about me.
4. Calling racial slurs based on my ethnicity and spitting in my food.
5. Trying to hit me when his friends are home(he's of a strong build and nearly 6 foot tall).
6. Clicking pictures of me in compromising positions when I requested him not to.
7. Throwing garbage in my room from the street.

52," Ok, so I had more than a few setbacks in my life including illness and unemployment. I had an agreement with my college to pay $100 a month for N# months until I had my \~3k debt paid off, which worked for me, **but**. **But** their payment system doesn't have an autopay option, and my **ADHD self** thought it was on autopay. Because all my bills are. I received last month a letter from a collection agency. I contacted my college and they refuse to give me a new payment plan, even justifying my hardship - unemployment, illness, ADHD. They never gave me even a courtesy of a reminder for the missed payments.  


From being unemployed I acquired 5k in credit card debt. I just started working again and I was planning on getting a few 0% APR cards to transfer the balance of my main card and pay everything off interest-free within the next N# months. I was approved for a discover with a 2.5k credit line. Even tho my credit is good,(\~710) the other cards I've applied to, declined my request. Probably because I applied for too many. The irony. I'm trying to not snowball into debt.  


I'm torn between putting the 2.5k I have left in my student loan into the 0% APR Discover card and just deal with paying APR in the 5K CC debt I have with other creditors. Or telling the damned college that they can go \*\*\*\* themselves and if they won't give a payment plan without placing into collections they won't see their money anymore. I can't negotiate with the collection agency because they will put in my credit report anyway, besides collecting a 33% fee.  


I have one more week to decide what to do. I'm planning on requesting a verification letter from the collection agency to gain time, which is warranted since they've got the wrong amount.  


Some extra info, I applied for a chase freedom Nov 02 and never gotten a reply. I called them yesterday and it still under analysis. I could only request a credit line increase on the discover after 31 days. My request with Citi® Double Cash Card is also under review :/

I applied for an American express which has been canceled without explanation (sigh). Capital One harasses me every month sending pre-approval letters but when I needed it, they denied (sigh). The bank I have my checking acc with, also denied my application for a 2nd card, probably because my card debt with them has been growing in the past months, although I've been paying more than the minimum consistently.

I'm waiting on the answer of my request for a CC with my credit union as well, its not 0 APR but it's from 2 to 5. Better than the current one I have. 

The collection agency is Williams &amp; Fudge. It's not showing on my credit report yet. **Anyone knows the likelihood of this particular creditor to report to the credit bureaus and/or sue me?** And how big of an impact a single collection is likely to affect my credit score? 

**What do you think I should do? Any other credit cards or consolidation loan companies that would accept my request?**",17Nov2019,1

even though it's somewhat special to me its broken down and rusted to hell and apperently there is a hole in the bottom.

(i didn't make the pictures, the garage is 2 hours away from me)

also i have no idea how hard it would be or how much time it would take to fix it myself even though i have 0 experience in fixing cars or is it maybe a good a idea to let a professional fix it all up? or will that cost immense unsustainable amounts of money?

here is a foto album of its current state: [https://imgur.com/a/4uQyLug](https://imgur.com/a/4uQyLug)

i hope some of you can help me out i would really appreciate it

edit: som1 said i should sell it how much would you guys think its worth?",17Nov2019,1

56,"I recently decided that two “friends” of mine (who I’m also roommates with, sadly) weren’t worth keeping due to a time line of events. 

Simply- them talking bad about me behind my back, me finding out from my boyfriend, me approaching them and saying politely that if they have a problem with me to talk to me and not others (seriously, we’re all 20, grow up), they said I was being mean to one of them and that it was building up (probably cause she didn’t talk about it in the first place), I asked for an example on what I did wrong and they COULDN’T GIVE ME ONE. After that day I texted them saying I don’t want to lose their friendship over something like this, and I was met with no response. No communication. It boggles my mind how they expect me to go up to them if they’re the ones with the problem and I’ve given them plenty of opportunities to come talk to me and make things right. I’ve always been the one that has to confront any issues they have with our roommates because they’re usually pushovers. (I.e. them talking to me about how dirty one roommate is and how disgusting and lazy she is, but when that roommate goes to them and says “sorry for not doing the dishes” they’ll say “oh it’s fine!”)

Now, I’ve decided that I can’t be friends with people who can’t communicate effectively and over complicate “issues.” For example, one of them was in a play and I asked how it was going and she said good but she was tired, so I responded “oh I’m sorry, that must suck” to which she replied “not really, it’s fine.” I found out from her boyfriend that she took it as me trying to bring down her experience with her first production. What??? I was just sympathizing with her because I’ve been there too and I know it can get exhausting.

I just want to find a way to move on and not hold this anger in. It’s hard because I live with them, I see them in classes (same major), they’re friends of my friends so I see them on social media all the time (I don’t even use much social media other than reddit if that even counts). I’m just not sure what to do. I’m firm on the stance that I don’t need to be the one to approach them- my therapist (a person who specializes in human behavior which is why I feel like I can trust her opinion) says that I’ve done my part to make them feel like they can come to me. I want to keep ignoring them but that’s not beneficial to anyone, especially this build up of frustration in me. If ignoring is the right way to go, how do I cope with it?",17Nov2019,1

58,"Today I was helping my 14 y/o brother with his homework. At one point he put his hand on the table we sat next to, in a way that allowed me to notice horizontal cuts all over his wrist. When I asked him about it, he pulled his hand away and told me to move on without asking questions.

Later on, I figured it would be a good idea to ask him whether I should tell it to mom or to dad - his relationship with either one of them is not simple. Asking him turned out to be a mistake, since he threatened me that if I tell them he'll continue this practice. The best thing I could do was promise that I won't tell them - as long as he doesn't hurt himself like that anymore.

Now, I need to clarify that he didn't try commit suicide, by cutting himself. He even told me that he knows vertical cuts do that better.

However, I think the situation is still very severe - a 14 year old should never try to solve his issues by injuring himself as that always leads to more harm.

Anyway, what would you recommend me to do? 

I really want to tell our parents about it, but if he'll find out that I told them he'll feel betrayed and continue injuring himself. I really don't want that to happen.

The best option I thought of is to have my mom pretend like she finds out about the injuries by coincidence, like I did.

Advice would be very welcome, the sooner - the better.

Thanks for reading &amp; helping.",17Nov2019,1

Recently I’ve noticed well I think I’ve noticed him flirting with me. He sends the little smirk emoji, the kiss face emoji and others like that but he has a sarcastic sense of humor so I can’t tell if it’s part of that. He also is more touchy feely, he pushes me things like that but it’s playful than anything. We talk so much more and he always tells me how much he appreciates me
Buuuuut I can’t tell if this is him just being more comfortable with me now that we’re closer, I don’t think I’m his type anyways.

62,"I have a dilemma here and I’ve asked people in my life for advice and they haven’t been able to really give any. Trigger Warning for molestation 

Also, I’m not sure what to call him to I’m going to refer to him as “my abuser”. I’m sorry if this offends anyone and if there’s something else I should call him let me know and I will change it.

For some background, I was molester by my mom’s friend’s son when I was really young. He wasn’t much older than me. There was a small confrontation at the time, he denied it happened and it was kind of brushed under the rug. My family continued to be friends with them for years after and my mom’s brother married my abuser’s mother(B) ten years ago. 
When I was just getting into college I had memories pop up from that time and asked my parents about it. I never wanted to confront him directly and we hadn’t spoken in a couple of years so I didn’t think I had anything to worry about. However when I got engaged a couple years later, he sent me a message and I told him that I remembered what he had done to me and to leave me alone. He told B about it and so she and my uncle called demanding to know what was going on. Basically they believed that I was lying. I haven’t spoken to them since. 

I was told a few days ago that B and my uncle will be coming to Thanksgiving at my grandparents’ this year. My great-grandparents are getting weaker as the year goes on and I fear it may be the last one I have with them. No one besides my parents, sister, and husband know any of what happened. If they asked I would be honest but I don’t want to damage any relationships. I’m also not very sure I’d have many people on my side anyway (this side of my family is known for ignoring or burying things so as not to have confrontation). I’m torn between wanting to be with my great-grandparents but also not wanting to be around B and my uncle. Besides my situation, B has been known to make sideways comments and go from being friendly to hostile in a snap. My mom suggested staying around my great-grandparents and making sure I’m never alone in a room with either of them. I’m also worried that if I see them I will want to confront them (mostly my uncle who up until he married B had been very close to me) and I do not want to cause unnecessary drama. I believe even being there I will cause tension and I don’t want that either. 

The way I see it is I either go and pretend nothing happened or not go and pretend to be with my husband’s family that day. What should I do?


tl;dr My uncle and abuser’s mom are coming to thanksgiving and idk if I should go",17Nov2019,1

65," I became friends with this girl I met from oversees after we both met at a week long conference type event near where I live. We spoke a lot in person and then eventually started chatting almost 2 or 3 times a week for a good long while.  


At one point I told her I had feelings for her and she understood but wanted to chat a little while longer and possibly meet again in person before taking anything further and we kind of just left it there. We kept chatting regularly but due to her busier schedule it slowed down a little bit.  


Eventually she came over to my city for another event with a big group of friends who were travelling over too and we met a couple of times but I was too busy with work in stuff so didn't get to speak to her much. She went back home and I felt like I missed a chance to say anything in person.  


A week or so later I ended up triple-drunk messaging her short paragraphs admitting my feelings again and how I felt annoyed for not speaking to her more in person when she came over but have had no response for a while now. Since then I've deleted all social media apps that she posts on as to try and not think about it, while at the same time I've been tempted to message her again to reconnect with her again.  


I've burnt bridges in the past and I've always eventually gotten over it except in this case and I don't know whether to try and salvage our friendship anymore.

68,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post here. 

    So last night me and 4 other friends (we are all 18, and I'm a guy) decided to have some alcohol in my neighbor's bedroom (we live in a dorm) and have some fun.
 
    I got very tipsy, and according to my friends ( I can't remember much), I climbed onto the bed and started pulling her over to me. For some reason the other 3 friends just left the room and left just me and the girl there. I can't remember anything except for seeing her face very close to mine. According to her I constantly pulled her back towards me whenever she pushed me away and did stuff like biting her ears and putting our lips together.

    She's a close friend but I don't have a thing with her. She has never done something like that with a guy before and obviously she's very upset right now, she's shouted at me and slapped me and shit and obviously she wouldn't accept the fact that I was drunk and had no idea of what I was doing (she thinks I wasn't drunk and intentionally did it)

   I admit it. I must've been the biggest asshole in the world last night. I fucked up. She's not going to forget this easily. What can I do? I don't think saying anything helps at this point, we're still going to be neighbors for the rest of the school year.

and saw a comment along the lines of “If you think that was bad check out r/eyebleach. You’ll wish you never saw the stuff on that subreddit”

Now, naturally I go to check out how bad this subreddit is, and yes it is indeed very bad. However, it’s stuff I could handle. I’m not one to get that disturbed by stuff found on that subreddit. So I was looking through the posts and noticed a trend. Mosts of these messed up posts originated from a website called “Beatgore”. 

Fast forward a few days and I’m back on reddit looking at the front page. I get the thought “let’s see what the worst post is on r/eyebleach. Granted, I don’t enjoy looking at this stuff but I was bored and it’s kinda similar to 50/50 challenge. Remember that? When I get to the subreddit, I remember that the posts are from the website I mentioned before. I go to check the website out with the mentality “ how bad can the internet really get”. I was driven purely by morbid curiosity. 

This website. This goddamn website is the most disturbing thing I have ever witnessed. Before seeing anything it tells you about what the website is about and how it’s not for the faint of heart. I still go along with it because I’m fine with a little gore. What I’m not fine with is some of the stuff shown here. Although it says what it will show, I didn’t actually expect it to be so real. I literally watched two people get beheaded. BEHEADED. Jesus Christ. While watching it I was in pure shock. I stopped it before I had a mental breakdown and now it’s all I’ve been able to think about all day. Every few seconds I get the flashing images from that video.

Her birthday was a couple days ago and she let me know the night before that she would have friends over then go to the bars and that I could tag along if I wanted. I pre-gamed with them here and decided to go out to the bars for my first time ever with them. I drank a lot and I had work the next morning so I left early to go back to our place and all seemed fine and we talked about it the next day and I thanked her for inviting me and how fun it was, and she even updated me on what happened afterwards and nothing seemed off.

It was too late for me to leave or anything so I just said hello as I passed by them to get to the counter. I saw my roommate quickly turn around to look at me and when I said hey they all pretty much ignored me. It made an awkward situation even more awkward and on top of that I sat there for like 10 minutes for my food, and one of the girls that was at our apartment a few days before came up to the counter like a foot away from me and also ignored me. It made me feel really weird and I'm wondering looking back if my roommate was just inviting me to a few of those events was just a way to hint that her friends would be around and find somewhere else to be? But then that doesn't make sense because she's gone out plenty of times/had friends over and I wasn't there or expected to be invited.

89,"First of all I just want to say I am sorry if this at all sounds cringy in any way. I don’t mean for it to be because it’s serious to me. 


I have been watching and playing video games all my life and while doing that I have played mainly alone in those times. I have played many of these popular esports games and it has really made me want to try to be the absolute best of the best. When I play these games I can’t help myself but try to be as competitive as possible and improve as fast as I can. So far though I have been unsuccessful at being able to be good enough to be a pro player or a great one in any game I have attempted to be good at. I love gaming and competing but I just can’t seem to get to the level I need to be at. It frustrates me that I can’t accomplish this one thing of being one of the best at at least one of these games. I just can’t help myself in these competitive games that I want to be the best. It’s so difficult for me to try to play them casually. On the other hand I am also worried that over my time of playing games and being somewhat of a hermit I haven’t really experienced what a life without constant gaming is really like. I am 18 and I have never been in a relationship or even really hanged out with friends outside of school or work. I’m afraid I’m just losing all my time focusing on getting better in these games that I am not actually living a real life. I stay in doors all day except for when I work and go to college practically and I don’t have a much of a social life other than talking to the people I work with. It eats at me everyday though that I can’t achieve this passion of mine at being the best at a game. I always just doubt myself and I just don’t know if I should just try to push through or to move on to having at lest somewhat normal and social life. Yet again I am so sorry if this sounds super cringy. I know my problems don’t seem very troubling to some but it does affect me. Any advice is very appreciated.",17Nov2019,1

What’s going to happen during the transition from college to full time job? How do I make it a smooth transition if possible?

I make music, and even sitting down writing has been difficult.  I played a match for a ESport game tonight and won, and even after that I feel like I accomplished nothing.

112,"What Is the Best Option for My Cats Happiness?

Hi reddit,

I currently have three cats, Fineas, Django, and Poppy. Django and Fineas were both planned (I got Django, he was lonely so I got Fineas). I loved them to death and didn’t have an aspirations to change my cat-count. 

Enter November 11th, two years ago. It’s cold and a friend finds a skinny cat outside that’s terrified and asks me to take her into my home. I take her to the vet, she’s treated, microchipped and spayed, and I take her into my home. I’m a sucker for a sob story. I name her Poppy because the day I met her was Remembrance day.

For the first year, Poppy would not leave from under my bed. She wouldn’t let you touch her and the only time she came out was to use the litter. She eventually warmed up to the point where she wanders the apartment but very much keeps to herself and still spendings the majority of her time under the bed. She lets you pet her on her own terms and my heart swells just thinking about how far she’s come. 

The issue is Fineas. He’s a fire cracker and loves to rough and tumble, which is just fine for Django, but it terrifies the living day lights out of Poppy. I’ve done my best to protect Poppy from his attempts at “playing” and she will definitely stick up for herself by hissing and swatting at him but it’s still not optimal for her. 

More and more, as Poppy’s come out of her shell, I’ve started feeling guilty and like I’m hindering her from truly growing into the cat she could be if she was in a one-cat household. I love her to the moon and back and gosh can you tell that she loves me too, but I am truly torn about whether or not I should keep her. I want to, but I’m not sure if it would be the best for her. My parents think that I would break her heart if I ever gave her up to another, and honestly it would break my heart too, but it’s clear that she would thrive if she was the only cat in a home. 

What should I do reddit? I feel stuck at an impasse where I feel guilty for keeping her and just as guilting for thinking about rehoming her.

Ps- before anyone says anything, I didn’t name Django or Fineas, I just kept their adoption names as they were. Maybe I have a guilt complex that’s ten miles high but I just couldn’t bring myself to change them.",17Nov2019,1

I'm a college student 18M, and I live with my dad (30 min. away from school) who is an alcoholic. He oftens comes home from work drunk at around 11PM-2AM (drinks and drives and/or drinks with friends). And sometimes when I arrive late from school, I see him past out on the floor. And it's very depressing, and pathetic sometimes... this isn't anything new either. I witnessed two divorces between my dad and my mom, and it's just getting worse day by day. My mom still has a key to our house, and she often comes into the house without notice to argue with me or my dad. She lives a few blocks, so it's a regular occurence. Sometimes even at 2AM on a weekend. She has custody of my 4 other siblings. 

Anyways. Just to clarify my dad is not abusive. But I've been having thoughts whether the presence of my family by side is even a good thing to begin with. I originally got a full-ride to university, but was stripped from it due my HS GPA falling in the last semester. (Paren
nts divorcing and they made more involved than I should have def made a big impact on me). I've been thinking there's not much my parents can possibly do for more other than shelter and food. And it may be best to leave them behind. It's seriously destroying up my mental well-being. I've become depressed and sometimes think about whether trying is worth it.

I was thinking about moving in with a possible roommate if I do get that job (I have an interview in a couple days, and I have connections within the company).

118,"Apologies in advance, since I know there's a real chance that I'm just being horribly neurotic, but I can't shake the feeling that I've somehow made a big faux pas and need to do something about it.

For background, here's who's involved in this situation: 1) Me, middle manager at a tech company, working on ""Product Z"", a product that's in development and not yet on the market; 2)  ""Margaret"", a junior employee (1 level below me) who's working on ""Product X"", which is already on the market and is the key product that's going to make or break our company; 3) ""Sonya"", a VP who's my boss and also Margaret's boss's boss.

All three of us (among others) are at a work-sponsored social event in the middle of the work day. Sonya leaves, and then about 5 minutes later I walk out of the event with Margaret. She turns to me and asks me how things are going, and I tell her, ""Oh, not bad,"" and then kind of jokingly ask her when she's going to come work on Product Z with me. (She had done a bit of fill-in work on it with me before and enjoyed it, and she has some struggles with her boss, so that's kind of where my comment came from.) 

She replies, ""Oh, do you think Sonya would let me?"" 

My response is ""Probably not. I don't think we're important enough,"" which was my really inarticulate way of trying to say ""I don't think Product Z is important enough that our boss would take you off of Product X and move you to my product.""

In any case, this verbal exchange started about 20 feet from the elevator and ended about 5 feet from the elevator, at which time I look in the elevator and see Sonya, my boss. I immediately have some internal panic about whether she heard us talking - what we were saying was harmless, but I'm afraid it somehow may have come across as being derogatory to her. (Not sure if the ""we're not important enough"" comment would have come across out of context as making it sound like I thought she didn't give a shit about the little people, or something like that, even though that's not what I meant.)

In any case, since then, I haven't gotten any obvious bad vibes from Sonya - I had a meeting with her the following day and she was perfectly friendly, and even on that elevator ride she had a pleasant chat with Margaret...so on the surface everything seems OK...but I also know that Sonya (although she's been good to me at work) has a reputation for being pretty tough and ruthless, so I have this (possibly irrational) fear that she's being nice to my face but then is somehow going to hold a  grudge against me if she heard me and thought I was talking shit about her.

So that brings me to the question in the title: Do I somehow need to proactively address this with Sonya? Or is it completely silly to do that, given all the question marks here: 1) Did she even hear our conversation, since she was in an elevator (possibly in her own conversation) a little ways away from us? 2) Did she even perceive our conversation as being derogatory toward her, given that it wasn't actually? 3) Would she really be nice to my face but then secretly take it out on me after something like that, or is that completely nuts?",17Nov2019,1

I literally have 0 friends and I have nobody to talk to, I actually regularly talk to myself. I just go to college and go home. That's it. Now I'm even more stressed because my hair became thinner over the past few months. It's crazy I saw a pic of my hair 4 months ago and it was insanely thick and voluminous. Now I feel even shittier. The amount of anxiety I have is crippling, I have no motivation to do anything. I noticed my attention span, and ability to processes information seriously diminished as well.

Hell no but I'm overweight and I never exercise, also I have genetic type 1 diabetes so I should take care of my health but it's difficult, I grew up surrounded by sugar, my mom is heavily addicted to sugar and she's kinda my ""drug dealer"" so when I wanna eat sugar she always buys some sweet shit for me...

Also I don't exercise like never cause I have no motivation at all! I'm terrible with forming habits or creating a routine, I star exercising for like 2 days and then I think like ""omg.... I don't wanna do this today"" and I never exercise again. I need to fix my eating habits and my laziness but I don't know how to!

133,"I’m going to make this as short and sweet as possible. My (24F) boyfriend(33) has been amazing and good to me, faithful, supportive, and great with my 5 year old. (Not his child) 

The last 3 months have been a complete 180. He lost his job and has turned into a shell of a human. This man has had a full time job since he was 16. So losing his job is extremely difficult for him. I’ve noticed he’s bailing on his friends constantly now, and just pulling away from family members as well. I think that He put a happy face on and has tried to pretend everything is just fine until he couldn’t possibly do that anymore. He’s now seeing a psychologist on Monday, and is going to get some help for the depression he’s experiencing. However, tonight for the first time in a while he was in a decent mood. So, I was happy that maybe things were looking up.  Well, He has a metal tumbler style cup and I took a drink of it, because I thought it was water. It was straight vodka.. !!!! 

So, now I realize that he was probably drunk and that’s why he was in a good mood. He has also been in a constant state of “not feeling good” for the last couple months, and now I’m wondering if it’s because he’s drinking all the time. 

Also note, we don’t live together. So I am not around him that often to monitor him that closely. But he is always going to sleep really early or sleeping till 1 pm in the afternoon, just lately. So I thought this was him depression sleeping. But again, I’m wondering if this is also an alcohol problem.

136,"Going to try to keep this as short as possible. I recently moved for a better job. It was sort of short notice so I wanted to continue paying my part of the rent until my roommates found a suitable replacement. We had some friends in mind, it was just a matter of time for them to be able to move in.

Cue my suspicion. One of the friends who's supposed to move in (we'll call them Alex) posted a picture to social media that looks eerily like my old room. I lived there a year and a half, I know that angle, the paint color, etc. Alex also recently acquired a job in the town my apartment is in even though he lives a town over, which is about a 25 minute commute. I don't think Alex would take the kind of job they took unless they were relatively close to it, so the timing seems right.

I tried to probe by asking my old roommates ""when is Alex moving in?"" and they answered Alex was trying to get off next weekend so they could move in. Their partner was trying to do the same.

I don't want to come off as accusatory but I'm pretty sure I've caught them in a lie. I've moved from the apartment, why would this be upsetting to me?

1. I already paid my portion of November's rent. If someone is moving in, it's not on my dime; I want a pro-rated portion of what I paid.
2. I already caught a group of friends (including these ex-roommates) in a lie recently and while they apologized I'm still pretty raw about it and if they're going behind my back again so soon I'm going to be pissed.

I don't know how to confirm my suspicions and I don't want to make an ass out of myself if I'm wrong. I don't know what to do in this situation.",17Nov2019,1

He asked for pictures for proof, so he added me on Instagram. And btw in India, it's like the U.S., if you're older than 18, no s*x/dating people under 18. I fake flirted with him, and he asked me out. I said yes because what is a good story to tell your friends at school other than an Indian man trying to flirt with me? The conversation after went like this.
M:me
I: Indian man

I: Send a pic please.
M: Fine (found random 12 year old girl of of the internet)
I: You are so beautiful.

(So you could be 17, marry them when they are 1, then have s*x with them when they are 14 and you are 30) And besides that, you can get arrested for a couple of years if you get caught being a pedophile, with evidence.

145,"I am 5'7"" and Indian. Here are a few relevant facts to my situation from North American dating studies:

* 2/3 of women consider a man my height unacceptable based solely on his height.
* White men receive 11-14 times more messages as equivalent Asian men on Tinder.
* 95% of women who voice a ""racial preference"" state that they find Indian men unacceptable for interracial dating (while the majority of women state they will gladly date a white man interracially).
* Women who don't voice a racial preference behave the same in online dating as those who do voice a racial preference (so it is likely the same across the board).
* Asian men have half the odds of being in a relationship in America as white men (while Asian women suffer no penalty compared to white women).

These points are all from major published dating studies. I can PM anyone links if they want. 

Dating is incredibly bleak for me. It seems nothing a man does means anything to most women if he does not meet their race and height requirements first. Is this about dating or recruiting supersoldiers for a new Nazi regime? Sometimes I wonder.

How am I not supposed to feel bitter about or dehumanized by women's strict racial and height requirements?

We are no longer friends and I really have no clear reason to live in this city anymore, where I only know a few other people. I have a job at Walmart but I feel terrible about it due to having a college degree (in Art History). I get 40 hours and am paid 12/hr so I could at least rent a room but I don’t know if I want to live with a Craigslist stranger and have no privacy again and I don’t know if I would want to commit to a lease. This is why I am finding it hard to commit to my current situation.

I have serious depression and social anxiety and struggle with procrastination and avoidance. I also am incapable of asking for help or making decisions. I usually let myself fall into disarray so others have to pick up the pieces. I also am no longer passionate about anything. I used to love to play and write music but now I just strum the occasional cover. I haven’t thought much about art in years.

I was thinking about going back home and focusing on going back to school for a more practical degree versus stick around in Houston just to work at Walmart. I like it here however and my hometown is a small rust belt city where I feel I don’t belong. I also have a friend (actually my best friend) in Dallas who will let me stay with him for awhile, though he still lives with his parents though they are apparently cool with me potentially being here.

148,"Ok, I spent over ten years with the same 30 plus students in my class from pre K to 8th grade. I had a pretty typical and happy childhood, but around the time I got glasses, things started to change. Not all at once, gradually my classmates started to treat me differently. From 3rd to 7th grade I was pretty dorky looking, it happens I’m not ashamed of that, and I guess the fact I wasn’t good at or liked sports didn’t help. But take into account that most of the guys in my class were pretty geeky looking too, glasses, braces, we all had em at some point. What I’m trying to get at is I was “bullied” in a sense that doesn’t really make sense. I don’t mean I was ever physically pushed around or hit or anything like that. I was cut off from the social circle that was the “in crowd” of my class, as in I was not treated nicely by the majority of kids, I was not invited to the birthday parties, and nobody wanted to be around me because that would damage their “reputation”. Now honestly, I would’ve been fine if I was just left alone while the “popular” ones had their good times. But no, they had to constantly remind me that they didn’t like me and act like they wished I would move 1,000 miles away.

I have absolutely no idea what I did to deserve this, but that was my life 5 days a week, 9 months of the year, for several years. No one knows except me how much that hurt, and as a result I am now a shy, insecure introvert that prefers to be alone. Quite honestly, I think I could’ve turned out a lot worse. But the damage is done and it can’t be undone. When 8th grade came around, I got contacts &amp; lost the dorky glasses. That didn’t change anything. I made an effort to get ppl to change their opinion of me, it didn’t work. I ate lunch alone, entertained myself, and couldn’t wait to get home every school day.

That was 15 years ago. I’m now 29, and my life is...ok. No fancy job, no hot girlfriend, no big successes to name, just ok. The one thing I do have going for me is my body. Several years ago, I was tired of being a skinny kid, so I bought some equipment, really committed, and never looked back. I’m no body builder, but my biceps are almost 16 inches in diameter and I weigh less than 200lbs at 5”9.75. So that’s something to me, I’ve always wondered if my old bullies worked out as often as I have.

Well today, I saw one of my bullies. In fact, this guy was the most popular guy in my class back then. I haven’t seen him in a long time(thank God) and when I saw him, I couldn’t help but laugh. He’s...pretty bad looking now. Chubby, scruffy beard, and all around looking like he is not aging well. I thought to myself, the fact that he’s probably not so popular with women nowadays is really gratifying. I may not have gotten any form of payback, but just knowing he looks like that now made me smile.

I should’ve just considered that karma has played its part and ended my experience there...then I had to go and check his Facebook. I just wanted to see more pics of him so I could laugh some more over how ugly he is now, and what do I see? He has a girlfriend, and not just any girl, she really beautiful. I don’t know why I’m surprised, it’s like the world refuses to give me any form victory.

This has really gotten me thinking what kind of payback is justified? I know it’s wrong to want to see bad stuff happen to ppl, but I see what they did to me and how they made me feel as a crime, and their crimes were never punished. They have no idea how many times they made me wish I was dead and that’s what really makes me mad, they have no idea how bad they were. If you asked them about the years at our school they’d probably say it was fun and enjoyable. Yea it was for them because they were the ones getting praised and noticed, so why would they think anything else. I’ve tried to just not think about them and move on, but just seeing that one guy today made so many memories and trauma come back and I can’t think of the right way to go about this is. I don’t want to become no better than they were back then, but I can’t accept that they all just got off scott free. I really don’t know what is justifiable and what is considered poisonous revenge. Despite all my efforts, I’m still single and overlooked by girls, my guess is they aren’t interested in shy quiet guys, and years later even though he’s really not that handsome anymore, a guy like my old bully still gets a beautiful girl. I’m dumbfounded and don’t know how to react.",17Nov2019,1

151,"So I live in an inner-city suburb in Sydney, it's developing very quickly and there are almost no quaint little houses left on this particular strip of road. Most of the suburb is bars and live music venues. Smushed in between a pub and a gig-space, is a few townhouses and inside one of them lives an elderly woman.

I have seen this woman outside of her house before, and on one such occasion stopped to speak to her because she looked very tired and very sad. She told me her name, which for the purpose of privacy I will say is 'Mary'. and that she had been having trouble sleeping for days. The smell coming from inside her home was something else. I mean it was awful.

After that night I made sure to keep an eye out every time I walked by, hoping I'd see her shuffling round inside or atleast sitting on her stoop. 

After a few months of not seeing her my partner and I began to get worried. Until yesterday when we walked past her place again, and Mary was taking out her bins. I felt glad to see her.. but we also got a chance to have a small peak inside as we walked past.

I'm not shitting you when I say I've never seen such a severely disturbing case of a hoarder-house.

Mary is a straight up hoarder. There was shit EVERYWHERE. Lining the walls, cobwebs covering everything, and the smell.. oh my fucking god. It stayed in our noses for like 4 blocks.

SO I'm pretty concerned about this whole situation. Not only is the house itself a HUGE fire hazard for Mary and also her neighbours (there was a case of a hoarder house burning down in recent years that killed a few people in a built-up Sydney suburb) but I'm also worried about Mary. Living like this must be miserable. I understand that hoarding is a complex issue and people become that way for various mental health reasons. But this woman is so nice and I'd love to let her know that people are around and looking out for her. Any Ideas would be great!!",17Nov2019,1

153,"First of I'd like to start by saying English isn't my first language so I apologize for any spelling mistakes etc.

So a month ago I met this guy on a online dating site. It's similar to Tinder but it's from 14 or 15 years old. I'm 16 and he's 20. Anyways I'm the one that messaged him first as I was attracted to his looks. He looked fit in his pics and had this cute dog. So straight away he asked me to use facebook instead as he didn't like using the app. I uad no issues with that. After 4 days of messaging each other we met up in a coffe shop near my school as I had an hour between end of school and when the bus came. At the first date he was a bit shy but also had his overly confident moments if that makes sense. So after the date he offered to drive me home and I agreed even though I always had this rule of not getting in a car with strangers. When I saw his car I was a bit schocked. It was a newer Audi A8 that had been wrapped in dark gray. For many people this may seem like nothing. But in area people generally drive old golfs etc. And only business owners or well mafia drive cars like these. In short, an average person couldn't afford a car like that. 

So to cut the story short, we've been dating for a month, I've stayed at his place several times and there's expensive items everywhere. Nice apartment, clothes etc. He spoils me a lot too. And no, I'm not with him because of his money. But I'm just not sure where he gets it. I know he doesn't work, his parents aren't rich and live abroad. And I don't think he's a drug dealer as I haven't noticed a second phone, or him going to sell. The only thing I noticed is that he's on his phone or laptop all the time.

156,"My mom is a warrior. She has financially supported her siblings and mom in Honduras during their times of need and has raised my three siblings and I for the last ten years all on her lonesome.

 Then there's my uncle. He illegally immigrated here around thirteen years ago. He is not the same man when I first met him. He used to be happier, full of life and more sociable and responsible. But progressively he has gotten lazier and leeched off of my mom any time he could because she enables it just like the rest of his family enables his lack of responsibility. So naturally, he'll find a job in another state, work there for a year and then come to us and stay for a year and have a ""vacation"" because he doesn't have to pay for anything or work so he just stays and visits from time to time while laying around doing nothing. He is disgusting and the fact that he takes advantage of a widow makes me hate him. And guess how old he is - HE'S 52- and he's STILL acting like a child.

 Anyway, present day he's been here for about a year now just mooching off of her and since the rest of my mom's siblings were able to get green cards, they have all moved into the house while they get settled, and so he decides to stay as well. What's concerning about him is that now he's an alcoholic who demands money from my mom, has called her names like ""satan"" and ""bitch"" because he blames her that she wasn't able to give him a green card (but he's the one who decided to legally immigrate here and didn't wait like the rest of them,) and just this past night my sister who lives at home with them told me that she heard him maniacally laughing to himself. The last time I visited I sensed something off about him and to make matters worse, on top of being an alcoholic and a super paranoid person, I'm very concerned that he'll lash out violently. He's never been ""violent"" in the physical sense but I can sense the pressure building between them with the angry outbursts he has towards my mom. He blames her for his own problems and I think that is a dangerous mindset to have. Of course nobody in her family intervenes, and my grandma, actually  enables and agrees with what my uncle is saying. All while living under my mom's roof and support. This is seriously horrible. 

So what can I do about this situation? I don't live at home but I really believe what he's doing warrants abuse, but it's tricky because if I were to call the police on him while he has one of his angry outbursts they'll notice that he's illegal. This is such a complicated situation but I'm genuinely scared that he will snap and hurt her. Please help me. I'm so scared.",17Nov2019,1
157,"Okay this is going to be all over the place trying cramp everything down,

Hi, I'm a 16F and I've been living out of home since the beginning of this year (not with my parents) I currently live with my boyfriend of four years. My mother was abusive towards only me and not any of my 3 other siblings, who are all younger. I've felt a sort of ""emptiness"" inside of me and I'm beginning to give up on my school's, dreams, feelings, self care anything to do with me because I just don't feel like it anymore. I've been on antidepressants for about 3-4 and a half months now and been to see multiple therapists. One in particular that told me what happened to me is just ""shit"" and I need to get over it (referring to my mother and what she is continuing to do) and even said if she was the doctor I wouldn't even have received that medication. It began to help me for awhile and I thought by now I would be at least a little happier where I am. However, I'm continuing to feel a sort of emptiness, cold sweats, constant headaches, either insomnia or oversleeping, aching body, dizziness and much more. I've recently just had surgery on top of that so I am still recovering. I was also sexually assaulted 5 years ago in a public bathroom which has caused me so much self hate I cannot look at myself in the mirror even to do my hair, which is becoming very hard for me, I've wanted to do something that would cause me great amounts of pain to punish myself. I've always felt I could never kill myself because of how upset those around me would be after they have put so much into helping me and I desperately want to be there for my sisters, but I just dont know what to do at this point. I don't mean to offend anyone in any way because I understand that there are people in worse situations than me and I get that these things that are happening don't necessarily mean I have depression, I'd just like others advice maybe an idea to think about anything to help would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR
I've been feeling empty inside and I don't know what to do after being told to get over it.",17Nov2019,1
158,"Throwaway due to potentially info on my main account.

I've been at this job for almost a year. It's an office environment with a strict professional dress code since we regularly interact with high profile people in the local business and political community. I've been kind of work friends with this guy since I started here. 

This past Friday, he invited a few co-workers out for drinks to celebrate his birthday. I was the only one who showed up. He ended up getting a little intoxicated and mentioned something about his time in prison. This was a complete shock to me. He doesn't look or act like a criminal at all, just a normal white collar office worker.

Today, I did some research, and was able to find the case file. In 2002, when he would have been late teens / early 20s, he was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to six years in prison.  It appears to be gang related, some kind of dispute between two different gangs.

I have no idea what to do now. I don't know if I feel safe around him or not myself. Does he still have any gang ties? I also don't know if our bosses know and if I should inform them. We deal with a lot of sensitive information, including proprietary technical, financial, and strategic information of several clients, and I think it's a major business risk giving a criminal access to this. I also don't know how my company could not figure this out, as I was able to do so with some pretty basic research. You'd think they'd do some due diligence before hiring the guy. Like I mentioned previously, I'm kind of work friends with this guy, and he seems totally normal and a good employee. Is that all just an act?",17Nov2019,1

I had my suspicion that my roommate took something from me, but I couldn’t prove it so I waited until she left to snoop in her bag to see if she had it, it was something small and stupid when i think back on it (a lighter). 

She came back in and caught me and I froze. She laughed awkwardly and it just came out that “I was looking for a quarter, sorry. And you know I’m not like that, I wouldn’t steal from you.” 

She just laughed awkwardly, gave me a quarter and then left again. 

I’m shaking because I’m so scared, i hate confrontation which is why I didn’t ask her if she had it in the first place, and I don’t want this to be a big thing.

173,"First and foremost, I'm writing this on mobile, so formatting may be a bit weird.

Second, here's a bit of important context; I'm 14 and homeschooled. I met her at a summer camp this summer. She's 13 and homeschooled as well. Unfortunately, we don't get to hang out very often for a lot of (personal) reasons, but we DO have archery practice every tuesday. Even then, there's not really too much free time to talk. (I mean, it's not very easy/safe to try talking to people around you while you're trying to shoot a small target 20 yards away, and every round lasts about 5 minutes.)

Alright, the important part; She's told me she doesn't really find guys attractive. She's never outright said she's 100% absolutely positively for-sure gay, but she hasn't ever found any guys attractive but has found girls attractive.

My VERY gae best friend gave me some advice that she may be bi and just prefers females (and doesn't know that yet, ofc), but to be honest sexuality isn't my area of experience (considering I'm a cisgender straight white male ~~that has never faced a single hardship in my life~~).

She and I get along great. She's sort of like those ""quirky"" girls you'd see online, but she's not absolutely annoying (At least she doesn't say ""I'm A pOtAtO"" or some stupid shit like that). She's genuinely pretty funny, and (as cheezy at it sounds) her smile makes my heart skip a beat. She's pretty talented, too. Her archery skills are as good as, maybe even better than my own. She's a budding artist, like me. She's even a gamer, also like me. We like the same shows, a lot of the same games, the same music even. I don't think I've ever met a girl that shares as many interests with me as she does.

The worst part is I have absolutely no idea what to do. For now, I'm not doing anything and trying to let the friendship build up until I do know what to do. Subtlety is NOT one of my strong suits, along with wording, so I'm afraid if I ask the wrong questions she'll find out and I'll get shot down before I get an actual chance. I mean, hell, I'm turning to Reddit for this, I'm completely clueless here.

175,"I haven't really been able to get back to square one after a really bad break up almost three years ago now. It was the only girl I've actually dated and really fell for, only casual stuff and hookups before that. We dated for just over two years and were beginning to get very serious, and the break up was very sudden with little explanation. Found out later there was another dude at her work, and she ended up marrying him like a year after. Really, really, reeeealllly devastated me. I gained weight, got the big sad for a long time, and it threw me off track HARD with school.

I'm back at it, exercising regularly, losing weight and getting in shape, and back in school in a graduate program. I am pretty fucking lonely though. I haven't dated anyone since then. My personality is still there and I'll strike up conversations with girls I find attractive regularly and it generally feels well received, I was blessed with halfway decent genetics and am a bit of a charmer and good conversationalist. I cannot get over the hump for whatever reason. I always feel like if I pushed it into dropping them my number or asking for a date, I would come across as a creep, since it's generally girls from lectures, work and stuff. Example, and not to brag, but I met with a really attractive leasing agent today, and we ended up standing there talking for like thirty minutes after the apartment business was finished talking about stuff and she was doing the whole playing with her hair, lots of smiles and laughing, did the shoulder touch when I made a joke. Then my stupid brain goes ""well is that everything I need to sign then"" to which she replies yes and I go ""okay cool well thanks so much for all your help"" shake her hand and walk off. Same kind of situation with this girl I met at work, and with a co-worker, and with a girl I met at the gym. 

When I started dating my ex, and just before that when I was regularly going to bars and having casual hookups when I was like 21-22, tinder and online dating were fairly new so my online game is weak, and idk how to strengthen it.

Im 27 and in a graduate program setting myself up to be very successful in a high earning field, but I don't want to be lonely anymore and feel like I'm missing out on my prime dating years, but I can't fucking figure it out.",17Nov2019,1
176,"I just adopted two kittens and I love them already. But I'm also super anxious about them and close to second guessing my decision to adopt them. I'm just worried something will happen to them while I'm not home or sleeping. Like they'll get out somehow even though the door is locked and cannot be opened, or they'll swallow something and choke, or they'll get lost in the house, just anything bad and they'll die. And then I'll have to tell their foster mom something horrible happened and my friends too. The worry is making me feel like this was a bad decision, even though this wasn't an impulsive decision (I started the process to adopt them in September) and I'm more than capable of caring for them. 

I know my fears are unrealistic. They won't even be alone ever because my grandfather is home all the time. Logically, I know they can't get through a locked door. I know they probably won't choke on anything. I know they won't get lost somewhere in the house. I know they won't randomly die if I leave them alone while I go to work. But the fear is still there. I just can't stop thinking that if I'm not physically present something bad can and will happen. 

This worry isn't limited to my pets. I also have bad worries about things like my alarm clock not going off and getting fired from my job, having a blanket too close to a plug and the house burning down, etc. Just things that technically can happen, but most likely won't. But ny issue with worrying is most obvious to me regarding my pets. Like I have the same worries with my family's cat and him getting out. When I'm at their house, I often would check the doors multiple times just to make sure they were locked and he couldn't get out. Probably will start doing that again if I'm honest.",17Nov2019,1

The main problem is that she's constantly pushing what she thinks onto me. As a recovered self harmer and someone who is attempting to recover from an eating disorder, hearing her talk the way she does is... Aggravating? 
She always brings up not eating and when I tell her to eat she yells at me or says something like ""No that's bad. Can't do that. Food is gross."".
Whenever something bad happens she immediately starts doing the worse thing possible and she never lets me help her.
She constantly brings up problems like she wants help then refuses it with ""but...I don't wanna"".
She's excruciatingly clingy to anyone that gives her attention, and when they don't she hates them.

She says that she wants to get better but refuses any kind of help. She won't take any medications, won't see any therapists, and bottles up her problems. It's like dealing with a toddler half of the time. 

I'm trying to keep my cool with it. It's maddening and I can't help but get angry at her when it goes on. I started ignoring it and even throwing it back but she just gets worse with it. I feel like the more I try the worse she gets- like I'm enabling her.

This is a major I know I can use to support many across the world, making life a little safer, accessible, convenient, and efficient.

So I've embarked on the path of learning code. I've spent the last month going through Youtube videos teaching myself Python, jotting down notes, and trying everything myself via PyCharm. I'm also going to websites every now and again to practice some drills on the lessons I've learned. I know about functions, if statements, for loops, while loops, return statements, modules, pips, classes and the works. But big G God knows I don't know how to apply them, think on my feet, or write my own application.

186,"I'm a guy in his mid thirties. I'm university educated. No wife, no kids, no girlfriend. I've always been an introvert and sorta shy. No debt. Tons of saved money in the bank. 

After I graduated from university I moved back to home to work in the family retail / fast food business. My dad started the business and he's elderly. Since I graduated from University I've worked full time in the family business. 

It's the kinda business where an owner or a boss always has to be there. You can't afford to hire a manager. We are also seasonal. Half the year it's crazy busy and the other half it's quiet. We're busy nights and weekends. I work opposite of a normal work week. My off days are weekdays. I usually start work around noon. During our busy season I won't be leaving till early in the morning. 

I think the main reason why I'm burned out is because it doesn't fit my personality. I've always been a shy introvert. This business requires you to be the opposite. I have to put on a persona when I'm at work. I also don't like bullshit, drama, and chaos. There is non stop bullshit, chaos, and drama during our busy season. Every single day there seems to be some stupid shit to deal with. Work just mentally drains me. I do nothing on my days off. I need to decompress and be alone. I literally have no friends and no social life.

The other bad part is my schedule wreaks havoc on my sleep and diet. When I was in school and had a normal Monday to Friday 9 to 5 schedule I had no issues sleeping or eating. Since I've been out of college for over a decade I have horrible issues sleeping. I rarely get a good nights sleep and I rarely wake up feeling good. I don't really eat meals and I'll just go almost a day without eating. My diet is horrible. I eat crappy food.

I need to work out to feel normal. It really helps my mental health. I've been a long distance runner since I went to college. I literally have to run at least five miles a day in order to feel good and sleep normally. Due to crazy long hours half the year I just cannot run. The other half of the year I'm working out nearly two hours a day. 

So I just became an owner of the business. In the last couple of years I've been contemplating just walking away. I can't deal with this lifestyle anymore. I'm tired of being exhausted, not having friends, and no social life. 

I come to work every day pissed off. I have no more tolerance for bullshit. I actually try my best to avoid dealing with customers because they are the source for a lot of it. I'm pretty certain I'm no longer the friendly guy I was years ago. 

A big thing that aggravates me is customer comments. Not a single one of my customers seems to be able to come in pick up a product or place an order, pay, and leave. They are either telling me their whole life, or some stupid story, or trying to have a conversation with me, or have some stupid fucking complaint or request. I know part of my job is being friendly and mingling with customers, entertaining them, and having conversations with them but I'm just over it. I don't want to do it anymore.

So, my problem recently is that things never seem to go my way. I am an introverted, socially awkward person, but I do have a few good friends, especially one, a very great friend with whom I have a healthy relationship, since he not only accepts me the way I am, but he truly gets me, and helps me come out of my shell. Outside of him, though, I struggle A LOT to make other male friendships. I have many acquaintances that I've met through him, but can't really get past that level. I am quite different from other guys. I couldn't care less about sports, am very calm, not eager to get into fights and not eager to fuck anything that moves either.

We both like to party a lot (but do hang out outside of party settings, at seasons almost daily). In fact, we used to hit the clubs (or better said, the same club) almost every weekend. In the beginning, it was just the two of us, as we got to know each other, and we had tons of fun. As time passed, he started introducing me to his other friends, and I liked them a lot, as they seemed very cool guys. At this point I need to explain that he is the polar opposite of me, an extremely outgoing and social person that makes friends almost wherever he goes. I started asking him if we could go out with them more often. He said OK, but didn't really make an effort to include them in our future plans. For a long time I was OK with that, as we truly only needed each other to have a great time, and I'd say we still do to this day, and also, we did meet by chance many times with the rest of the guys, or he would call me to hang out with them once in a while, mostly outside of party settings. But as I started hearing the anecdotes they share, I started getting a bit jealous of the kind of fun they have as a group. As I mentioned earlier, I struggle a lot, and I mean A LOT to connect with other guys, and as a result I pretty much never had a group of friends. I spent the better part of my 20s isolated, and only started improving socially about 3 years ago or so. 

So, the thing that bothers me, is that I want a lot for hanging out more with his other friends to happen, but things never seemed to pan out as I planned. When I have the time, money and energy to go out, he is either without money (he struggles a bit financially, and I try to help him within reason), or we go out, but we end up being just the two of us staring at each other's faces, and going to the same place. When I, for some reason, don't have the money, time or energy and as a result can't go out with him, it turns out that he ended up meeting with the rest of the crew, or going to very cool places that, for some reason, we can't really go when it's us two. He does try sometimes to recreate the same fun, like for example, he takes me to the same place he went earlier, but his other friends can't make it. Or, they do come, but for some reason I have to leave early. This happened in my birthday, which was six weeks ago. I desperately tried to make it happen again, as I regretted a lot missing the chance to party till sun comes up without restrictions (I still live with my parents and they do put some restrictions, but tend to be lenient on my birthday). Due to several circumstances, all of them absolutely outside of my control, including falling sick with chickenpox for two weeks, it's been six weeks, the longest ever, without being able to go out. He wasn't able either due to lack of money, so we eagerly made plans for today. But due to an argument in my house,  again, I wasn't able. Turns out, today his brother is joining the party (I also get along with him a lot, but he rarely goes out), and they are going to a very nice club for a birthday. While I can almost bet that, if I'm finally able to break the spell next weekend, it will be just us two, in the same club.

I know this is a really trivial issue, but I can't help bothering about it. I brought it up with him, and his response was that I should take it easy, that the nicer clubs will always be there, and there will always be people to meet (which is true, due to his great personality we end up meeting up people, sometimes even strangers), and that in short, fun will never stop. I know in my mind that is true, but can't help feeling that it's just too easy for someone like him to say that, when he's not on my shoes. He also told me that he will get back on his feet, and reassured me that ""the good times will come back"", but his financial situation doesn't seem to improve, although I am certain he does try, but luck hasn't been on his side. He being him, there's always someone to bail him, so going out without money has never been a problem for him. **I must stress that, barring this issue, our relationship is overall pretty healthy.**

If you made it till there, thank you very much for reading and I will really appreciate your advice, don't hesitate to page me if you ever need advice yourself.

TLDR.- When I can go out, nothing pans out as planned and when I can't I end up missing up on a lot of fun, which I try to recreate later but fail to. Sorry, it's that trivial.",17Nov2019,1
188,"Hello. I am Jamie. I am sorry for the long post. I would really appreciate your help.

My boyfriend is 9 years older than me. He was my older brother's friend. I met him when I was 12. He was 21 at that time and he had a girlfriend. He was a very nice guy. The most sweet kind-hearted man. I've been in love with him since I was small even though naturally he didn't feel that same affection considering my age.  3 years after I met him, his girlfriend who also was his high school sweetheart and very compatible with him was forced to move away to another country with her family. This devasted him as he was planning to marry her. He was very depressed, suicidal and he started hanging  around the wrong types of people.  Gangs, alcohol, innapropriate women that were invited in his appartment by roomates etc.

When I was 17, we started hanging out and we were both drawing, working on literature and we were creating stories together. We are both artists and he taught me how to play basketball properly. He was feeling better around me because I was very positive. Some old bad habbits were cut short. When I was 20 me and him started dating. I was madly in love with him (and I still am). We were doing everything together. Movies, art, restaurants... But.... I am not like his ex. His ex was a very calm girl. She wasn't speaking much. I am a big talker. But also, my personality is different. For years, I was having difficulties when I was in school. I was being picked on (I don't want to say ""bullied"" since this word is taken out of context nowadays) so it takes longer for me to open up and feel comfortable with speaking about myself, my issues, my life etc to someone. 

At first he didn't seem to have an issue, but later on (about a year into my relationship) he started saying that I haven't been completely honest with him.  I tried to explain to him that it takes time for me to open up. We were having fun moments, but then the arguments came. Me and him started arguing over everything. He was upset about the fact that some male school friends from the past were sending me hearts on my photos on Facebook and the fact that they were making jokes (that's before we got together). He claimed that I never mentioned them and that I was being dishonest. I told him that those were some great friends from High school. I was a tomboy so the majority of my friends were boys. He didn't like that. Comments like those were triggering arguments. I started deleting some of the comments from my facebook page  to prevent unreasonable arguments and he saw it as me trying to hide something. I was being logical asking him why would I leave anything innapropriate on my facebook page for years and he said that he believed that I was trying to show that I am not like other girls and that I try too hard to look unique and innocent in his eyes.

I no longer have any type of male friends. I feel more comfortable around girlfriends. Things seemed to be getting a little better. The fun was back. On our 4th year of our relationship, we made love for the first time. It was the best moment of my life. I wanted to marry this man and bare him kids. He wanted a family as well.  

Unfortunately, some friends of his from the past that were supportive of him on his bad times were a very bad influence in his life. 4 of them were decent, but the rest...not so much. Most of them were obviously women. They were all forthcoming about what they wanted they were known to be callling people out. They obviously never knew me personally (they have only seen me and I have seen them), but he was talking about me to them. These people were telling him that something is off. That there's no way a person to be ""that"" perfect. They were saying that deep down all women are sl\*ts and they know it first han because they are women themselves. They were telling him disgusting things like ""Do you know when the Pedo Bear myth came from? It's because toddlers were using their teddybears so that they would rub them against their private area becasue young females can be very horny"". As a result, this made him not to want to look at photos of child me holding teddybears anymore. When he told me what they told him, I got very offended and I started demanding from him to tell them that they should come to my face and say those things. This obviously never happened. These people kept texting him to hang out, watch a movie etc. It's fair to say that these girls look like super models. They have very beautiful bodies. I am plumpy and my figure is not all that impressive. He was always telling me that to him I am a goddess. He neevr made me feel insecure about my appearence.

Anyway, everytime there was an argument he was venting to them. Telling them about my business and what happened. As a result, they were talking very ill of me and they were having disgusting assumptions. I have told him not to speak to these people about our relationship. It's the least he can do since he doesn't cut them off for disrespecting me. He told me that he needs a thrid-party opinion. I said that I never tell our business to anybody else. That should be resolved between us. 

Finally, we are on the 6th year. These people are still in his life. In the meanwhile, I had met this super funny girl who was a co-worker and I couldn't help, but laugh with her jokes. She was helping my mood and she was a social butterfly. Always texting! I have introduced her to him before. Now.... Here's what happened..

Me and him were about to watch a movie, but my internet is slow and the movie took a bit longer to download on 4K. So, while we were sitting there doing nothing I recieved a text from my new friend and her message made me laugh. We were talking about memes etc. He turned to look at me and he saw me covering my mouth and he immediately got up and left. I was like ""What the..?"". The movie night was canceled. He wasn't picking up his phone. I don't know what happened. I found out the other day that he blocked me on Facebook and he had deleted me from Whatspp. I was heartbroken and devasted. I could not stop crying. I went to his apartment to demand for an explanation. He wasn't opening the door.

He ended up responding to my call during that night. I  asked him what happened. He said that he didn't know who I was texting and that I didn't let him know what I was doing. That I was wasting his time that he coud be spending with his friends. Of course, I AGREE that I should let him know who I texted and why I laughed out of respect because he was in my house about to spend time with me. I am not gonna lie, eveytime he brings up his friends, I get annoyed. He ended up saying ""I don't believe you. I don't believe a thing you are saying. You tried to cover your mouth"" I flipped out on him and I asked why he didn't believe me.... His ""friends"" had told him that I didn't say who texted me because I knew that it would bother him and that I was being dishonest. They were trying to paint me out to be this personwho works based on motive. I got angry and I said it was my friend from work! I even offered to share screenshots! He said ""You covered your mouth.... You were obviously try to hide that you were laughing. Lies these small can cause bigger issues in the future. Can can I be sure that you haven't sucked d\*ck? You selectively tell me what you want if it benefits you. I knew a girl once who was at a party and she had just finished giving a bj to somebody and she went back to her boyfriend and tried to cover her excitment the same way that you did.""

I SCREAMED on him on the phone, I cried and I started calling him a stupid moron. ""THESE GIRLS ARE TRYING TO BREAK US UP"" I yelled. He said that me blaming his friends (his support network) is the first thing a toxic partner/emotional manipulator does. He said that he didn't know me anymore. He said that that my zodiac sign are people pleasers and that I would do anything to keep this relationship going. Even lie to him or not give certain information.. He said that he's seen it all before. The same pattern happening to his friends from back then when he was in a bad state of mind. He said that he didn't want to be involved with me anymore. ""I have a feeling in my gut that I cannot ignore. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. And I know this because I had literal perfection before."" He talked about his ex......  
He then said ""I gotta go. My friends gave me only one hour to speak to you. I am not wasting anymore of my time or theirs. Goodbye."" burned some photos and trashed some others. How could he compare me with his ex??? I know that they broke up under unfortunate circumstances and that they were more compatible, but to call her ""Literal perfection""?? And his friends are controling for how long he should speak to me!?

He broke up with me.... over this. I never did anything wrong! I was always honest with him! I never looked at any other men! I stopped having male friends. And he STILL listened to these terrible people. I want to DIE. I shared my passions, my childhood, my life, my body, my soul with this person! And he DID THIS TO ME. I haven't stopped crying ever since. I've been having very bad suicdal thoughts. I know that I am not going to kill myself because I am rational. But I've been cutting myself a lot.... I can't function well. What should I do??? Can somebody please HELP ME! I tried all the obvious things! Talk to friends, do sports, do hobbies, taking sleep pills.... I can't stop thinking about him... Please help me...",17Nov2019,1

197,"My parents forced me to attend a university I didn’t want to go to. They claimed attending said college would create less financial strain. (Note: This is an out of state university. I did not get any scholarships to attend here. They claimed that living with my aunt, who lives near the university, would be less expensive than attending an in state university while living on campus. After I did the calculations, this is not true.) 

They sent me here with good intentions. I did not have any ‘life experiences’ in high school, and they simply wanted to make sure I was safe and could learn how to care for myself while still having the safety net that was my aunt if I ever did need help. 

I have been resentful toward them since. I have this place. I hate this university. I hate that my aunt is too controlling and forceful. (I couldn’t even choose what major I wanted, it was decided for me. I can’t even cook for myself without being questioned. I can’t stay out late unless I want to be interrogated the next morning. I don’t even have a key to the house, someone has to let me in!) Anyway, I hate it here.

This past semester, after returning from an internship where I had ultimate freedom, the feeling of suffocation and control has been amplified. Still, I tried to assert my own independence by trying to cook my own meals so that my aunt would not have to. Taking the bus, so my aunt didn’t have to drive me. Working to prove that I am capable of doing adult things. I have been trying to show them that I can be independent. Except my plan backfired.

From my aunt/parent’s point of view: Cooking for myself was selfish and disrespectful if I didn’t also cook for everyone else. I was only taking the bus because I wanted to avoid everyone. I didn’t give a shit about anyone because I was never home!

I was too tired to address these issues and have been letting these tensions fester for a long time. I’m suppose to respect my aunt for letting me stay in her house, but I don’t feel obliged to because I am literally forced to be there. I want to cook my own food because I don’t want my aunt to do that for me! My aunt always makes me late to my 8 AM so I have to take the bus or get points deducted from my lab grade since attendance is obviously important! Living here is too difficult, and even though I am going to talk with my aunt, I know she will not change.

Hes gay as hell and I think she views his slap as a girlfriend slapping her ass. Its also a place you work at inbetween jobs. Place is just a really weird shithole but also I kinda like working here. And everyone else does.

She showed up at the job and just started talking to me. She asked her friend about me, because I seemed like I dont like many people. She gets along with other people like that. She said she had a boyfriend. Months later, she told me he was physically and verbally abusive. I dont know if he really was or not. I never talked to him. Though, he showed up at our job. He told her ""I just want some pizza"" and she loudly, sarcastically joked ""Yeah, my boyfriend came to my job because he just wanted some pizza.."" 
I brought back some food from a restaurant for both of us, she handed me money for her meal infront of him. But, I could feel him staring at me the entire time. 

I mention this because within a month or so, she did a lot of things. I'll admit, I didnt really say much because shes pretty attractive. But I also found it really odd, more than hot. I kept wondering why is she doing this? She rubbed her breasts purposely on my arm. Pressed them onto my back and chest. It kinda started becoming a little common for a bit. She eventually stopped. She does it every once in a while though. I wouldve thought ""Well she has a boyfriend..?"" We hungout a few times, but have been hanging out more after they broke up. Never got a vibe from her other than just being friends. She also told me shes a virgin. But a few months later, casually mentioned she had a one night stand. She seemed to forget she told me that, because she told me one of our other coworkers doesnt believe her. I said I dont either, and brought up the one night stand she mentioned. All she said was ""Oh, shit."" And walked away. She also declared we're best friends the second or third shift we worked together.

Its gone from just meeting for dinner/lunch, to talking about being gym partners, going thrift shopping, and our dogs have met. Im not very interested in her that way, she is starting to become a good friend though. But cant see myself actually dating her. I just dont feel it.

Is this how it should work? I've had it explained to me but I just don't get it really... It seems to me that all flatmates should be paying into the shared account so we can share everything?

205,"Hello there, okay so

I'm heavily into fictional roleplay and creating characters and stories. i do this most of this with others in collaboration, usually focusing on one partner at a time. i've made some great things with others, and I love doing it. However, after a long time of low confidence and being isolated i stopped rping, until i decided to reach out to an old friend. we picked up again, and just like that i was inspired, creating again.

But, it's not been very long and i've had so many ups and downs with them in a short time. i really like them, and i find we vibe well on a lot of things. however, there are many things we simply just don't agree on, in and out of creating together.

I want it to work out because, we're around the same age and we both so easily get into our ideas. we can brainstorm for hours together. it's hard to find someone to write with like that...

I guess, my problem is that they don't seem to listen to my side, or my ideas in the end. i feel like, they can't be flexible. there are times when they shoot down my ideas just as fast as they take flight. it's really disappointing. They insist, also, on all unhappy/bad endings. which is fine, but it's putting me in a corner where i work on a character with a lot of depth and i get attached.. and then my friend decides that they should be killed off, as if they don't have any reason to be taken any further. or they end up an abused character. it's strange to explain, but they seem to focus a lot on abuse and toxicity where it's not necessary. things i honestly don't want to write about when I'm doing this as a fun hobby. and I've expressed that. a lot.

When I've recently expressed my feelings they only responded telling me what I ""need"" to or ""should"" change. it hurt that someone I've started to care a lot and have gotten closer to, I thought, wasn't comforting as a friend I was being honest with.

I try to embrace our differences but it builds up, where i'm uncomfortable with them putting most our creations in abusive relationships. I've tried to talk to them about it and it seems to go no where.. it turns into justification about why i shouldn't change anything or why it ""makes sense"". or how beautiful it is that they're in pain or broken.

All this is saying is that they want it their way or no way.

To top that, outside of rping, they are condescending to me in so many little ways, as if i'm a kid. I'm not sure if they realize they're doing it but it hurts as an adult trying to be an equal in a collaboration.

I feel like i'm crazy to be so bothered by this stuff so much, but i don't care to feel like i'm wasting my ideas and my time on this.

I'm not sure, if i should hold out hope for someone like this or if i should give up and move on. I don't want to give up, as i have a terrible time finding people to create and collab with. I just want to be happy with them, and we do have happy times. but then eventually i lapse back into my discomfort and unhappiness, as if my ideas and feelings are stupid or don't matter.",17Nov2019,1
206,"Tonight I got my summons for Federal Jury Duty. I am summoned to go in 2 weeks.

My issues with this: I (25) graduated from a big pre law college in my area (same district as where this will take place). I know 25 current law students, and probably most of the lawyers for the federal trials or at least their staff are alumni of my school. 

I also through friends of family know a lot of elected officials in my area along with the LT. Governor who is a friend of my ""cousin"" (grandma's best friend's son). So I would have been at parties socially with these lawyers.

I am still nervous about driving and never driven the city where this summons will take place. So this will pose as an issue.

I also just in October started a job and I know (although not major) there will be some issues over new employee taking off 2 weeks like that.

214,"So, for reference, I'm a college student almost done with my BA. English major. I consider myself a pretty above average looking dude, and if we get to talking a lot, I can normally tell if a girl is into me. Currently single, haven't been committed to a girl in a very very long time. 

  
I'm in an English class where one of my classmates (Who must have taken this class a while ago) is a writing assistant for our professor. She's around my age, I'm pretty sure. She's been overlooking and revising half of the class's first draft essays, myself included. She's really cute and insanely smart, and as of late I've kinda been getting a thing for her. 

  
I transferred to this university last year and we had a class together. We're both English majors in the teaching program at our school. I don't even know when I learned her name, all I know is I thought she was the most attractive girl in the classroom. Though since I didn't know her, I had no real desire to talk to her (didn't even know she was an English major, tbh). Until I gave a speech in class one day, and she went out of her way to tell me that I was a great public speaker. I was pleasantly surprised by her remark since she and I never said a word to each other before that.   
I definitely toyed with the idea of talking to her after that, but the class only met once a week and the professor canceled class constantly. Plus, I was really busy and involved with someone else at the time, so I didn't see it as anything I needed to pursue. 

This a little over a year ago. Next semester we had no classes together, and I barely ever saw her on campus. I pretty quickly forgot about her until finding out she was going to be reading over my work for one of my classes this semester. 

I remembered her pretty quickly when I found that out, but I doubted she remembered me. By the time we met for our first conference, it must have been over a year since we talked to each other. Though to my surprise, one of the first things she greets me with when I enter the room is ""I didn't know you were in this class."" I was sort of taken aback by the familiarity she expressed. Maybe I just have a shit memory, but if I went a year without talking to someone and a pretty long time without even seeing them, I'd probably forget about them. Or at least, feel no real desire to express familiarity. Unless, of course, I liked them to some degree. Platonically or otherwise. 

She was super cool during the conference. She gave my writing a lot of praise, and in areas she did criticized it in, it was always really helpful in expanding my thesis and clarifying points. I didn't go into that conference with any sort of feelings towards her, I had gotten one hour of sleep and was pretty hungover from a party I went to the night before. I still dressed presentably, but I wasn't exactly biting my nails over what she was gonna think of me. But I left that conference with her on my mind, and surprised that she seemed kinda happy to see me. 

Obviously, I was pleasantly surprised that not only did she remember me, but she also expressed it. And I think I had just totally forgot about how smart and attractive I thought she was until that conference, but ever since then, I haven't been able to get it off my mind. 

I'm meeting her again for our second paper next week. She already commented on two of my pre-writing assignments for this paper (which were marked by the other writing assistant when I submitted them for paper one) and the praise she gave me was almost personable, in a way. She made comments like ""Interesting points!"" ""I like that you included\_\_\_\_\_"" ""You incorporated evidence beautifully!"" ""Keep up the great work!"" and stuff like that. The last girl didn't do that, she was a lot more objective and distant with her statements, whilst also remaining a harsher critic (Should also state that I didn't try any harder on these two pre-writings than the last ones, since I assumed the same person was gonna comment on them all four times). It's definitely possible that this is just her approach to commenting on papers, and she could have very well done this for a variety of other pre-writings that weren't mind, but I'm not just gonna not notice it in contrast to the previous assignments. 

We haven't really seen each other since that last conference, just one time passing each other on campus, in which we both smiled at one another. It's a nice gesture, but I doubt that means anything. 

I guess what I mean to get at here is: should I try to invoke casual conversation in our next conference? See if I could find a way to get her number, ask her out to coffee, or anything like that? It seems weird, it's not like talking to a girl you just met at a bar. We're just meant to talk about my essay, and I don't know if she'd think it appropriate for me to try and hint at anything like that. I mean, all things considered, we still barely know each other. And every instance of her even potentially liking me could easily be written off as her just being a really nice person. To me, I have no solid indication one way or the other how she feels about me. 

Her rejecting me would also be kind of awkward since we'd still see each other on campus from time to time. I think that's why I tend to stay away from girls I go to school with, lol. But this time around, I can't get the idea out of my head that there's a chance she COULD like me, and that I'd really enjoy spending time with her.

Is it even worth the effort? Should I just go to the conference and see where it goes? Or try to go out of my way and bring something up, anything to imply that I'd like to get to know her? I'm stuck between wondering if I'm passing up an opportunity to get to know this really awesome girl, or if I'm just looking for things that aren't there. I'm a generally confident guy, but when it comes to this stuff, I tend to overthink, so any sort of advice on how I should go about this would be much appreciated!",17Nov2019,1
215,"I'm currently 23 and I am having trouble setting a proper career for myself. After graduating high school I took a 2 year hiatus before deciding to attend post-secondary ( I went to work for those 2 years) .  From that 2 year hiatus I decided to pursue engineering and at 20 I entered my first year. I did terrible, in my first year I only put half the effort so I only received D's and C's which lead to the university asking me to withdraw for a year. I decided not to petition this because I felt that I do need to improve myself. Again, I went back to work during my 1 year hiatus while trying to work on my flaws  and motivating myself to study. I felt progress, for a while I understood what my previous professors were trying to teach me. The math proving the theories had me day dreaming about all the devices that were made starting from the concepts. I was genuinely excited opening my textbooks. I had been working at a few places and studied on my free time. Work was never depressing for me, I worked as a line cook at a ""fancy"" restaurant. I couldn't wait to come back to study at the University and converse with my professors/TAs since I had questions from the textbooks that had me thinking. While this all happened, my father kept hounding at me for being behind all my high school classmates, how much of his money would go into me (food, hydro, not rent) and how much money I would be missing out on each year I wasn't working as an engineer. My father is man who believes that time is expensive and I agreed with it, it makes sense to me. It just made me depressed, this has been going on since I graduated high school (18) but it intensified when I told him the university asked me to withdraw for a year. I asked a few times that constantly reminding me didn't help motivate me but he insisted that if I'm going to live under him, I would follow his rules and his way of doing things. Then came family meetings, I am the oldest of my cousins so the adults/elders consider me as the ""leader"". Every family meeting I'd be ridiculed by the adults/elders for being behind my younger cousins who would be 2nd years by the time I returned to redo my 1st year. Maybe I'm just a little \*\*\*\*\* but this slowly drained my mental status, I started thinking that I'm just a waste of life and my father's money, every night I doubted my decision to be an engineer. I stopped studying as I would daydream if it's even worth to study. By the time I re-entered, I felt really saddened but I decided to finish my semester because I didn't want to waste anymore time. Fortunately my marks were good, I received A's and B's. I conversed with my professors and things felt like they were looking up. However I messed up 2 courses receiving F's as my final mark. Again the university has asked me to withdraw, but this time for 2 years and I petitioned this time because I feel I can continue my streak of A's and B's. They declined me petition, I haven't told my parents yet... I don't know what to do anymore, I currently work but the engineer route exists no longer for me. Should I wait 2 years? Should I just find a different career path?

tl:dr - I failed my first year at university, then asked to withdraw from the university. I returned to redo it and then failed again so I need guidance on what to do after failing again and receiving the 2nd withdrawal notif.",17Nov2019,1

I've learned to somewhat moderate these emotions, but I still feel like I'm not normal. I've been wanting to be normal my whole life. A desire to fit in has swept me over. Attempts to suppress these emotions by choosing to exclude myself in my preteen and early teen years only reinforced this notion in my head of my abnormality. Here I am, facing difficulty breaking down my self-inflected walls that prevent me from connecting with others. I erected these barriers to protect others from myself, from learning about my destructive emotions, from learning about myself. I consider myself to be a horrible person. I feel like I was born bad, and despite them only being feelings, they continue to torment me.

I'm looking for some meaning. I'm a senior in high school, aged 17, and I'm sinking academically. I feel like there's no future for me, like tomorrow is just some distant illusion. And maybe it is; I don't imagine the average hunter gatherer was thinking too much beyond his next meal. We cloud ourselves with our own terrorizing abstractions, lending power to them. I don't know what university to go to, what degree to pursue, what kind of life to seek. All I want to have in some greater meaning, and some happiness, but I recognize that it must be found within myself. Still, I need guidance. I've never had guidance, and my habitual rejection of help (to prevent intimacy with others) has only hurt me. I need help.

Hi, I’m 21 years old and recently graduated from university. I manged to get an entry-level job in the industry I wanted to work in straight after graduating and I’m already up for a promotion. I’m obviously really happy about this, especially seeing that quite a few of my peers haven’t been very successful landing jobs related to our university degree.

But a thing that sucks is I work really far away from my hometown where all my friends and family are, I don’t drive yet and traveling such a big distance on public transport is waaay too expensive. If I wanted to visit, I’d literally have just under a day to spend at home and then I’d have to travel back again, so going home on weekends just isn’t worth it.

I’ve always been a bit of an introvert, so being alone wasn’t too bad for me at first but it’s been three months now and it’s kind of starting to get to me. Where I’m living now is a pretty nice, quiet area but the downside to that is literally nothing happens, there’s no nightlife, events or anything like that so my weekends are pretty much spent sleeping for 12+ hours and watching Netflix. I mostly work night shifts at work too, so I’m not active during the day and I have no idea how to get some kind of a social circle. It’s getting to the point where I just ramble to myself when I’m alone and bored, which is making me a little dubious about where my mental health is going. 

(Also just a note, the industry I work in is pretty much non-existent around my hometown and surrounding areas, so it’s not like I can really quit my job and find a similar one back home).

The possibility of dying alone is looking preeetty likely to me at this point too which makes me sad, I won’t really get into relationships and stuff in this post but anxiety has really held me back in that regard.

I have a really bitter-sweet feeling about my life right now because I’m really happy about my current employment, but everything else in life is making me feel depressed. Does anyone have any advice on how I can start to sort myself out? I know I'm basically just venting and I'm probably just coming across as whiny, but I just feel so confused. Either way, it felt good to just type out how I feel so if that’s all I get out of posting this, that’s ok.

TL;DR: I’m living an extremely isolated life. There's nothing to do where I live, I have no friends or a relationship. Hometown where friends and family live is too far away for weekend visits. I pretty much just work and sleep. But I also love my job and don’t want to move. What do I do?",17Nov2019,1

229," **TLDR:** I am lucky to have good opportunities. I feel lazy, incompetent, and generally that I am wasting my potential. Need help building discipline and not wasting time.

**Hello**! I'm looking for advice and tips on life in general. I felt writing this out will be helpful for me and **I consider your advice and thoughts infinitely priceless**.

&gt;\*\*Disclaimer\*\**:* I am sorry if it sounds like I am whining complaining, or bragging.. I really hope not to come across like that. I am not deserving of anything I have gotten in life, but it is very hard to talk about these feelings with anyone in my life right now. I had a lot of good chance. I also have great friends, but it is difficult to discuss about such things since they know about the good fortune. They know I seem lazy, but believe I also work hard. Deep inside though, I know I do not work hard or work enough. And, I feel really incompetent and unfulfilling of my potential. I only seem to make it b/c of my ability to get by somehow. (thank God for everything but I need help to do more than the minimum)

So I'm really lazy and it sucks because of the opportunities that have been afforded to me. I can force myself to get through things, but in a way, that doesn't allow for me to fully challenge or nurture my growth. I want to learn more and be smarter, but I impede my growth with my lack of control. I am actually an overly optimistic person that thinks then can do more than they actually can in an hour... yet somehow I get by when the duck hits the fan.

*You can ignore this: Laziness tracked from younger age*

&gt;\-- A quick side example of my laziness at a young age: In 5th grade, I read 200 books in a year and was leading my school in AR points... breaking a school record... then lost my huge lead when I got complacent and finishing 2nd overall in my school. This is to show how my laziness had seeds from a very young age. I have the drive to do things when I find myself addicted to learning/doing something.  
At the end of the semester, my 5th grade teacher tells me: ""I am so sorry I didn't include you in beta club. I had no idea how great of a student you are based off of your initial impression. You deserved to be in it""  
\-- In high school, I would do things crazy last minute at got by. I ended up completing a rigorous academic program and still had crappy time management skills. A regret: I didn't preform great in chemistry which I found really interesting at the time b/c of my lack of initiative. It feels like I backed down from the challenge my HS teacher gave.. that required investing time into studying I might've done Chem in college otherwise.... anywhooo I still ended up getting into great colleges / full scholarships / solid SAT/ACT scores like 30+ (even this I should've properly studied for and wasn't focused enough to get perfect)

***Fast forward to today:***

&gt;**I am currently a 4th year college student** with no financial worries b/c of scholarship which is a blessing. I have an average GPA: 3.5, though this semester will tank it a bit... I am taking an extra semester to finish my double major - in CS and second major. Taking the extra semester feels fine to me, although I do feel like I wish I was graduating on a normal track. Anyways, I am bulldozing through difficult classes and have always been (most of which I found interesting). This semester I find myself doing what feels like the bare minimum to get by, yet again.

This semester I have 5 classes which is a lot (3 CS / 1 Math / 1 Upper level Social research class), but somehow, I can rely on last minute bursts of crazy productivity. It sucks that I can't manage to focus when I bring work to my dorm. I can totally listen to lectures with 90%+ attention most of the time and I get the concepts in class fairly quickly... but I barely try to keep up with material outside of class or work... and it bites me in the ass when I could be getting more As and I just end up with Bs. It sucks that I manage this and I feel like I'll never live up to my full potential or the full extent of growth my opportunities offer me. I also procrastinate for other classes to accommodate the assignments I have for other classes. If I was disciplined, I could easily be doing well in most of my classes. Like I don't carve out time to read things that interest me. Then when I have to pull really late nights to do work and read for an assignment - I find it really interesting lol. Honestly, maybe me getting a 100 on my first exam in college, when I didn't try hard... set me up for laziness and thinking of myself smarter than I actually am. People become smarter when they read, continue learning, nurture their curiosity, etc. Not just getting by on tests or answering questions in class... unfortunately even now, I can't say I can do that as easily or as well as I did freshman year.

Last summer, I got to work at arguably one of the best places to intern for my desired tech role that meshes my majors together. I realized that I can do good work at top places last summer, and excel, if I could get over my laziness and work hard. This isn't limited to academics, but even with music, my passion; I am kinda stuck in intermediate/mediocrity because I lack the discipline to practice or in my abilities in things that require practice such as Math (somehow I am taking really high level math and getting by okay...). During my summer job, I realized how bad I was at working efficiently and resorted to late nights to catch up on work. I ended up doing a solid job, but I honestly could've done better. It was my first job where I learned what it felt like to be at an 9 - 5 and being productive most of the time. The place really showed me how short life is and that I care about being more than mediocre at my passions/hobbies as well (music, etc).

Please help me. I am an only child and have no one to hold me accountable in my life .. my parents have tried to help me at a young age and I still managed to the minimum looking back. I wish I could ask them to help me through, but I think I need to grow up and not worry them with these feelings tbh. I honestly have always had an issue where I am interested in a lot of things, so much so that it is hard for me to focus on what I want to do:... (Vocals, Guitar, Piano, Language learning, Working out, etc.). Even getting to settle down with my major was hard since I could always see myself doing other things at the same time. Yet, I realize that is just me. Maybe the way I study in breadth, is what has allowed for me to take a diverse amount of courses. I like learning about things in breadth and I am feeling the need to build depth now.

**Anyhow, sorry this really stretched out.. I just needed to get this off my chest and need help.**

**Goals I have that I want and need to do**:

I suck at practicing consistently or applying things I learn into projects. Like I'll start something great and let it slip somehow out of my mind or routine. I seem to hold on to ideas and haven't taken the initiative on just running with them. I have started to get some parts of my life more consistent and hope to accomplish goals I have always had this year.

* Improve as a musician / finish small projects ( I've already begun practicing a more consistently)
* Do good CS side projects / apply the concepts more than minimum
* Regain momentum on losing weight.. I had lost 20 pounds .. gaining 10 right now
* Actually not leave everything for last moment
* End up with a decent semester GPA for this term (Ironically, I did solid in my hardest class and bombed the easiest test for a class I actually understand entirely)
* Learn skills I will use for my career after graduation outside of class since my career is tangential to default CS path (Analytics)
* Become competent and feel confident as a result of good work ethic
* Improve on my ability to work / Work hard

Stretch goals:

* Working on business ideas
* Get to intermediate Mandarin (I've actually taken Mandarin freshman year and really enjoyed it)
* Study for grad school - find and focus on a program I want to specialize in (taking gap year to actually work)

240,"Hi all, Im an 18 year old nursing student and currently live with my Mom and my stepdad. Recently, things have been getting pretty stressful for me. My mom has a history of mental illness but has been able to keep it under control. However, about 2 months ago things seem to have gotten worse (to me at least). 

The other night was the breaking point for me. I got out of work at about 10:35 PM Friday, and then texted my mom I was going to my friends house as he was having about 6 other of our friends over. Everything was fine until about 15 minutes later I got a call from my mom saying that I had to come home immediately. In the call, she sounded extremely out of breath, and she said that I have to ""drive save and stay calm"" and that she may have to go to the hospital. She said it was something with her heart. I was fairly annoyed considering I had just gotten to my friends house, and asked her why she didn't just call me either during or after work but she said it had just started. I then said okay and started driving to my moms house. As I was leaving, my best friend asking me if I think she's lying, to which I responded ""Yeah, probably"".

While driving, I called my sister (16 y/o), asking her if she knew what was going on, as she had been home for about 5 hours at this point. She sounded like she was almost asleep and said no. I then explained to her that our mom had called me and she may need to go to the hospital or urgent care. She then started to get extremely worried and stressed so I calmed her down over the phone saying Id be home any minute now. 

Once I got home, I went up to my mom and saw her on the bed with her heart to her chest, and I asked her what the hell is going on. She said that shed been having ""heart palpitations for the last 2 hours"" (contrary to what she said on the phone). She then said to me to stay with my sister while she went to the hospital and to not tell her shed be going to the hospital. I then told my mom I was going to drive my sister back to our dads house, so she could sleep there for the night/weekend.  I also told her that I had called her already, asking if she knew what was going on, and I believe she deserves to know what's going on, and not be left in the dark. My sister then came out crying, and started hugging my mom. My mom then yelled at me saying ""what is wrong with you"" and other comments like saying Im selfish and whatnot because she didn't want my sister knowing. My stepdad then came home from work, who was supposed to take her to the hospital according to what my mom told me. However, my stepdad didn't seem to know what was going on either. He came in, me and my sister stayed in her room for a couple of minutes and then went back in my sisters room. This has all happened in about 10 minutes.

About 10 minutes later, all is fine, my mom is perfectly fine, and after calming my sister down she was able to fall back asleep. At this point I was pissed, as she had just blatantly lied to me about this whole situation, and just caused stress for everyone. I then eventually went to my room, and then got a text from her saying ""Is your sister asleep now? Im not gonna go to the hospital. He \[stepdad\] hates hospitals and I will be there for so long"". To which I replied 'Yes she is asleep"".

After I told my friend (same one who asked if I thought she was lying) about the situation, he said he was gonna ask his mom if I could just stay with them, because he said this is ridiculous that I have to put up with her( my moms) stuff. I then responded no, you don't have to do that it isn't that bad, but thank you for the offer I really appreciate it. We hung out a couple of hours ago and brought up his offer to me again, saying I could stay with them rent free for however long I needed anytime. I again declined, but thanking him. We talked about the situation some more, and I then dropped him off and went home.

However this offer has me thinking if I should just leave my mom and go live somewhere else. I used to live with my dad through high school, but moved out because he recently had a newborn with his new wife, and they also bought a puppy around the same time. So I decided to leave because I felt I wouldn't be able to focus on school. However I am just debating going to live with him and his wife for the time being, until I can save up enough to buy my own place. And I can still live with my friend and his mom as well, but I don't want to spring that on them, even though they have agreed that they would do it with open arms.

So, should I stay with my mom or live with my dad or maybe even friend for the time being. Im leaving background details out, considering this is already a gigantic wall of text, but will be happy to provide them if asked for. Thank you for reading, I truly do appreciate it! I hope you have good morning/day/night!",17Nov2019,1

Anyway last shift, everything was fine again and she was there, I introduced myself and she just said ""yeah, I know who you are"" in a very condescending tone. Then she walked away.

249,"So after over a decade of not dating, my mum suddenly (very suddenly) found her groove. 
She was suddenly interested in dating again, and whilst I encouraged it. I also found it incredibly uncomfortable. 
Because hi, adult daughter still living with mum. 
It’s weird enough as it is without throwing sex noises into the mix. 

One evening she tells me she’s invited a family friends uncle over for sex. I kick up a stink telling her how uncomfortable that makes me simply because she’s never been known to be quiet in bed and also because I don’t know this man that she’s inviting into our home. 
He could be capable of anything. 
And whilst I want her to be happy, I won’t tolerate anything that will put my safety or my dogs safety and risk. Sounds ridiculous. But I don’t fuck with stranger danger. 

But she proceeds. He comes over. I don’t see him ever again. 
This happened a couple more times before she finally got the idea that it wasn’t appropriate to be inviting her one night stands to the house where we both lived. And she needed to respect me and my comfort as much as I did her. 
Whilst we’re both adults. I’m still her daughter. She’s still my mum. And there needs to be boundaries. 

Now, I’ll be the first to say that my mum has gone completely bat shit crazy with it. 
She’s sleeping with anything that gives her an ounce of attention. 

And whilst that’s fine. She’s an adult she can do as she pleases. 
I’m extremely worried for her safety. 

She isn’t waiting to get to know these people as much as possible. She’s talking to them for a day online and then going to their homes. 

Now, after not speaking to this family friends uncle for months. After having some sort of falling out with him. She randomly ran into him and they started talking again via an online dating site. 
They were supposed to meet up for casual sex on one day, but he messaged her and let her know he couldn’t on that day. So she offered to go over to his house that morning. 
He agreed. 
And whilst she went there for consensual, vaginal sex. 
It didn’t end up being consensual. Or vaginal. 
She filed a police report. He denied the allegations. Not much could be done. 
But that just reiterated my early arguments that it isn’t safe what she’s doing. And why I really really didn’t want her inviting strangers to the house. 
This man wasn’t a complete stranger. But he still raped her. 
So imagine what would happen if she ended up in the embrace of a complete psychopath. 
Now not only had something awful happened to her. But he also had our home address. 
That was the only reason she let me know about the rape and the charges. In case there were repercussions. 

Less than a month after the incident and she’s back at it again. 
Going to strangers houses once more. 
And I can’t seem to get it through to her that she needs to be careful. That what she’s doing is dangerous and next time it might not be rape, and instead she’ll be cut up into little pieces. 

I don’t want to lose my mum because she’s acting like a hormonal teenager with no self control or awareness. But I don’t know what else to do. 
I can’t stop her from doing these things. And at this point if I press it further I’d just sound like a broken record. 
Do you have any sort of advice? 
Is this just something I have to let happen and hope it doesn’t end badly?",17Nov2019,1

252,"Hey Reddit,

I'm gonna try to keep this as brief as possible. I've been with my husband for ten years. We both have good jobs that we went to school for. I am currently going to grad school while working. My husband is a relatively good partner. He is reliable, honest, very financially responsible, supports my hopes and dreams, etc.

However, because of how he grew up where his mom and dad never told him no and gave him everything he wanted and did everything for him, he is lazy and does the bare minimum in everything in life. He puts minimal effort into his job. He did just enough work to pass to get his degrees.

He applies the same amount of effort into things around the house. He does his laundry and shoves his clothes in the drawers without folding them. He leaves crumbs all over the counter after making food and it attracts bugs, he rinses dirty dishes with cold water and it embarasses me when company comes over and our dishes are filthy. He wants to start having kids after I finish school, but the amount of upkeep around the house would be insane. I am starting to resent him some days for walking through life like a careless slob. After going through his drawers to donate old clothes and refold everything for an hour, I nearly cried when I opened up his drawers a few weeks later and everything was shoved in there again.

What do I do about this? I have talked to him about helping me keep the house clean, but his idea of clean is not the same as my clean. I don't mind a house that looks lived in, but if my husband lived on his own it would be a health hazard. So what do I do? Continue to clean up after him? Continue to let him ""clean"" in his half ass way and lower my standards? What would you do?",17Nov2019,1

The difference in these 3, is when I try to go by my class and our schools discipline plan, I am met with very defensive parents. We have a 3 strike system. 1st strike is a warning, second strike is a parent contact, and 3rd is an office referral. None of these 3 have ever received office referrals, partly because their behavior has not quite warranted it, but also partly because I am walking on egg shells to avoid parent conflict. If I give one strike, my boss gets called or I have an angry parent at my door. They have told me to my face that they do not believe me, their child said they didn’t do it, and that I am lying. This is over things such as a student hitting another (not hearsay, things I have seen with my own eyes), screaming out in the middle of class, or just breaking school policy. They say I am racist and bullying their children. The thing is, these kids are not the worst in my class by far! I have 3-4 write ups a week and these kids have never gotten one. One of them actually has great behavior! Last week I called one of these parents to ask her to send a note to school because her son was absent (school policy) she said that she was too busy for that bull shit, hung up on me, and called me out on Facebook by name for being racist.

I am 25 years old and running away from a very toxic family environment (I am an adult, please understand that I feel this is justified - regardless of your views, I ask that you respect mine).

I am sneaking out of my parents’ home and flying from Bangladesh to Saudi Arabia. From there I will have a connecting flight to the USA (where most of my close friends are &amp; where I am also a citizen).

However, I purchased the tickets in my name using my father’s credit card. I’m worried that, once my parents discover what’s going on (my father is aware of the fact that I have these tickets) they may attempt to redirect my flight from - instead of SA to the USA - SA to back home. Is this a real possibility (approximately 20 hours will pass from the time I leave Bangladesh to the time I board my plane to the USA)? Even though I have booked everything myself using my name, albeit with my dad’s credit card (with his approval by the way - he had initially been on the fence about letting me go), will he be able to change my flight if he decides to? If so, what should I do?

He told her bf that he was just talking to her as friends and did not want any trouble. But the bf got jealous and came back with three guys and beat him.

Before I knew this friend of mine, he used to be a violent guy; he was a “You may kill me but you will never insult me” kind of guy. But over the years in HS together, he became more compassionate and rational. Now he is going to avenge the guy who beat him up although his mom pressed charged on the guys who beat him up. I am afraid that he will hurt himself even more since he is wearing a splint. He is a musician and needs his fingers to play the piano. Now he must wait a month for his arms to heal and he still has a lot of work to do. 

Avenging may seem very important to him but I don’t want him to risk his future, and god forbid, his life for a stupid argument. I tried to calm him down so many times but he insists that he must seek vengeance.",17Nov2019,1
271,"I need help understanding this girl

*Bare with me im not good at writing stories, and im still learning English. And i need advice asap.*

I been friends with this girl for at least 2 and a half years. And we are both socially awkward, i had to literally go talk to her bc she was afraid i was annoyed by her(which I obviously wasnt bc she was my best friend). Last year was a strange year, i hardly ever talked to her irl bc we were in different classes, we still chatted online, talked about pretty much everything, I basically know everything about her(not in a creepy way) but as summer came in we hanged out more often. I started to fall in love with her, and thats when everything became more complicated. 


This year was strange, we were in the same class as her, i went and talked to her. And she rarely came back, but we still hanged out, but not that often. 
I wanted to tell her i liked her and loved her but I couldn’t because i dont want to ruin our friendship in the case i got rejected. 

On the other side, she has her friends and i have my group of friends. Im kind of friends with her friends but not totally to hang with them. But they always refer to me as her boyfriend, and grab her phone and send me love notes, “love poems” and hearts. And she always turns timid every time they say that. 
And i remember one time when we were in a birthday party that her friends arranged me with her so I would kiss her, which i didn’t accept bc it was very forced and i was timid. 
**But after all this she keeps ignoring me, and doesn’t go talk to me no matter how many times i told her we are friends. (This is the shit that throws me off), she seems to have a better friendship with the fuckboy of the class rather than me, to put things in perspective.**


I have more friends in school than her, and every time i mention a female friend she gets slightly annoyed. And i try to compensate this by trying to enjoy time together and talk about her life and mine. As it is very difficult to show love to her bc she is very timid and im know to be “the very funny guy who takes everything as a joke, who is also very dry when it comes to love”(description made by my ex girlfriend). 


I remember one time we came back from a party and we were a lil drunk and i lost my jacket which had my keys. And i didnt want to wake up my family. So i decided to ask her, while we were in the uber, if i could stay at her home for the night, which she replied yes. 
I was drunk and i wasnt thinking correctly, so I tried to make out with her, which turned out bad bc when i got out of the bathroom she already had fell asleep. I was very frustrated at the moment, but now i look back im glad that turned out bad. 

Now let get this straight, and explain why im so confused with this girl, which led to me asking reddit for advice. 
5 months ago i decided to change schools, but I didn’t told anyone. Until two months ago i told the news, well every friend came and asked why im going to change and all that. 
And then i told her over Instagram to let her know bc she was on a trip. She started crying, and sending me pics of her crying, which I anticipated so i decide to change topics and tell her im going to wait her at the airport. (During her trip it was wired, she used to talk to me everyday, but when she came home she didnt talk to me anymore)
Fast forward to the present, school year ends this Wednesday. And she started texting me, telling me she is going to miss me, i told her we are going to still hang out. 
And this was the moment that made me doubt. She told me she wanted to move to school next to it, and she literally asked her mother. 


Now this what i need to understand. 
Is she into me? it is very wired.
Any advice is going to be taken seriously, please dont make jokes about this post. 
I dont want to shot my shot now bc i dont want to look like a pussy, who waited till the last week to confess to her. 
What do i do?!?
Im out of ideas. 
I dont want to let her go,



 I really love her.",17Nov2019,1

274,"So I’ll try keep this short, I’m on mobile, and I appreciate any advice! 

I started a new job, at a charity 4 days ago, and I feel like I’ve been put in the middle of the ocean and I’m drowning! There is no one to teach me the job, the previous person did it for 20 years and retired (so she knew the role well and it was all her system). Since her retirement many months ago, they’ve had various temps filling the role, who are now all gone. Another lady has been showing me the ropes as best she can, but she knows little about it and actually has her own job to do. In the interview they said I was on salary, and would only be paid for 18.75 hrs p/w and they couldn’t pay more, but that I would sometimes have to stay over my finishing time unpaid - but only ever so often, when I have to fill in for a volunteer. I asked again how often this would be in the interview, and they said really not that much. 

So fast forward to my first 3 days, and I have had to fill in every day, working 2 hours, maybe more, for no pay this week, and I’ve had no time to actually acquaint myself with what the heck I’m meant to be doing.  

The work is piling up, I’m absolutely miserable, people keep asking me questions and I can’t answer them, or don’t know what they’re talking about. I have so many empty slots next week, and am aimlessly texting volunteers to find someone to fill them - if I cant get enough volunteers, house bound people miss their hot food for the day (which means I am under a HUGE amount of pressure).  

I ended up texting someone who had actually passed away, and received a text back on the phone from a family member who wasn’t impressed I had text to confirm a shift when they had specifically told us they had died (this info was no where to be found and they were still on the roster and contact list with no notes). I also notice people asking me about a xmas party, that I’m supposedly organizing?! But no one has said anything about it, I’m meant to be getting people paid for their petrol and simply have no clue what to even do....

....I’ve basically been crying every night, i can’t sleep, I am DREADING going back in tomorrow, my stomach is in knots! I know I have to talk to my manager, but I feel like I want to quit, as there’s no way this can all be fixed and the helpful coworker (who’s been here 8 weeks!) said they swindled 2 free days work out of her for their own payroll error! And she said there’s lots of management issues.  I will be broke, which sucks, I need the job, but I am scared this job will break my mental health completely. 


The problem is, I have awful anxiety and feel like they’re going to think I am a time waster, or be angry with me, or blame me. My entire family have told me that I am 100% in the right to leave or ask for better conditions, but I feel SO sick about this situations and just want to run away. I hate letting people down!

276,"Okay reddit fam, I really need some feedback and advice for my life. This is about to be a super long post because I want to give as much detail as possible as objectively as possible without sounding like I’m just being a defeatist or a white knight or something. TLDR: is being consistently good in a relationship (agreeable, doing cute things, not getting into arguments) boring and therefore unattractive?

The last 5 people I’ve dated, and countless others that I’ve started “talking to” have either cheated on me or hit me with the “well there’s someone else and you’re fantastic and all but I want to go be with them instead” which practically just means “I’ve found someone better and I’m telling you rather cheating.” All 5 of these girls were wildly different personalities with amazingly different goals, habits, likes and dislikes. From white hippie chick to middle eastern scholarly girl to Cuban party girl to future doctor white girl to Spanish emo girl, they’re super different and definitely different enough for me to be the constant issue rather just “wow must just be the girls’ fault.” Each of the 5 follow the same pattern, some of them within weeks, some months, one for a year. We meet, date, hook up, and get serious. From there it always ends the same. Cheating or another person. What I don’t understand is like, I genuinely try so hard in these relationships. Whoever I’m with I want them to have the world, I do the cute shit like flowers or surprises and nice dates and fun things to go do and spend time together and - not even trying to sound like a fucking cocksucker here but - even have a pretty alright track record with taking care of business in bed. The only thing that I’ve noticed time and time again is I think it’s just simply boring for them. There’s no conflict, no chase to keep things good, things are just consistently good and I can’t help but feel like that’s just a relationship killer for me... and it really puts me in a dark place to think that because like I can’t change that? How could I ever be dating someone and not treat them like they’re the world when maybe some day far into the future I’d want to spend my life with them? Why would I deliberately treat someone less special to make them want to stay??? It just doesn’t make sense to me. 

And I’ve seen the other side too. Girls that I used to date / have remained friends with / knew platonically all along who get into these fucking disgustingly mentally abusive and manipulative relationships and they just can never leave the guys. Like one girl I used to date started dating this new dude who basically made her clean his house, listen to his mom as if it was her own (they’re 25 and 23), gas lights everything she says, tells her her anxiety isn’t real, says she’s too clingy but then begs her to be around, yells and screams at her, and leaves her alone when they’re out places / never takes her on actual dates... and whenever he’s confronted about his shittiness he hits her with “yeah I know I’m a bad boyfriend okay but I’m trying why can’t you be more appreciative” and bam she’s sucked right back in — like holy fuck... it’s so bad. But she like can’t even imagine leaving him. Another girl I know is with some dude who has cheated on her, hired a prostitute while with her, lied and been an asshole to her... he literally told me “I start a fight once a month to keep her interested, otherwise it’s too easy and she’d probably leave tbh” and when I asked “don’t you think that’s kind of shit” his response was simple “yeah but at the end of the day it’s just pussy haha”
— like why the fuck would you stay with that? Even more important, why does that work? But most importantly (and selfishly) it makes me so sad to think that I try to be the best significant other I could be and I’m traded for shit like that or I just get cheated on. Why is consistency so bad? Why don’t girls want someone who actually treats them like they’re the most important thing rather just someone they keep around? I know this probably sounds whiny and shit but I assure you this is not how I come across in real life or a question / TEDD talk that I’d ever consider uttering out loud... I just don’t know what else to test other than a bunch of people’s opinions. Does anyone - male or female - have similar experience? I’m in my 20s, steady work, nice car, really great cook I swear, and very capable of talking about thoughts and feelings or if something is wrong or abit off. I don’t think I’m hilarious but sometimes I’ll hit a good one liner. 

What on earth should I do so I don’t end up dying alone some day...?",17Nov2019,1
277,"I am 26 year old, working on **contract** as a Software Developer in a unicorn startup in India. Few days ago, I was offered a full time position there. I haven't yet accepted the offer.

The second one is not exactly an offer but ""kinda offer"". It is a leading media and streaming company which is just starting to build a tech team in India. I didn't interview for this, an ex colleague has joined as lead over there and he asked me if I would like to join, since he has a lead position, there would hardly be any tech interview as he has worked with me.

I had initially planned that after the contract is over, I will search for job opportunities overseas, may be in Europe or Canada.

Both of the offers pay really good, but I had planned a totally to go overseas and now these things mess up with my initial plan.

Also, I did some research and found that it is kinda difficult for a non European person to get a job in Europe. Also, there would be language barriers. Then Canada could be good alternative.  


I am really confused, finding a job overseas would require some efforts from my side and might take up to minimum 6 months, and still there would be no guarantee if I land up having one. If I decline these two offers, I would be losing a lot of money because they both pay good. I am in need of some advice.",17Nov2019,1

282,"So I’m in a relationship and we’ve been together for three years. 

Last night I went out dancing with one of my girlfriends and we got kinda tipsy or whatever. We were on the dance floor and all of a sudden I felt someone come up behind me and start dancing on me. I didn’t really know what to do as I felt awkward and didn’t want to be an asshole, so instead I let it continue for like 10 seconds and I pulled my girlfriend near me to dance with to show that I wasn’t really interested in the guy behind me. And obviously I didn’t really engage in any activity with the person who danced on me. 

I know this seems very small and pointless but here’s the thing: maybe I enjoyed being danced on? My partner knows that I have a flirty personality, and they know that there’s been times where I’ve been flirty with people at the club, as I would tell them as soon as I got home. And the guilt just really starts to get at me because I feel like I’m doing something horribly wrong. But then I also think, it’s just dancing! Being flirty is just in my personality and it doesn’t mean anything at the end of the day. If my partner was out and decided to dance with somebody and kept it at that, I don’t think I would mind tbh.

So I guess what I’m asking is, do I tell my partner about the little dance? Is it worth it? Because to me it’s not even a big enough deal to tell, but yet my guilty conscious is screaming at me. This tends to happen a lot whenever I feel my flirty side coming out when I’m out at a bar or something, but at the end of the day I just enjoy attention and interaction, and there’s a fine line between that and actually cheating.

This just makes me feel like a really shitty partner sometimes and I would like to hear some insight if y’all have any. Thanks.

He had her open the calculator from the lock screen.  He had her it clear twice (which I think is important to the trick).  He then had her type the number of someone she knows and cares about.  From there he had her it plus and the  pass code and then enter.  After a little bit of talking and fluff he had her click clear only once (again this seems important to em).  From there he did more fluff and asked questions, etc while he had her phone in his hand.  He gave her his phone to hold.  This was all fluff since I  knew he knew right away.

I'm RSA Dentistry 3rd year student
I was diagnosed with depression in April. Life was hell. I was depressed and contracted some very bad infections and mini strokes. I was in and out of hospital until July. I really hated my life and didn't see the point of going on and planned on killing myself at the end of our July holidays. (I'm South African and our school year is from Jan - Des with holidays every 3 months.)

Life took a turn and the night I planned on killing myself, I drank pills, booze and blood thinners. Took my scalpel and instead of just cutting myself I planned on making the final cut. But for some reason I slither of life come in and for just a second I had a bit of hope. I dropped the scalpel in the drain and decided to take life on no matter how shit I was. 

Fast forward to today. 

I've been having a great 4 months.Negative and suicidal thoughts have been few and far between. It's the first time I've been contemplating life without depression and meditation. 

But because I decided to kill myself I didn't study for my Uni tests and failed almost every test of my year subjects (of which I have 13! I study dentistry and it's hard as hell)
I currently have 4 supplementary exams and got alot of shit from my family/friends and lectures because of it and they want to know why I'm subbing and why I failed my year tests. I just can't bring myself to tell them I didn't study because I decided to kill myself.

I don't how to handel the situation further. The supplementary exams and fear of failing my year are causing alot of family/household problems. The pressure is starting to get to me and I fear slipping back into the darkness. 

What should I do? How can I handel the situation and people?

293,"Okay firstly I have never really had dreams but for the past few nights ive had a dream every night. This was the third night in a row that i had a dream and idk what to make of it.

Dream 1
The Trans Train (Firstly idk why but for some reason this is the title im getting.)

Essentially this dream starts off with a person giving birth in a dark room, it looks like the lady and the nurse are wearing Victorian style clothing, the mother seems distressed but i chalked it up to the birth.

Once the mother gives birth the nurse looks down and shakes her head, that is when these men came out about 3 or 4 of them. They were wearing what i can only describe as a brown trench coat and a potato sack mask but in the shape of the boarder lands character.

This is when it cuts to a train, the men get on the roof with the baby and this is when i notice a reverse traintrack? Like above the train, this is when i see boddies in the distance hanging by hooks.

That is when the dream cuts out and i wake up.

Dream 2 
Mirror monster 

This dream was so scary, it also happened around the same time period because everyone was wearing the same style of clothing, exept now everyone has mirrors strapped to themselves, like they are covered and they have so many different types like they have big ones small ones everything.

This is when it cuts to a rather large group of people with torches, the fire ones, running in the woods. This is when the leader shouts make sure your reflecters are clean, he cant see himself otherwise. 

This is when i somehow fall into a mirror and it looks like a freaking portal, i fall onto a hug pile of gold and the room im in is filled with doors, looks like gravity falls, and in the corner of the room i see this...creature. it looked like a mix between golum from LOTR and keyface. It was mental. 

This is when i wake up

I think the mirrors were so the monster didnt see himself?

Dream 3
Grandma

This was the one that really messed me up, I woke up an hour ago and i still cant comprehend it.

I was a resturaunt that i went regularly to as a child, but it was distorted somehow, it was like a mix between the restaurant and another shop called makro, my citys wallmart, then it cut to my grandpa and grandma, (grandpa dead for 11 years , grandma for 3) i kept repeating 2016 over and over then i woke up.

I just checked now, my grandma died in 2016...

298,"Hi. I am 16 and I am from Ukraine (which means sorry for my grammar). Aaaaaand I don't know if I am a boy or a girl. I mean, I think I know I am a lesbian. But how can I be sure? This is the problem. I don't know how this follow-your-heart thing works. I can only know something if there are some evidences for it. When I try to listen to my heart (which I think is completely ridiculous), I get confused and stuck in my doubts. It's like as soon as I get up on the ice I start shaking and panicking and, eventually, I fall again. I am so exhausted because of my overthinking and I can't go to a therapist, plus, I don't want to do it.

So, can anybody tell me how to trust my feelings despite their inconstancy and groundlessness? And, if you don't mind, tell me how it feels to be a guy.

299,"I’m currently in college in America and I live with two international students from China. 

This all started a few months ago when we moved in. To be extremely blunt, the first time they cooked in the apartment, the entire place smelled “chinese”. I understand this may sound rude but I really have no other way of describing it. Now I figured that since were just cooking something, the smell would go away when they were done. 

Flash forward three months and the apartment still has this smell at all times. It definitely is worse after they’ve cooked but it’s still there. I know I’m probably just really sensitive to smells and they think I have a smell too, but I honestly can’t stand it. It’s not even that the smell is disgusting or anything, it’s just strong. It is somehow even there after they make seemingly plain rice. In addition, I don’t even cook in the kitchen so all of their food is out at all times. 

What I want to know is what I can do to get rid of this smell? I’ve tried coffee grinds and those air freshener beads but neither work. Also, should I talk to them about putting away all of their ingredients after cooking? Also also, am I an asshole for thinking/saying this?",17Nov2019,1
300,"Hello once again reddit , this post isn’t about me but rather my mom . She’s in a bit of a pickle and needs some help on how to politely tell someone she’s not interested in their work .

So my parents want to get some landscaping work done for their garden and they’ve been looking at potential candidates . There’s a well known woman who’s pretty famous for her recognizable work , so naturally they approached her . This was in the early stages of everything and was , by no means a done deal , they were simply exploring their options . 

My mother arranged a little meeting with her and things went well . She explained how they were weighing their options but were interested and would like to see some more examples of her work . She didn’t respond until over a month later when my mother texted her again . During this month my parents had actually found another artist they were happy with that was cheaper and seemed very eager to work with them . Still nothing was settled . 
Now the first woman says she refuses to give them the examples as they have already settled on someone else and she does not want to waste her time on them . She starts playing victim and makes them beg for it . Finally they got their samples and they hated them to put it lightly. My mother can’t understand why her prices are so much higher up than others when the work is subpar , but she doesn’t wanna be rude . The landscaper is waiting for a response . She needs a way to say that she doesn’t like her work and reject her without sounding overly rude . 

Tl:dr what’s a good way to tell someone their work is overpriced and you’re not interested without being rude .",17Nov2019,1
301,"I'm currently taking fine arts major in painting in my 2nd college that I'm attending. I graduated high school back in 2015 and immediately got myself into this small art college--it's small because it's just one simple building. I was taking multimedia arts in animation back then. But then I stopped by the end of 2016 due to a few problems: financial, mental, found out I suck at technologies and even using computers and shit. My subjects PC related were all failed except the arts related. 

Basically I stopped until august this year, which I got myself into a huge university and finally got the course which I think would be easier for me. I know myself that it would take some huge adjusting considering I always get panic attacks everytime I'm in a place full of university students my age. I get intimidated since they wear uniforms and shit like that, and they also seem experienced with a lot of things--like they are all matured than me. 1st-around 3rd week of first semester I was doing okay. I manage to report successfully in front of one class and I did my homeworks. But then I started dropping my subjects one by one as I had a problem with one subject. I got intimidated with my classmates who seem smarter than me. Shit just got worse and worse as weeks passed by, my classes were around 8 and I ended up only attending 1-2 classes. But in the end even the art class I truly enjoyed I failed to attend to. 

The fucking culprit for this is my severe social anxiety. I already talked to the guidance counselor in the university and she gave me few advices. I'm also in therapy at the moment plus some meds. I decided to reach for help since my social anxiety was legit interfering with my daily life, it stopped me from doing things like simply going to class or even entering the campus. 

So I just ended up not attending to any of my class and plan to drop them all since my absences are already too much and there's no going back. My parents are split and both of them don't really have enough money to support me. 

Before I started going to college again I used to do art commissions and I got plenty of clients which made me earn a lot of money, but then I spent them all and it's gone by now. Now I am not sure what to do with my life at the moment. I'm surely working on myself to get rid of this social anxiety as I go to therapy and continued taking my meds. 

But unfortunately by the way, nothing has been credited when I enrolled in the university. I went back to 0, I went back to being a freshman. I was, I think, 2nd year college when I left my previous school. It's kind of tiring to think about it, not one single subject has been credited, I went back as a freshman now I have 4 years again so I could graduate. I also think I lost my passion with arts, I'm not sure. I'm just not that motivated anymore. 

Back when I was a kid I originally wanted to take veterinary, but then I'm stupid as fuck when it comes to science and besides, there aren't any universities near me that offers that course. 

Is college still worth it these days? Should I still continue if  my parents could still support me anyway? Or should I just find a job first, earn money, then support myself? I just don't know what kind of job will fit me or accept someone like me. 

TL:DR - Is college still worth the money these days? Or should I just find a job first then support myself when the time comes? If so, what job do you recommend to someone who has severe social anxiety, could draw, and probably likes animals?",17Nov2019,1

303,"tl;dr My bf and i have different values and priorities and it’s been messing with my mental health to where i feel i’ve become toxic, controlling or overbearing and i need advice on how to stop. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year and i’ve noticed a change in my behavior that’s really been stressing me out. My boyfriend is not really academically focused, and spends most of his time playing video games. He skips class a lot (we’re in college) and spends 99% of his time in his apartment. He used to be on academic probation and pulled himself out of it, but still missed a ton of quizzes, exams and assignments this year. He is, thankfully, passing everything rn with C’s. He eats out a lot and doesn’t really stay healthy, and had taken out loans to put for rent and stuff, and used a lot of it on random things like a new PC and video game. I’m someone who’s super focused on my career and my aspirations and classes, and I prioritize my grades and hard work over anything else. I still hang out with a steady friend group and socialize, so i’m not someone who spends the whole day studying. I just complete my homework and responsibilities before i do anything else because i don’t want to fall behind or fuck up my GPA because i forgot to submit an assignment or something. I work out when i can but maintain a healthy diet, and watch my spending as much as i can (admittedly, i am an impulsive shopper), My boyfriend feels he’s in a good spot in his life right now and doesn’t have anything to worry about, but i don’t see it that way. I’m so afraid he’s going to miss another exam or get a pre-mature heart attack with the amount of fast food and unhealthy snacks he eats in a week. In the past when he’s told me everything’s ok it’s turned out to not be ok, so i think that’s why i’m so anxious for him and sometimes controlling with the choices he makes. I’m so stressed out for him that it’s taking a toll on my mental health. He’s so incredibly intelligent and capable of so much more than where he’s at right now but doesn’t work towards it at all. Lately, I’ve become very overbearing by reminding him to do his homework or study/asking about how he’s doing in his classes, asking him to make healthier choices in food and to not spend on things he doesn’t need at the moment. I know i shouldn’t hold him up to any standards because he should be able to make his own choices, and i know the way i’ve been acting is completely unacceptable and unhealthy. he’s an adult and he can make his own choices, but it’s hard when the person you’re with has completely polar-opposite values and priorities than you. I’m not trying to control him in any way but i feel like it’s coming across that way now. i’m really scared that i’m turning into a toxic, overbearing girlfriend who can’t let her bf live his own life because she’s scared he’ll be on academic probation again or hurt his health to a point where he can’t recover. Am i becoming a toxic girlfriend? If i am, how do i stop this before it gets worse? i don’t want to hurt him because i love him so much, so please be honest with me being toxic or not because i want to change. thank you.",17Nov2019,1

308,"My father is abusive of my mother. He abuses her emotionally, physically, and sometimes sexually. My mother tried to leave him, but backed out because she's afraid and doesn't earn a lot of money. She's promised so many times now that she's working on leaving him, but she's made no effort, and always needs time to relax and recharge before she can even think about putting effort in. Not that she gets to relax because of my father.

My parents fight all the time, and it's really stressing me out. My father has also verbally abused me, too. My older brother joins in sometimes. My father also hurts our dog. I don't feel safe or loved at home most of the time. My family is completely broken apart and I feel minimal connection with any of them. I'm closest with my mother, but I don't feel comfortable talking to her about a lot of things. She's depressed and moody and that takes a toll on me, too. I can't turn to my extended family because they all live in a different country.

I'm too young (15) to be able to live on my own or with someone else, but I hate being at home. I try my hardest to spend as much time away as possible, but I can't always do that.

We never really have much food at my house, either. It's always just sandwiches and the occasional not-very-diverse homecooked meal. As a result, I'm anemic and need supplements, I'm very weak, and underweight. I'm also always sick. Also, my parents have spent little time teaching me and my brother to do important life things (cooking, driving, using tools, etc.) and I feel completely unprepared for life. My parents overprotect me and don't allow me to do anything myself or go anywhere by myself. I'm not even allowed to walk our dog beyond the parking lot of our apartment complex.

I've been to therapy (I stopped going for financial reasons) and was diagnosed with a panic disorder. I've also struggled with depression.

Based on information specific to my country and area of residence, I've concluded that it would be very possible for me, my brother, and my mother to get away from my father and live alone, but my mother hasn't taken any action, and shows no signs of being willing to do so, despite her promises, and has made it abundantly clear that she wants NO outside help from anyone (including police, therapists, etc.) She tried therapy for a bit, but quit. She and my brother would both be upset with me if I went against this and called CPS or the police (I'm not allowed to even talk to my school counsellors because they might intervene), but I don't want to live like this anymore.

I already help my mother emotionally and give her advice, but I can't convince her, however much I talk to her, to get help. What should I do?

TL;DR: My father's severely abusive of my mother and mildly of me too. I barely have anything to eat and am sick mentally and physically. I'm both neglected and overprotected. My mother refuses to get help. What do I do?",17Nov2019,1

I feel home in the more beautiful apartment. But I feel more uncomfortable due to the location of the apartment.
I grew up in forests and love peace and nature, which is way more present in the less attractive apartment.

So, my next option was YouTube. Okay don't cringe yet hear me out. I love technology and I love talking about technology, so I created a YouTube channel(""Preston's Thoughts"") where I just talk about technology news etc. And as of right now I only have 25 subs. Making review videos and just talking about technology makes me happy considering it still falls under the realm of marketing and advertising so I absolutely love doing it(although in high school I was put down for trying to start a YouTube channel by classmates so this is like my 3rd attempt at starting a channel). I have only been at it for about 2 months now, but it makes me wonder if I will ever even grow enough to make a living off of it. Maybe I'm being to hard on myself and expecting immediate results or for me to go viral or something idk. Something I absolutely love doing is photography it's like just so much fun to capture those precious moments life gives us that we can just look back on whenever we want to. I also make photography related videos on my channel as well, but yet again I run into the same problem, can I make a living out of this, how do I know I will actually be successful.

314,"So it’s my first semester of college and it’s been alright so far. About 2 weeks in, my roommate was friends with a girl I went to middle school with so I decided to hangout with them. After reconnecting, I met her 2 good friends she’s met up here too. We all became really good friends fast and we had our own little friend group. We usually just hangout and watched movies in my room. After a while, I started to become a lot closer with one of the girls. Every time we would watch a movie she would always lay on my bed with me. At first it was nothing, but out of the blue one night she started to cuddle with me. I already had a pretty big crush on her so I was pretty excited. Later that night when everyone was asleep, we made out for about 2 hours straight. Sex was definitely on the table, but personally, I don’t like hookups so I wanted to wait till I knew something would come out of it. The next day, we all went to a party. She danced on me and was kissing me the entire night. At the time, I truly thought that we were going to be dating soon and that this was something. We went back to my dorm room and we ended up having sex. Twice. The next day lead to more kissing and cuddling which made my feelings grow stronger and stronger for her. The next day, we were texting and I could tell she was a little off, so I asked her about it to see if there was anything I could do to help. Oh boy what I didn’t know what was about to happen lol. She pretty much told me that she doesn’t want a relationship right now in college and that she didn’t want to ruin our friend group because of it. It sucked to hear but it made sense. I mean yeah she could have said something before she lead me on HELLA. I was heartbroken and it really fucked me up. She felt horrible about it and almost drank herself into a coma about it. I couldn’t stand to see her in that much pain so we talked about it and I forgave her so she wouldn’t feel bad about it. We continued to be friends, but I still didn’t lose any feelings. After about maybe a week, she went and found a new guy. I really thought she felt bad about what she did to me, until she went and did the exact same thing with that guy. It’s now been about 2 months since we slept together, and these last 2 months have been filled with sadness and anger. It caused me so much pain to see her and Snapchat her everyday because I knew she was already with this other guy. I thought to myself at that time, “ok the only way to stop hurting from this is to cut her out of your life” and I tried it, I stopped snap chatting her and stopped hanging out with her. And maybe after like a day she texted one of my friends saying that I hate her because I don’t Snapchat or talk to her anymore. I don’t hate her, it’s the opposite of that, I just couldn’t deal with the pain anymore. But I couldn’t say that to her because everyone in the friend group thinks that I’ve moved on from her and they think I’m idiotic if I still like her. I want to tell her everything and tell her how I truly feel, but I’m just so scared that I’m going to lose all of my friends because of my feelings towards her. It happened to me in highschool and I would never want to have to go through that again. I can truly say I’m in love with this girl, and I just don’t know what I can do, I don’t want to have to keep dealing with this pain, but I also don’t want to lose her. What do I do?",17Nov2019,1

316,"Throwaway because I don’t want this traces back to me. Nobody knows about this besides me, my dad and the person involved. 

A little bit of backstory. 
I (17 M) go to church every weekend with my dad, and I have been for 2 years. I get along great with almost everybody there, despite being socially awkward, and at least once a month we will all get together to watch a movie, or have a BBQ or something like that. 

Now to the story. 
There was this one girl, around mid 20s, who I’ve never spoken to before, despite her being in the church at the same time I was there. So one day I decided to talk to her, let’s call her Abagail. At first, Abagail and I got along great, and we were only 2 conversations in. Now, keep in mind that I had no intention of dating her, I only wanted us to be friends. 

This is where I mess up. 
Fast Forward to the next church meeting, church ends and i am about to leave, when I see Abagail. My dad is already outside ready to leave, So I thought I would give her a quick hug and leave. Abigail was waking the opposite direction from me, so in a rush I just said, “Abagail”. She immediately turned around and said “oh, hey” with her hand extended out, ready to shake mine. I didn’t immediately see the hand, however, and by the time I did, it was too late, I was already in the action of hugging her. A little surprised, she retreated her and and gave me a light hug. Did I mention I was socially awkward? Well, my brain decided that this would be the perfect time for me to just freeze up and and have a mini panic attack. Which I did. Which made me forget everything I was going to say (which was mostly just a hi and goodbye, but still) So I just started slowly walking backwards towards the door, now visibly nervous. While i was doing this, I managed to sputter a “how are you?” To which she replied “good, you?” Now visibly uncomfortable. I was able to get a “good” in before walking out the door and into my dads car, which at that point I started to question every decision I made in my life that led me to that point. I literally could not stop thinking about that moment and how bad I messed up. 

Here’s where I mess up part II. 
Fast forward to the next church meeting, and for some reason unbeknownst to me, I thought that the best idea was to just not address it, and pretend like everything was normal. By approaching her after every church meeting. So after church, I just went up to her and greeted her, then left to talk to other people. I did this the next 2 church meetings, even going as far as to interrupt her talking to another friend just to greet her. Finally, I figured out that this was NOT helping, so I just avoided her altogether for about a month. Keep in mind my dad has no idea about any of this happening.

FF to about our last church meeting before our next BBQ meet up, and me and my dad just happened to be sitting next to Abagail. I thought that since it has been a while, I might as well try again and talk to her after the meeting. So after the meeting, my dad first greeted her, and then I did. And I was actually right. We just went straight into a conversation about my school, her work etc. then we said our byes and talked to other people. Did this actually work? Was this situation finally behind us now?

Nope. Far from it. FF to our BBQ meetup, and to make things short (I know this is getting long now) it wasn’t bad, me and Abagail were able to talk about pets and how she wanted a dog, but couldn’t find the space in her apartment for it. At this point I thought this entire situation was behind us, and we could start fresh.

Here’s where I mess up part III (the finale) 
I’m going to make this as short a possible. Our church had a soccer game in 2 weeks, which I attended. Abagail was also there, as well as some other mutual friends. I first talk to one of my other friends, which was a mutual friend of Abagail, for about 10 minutes. This soccer game was in a park, so everyone had foldable chairs (except for me, I just squatted in the ground) and there were 4 of us together. The friend I was talking to was on the left side, and Abagail was of the right side, with another friend in the middle. After I talked to my friend I went to talk to Abagail, which was more or less awkward. After 5 minutes of that I decided to play a little soccer. FF to the end of the game, and everyone was leaving. I went to say bye to my friends and Abagail, when I had the brilliant idea to ask if she wanted to watch a movie with me this month (I know, I know, I’m an idiot), to which she said she’d have to check her schedule, as work was really piling up on her (which was the truth) then my other friends (whom I also wanted to watch a movie with) said we could all go together, to which I happily agreed. FF to about 3 church meetings later, and movie time is closing in. I ask Abagail if work would allow her to watch it with us, and she says she’ll get back to me. I then see her talk to my dad a few minutes later. Thinking nothing of it, I confirm with my other friends that they can watch the movie with me. After we leave church I ask my dad what he and Abagail we’re talking about, and he asked if I invited her to watch a movie with me, to which I said yes, and some other friends were coming as well. He asked if I made it clear that my other friends were coming as well, to which I said yes (even though it was only her I originally invited, I did make it clear that my other friends were coming). He then said it was weird, because she made it sound as if I invited her by herself. (To make things clear, my dad only knew about me inviting her to the movies, not me hugging her)

That’s when it all clicked in my head. She thought I liked her. She never really forgot about the situation beforehand, but she was willing to let it slide. However, I was unknowingly giving her more “evidence” that I liked her. Which I didn’t. To make matters worse, she was married (although her husband doesn’t come to church). I then decided that I would just avoid her completely, to make sure I don’t accidentally make any more mistakes. I did this for 3 months straight. We still said hi whenever we walked by, but nothing beyond that.

FF to last week, we were in church and I had to sit next to Abagail again, as the seats were mostly full. I made sure to sit a few seats away, however. At the end of church, I thought I would try to actually talk to her this time, so we wouldn’t have this awkward tension around us. Well, I did, and when I tried to ask her about work she would just give the shortest responses possible, and she looked a bit uncomfortable. So I quickly ended the conversation.

This whole thing started this April, and it is coming close to the end of the year. I know I am going to have to clear things up with her, and explain everything, but I want to make sure
I do it correctly and don’t say anything wrong. If anything I just want to be able to leave this whole situation behind us, and maybe get another shot at being friends. So, Reddit, what should I do? What should I say to her and what do I do after I talk to her?

318,"My fiancé’s cousin accused him of sexually abusing her as a kid (he would have been 12, she would have been 6). We went to a family birthday party and her boyfriend was there.

My fiancé said “sorry id shake your hand but I’m sick” and he looked at him in the eyes and said “I didn’t want to shake your anyway” and my fiancé laughed, thinking he was joking, and the other guy responded with a sarcastic laugh and then stared him in the eyes as he walked away.

I’m going to therapy and on medication for major depressive disorder and anxiety and I have a massive fear of being taken advantage of or someone hunting me down and breaking into my house to hurt me so I don’t ever leave my house.

It goes against my entire ethical code to not believe her because I know what that’s like, but I also know that your mind can make you believe weird things in trauma. I grew up believing that it was someone else who had hurt me, until I started going to therapy where I realise that it wasn’t that person at all, it was someone else, and the other person was just there suffering the same abuse so my brain assumed it was him. I don’t fucking know. I’ve tried so hard to get the truth out of him and I always know when he’s lying but he doesn’t show any signs of lying. He says he doesn’t even have any memory of anything that could even remotely be taken that way and mentioned how they made their barbies kiss and maybe that was it. That night, my fiancé broke down because his family was excluding him from everything and there’s no way he can explain himself because no one will believe him no matter what. I’ve actually considered just giving up. I literally don’t see a point. I don’t want to live my whole life wondering if he did it or not. I’m so terrified that his cousins boyfriend is going to break into our house and hurt us. And I can’t even tell my dad or my brothers because of it all and how weird that would be. I’m absolutely fucking terrified and I’m honestly considering going to a mental hospital to get help and to feel safe but I hate how drastic that is. I hate this all. Things literally just fucking started getting better in my life. I stopped feeling suicidal and started my dream career and now I just want to lock myself in a room and never come out. Please, please help.",17Nov2019,1
319,"Alitalia and Ethiopian Airlines added a stop in another African country after selling me the ticket

Ethiopian air sold me a ticket from Geneva to Rome to Addis to Lilongwe, Malawi.  I bought the flight on the basis of duration and number of stops and price.

 Then they sent me a text saying the flight would leave Addis earlier but arrive an hour or so later.  That seemed odd so I started asking around and found out that they regularly stop in Lubumbashi in DRC.

I asked the agents in Geneva and Rome who could not see the stop on their systems.  Sure enough the plane landed, re-fueled and  off-loaded and on boarded passengers.  The delay caused my hotel to give up my room—I was forced to find another hotel.

When I wrote Ethiopian Air they said the fine print allows them to stop wherever they deem fit.

Turns out this is a regular stop for them and they regularly “bait and switch” customers with false advertising about this flight.

Who can I complain to so that other people are not similarly defrauded?  Is this something for IATA or any advice welcome!",17Nov2019,1

321,"Me (cancer) and my boyfriend (pisces) were dating for about 4 months. A couple days before we broke up we were talking about taking the next step in our relationship and all that. Me being clingy, I was with him every single day at school. We spent breaks together, whether it was with his friend or we went to have a picnic by the beach (we did this quite often) and we seemed to have mostly good moments together. One day after school I asked him to come over to his house and he agreed (I had been there 3 times before). On the way to his house he seemed irritable but when I asked him about it he dismissed it and told me it was fine. When I arrived at his house we sat on the couch in his room and that is when it started, complete silence. I tried to start conversation but he wouldn't. After 5 minutes of sitting together on the sofia he moved and sat on the bed, he was texting someone. Throughout our relationship he was always secretive about his phone and had a strange relationship with my female friend. I trusted him and didn't think anything of it. I asked him the simple question, ""who are you texting"". He said nobody and the silence continued. Since he didn't want to talk I texted him, literally a meter away from him. His only response to ALL of my texts were ""Nothing much, you?"". The text conversation went as follows: ""What are you doing?"" ""Nothing much, you?"". ""who are you texting?"" ""nothing much you?"". Do you want me to me here?"". Nothing much you?

It kept on like this for a while. Then he told me that his best friend had a text for me. I opened the text and it said ""(ex-name) wants to break up with you"". I closed my phone and looked him in the eyes. Then I got another text from his friend that simply said ""jk"".  At that moment I decided this was not gonna work and left. I didn't have anywhere to go, or anywhere to be, but I just left and started walking towards our school (around 15 minutes away from his house). Once I arrived I just sat there and thought about our relationship, although I wanted to believe the text from his friend really was a joke. Luckily, the girl that my ex had been texting lived right next to the school and saw me from her window. She came out and we were at the school and I told her what happened. Then my ex arrived on his bike. She, being a somewhat good friend confronted him.

He said his best friend (the one that had texted me earlier) told him to go to, and it turns out it was simply because he wanted to hang out with him and another friend (a friend who also lives close to the school). So he turned on his bike and went there. The girl who was texting my ex (I'll just call her D) forced me to go to this guys house since I was pretty good friends with him anyway and me and my boyfriend needed to talk. It was only awkward there so me and my ex's best friend (i'll call him A) decided to go back up to the school and hang out a little bit. Then I asked him about the text. 

This is when everything happened. He showed me his and my ex's chat conversation from so far back as 2 weeks after we got together. The texts were detailing things that I had told my bf out of trust, secrets, things he thought that was weird about me and that he wanted to break up with me. 2 weeks after we got together he wanted to break up with me. But he didn't, because he was scared. Our whole relationship had been a lie. I had fallen more in love and he was trying to break up with me day after day. I called him out of anger and frustration, I couldn't control myself so I called him a \*bad word for cat\* for keeping it a secret so long and told him that if he really wanted to break up, it was over.

5 days later he got together with D and never spoke to me again.

I sit behind him in english class and when scrolling through his pc images i saw a picture of me from my instagram page. D who was still my friend even though I resent her said he always talked about me and had a bunch of pictures of me on his phone too.

To be honest I really miss him, he was the best I ever had and I don't understand how everything happened. Was I too clingy? Was I bossy? Was I actually weird as he said? I just wish I could have known in time.",17Nov2019,1
322,"I have a girlfriend, we have been dating for about 6 months and I love her dearly but there is another person. If I were to chose between those two people, I wouldn't be able to make a decision, I love them both equally. I haven't brought this up to my current girlfriend or the second person.

323,"So when I was younger, my mother did not allow me to do anything I really wanted. I wasn't allowed to play computer games, play toys, or play games on the tablet. It was always practice the piano, do my work, practice the violin, read, school(my school was from 2pm-6pm),more work, read then bed. The only time I was allowed to do so was when we were out in public in front of her parents and siblings where she allows me to play, but other than that no. Hence to get my fill of entertainment I'd play games secretly when she was not home in the morning, often lying that I was had done the piano, and all other tasks when I was actually playing games in the morning. To be far, I did actually practice my instruments and did my school work; just that it was at the expense of my reading time. When I did get caught, I was beaten severely 
Hence, 6 years of constantly hiding and lying has trained my reflexes and muscle memory. While my mother has been more lax on my usage, I still have this reflex where I immediately stop using my phone and slap my phone down on the table and pretend to do work whenever she's here. The first few times she caught me, and in the past 2 years, she's been creeping up on me and it's getting annoying. 
Even when I'm doing nothing wrong, I'm just checking my school schedule, I'll put my phone down immediately when I see or hear her. Even if I've done all my work and I just want to watch one video, she'll sneak up to my room halfway through the video and I'll slap my phone down on my table. This just happens to me just now and it's starting to get old and I don't know how to avoid this.",17Nov2019,1

327,So my best friends younger sister (13). Texted me that she was drunk.  She's always looked up to me!  About  a month ago I ended up staying at said friends house and me and him ended up drinking.  I'm 20 so this is pretty normal!   But she's 13 and I'm worried that this is because she thinks its cool.  I know it's not all me but IV had significant influence on her before.

328,"A particular teacher from the school administration has taken a liking to me since last year and always frequents conversations with me during lunch. I never really noticed if he was like this with other students, but I'm sure that whenever he sees me he's always going to try to talk to me whether I'm in a group of friends or alone. I didn't really have any friends last year, so I thought that perhaps he just took pity on me and kept me company. I remember on one occasion that he offered for me to sit in the office with him so I could have his lunch. This year I've made progress, made friends, and became more sociable in general. I didn't sit alone since then but even now he tries to attempt small-talk with me. On a particular day I was having a rather bad day, so when he talked to me again I made the mistake to tell him that I'm having a bad day. He offered to, again, go and talk in the office, but I politely rejected and told him I'd be fine. Well, he pulled me out of my 4th period just because I said I was having a bad day, then made me talk about it. I eventually broke down and told him everything on my mind (big whoopsee), so now he's making me greet him every single time I see him. Even when months has passed since the incident, if he ever spots me he'll yell my name out and greet me as loud as possible. If I don't greet him back I'm given a lecture of how he's trying to make me better. To be honest, it makes me extremely anxious to see him to the point that I will avoid him by not getting lunch at all or taking shortcuts that I know will keep me away from him. I don't like how he's giving me special attention or seeing that greeting me all the time will make me any better. I've told my friend about this and even she says that he's a bit creepy (apparently also favors my friend). And it's not like I can do anything because he's part of the school administration. I'll have to see him until I graduate and if I ignore him he'll most likely approach me. If I tell him that I don't want to greet him, he'll probably pull me out of my class to go talk in his office about why. It stresses me so much. Yet I don't even know if I'm overthinking it, what if he's just being extra-friendly? I don't know what to do and I need advice. Last year of this bullshit and I'll be graduating...",17Nov2019,1
329," have never been a happy kiddo. Ever since becoming self-aware, I distanced myself from the group. Of course, that was not the best desicion, but I always kept in mind that ''if I just persist for a while, things get better at a later time(after high school I would go to uni, after uni I would move somewhere,...)"". But of course, that is a lie I have been telling myself for YEARS now.

Anyway, last year, I had the opportunity to come to Paris for an internship. As someone who is a huge fan of the Belle Epoque architecture, art and attitude, this was a dream come true. However, the internship was dreadful (I think it might have given me a bore-out) and the Paris I so loved, was dead. As I lived quite a bit from the center and had to go to work, I had practically no social life and if I had no boyfriend/family coming over, I visited things by myself. I even went to restaurants alone. As a 20 year old female. So sad.

Even though I was not happy, I didn't want to leave Paris. Because at home, there were not as many exciting things to see or to do. I found a study at a Parisian university that seemed interesting and would help me get away from the pharmaceutical sector I had become to despise.

Spoiler : it did not help at all. It is pharma all over again. I don't like the courses, I don't like the people in it (far too serious, as they don't have a degree yet), and yet, my whole life is waking up- school - study - sleep. I don't have time to do ANYTHING anymore, except studying subjects I already did. My relationship with my boyfriend has ended, so I find myself all alone in Paris now. I know I should meet other people, but I am not a good version of myself right now. I don't have any energy left to do ANYTHING. I don't want to be in Paris anymore, I don't want to go home either. I don't want to work in the pharmaceutical industry, but I don't want to study anymore either.

I really don't know how to get out of this mess anymore.",17Nov2019,1
330,"So i usually stay at my dads house on weekdays (Mon-Fri) and on the weekend i usually go over to my mums house, i have 5 siblings and three of them live in my mums house.  Two sisters (one is 29 the other is 19) and one 7 year old brother

Now on  to the story, so my grandma can’t walk probably so my mum got her a walker (zimmerframe thing), now my mum has a habit of finding things outside and re-using them (she washes and cleans them) now yesterday my Aunt (who lives with my grandma) sent me a text message asking if my mum had gotten the walker from the streets, in which i replied ‘im not sure, either way i thought my grandma knew’ my Aunt then replied saying that she told me grandma that she’s pretty sure she found it on the streets (which i thought she did) anyway my grandma decided to call my mum and tell her off for getting the walker from the streets, but it turns out that my mum didn’t find it on the streets. 

Anyway my short tempered 29 year old sister goes LIVID screaming saying that my grandma is a ‘c*nt’ and deserves to die’ she then went on bashing my aunt, who’s extremely nice to me’ and saying how ‘she’s an ugly perso’ and decided to bring up some very personal stuff about my aunt. She then asked me to send her the conversation i had between my aunt. Usually i’d send it to her but this time i said no. She then proceeded to yell at me and say that i’m a pussy for not backing up my mum, i’m which i replied ‘im not trying to make this a big deal and send round gossip’ She carried on yelling for the next hour, stating that if she saw my aunt she’d ‘fuck her up’ and all that. She’s always getting into problems with family members over the SMALLEST things, and she goes LIVID, screaming and shouting for the neighbours to hear.

In between fits of crying and pure fear, I have found nearly no solace. It's 4:46 AM (EST) as I write this, and she is sleeping. Safe, for now. They tested a tumor above her right (our left) ear. There's a tennis ball-sized mass under her ribs that I don't think anyone knows about yet, we only just discovered it Friday night. I can feel another small one lingering at the bottom of her belly, not attached to anything. 

I am heartbroken. I am terrified. I love her so much. No one seems to understand how I feel, not even my husband. My grandfather passed away in 2009 and it tore me up for a long, long time. Allie was born onto this world on March 24, 2010. We adopted her that August. Allie was my healing partner. My retribution. My purpose.

I just love the thought of having a pierced belly button with jewelry in - that's so hot in my opinion. I also like girls with a pierced navel. I mean, why can not guys have a navel piercing too? I would like to get a silver piercing jewelry on the top of my belly button. (picture in my profile) I also thought about getting a double belly button piercing 😄 As you can see, I love belly button piercings so much and that's why I want to get one. Now I'm wondering what girls think about that. Would you find a guy with a belly button piercing attractive If you see the piercing? Hot or not? Thanks for helping :)",17Nov2019,1
349,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post something like this but I have no idea what to do or who to turn to. My youngest brother is 10, and for the past year or so his behavior has changed significantly. He bursts out laughing in an evil way and/or screaming to himself, pretends to shoot people in movies or shows he is watching, and constantly brings up murdering people. He compares himself to a demon and always smiles when he explains why he thinks he is one. He also likes to think it would be easy for him to get away with murder. I have no idea where all of these thoughts came from or why he is so obsessed with them. I have tried discussing this with my mom numerous times but she always brushes it off. I feel like he should go to therapy because his past may be a contributor to his current behavior. He has a feminine personality and has expressed liking boys and my parents used to beat him or reprimand him for it.  I constantly went behind their backs to do damage control and let him know he should do what he wants as long as he is safe but it may not have been enough.parents also divorced when he was young and while he did not understand it much I believe that their behavior towards each other in front of him could also be a factor. I am just scared he will continue thinking and behaving this way and hurt himself or others. It is so strange because he is a normal child in every other way, but has these episodes where he ""becomes a demon"". What do I do?

My mother is recovering from an alcohol dependence stemming from our poor living situation a bit over a year ago, and my father blames the family’s issues on it. He has made her visit a psychologist and stop drinking during the week. She is a much more loving person now and has made a dramatic change for him and the family. 

I got home from the gym last night to see my father jerk his phone away from his head. I walked towards my room and as I was going up the stairs he resumed talking. Regrettably, I paused and listened. I heard bits and pieces of a sexual conversation, discussing fantasies and secrets etc. He ended the conversation by saying, “I have to go, I think I can here Canada2476 walking around, goodbye, I love you”.

I'm 179 cm tall and weigh around 103 kilos (so my BMI is 32 and I'm obese). I was at a clinic yesterday, all I did was interview patients and then give the info to my lecturer and since I'm studying cardiology this month I thought I'd my own bp (blood pressure) and hr (heart rate).

Yesterday I got a stethoscope of my own and put it on my heart and I notiec it was a little faster than it should be.

362,"I posted to a bunch of trans places and i encourage you to read through the comments there too if you want, i want nuanced opinions and maybe some good discussion. 

First off, i have gender dysphoria. I'm currently 14 months on hrt, and i stopped taking my estrogen like 3 weeks ago.

I'm not sure what's the right decision for me.

Transition has been only traumatic for me, people leaving me, people saying horrible things to my face, my own dad locked me in my room, beat me, shouted at me and tried to kill me, and i had to escape my own place. I'm currently almost homeless. I can't find a normal partner, men who are into me are chasers, women who would be into me don't exist. Potential employers will most likely not wanna promote me and my documents (which I cannot change soon) make it super hard to get a job in the first place. 

I also seem to pass currently with no effort but I don't see it and feel horrible every time i see my manly ass face or my huge shoulders. What's the point in passing if i don't see it? If i am convinced i don't pass, then my dysphoria remains, making my irl passing completely meaningless for me. 

Plus like having invasive surgeries and not being able to feel my face sounds horrible. 

At this point i wanna go back and only have to deal with dysphoria. I don't wanna be othered. I don't wanna be chased. I don't want people to secretly think I'm a freak. It was so much easier when i was a privileged male with bad dysphoria,than it is to be hated by everyone and have slightly less dysphoria.

Yesterday i was at work, short hair, not trying to hide my shoulders, with baggy clothes so you can't see my breasts, and had small talk wuth a random guy and he thought i was a cis female, and was surprised when i told him my legal name. It made me think if detransitioning is worth it, and i feel like I'll miss how I looked on hrt. But idk, i can't take the social ostracisation.

Any thoughts? I am nearly homeless and can't afford seeing a therapist.",17Nov2019,1

I am going to see some professional help soon (once its cleared with insurance) but could use some useful tips from you guys

We were together for a year before she had to move away for 4 months for family reasons. She moved back to her home town. We were making it work and things were going ok, not perfect but ok. I don't think any long distance relationship could be perfect.

George was the name of my partner at the time, I guess they were trying to trick me into thinking it was him?
One of them was also touching my friend who was just as drunk as I was. Luckily another friend interrupted before they could pull me away.

I'm not really sure what I should do? On the one hand they were definitely going to try to have force themselves on me if they pulled me away, and I was intoxicated and unable to consent. On the other hand the fact that they were stopped before they could and didn't actually makes it feel like it wasn't a crime?

I know this sounds weird - maybe even pretentious or ostentatious. But people at my work more or less think I'm a mindless NPC with no interests. They pay me no mind and act like I don't exist, unless they just have to acknowledge me for some reason. When they do it's never for any conversational purposes. 

I am shy and awkward in ways that make aspects of daily life strenuous. So starting up a conversation is near impossible for me to do. I just want to be seen as a person, you know?

I notice it when I come into my house, families’ houses, and come across people from my culture; and notice even other culture’s smells too. My family doesn’t seem to notice it though.

So basically my problem is, it seems to stick on everything and give it a strong, distinct smell; sometimes a bit too strong.[Has caused people(and even me recently) to chronically sneeze from it] I get paranoid and hang my clothes and bag out before going out now to get rid of the smell, and it makes it a real hassle.

I'm 5th year med student from Central Europe and my boyfriend is 6th year med student from Latin America. We would like to live together in the future but we have a problem with finding the right country to live and work in as medicine is very specific field (mainly because you need to know the language of the country perfectly).

I speak English B2, Spanish A2-B1, Russian A2; he speaks English B1, Spanish C2. We would like to settle somewhere in Europe, not necessarily EU, and in stable and prosperous country. Unfortunately it's not possible to live in my country as our language is Slavic and very difficult. Which leaves out other Slavic countries as it's very hard for Spaniard to learn them. But we're willing to learn other new/practice our languages. Also we won't have any specialisation by that time.

Is there anyone who has any idea or advice? I'm getting hopeless. Or is there any doctor who migrated abroad as a fresh graduate?

Thank you for any help!

P.S.: of course that we had Spain in our mind as a first option, but it looks like Spain is very unfriendly for freshly graduated doctors in general. To start working you need to pass MIR test that happens once a year; if you don't pass, you can't work for next one year and thanks to that you're not in touch with the latest medicine and practice. Funny enough, you have to have residency in Spain to apply for the test, meaning that in the meantime you can't practice in other country and make money. What's even more funny is that even if you're from EU, recognizing the title take 9-12 months, making it more than 2 years between your graduation and getting a job. Whoa. Or that's at least what I found on the internet. Is there someone from Spain who can prove me wrong? (Pretty please?)

We have one child together. When I met her, she had a daughter of her own. We were nineteen at the time and her daughter was one and a half. I worked hard at my fathers pawn shop to get out of my parents house. Eventually I landed a good job at a multi-million dollar jewelry store and moved to Phoenix, AZ from a small town. Things were good for two years then she decided to go work with her mother out of town at a construction company. We would see each other every other week, then one day she said she was pregnant. I was elated. We had a baby boy together, and things were great followed by a baby girl. As my son got older around three he began to develop traits that were nothing like mine. I went to CVS to get a DNA test kit and tested my son, it came back negative. I confronted my now ex-wife and she swore up and down he was mine. I believed her. I ended up leaving my job to pursue real estate. Things were slow and money was tight and I started to drink in excess and she ended up leaving me.

She said she needed space and then eventually moved out to her own apartment. She’s never paid a bill as long a we were together. Now she has all three of our kids and is sleeping with the guy that got her the job. I tried to make it work for the kids sake. It eats me up everyday that she left. I drink every night to ease the pain. I lost my family over low financial times and it’s painful to think about. I want to move on but I miss the family I had and I miss her.

390,"3 months ago, I made a mistake of sending out a meme (guy checking out girl while his GF is looking at him angrily) to our department distribution list. It was completely harmless at my end, and the only purpose was to add a bit of humor to the usual KPI updates we send frequently.

Well, someone found it offensive and reported to HR. HR gave me a ‘counseling memorandum’, told me to send an apology email and said that this won’t impact my future at the company. They also told me the memo has an impact period of about 3 months. None of this was in writing though. This was an in-person meeting between the Employee Relations manager, myself and my direct manager. However, the written copy of the memo I got clearly says that management has decided to take a lenient approach considering my spotless past.

However, now my direct manager has told me that as per instructions from HR, this is actually going to impact my year-end evaluation and my increment. I am beyond pissed. No one told me about this. This is not lenient, this is the worst thing to do other than firing me because it impacts my future at the company as well as impacts me financially.

My manager is going to do my evaluation in December, a full 5 months after the memo, whose impact was allegedly 3 months. I don’t know what to do here. What are my legal options? Legal would be the absolute last resort, but before that I want to present my case strongly to HR.

Make no mistake, I fully understand that I made a mistake sending out that meme. And if I was told about these consequences, I would have quit there and then rather than busting my ass for another 3.",17Nov2019,1

I also couldn't been seen with the girl as her family was there which I understand but I guess it kinda got me mad. Then out of nowhere I just basically broke and got a panic attack. I'm not a party person most of the people started smoking and drinking something I never done. Then I just got a panic attack I got really made and started crying as I felt scared.

Then I calmed down then left home afterwards but I feel that I messed up everything I have had with the girl I really like her.

I was speaking to someone for a while, we stopped speaking over an argument. We have blocked each other from social media and cut all contact.

He knows all of the drama that has occurred between us, and he is perfectly aware of me and his friend shaky history with eachother. 

My question is...am I being honey trapped here? He’s a nice enough guy to speak to but it seems too strange. Wouldn’t his friend know? Does he not care?

396,"TLDR: I am lucky to have good opportunities. I feel lazy, incompetent, and generally that I am wasting my potential. Need help building discipline and not wasting time.

Hello! I'm looking for advice and tips on life in general. I felt writing this out will be helpful for me and I consider your advice and thoughts infinitely priceless.

**Disclaimer**: I am sorry if it sounds like I am whining complaining, or bragging.. I really hope not to come across like that. I am not deserving of anything I have gotten in life, but it is very hard to talk about these feelings with anyone in my life right now. I had a lot of good chance. I also have great friends, but it is difficult to discuss about such things since they know about the good fortune. They know I seem lazy, but believe I also work hard. Deep inside though, I know I do not work hard or work enough. And, I feel really incompetent and unfulfilling of my potential. I only seem to make it b/c of my ability to get by somehow. (thank God for everything but I need help to do more than the minimum)

So I'm really lazy and it sucks because of the opportunities that have been afforded to me. I can force myself to get through things, but in a way, that doesn't allow for me to fully challenge or nurture my growth. I want to learn more and be smarter, but I impede my growth with my lack of control. I am actually an overly optimistic person that thinks then can do more than they actually can in an hour... yet somehow I get by when the duck hits the fan.

You can ignore this: Laziness tracked from younger age

-- A quick side example of my laziness at a young age: In 5th grade, I read 200 books in a year and was leading my school in AR points... breaking a school record... then lost my huge lead when I got complacent and finishing 2nd overall in my school. This is to show how my laziness had seeds from a very young age. I have the drive to do things when I find myself addicted to learning/doing something.
At the end of the semester, my 5th grade teacher tells me: ""I am so sorry I didn't include you in beta club. I had no idea how great of a student you are based off of your initial impression. You deserved to be in it""
-- In high school, I would do things crazy last minute at got by. I ended up completing a rigorous academic program and still had crappy time management skills. A regret: I didn't preform great in chemistry which I found really interesting at the time b/c of my lack of initiative. It feels like I backed down from the challenge my HS teacher gave.. that required investing time into studying I might've done Chem in college otherwise.... anywhooo I still ended up getting into great colleges / full scholarships / solid SAT/ACT scores like 30+ (even this I should've properly studied for and wasn't focused enough to get perfect)

Fast forward to today:

I am currently a 4th year college student with no financial worries b/c of scholarship which is a blessing. I have an average GPA: 3.5, though this semester will tank it a bit... I am taking an extra semester to finish my double major - in CS and second major. Taking the extra semester feels fine to me, although I do feel like I wish I was graduating on a normal track. Anyways, I am bulldozing through difficult classes and have always been (most of which I found interesting). This semester I find myself doing what feels like the bare minimum to get by, yet again.

This semester I have 5 classes which is a lot (3 CS / 1 Math / 1 Upper level Social research class), but somehow, I can rely on last minute bursts of crazy productivity. It sucks that I can't manage to focus when I bring work to my dorm. I can totally listen to lectures with 90%+ attention most of the time and I get the concepts in class fairly quickly... but I barely try to keep up with material outside of class or work... and it bites me in the ass when I could be getting more As and I just end up with Bs. It sucks that I manage this and I feel like I'll never live up to my full potential or the full extent of growth my opportunities offer me. I also procrastinate for other classes to accommodate the assignments I have for other classes. If I was disciplined, I could easily be doing well in most of my classes. Like I don't carve out time to read things that interest me. Then when I have to pull really late nights to do work and read for an assignment - I find it really interesting lol. Honestly, maybe me getting a 100 on my first exam in college, when I didn't try hard... set me up for laziness and thinking of myself smarter than I actually am. People become smarter when they read, continue learning, nurture their curiosity, etc. Not just getting by on tests or answering questions in class... unfortunately even now, I can't say I can do that as easily or as well as I did freshman year.

Last summer, I got to work at arguably one of the best places to intern for my desired tech role that meshes my majors together. I realized that I can do good work at top places last summer, and excel, if I could get over my laziness and work hard. This isn't limited to academics, but even with music, my passion; I am kinda stuck in intermediate/mediocrity because I lack the discipline to practice or in my abilities in things that require practice such as Math (somehow I am taking really high level math and getting by okay...). During my summer job, I realized how bad I was at working efficiently and resorted to late nights to catch up on work. I ended up doing a solid job, but I honestly could've done better. It was my first job where I learned what it felt like to be at an 9 - 5 and being productive most of the time. The place really showed me how short life is and that I care about being more than mediocre at my passions/hobbies as well (music, etc).

Please help me. I am an only child and have no one to hold me accountable in my life .. my parents have tried to help me at a young age and I still managed to the minimum looking back. I wish I could ask them to help me through, but I think I need to grow up and not worry them with these feelings tbh. I honestly have always had an issue where I am interested in a lot of things, so much so that it is hard for me to focus on what I want to do:... (Vocals, Guitar, Piano, Language learning, Working out, etc.). Even getting to settle down with my major was hard since I could always see myself doing other things at the same time. Yet, I realize that is just me. Maybe the way I study in breadth, is what has allowed for me to take a diverse amount of courses. I like learning about things in breadth and I am feeling the need to build depth now.

Anyhow, sorry this really stretched out.. I just needed to get this off my chest and need help.

Goals I have that I want and need to do:

I suck at practicing consistently or applying things I learn into projects. Like I'll start something great and let it slip somehow out of my mind or routine. I seem to hold on to ideas and haven't taken the initiative on just running with them. I have started to get some parts of my life more consistent and hope to accomplish goals I have always had this year.

Improve as a musician / finish small projects ( I've already begun practicing a more consistently)
Do good CS side projects / apply the concepts more than minimum
Regain momentum on losing weight.. I had lost 20 pounds .. gaining 10 right now
Actually not leave everything for last moment
End up with a decent semester GPA for this term (Ironically, I did solid in my hardest class and bombed the easiest test for a class I actually understand entirely)
Learn skills I will use for my career after graduation outside of class since my career is tangential to default CS path (Analytics)
Become competent and feel confident as a result of good work ethic
Improve on my ability to work / Work hard
Stretch goals:

Working on business ideas
Get to intermediate Mandarin (I've actually taken Mandarin freshman year and really enjoyed it)
Study for grad school - find and focus on a program I want to specialize in (taking gap year to actually work)

400,"I am a manager of a department in a large grocery chain and HR just hired me a young girl to work evening shifts.

Right out of the gate she has been a great learner and shows up on time and has been doing great post training on her own. But she has a lot of personal issues that she is very open about.

Last night she tried calling off work for the first time because her grandmother was having surgery. She did this mere minutes before her shift starts and she knows that she has to give at least two hours notice.

I talked to her on the phone after she texted me and she said she didn’t have to have the night off but she would be late by two hours. I told her no problem, we have the coverage until then and to give me more advanced notice in the future if you do run into these issues so that we can fill her shift.

Late last night, while I was sleeping, she texted me three times about her abusive ex boyfriend who caught her as she was coming home and he attacked her. Then she said “oops sorry wrong person”

I am not going to get involved in her personal life, but I think she is now on track to a steady stream of “if I make it look like there is a personal problem, I can have the day off”. I don’t want to jump to conclusion that this is all fake especially when abuse is involved, but I can’t have her all of a sudden calling off work every day.

How can I approach her about this? I want to more or less ask her if she wants to work here and just doesn’t want to work weekends or if she is actually having personal problems that affect her work attendance, and how we can resolve these issues to make sure she is coming to work and performing well.

This job has a huge, and fast turnover rate. A lot of new hires quit after just a couple weeks or months because it’s a lot of work for little money. But this is the first time I’m dealing with a young girl who is crying for help.",17Nov2019,1

Hello I am hoping someone can give me good advice, my situation is kind of unique. Its probably not one many people have experienced but I can really use some advice.

Heres some background information. I am 28 years old, I have no education and have no job, or assets. I come from a great working family. My parents both work 2 jobs to stay afloat. I am a recovering drug addict with multiple years clean.

A few years ago when I got clean, I started a very successful business and made a ton of money that I saved. (6 figures, multiples) About a 2 years ago I started gambling, and lost literally everything. Not only did I lose everything of mine, I lost somebody elses money too behind their back, trying to chase back my money and thinking I would be able to replace theirs. It started with a small amount and then kept going and going. I was trusted holding this persons money because it is my best friends (20+ year friendship) and he couldnt keep it where he lived for whatever reasons. The amount of money is also multiples of 6 figures. I obviously had to tell them what I did when they asked to come get some of it. I was so caught up and everything happen so fast I really cant believe what I did when it was all gone. Just like anybody else would be, this person is very upset with me but has been somewhat reasonable to an extent. This is the last person I would of wanted to do this to considering our friendship but also because of their temper and how crazy they are. Besides that money I also owe a few people smaller amounts (10-20k each).

I am in such a deep hole. I am so depressed and stressed out I really dont know how much longer I can take. My future and friendship with my best friend is destroyed. This obviously is not going to go away. I am suppose to pay my friend a decent amount of money every week. The other people I owe money to are always hounding me but they are easy going. They all know they will be waiting a long time for their money but I hate having it on my conscious and on my shoulders.

My family barely gets by and they have tried to do everything they can to help me, but theres only so much they can do for me. My business is not like it used to be. All the money I make I have to give to my friend each week so when my business needs funds to continue I end up putting myself in a deeper hole by borrowing or overdrawing my accounts.

My life was so amazing and I completely destroyed it. I am so stressed all the time I can feel it in my chest. I am scared and depressed. Its so hard to get out of bed and be motivated to go out and make money. I have no education and getting a job wont help. Between the weekly payment I have to make and living expenses. I would need a job making 100k+ a year to get by. That wont happen overnight. No job I can get will help. I did this to myself 10 years ago, I started a different very successful business and lost it all to drugs. I am really smart and good at making money so I have hope that I will figure out something but thats not guaranteed. I hate myself for what I did and what I am putting my family through. I put them through hell for years with my drug addiction only to get clean and do really well, to just fuck it up again.

I dont know what to do but I cant see my self living like this. The stress and depression is really getting to me. If I didn't have a family i would have definitely killed myself by now but I would never do that to them. Running away or going to the police for protection is 100% not an option.

Any advice or anything at all would be appreciated.",17Nov2019,1

408,"So I’ve been dealing with a real pain of a professor, and I don’t know what to really do about it besides not go to lecture anymore. 

I’ve been going to the same lecture and have been turning in papers and passing exams in this class since August. I do well in the class, attendance isn’t required; however I only miss when I desperately have to. 

We use an app called Canvas for assignments and announcements from professors and instructors, she’ll make announcements saying how she doesn’t like when people don’t show up for lecture (usually happens cold/flu season and after papers and exams. Or if there’s a guest speaker). She’ll always repeat on how nothing will be electronic so you need to come to lecture. She’ll also make announcements about cancelling office hours...a lot, and has a healthy habit of not hosting lectures a week before and after exams. We have a different professor come in on those days. I also know that after all of our papers and exams, we continue lecture...weirdly enough. This is just what I can see through the app and can prove if need be. 

As of recent, she’s been picking on me in lecture...a lot. To the point where other classmates come up to me; outside of class to ask if I’m alright. It’s embarrassing, even when I’m not doing much of anything. It’s a big lecture, 80-120 people. 

It all started when I sat next to a buddy of mine once...yes I seriously mean once. I play smash w/ him, so I see him everyday anyway and usually won’t sit next to him because we will talk nonstop. He also does really well in the class, better than me. So also to not get distracted. She yelled at us, primarily me; for whispering in lecture last week. She told both of us to drop the class because she doesn’t want to see us anymore. 

This is the first time she’s called us out, and we don’t sit next to each other ever. I definitely would’ve been called out sooner if we’ve been with each other. 

Now, I will go to lecture, and she’ll only pick on me. Even when I’m sitting alone quietly. She’ll ask what I’m still doing in the lecture and that she’s told me to drop...for no reason other than one occurrence of talking. 

I’m still enrolled in the class, I’ve checked. The professor doesn’t even grade my work, an AI does. I don’t really ever see my AI in lecture though, only exam days. My buddy still goes to lecture and isn’t bothered, but she only points me out to leave for no reason. At this point I wonder if I should even go back. 

I don’t know what I should do, who should be involved if anyone. We have one more exam left and I got a B+ on the last one, I just would like to pass it and be done w/ the class. However if she’s kicking me out everyday for no reason besides her basically banning me that one day, I don’t know what else to do besides not show up...but of course I can’t do that if I wanna pass. 

I can answer any question if need be, I feel this is a weird scenario and can clear up anything.",17Nov2019,1
409,"This might sound a little stupid, but I am afraid he is going to break it.

Some context: I live in a very small apartment. I have a bed, some plastic chairs and my working/office/gaming chair. I am a student, and my studies require a lot of hours working with my computer( animation/3d modeling etc.) so I need to have a desk and a good chair- I cannot just do the work in my bed. So that chair is super important to me! I would not have the money to buy a new one, nor the means to get it inside or to my apartment (I live on the 3rd floor, I have no car). So if it breaks I am pretty much screwed. Also it would be difficult to use a plastic chair because they are too short for the desk, and I am a short person. I would not be able to see the screen

Okay, so I love my brother. He is awesome. But whenever he come to visit- he insists on sitting in it. Fair enough... But the thing is- he is morbidly obese, and the chair is not sturdy enough to handle that kind of weight. I have tried to persuade him to sit in one of my plastic chairs or on my bed instead( i bought some pillows to make them more comfortable). I even went as far to claim it's back is weak. I have tried to put stuff onto the seat in the hopes that he'd choose somewhere else to sit. No luck. Luckily not much damage has been done yet. But it is only a matter of time.

He is aware that he is obese, but it is a very sore topic for him and I don't wanna bring it up unless it is really necessary. I don't want to risk him coming over and spending time with me in a bad mood. He lives some miles apart, so he does not get the chance to visit alot.

She pees about every 15-20 minutes in our house it seems. 

I’m having anxiety about bringing her into my next journey. I can’t afford health visits and medication to address the incontinence. I’ve tried multiple diapers. I don’t want to pay a pet deposit or face the inevitable of her ruining the carpet in an apartment. 

I feel like her quality of life just isn’t good. She has some personality but she’s not the same dog I had with me for so long. 

Come May if she is still alive, I’m considering putting her to sleep and I feel like I’m a horrible person for considering this. Am I? The long story short is that I have two young children, I’m about to become a single mom and not have a lot of money, and I feel like I can’t give her the financial care she needs especially when I move out. I don’t want to give her up to a shelter to rot away. She’s an old baby. I’d want her to go with my face being the last one she sees. 

I need to know if I’m breaking some moral ethics for considering this. I feel really guilty thinking about it. 

Thanks in advance. Please be kind. I’m obviously going through a lot personally.",17Nov2019,1
411,"My girlfriend and I are currently 2-2:30 hours away from our home in a different state. She’s competing in an equestrian competition, one of the bigger shows of the season.

This morning we woke up in our hotel and her mom informed us that my back windshield on my car is completely shattered. Her mom was stopping by our house when she noticed the windshield and took a picture. 

Now we’re sitting at breakfast and I’m insisting we go home and take care of this. My girlfriend wants to stay in town. She argues that she’s spent a lot of money on this weekend, around 300-400 dollars when all is said and done. 

I’m arguing that my car takes precedence. We won’t be home for another 6-7 hours if we stay for the competition, and I’m not comfortable having my car open to the public all day. I’m afraid that anyone can simple get into my car through the back and drive away. We’re discussing whether that risk outweighs the hundreds of dollars spent on this competition.

So we need advice. What should we do?",17Nov2019,1

415,"Thanks for the advice &amp; for reading.  This situation is a bit complex and I need advice on a couple different angles, so bear with me, please! 

I recently moved in with my sister on the East Coast in July.  I was accepted into an intensive educational program that has allowed me to reset my career, but it was pretty expensive.  I wouldn't have been able to afford it but my sister offered me free rent (and to make my student loan payments) while I was in the program.  She is an absolute saint!  However, this created an un-equal power dynamic between us that will be relevant later.

I met this dance teacher with her the month before I started class.  I had been trying to get her into my social dance scene that I loved and he had managed to get her number and through her, get mine.  He is an older man who was super nice to her at one of her first dances, which really impressed me because she was an absolute beginner, and a lot of times experienced dancers avoid beginners.  

Anyway, he contacted me and offered me free dance classes, saying that he needed a partner for an upcoming performance.  I was really excited!  I am passionate about this dance but haven't really been into it for years because of how expensive it is to take lessons.  So I started practicing with him every day to prepare for this performance.  It was perfect because I had about a month and a half before my program started. 

My sister was NOT pleased.  I assured her that his intentions were pure (which he had told me when I had expressed hesitation and was upfront about not wanting to date him).  Anyway, long story short I wasn't attracted to him at first, but he basically won me over being super sweet and attentive and giving me thousands of dollars of free lessons.  So after about 3 weeks he finally made a move and I was like ""yeah! I'm d!""",17Nov2019,1

417,"hi reddit! newbie here, so please be kind. Anyway, i have been put in a pretty crappy situation if the title doesn’t already give some of it away. I’ll try not to give my life story, and i apologize if this belongs in r/relationshipadvice, but here goes:

So I once met this girl in middle school, and we became best friends. We had a really rough history throughout the years, ending our friendship multiple times, sometimes over dumb stuff, but sometimes because i felt i was too mentally unstable to deal with her treatment towards me. After becoming friends again after nearly 5 months of no contact, she began to catch feelings for me. She was still with someone at the time, and i was perusing someone else, so obviously we both knew it wouldn’t work out. Eventually she broke it off with her partner and things didn’t work out well with my girl, so I decided to give her chance and start dating. Oh man, i was in love. It was some of the most happy months of my life, but then, school started again. Now we’re both students and college or other life stuff is getting closer, and my gf began getting depressed. Blah blahblah, we began to argue more, blah blah, she cheats on me with her ex. Obviously, that destroyed me. Things are different now, and we’re not together, but we were still each other’s best friends, so we try talking on the occasion. But still there are moments i think about that betrayal, and i get so angry. What happened that led to it? Was the ex really okay with it? (The ex was my friend as well) Am I stupid for still wanting my future to be with the girl who’s hurt me so much? Idk, part of me wants to keep asking questions and details to get rid of the curiosity, but i also know that’s probably a dumb idea. So, any advice? (Btw im a girl)",17Nov2019,1
418,"Hey everyone, I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this or can give me some advice. 

I have some friends that literally bring out the worst in me. They are really negative and talk shit about people all the time and I can’t stand it. I’m usually positive so it bothers me that I’m surrounded by such negative people. I have a strong set of morals but when I’m with them it’s like I lose control if I find something funny. 

I know the obvious answer is to drop them but I can’t really do that. We all live close and they are dependent on me for rides to school.",17Nov2019,1

423,"Every Friday I go to my Mom's house and spend the weekend there. The house has four bedrooms. Three of the bedrooms are used to sleep in while the fourth is used as my Mom's office as she works from home. One bedroom is the master, one is mine, and the third is my younger sister's, who also visits on weekends. My Mom and her fiance sleep in the master together and have been as far as I can remember and, from what I can tell, they aren't fighting and have no problems sleeping in the same king-sized bed together.

However I've noticed that my Mom will sleep in my bed when I'm not there. I've asked her nicely not to since it is my bed and I would like her to respect my privacy, as she doesn't sleep in my sister's bed, only mine, but she ignores me and does it anyway.

I understand that it's her house and I'm not there all the time, but I still feel like she's blatantly ignoring my simple wishes. It's like she's targeting me on purpose because my sister and I have the same kind of bed, same size, everything. The only difference is that my room is on the top floor while my sister's is on the ground floor.

I've asked some other people about it and they all tell me I'm in the wrong, pointing out that it's her house that she pays for and she's allowed to do whatever she wants, especially since I'm only there on the weekends. Those are all valid reasons but I still don't understand why she keeps sleeping in my bed even when I've politely asked her not to many times.

So, honestly, am I in the wrong? I thought I was right but now that I consider some things I'm torn because, yes, it is her house, etc. etc., but also I feel like it's an invasion of privacy, a blatant disregard of my wishes, and that she's specifically targeting me for some reason. I'm not sure why.

So am I just overreacting or am I justified in my feelings here?

If you believe I'm wrong then please explain why, but also please don't be rude about it because I'm tired of people on the internet calling me an idiot for not wanting my Mom to sleep in my bed when I'm not there

(Note: I've always approached her nicely and asked her to please not sleep in my bed. I'm not demanding anything from her or commanding her to stop, just asking)",17Nov2019,1
424,"So.. this is a tricky one, and I know it's not easy to give advice to but I'd really just like some different views. I'm 18 now, and when I was about 7/8 years old I was sexually abused by our neighbour's daughter. I remember it really clearly, it's always stuck with me and happened a few times. My neighbour's daughter was young at the time too, maybe 13/14, so I don't necessarily know if this would be abuse or not since she was underage too. All I know is I was too young to consent, and I would just do what she asked me to without asking questions. - Looking back now, I feel really stupid, I should have  just refused. After a while, our neighbours moved house, and obviously it stopped, but I never forgot about it. I've never said all of this publicly so I'm a little nervous, but I'll try my best. Whilst this was going on, I became interested in what we were actually doing during 'Play Time' and using our home computer, I started watching Porn. It never aroused me and I wasn't watching it for pleasure, I think I was too young at that point, I never touched myself, but I just found Porn interesting to watch, so I would do it secretly. Of course, this is 10 or so years ago when we only had one computer in our house that everyone shared, so after a while, I was caught looking at these sites. To say my parents were mortified would be an understatement. They told me off really bad and told my siblings. Looking back, I still think that was pretty harsh, they didn't sit me down and ask why I was doing what I was doing, but I understand they must've been really shocked and upset with me, I was an 8 year old watching porn anyways. For the first time ever I felt true shame and I was too embarrassed to even communicate with my family properly for a long time, I felt disgusting - so much so, that I have never watched porn since. I don't think it's a bad thing, but every time I even think about watching it I get this horrible feeling. Alongside this, it's really ruined how I handle relationships. As I went through my teens I became depressed and would harm myself, then as I got older I became socially anxious and would refuse to leave home - this was really recent. I just finished my third course of therapy, so my anxiety is getting a lot better and I hope to make some friends soon. In high school, I would go to parties etc and sometimes, would have a little too much to drink and make out with someone, and one time I started being felt up by my friend, his touch completely threw me off guard and I suddenly thought about being touched there when I was younger, I completely freaked out and locked myself in the bathroom, I cried over how disappointed in myself I was for being so messed up - I can't even handle being touched! About a year ago, I met someone online and we developed a relationship, we've met a few times and get on really well, but when things heat up between us, all I can think about is my neighbour's daughter. I hate being intimate, I hate being touched, I feel weird and I don't feel any pleasure at all. I would happily die an untouched virgin. Honestly, I know my neighbour was young at the time too and probably just curious, I think she just knew I was young and wouldn't tell anyone, let alone remember it 10 years later.. but I do. Now moving onto my sister, she is my best friend, and right now she is my only friend. The other day, she told me she is really happy about how close we are and how we can tell each other everything. Suddenly I felt this horrible guilt inside me. She has told me everything, it's not as intense as my stuff but, I haven't told her any of it. About the neighbour's daughter, why I watched porn at such a young age, how I self harmed when I was younger, how I hate the thought of being intimate with someone. But I know the problem is if I tell her, am I just sharing a burden? All of this was so long ago, and sure it still affects me now but I've been dealing with it on my own so far. Part of me thinks it would be good to get it off my chest and tell her everything, if anything it would make us closer. But the other part of me knows that it could really upset her, she's a sensitive person, and I don't want her to worry about me because I'm not going through all that now. I thought about speaking to my therapist about it but I could never bring myself to do it, and my therapy is over now. But I think I'm finally ready to tell someone. Do you think I should tell her? or stay quiet? She deserves to know everything about me, but I don't want to change how she thinks of me, and I don't want to burden her with all of this.",17Nov2019,1

We became extremely close and could tell anything to each other(both had broken childhoods and have problems with self worth and connecting to people). I moved back home after college a month later my gf broke up with me. She was always there to comfort me and help me out with coping with the break up. I jokingly said it sucks now I have to go to my mom's weekend long wedding without a date. She pretty much said that shes is coming with. Me thinking cool at least I'll have someone I can go with and not fly solo. At this point I didn't have feelings for her in a romantic way. Drove 7 to Iowa where she lives picked her up came back and went to the wedding. During the weekend we both vented about life and how we cant be close to anyone. Later that night we began to dance on the dance floor together and i held her close and felt a feeling I never had before. Everything felt right and felt as if this was meant to be. I fought the urge to kiss her while her eyes we closed signing along to the song while we danced. Everyone there said that no one dances like that with someone who they are just friends with. Fast forward to take her back home. I told her about me wanting to kiss her. She said it probably was I go idea I didn't. After dropping her off I told her that I fell for her that weekend unplanned. She said that she thinks it would be weird if we were together. I asked my close buddies what that they think that means and they said they think she is indecisive about it all. Due the fact that she wants to spend her month long Christmas break with me at my apartment with my family. Personally I wouldn't think that someone would do that unless they have feelings for the other person with Christmas being a family type of holiday and it being the entire month she is on break from college. I want to actually be in a romantic relationship with her not based on sex but actual feelings neither one of us has had that but she feels like the one that provides that feeling. But I don't know if it's just me feeling this way.

442,"Hi! I'm in serious need of some advice regarding a collegue. I started working at this place about 8 month ago. I really like working there and I am so thankful I have this job... but their is a problem. I have a coworker that starts rumors about other colleges. In the span of 1 year 4 coworkers have quitted their job due to stress and other things(I really don't know why they quitted but I am starting to think that it is due to her). She is always talking and she is charismatic at first but as time went I started to notice that she has a tendency to trash talk people. She always talk about other coworkers when they are not precent and when they are precent she acts like nothing ever happened and is social and very kind towards them. She is good at making people trust her and tell her their ""secrets"" and then she tells other people. I don't like when people trash talk others and then act like nothing cause it makes the workplace toxic and people don't trust each other. 

When I started this job I thought that she was a kind person and I trusted her. I have some trust issue and when I trust people I hate to be let down because I am very used to people backstabbing me. I told her some private things about me and my life and I am more than sure that she told other people  what I told her. 

She is bullying a coworker and calling her names and she has made other people turn against that woman. The woman that she is bullying is shy and has low self esteem and at first I thought that she was the ""bad guy"", but as time went and I started to get more into the work culture I started to notice that the bullied woman was one of the nicest people I have ever met and that the woman bullying her was the problem. I didn't notice that at first. It took me 5 month to realize that.

I am fed up with all of this. I am starting to vent to my boyfriend about this work-related drama and he is getting tired of it. I am so depressed about this. I feel insecure around her. I am young and she is relatively old (as old as my mother) and I just can't understand how a person can be so cruel.

She is always talking about other people in a negative way and she is always unsatisfied with something. She is making this workplace a hell and no one seems to see it. Everybody talks to her and she is some sort of an informal leader. 

I don't know what to do. Why aren't people confronting her? What can I do? I am afraid I will get fired if I get on her bad side.... I am new and I don't have much power to change things around here.",17Nov2019,1
443,"I met her online a few weeks ago and we hung out a few times since then. She told me her parents are strict so to start we won't be able to meet too often since she lives with them, which I was fine with because I understand and I really like the time we did have together.

Last night, I asked her when the next time might be that she'll be free and she gave me like the times every week that her parents might not be home and it made me look back on my last relationship.

My last girlfriend had a strict parent too and we sneak around for months. And it was just so much stress and it was so extra and I hated every second of having to sneak around like that because it takes the fun out of it.

I talked to this girl about this, explaining that I've been in this situation before and it's probably a lot easier if she just tells her parents that she wants to go on a date with somebody. She told me that her dad would probably want to meet me first and I was fine with that because I really do like this girl and I just want to enjoy my time with her without stressing out about it.

And then she got worried and doesn't want to tell her parents anything yet. This is her first relationship and I was even her first kiss so she has no idea how her parents are going to relax. I told her that it was alright and we could keep doing what we were doing for a bit longer, but I didn't want to be sneaking around months from now.

Is there any way we can find a solution to this? What should I tell her to get her to get the confidence to mention something to her parents?",17Nov2019,1

445,"I'm helping a friend and I've run out of ideas. She's fallen for a guy half her age, oddly without any physical desires, just emotional.  She's happily married, with kids. The young guy and herself just clicked, with the same sense of humour and level of sarcasm, they are very helpful to each other and visibly protective of each other. It's painful for her to be in his presence, so she's started avoiding him. He, in turn, creates opportunities for them to meet and he was the one who showed interest first. They work together and meet on a daily basis. 
I try to keep her occupied with other stuff, she puts a lot of effort and attention to the family time, spends as much time as she can with her husband.

453,"I've never been too fond of my dad. Here's some crap he's done/does:

-I've had psychiatric problems basically my whole life. In high school, I had abnormally severe, *severe* social anxiety. He would yell at me and shame me and say I was disappointing and embarrassing whenever I couldn't do any public speaking assignment at school until I'd be sobbing and then he'd just continue berating me. 

-He's screams like the scariest deranged psychopath I've ever seen whenever he gets mad at my brothers. He cusses at them, calls them named, grabs them, shoves them, has thrown things at them before, and has made my adult autistic brother cry. I've had to lock myself in the bathroom or hide in my room with my phone ready to dial 911 just in case because he fuckin terrified me and didn't know if he was going to seriously injure one of us or not.

-He screams and cusses at and sometimes hits my mom with things when he's drunk.

-Refused to acknowledge or get any sort of help for my autistic brother when he was diagnosed with autism. Tried to do the same to me when I was hallucinating, severely depressed, and was barely functioning and having panic attacks every day in school but I fought back and finally got the therapy and meds that I desperately needed.

-My other brother was basically the same as my dad but he did this shit literally every day and he scared the fuck out of me.

-My other, other brother beat me a lot and would leave a ton of bruises on my legs until my doctor started questioning me about it and I lied to her. Idk why just scared I guess

-couple other things: immediately after I had finally recovered from a years long eating disorder, i had gained some healthy weight and had finally started eating like a normal person. They immediately started commenting and criticizing every little thing I ate. For example, i once went to get a couple slices of whole grain bread to eat as a snack. He then started chastising me for eating them, talking about how unhealthy all the carbs in it would be. 

When I started going to therapy to deal with some if my family issues, they demanded that i write down everything my therapist and i talked about during our meetings (i was a 22 year old grown adult at the time)


I'm so fucked up on my feelings about all this. Were they abusive or just kind of asshole-ish and I'm overreacting? He's never actually like punched us or left marks on us, i think. How would you feel towards them if you were me? What do I do? How should I feel? I know nothing, my brain just feels completely fucked. I've never talked to anyone about this before. How do i deal with this? What do you recommend? By the way, long story short, my family is beyond redemption at this point. I have tried for years to reunite and rebuild some love in my family and all attempts have been futile and Im beyond emotionally exhausted from trying. So please don't tell me to try make amends with them. At this point, i am just trying to take care of myself and find peace within myself.

We've been through a lot of tough times and he often looks to me for advice and guidance but as of recently, he's been more enamored with a girl over discord who is 13. I'm friends with her as well and she has talked to me for advice and help with problems.

The guy i've known for 3+ is messaging me less and less and calling much less frequently and when he does talk or message, it's something relating to her. He is extremely adamant and defensive about things I say and when I message her, he tries to get involved by messaging me when she shares her screen with him privately.

I really care about him as a friend as we've both gotten each other through some dark patches with how he has been acting recently, I want to talk some sense into him. I really do care about the 2 of them but he acts obsessive and manipulative and doesn't see how it affects the people he talks to.

Whenever we've been in calls, he usually messages her even while we are doing something and he stated that he knows he does this and says he'll keep more in touch with me when he is talking to her but he messages less and less and the last message I got from him was revolving around him trying to get her to do something (I don't know what he wanted because he wouldn't admit so I told him to not get me involved if I shouldn't even know)

I told her last night about the fact he tries to manipulate what I say in front of her and how he's not the most trustworthy. Whenever he thinks i'm doing something weird in front of her he always messages me and tells me i'm faking or bullshitting. I know so many things that he is scared of her knowing that he has said among other actions but I don't feel like being a vindictive prick.

Her secretary got in contact with me and told me that a family member of hers passed away and she would be taking the next two weeks off.

466,"I'm trying to put this in a format that prevents it from getting removed because I desperately need help so I'm just going to go into it. I'm 17M and my gf 16F have been together for a year and we just recently started having sex when she turned 16. Her mom let her go on birth control for cramps because she get's terrible cramping but it does help with a feeling security  with safe sex but I still use a condom. Last Monday we had sex and she happened to have to get her prescription that day so of course she kept reminding her mom to pick her up because she didn't want to risk anything, so she called once and texted her mom a bunch. throughout the day. We had sex and I pulled out and there's just a ring, my condom broke, I internally flipped shit, but I remembered about the bc and then she told me about the prescription fill. All pharmacies were closed that I could find and Planned Parenthood was closed so I couldn't call. I read that if you took two the next day you were fine but I didn't want to risk it so she took the two and I got her a Plan B the following day. She kept getting signs the following week but I brushed them off as side effects of the missing birth control like acne and light brown discharge which she never gets. We took a test and it's positive. I do realize how big of a fuck up this is, I know I have no idea what it takes to care for a child, especially a baby and I know I'm selfish. An abortion is not happening and I know if this post gets any attention it's going to revolve around that but it's not happening. Now let me give some background of her family, they're complete pricks, they say if you're gay, get pregnant while living here no matter what age or don't do what we say you will be kicked out. I know for an absolute fact that if she has the kid and they don't kick her out they will make her life hell and they won't let me see the baby. Another thing to add is that they're very wealthy so I know they can get a good lawyer and I know they have good connections with law around here. So my question is: What goes on with Child Custody laws in Pennsylvania and can they kick her out. If they kick her out could she legally live with us, how would custody work with the child, and who has the power over the child (is it more parents of the child or the parents of us since we're underage?). Some more background, I make $800 a month from my job and I'm planning to make a tiny under the table business in building computer rigs so I hope to make around 1k a month. I could make this work for all of the needs for the child and my family's insurance would cover the childbirth costs. My school also has a program where you work for half the day and go to school for the rest o the average school day so I would go 3 hours a day to school and stay at home with the kid and get the paperwork signed by one of my businessmen family members. In a perfect world, I get accepted for the program, I keep my hours for my work (which will happen), I'm able to make more money on the side, my girlfriend can move in our spare room, and I'm able to care for the baby. I know this whole thing is written like shit, I'm usually a decent creative writer but I'm kind of in a bad spot rn and can think very clearly and I really hope this doesn't get removed for some bullshit rule. Thank you for all replies it means a lot if I get even one &lt;3  


TLDR: (Pennsylvania) I(17M) got gf(16F) pregnant, she has batshit parents that will either kick her out or keep her at home and make her life hell while limiting or getting rid of my visitation of the baby. The last thing I want is for them to raise my child.",17Nov2019,1

This year's a little different cause when I sent in my design, my boss this time gave me a bunch of changes to implement (a different design and new colors).

I pretty much told her no. I said if she had special requirements she should tell me before I start and that her changes represent hours of extra work which I don't have. I reminded her I was doing this for free and she's free to use someone else's design if she wishes.

She replied that everyone is required to do this kind of ""community"" work for the office, that those changes were the least I could do and that I should get them done ASAP.

What should I do now? I'm hesitating between doing a few tiny changes to get her off my back or give her a straight ""no"" again, likely leading to confrontation, which I do not handle well, and further pressure from her. I could also get another (trusted) boss involved if necessary.

472,"16M. I've recently started this new thing where, when I'm interested in someone, I just don't want to talk to them. It's mostly on text, and it usually starts when I've found out they're also interested in me. It started when I was dating a girl almost two months ago, I avoided texting her for what seemed like no reason at the time but I've since realized that it was because I was always afraid of how she would react to things I said. She would make me feel bad if I worded something weirdly so I had to make everything I wrote sound absolutely perfect and it was too stressful. Also she was bad at keeping conversations going and would get mad at me if I couldn't carry the conversation through that. 

Anyways, now I've been talking to someone else and he's absolutely amazing and probably one of the nicest people I know but I'm finding it difficult to text him. When you like someone you're supposed to want to talk to them all the time but I just.... don't. Sometimes he'll text me and I just won't open it for hours until I've mentally prepared myself to. This isn't how it's supposed to go. How do I fix this? I really do want to talk to him all the time but I can't.

475,"Long post alert! probably 7-10 min read

Thanks for the advice &amp; for reading. This situation is a bit complex and I need advice on a couple different angles, so bear with me, please!

I recently moved in with my sister on the East Coast in July. I was accepted into an intensive educational program that has allowed me to reset my career, but it was pretty expensive. I wouldn't have been able to afford it but my sister offered me free rent (and to make my student loan payments) while I was in the program. She is an absolute saint! However, this created an un-equal power dynamic between us that will be relevant later.

I met this dance teacher with her the month before I started class. I had been trying to get her into my social dance scene that I loved and he had managed to get her number and through her, get mine. He is an older man who was super nice to her at one of her first dances, which really impressed me because she was an absolute beginner, and a lot of times experienced dancers avoid beginners.

Anyway, he contacted me and offered me free dance classes, saying that he needed a partner for an upcoming performance. I was really excited! I am passionate about this dance but haven't really been into it for years because of how expensive it is to take lessons. So I started practicing with him every day to prepare for this performance. It was perfect because I had about a month and a half before my program started.

My sister was NOT pleased. I assured her that his intentions were pure (which he had told me when I had expressed hesitation and was upfront about not wanting to date him). Anyway, long story short I wasn't attracted to him at first, but he basically won me over being super sweet and attentive and giving me thousands of dollars of free lessons. So after about 3 weeks he finally made a move and I was like ""yeah! I'm d!""

I've never been one to judge a book by it's cover, and I was like ""so what if he's like 20 years older than me? That's so basic to judge someone for that."" Plus I am early 30s and want to have a family, and had experienced guys my age breaking up with me because of that. I'm a little worried that if I don't settle down soon I'll be out of luck in the kids department. ""Maybe an older, responsible, settled guy is right for a girl like me?"" I thought.

Again my sister was not pleased. She didn't like how the situation had gone down, that he wasn't up front, or that he was so much older than me, and also that he was short. Everyone in my family is very tall except for me, and this guy is exceptionally short for a guy, so this is kinda a thing that comes up from time to time. I was able to shrug off her warnings because of the short thing -- I was like, ""she's just being judge-y and physical characteristics shouldn't be something that's important!"" Basically I threw out her advice like a baby with the bathwater.

But then I started this program and this guy kept being pushy. I was REALLY busy and needed alone time, but he would INSIST on picking me up every day at the metro and simply would not take ""no"" for an answer about things. This really started to fray the relationship with my sister. He would push me to stay with him to practice just a bit more, and I'd come home later than I had told her, and she would be pissed. Because she's giving me all this money she is really invested in my program and thought I wasn't taking it seriously enough.

Even though I was working hard I felt like she was right and I reiterated that I couldn't see him as often but he still insisted on picking me up and stuff. I don't have a car so honestly it was really nice of him and I didn't realize that he had all this free time and stuff because he wasn't actually employed full-time... or really even part-time.

My sister was like, ""don't trust men!"" ""Don't let them give you things!"" and ""They just want to make you dependent on them!"" Since we're two different people -- I am family oriented and she is seriously independent and a career military officer -- I figured that yeah, she makes a good point, but I AM going to want to settle down with some time and we WILL need to depend on and trust each other if we want to have a family. I didn't think it was a big deal anyway because he seemed so happy to do it and never went TOO far out of his way.

Stuff started to escalate and after about 2 weeks of dating he started becoming more pushing and dominant. After going to one of his performances or a party on a Saturday night, for instance, he was like, "" let's go to my house,"" and I'd be like, ""no I told you I have to go home,"" and then I'd realize 20 minutes later that he was parking at his house.

I definitely have a hard time telling me people ""no"" (I know, it's bad, I'm working on it!) so at first I would like give in when he did stuff like this. I also gave him the benefit of the doubt because he is from Argentina and also is of a different age group than me... so I was like, ""ok he has these bad habits because of maybe culture and upbringing, so I'll give him a pass on some things.""

I started teaching dance lessons with him (for free, by the way -- he was getting paid, I was not. He told me that this was because he needed to recoup the losses he took for giving me free lessons.... this didn't reeally sit right with me because he had freely given me those lessons -- I thought -- and now it seemed like maybe he had expected to get ""paid back"" for it all along. But I was like 'whatever, it was suuuper nice of him to give me lessons, I can return the favor."")

But even though I was really busy AND not getting paid AND he was like, ""don't worry if you can't come to the lessons at any time -- I will have no problem getting someone else,"" when i said I wasn't able to make one, he changed his tune and said ""I had to come,"" and he had ""promised,"" that I would be there.

I caved to the pressure, but my coursework had started to suffer. Plus I didn't like how he was treating me at the lessons. I wasn't introduced as a teacher (totally fine or whatever, like I didn't feel super comfortable with that anyway) but then it seemed like he was paying more attention to my technique than the actual students. He started criticizing me in front of students and it really stressed me out. I wasn't able to practice every day anymore, so I would feel rusty and forget stuff. At one point, I wanted to help a nice lady at one of the dances with the setup, and he said ""No, come here, I need you here,"" in front of everyone. THAT really bothered me.

Plus, I was seeing him interact with other people and I didn't really like some of the ways he acted. He was thoughtless sometimes, and I didn't like how he would sort of blame other people for stuff. He would walk right in front of people, and got into an altercation with someone over something that was really small. He also always insisted that I was right by him at social gatherings, and would gesture ""come here"" to me in a way that made me really uncomfortable. He texted me all the time, and would act as if he was so gracious for not being hurt if I didn't text him all morning, or during the day while I was in class. I was getting annoyed and stressed... and I realized I just wasn't into him that much anymore.

I started to put distance between us, but at this point he was acting really entitled and weird. He would show up unannounced and unasked to pick me up at my metro stop. He would ask me questions about where I would be and when, and why I wasn't texting him. He showed up at my house in the morning. When I came out to catch the bus he was standing outside... who knows how long he had been there.

Class was getting more and more intense, and I told him I couldn't do teaching with him which made me feel really bad but I had to do it or I was going to fail. He said ""Yeah,"" but then wouldn't make arrangements for other people to take the class and would continue to pressure me to be there. I stayed late on the campus one night, working, while he was doing a class. He had wanted to meet up but I was getting stressed and annoyed and just wanted it to be over, but felt guilty and bad at the same time. I was trying to sort out my feelings alone but had an inkling that he might stop by since my school was in between where the class was and the town where we live. I worked deliberately late to avoid any chance that we could meet each other on the transit system.

I was standing on the platform and feeling really weird and paranoid. I had started to feel like he was everywhere and have a really oppressed feeling that he could just show up at anytime. At this point I had decided to break up with him but wasn't sure how to and also was afraid that he would not take it well and could show up at my school or whatever. I was afraid of being embarrassed and/or harassed.

I heard my name and turned around and there he was on the platform walking towards me. I'm sure he saw a look of horror cross my face. I was shocked for a second but able to recover quickly. We got on the train together and I was sort of frantic in my mind, not sure of what to do. Obviously I should have just told him it was over and to get lost but I was confused and a bit afraid.

He was so happy to see me and assured me it was an absolute serendipitous, romantic, coincidence that we were meeting, but that he had had this overpowering feeling that we might meet. He gave me a present and a rose and asked to drive me home when we got to his stop because there was something he'd wanted to give me but hadn't had the chance since he hadn't seen me.

He drove me home, gave me flowers and I just desperately wanted to be away from him. I had started to not feel physically attracted to him, and when he gave me a kiss goodnight his smell (I'm sorry to say this but he smelled sort of moldy and rotten... like the time when I had had a terrible cavity or the way an old folk's home smells ). I felt sick and weird and just really guilty but I had to get away.

i knew, basically because of my physical attraction changing that I had to end it. I texted him a couple days later and told him that I was breaking up -- I didn't trust myself to see him in person because I thought that he would convince me to stay with him somehow.

he took it well! I was super surprised and happy that he was being mature. This made me more comfortable being honest and I told him I had put off telling him because I was honestly afraid he might make a scene or show up at my school. He asked to meet and so we met about 5 days later.

I felt so much better. I didn't feel like I was being followed or watched anymore. I thought that maybe I hadn't hurt him too bad, although I still felt a little guilty. He's really handsome and fit for a 49 year old (although I had begun to suspect, that my sister was right and that he had lied about his age) and I thought that he could find someone closer to his age or even another younger person like me.

In those 5 days I went out with a friend from my class and some of the staff from the school came. I got the vibe that this cute teacher (in another department than mine) who was my age was interested in me, and I started to get a little excited! He was super appropriate and all, but a few days later popped into my class and handed me a paper with phone number, apologizing for being abrupt or something during some random hallway interaction, and telling me to hit him up and that we should hang out.)

I was sooooooo excited. This also gave me some sort of fortitude, and so when I met with my ex I was able to be super direct. He blamed my sister a little bit, but I assured him I was not interested in him for reasons a, b, and c, and he seemed to respect that and even played it off like it wasn't a big deal for him anyway. He promised not to contact me and assured me he would not come to my house, my school, my work or anything else. We were over, done, cool.

I believed him....

I was so happy! We were good! I knew that he would blame my sister but i thought that I had settled that point with him.

I didn't hear from him and started to get more and more comfortable and relieved. I went on a date with this new dude and it was absolutely lovely. He didn't show any of the signs of being weird and I thought that because we were so busy that I could be more healthy about this new thing. Take it slow. Set up appropriate boundaries, that sort of thing. I knew that I had gone WAY to fast with Mr. Dance Teacher.

About 5 days later though, my sister said, ""don't get upset okay, but ""Mr. Dance Teacher"" has been texting me."" He had been accusing her of ruining our relationship and said that I had been perfectly happy with him and would be if it weren't for her interference.

I was floored. I'd been lulled into a false sense of security... and I was worried. BUT she assured me it was okay, he had handled it. I asked if I should text him... we decided that she would just say something to the tune of ""shove off."" And we'd leave it at that.

2 weeks passed and we didn't hear anything. By this time, I was falling head-over-heals for someone else. It was perfect. He even said that one thing he liked about me is that I didn't get mad if he couldn't text for like a day or two. I liked that too! He was cute and sweet and I was able to see how he interacted with other people, and his work ethic, which I really admired! I confided in a couple classmates and they were excited! Everyone liked him and think we match up well-- there were none of the warning signs of my last relationship.

However, one day, Mr. Dance Teacher showed up at my school. I was mortified. I had forgotten my ipad in his car apparently. He had texted me the day before and I was relieved that it had been found (I had thought I'd lost it in my stress and lack of sleep from school) and also admired him for giving it back! BUT I had been trying to figure out how I should respond to him and pick it up in a neutral location, etc. And then he just showed up.

We didn't speak -- he handed a bag to the receptionist and she'd run up the stairs to deliver it to me... as I was coming down to the lobby. She was like, ""this is yours,"" and I was like ""huh? I don't know what that is."" She ran back down and I followed her, curious. And then he was standing right in front of me and handed me the bag... and left.

I was rattled. There were flowers in there and a happy birthday card and a note saying that he hadn't given up on me. I didn't know what to do, but by this time I was in the throes of my final intensive project for this program and a littttttttlle distracted. Maybe I should have texted him and told him ""thank you, I'm not interested,"" but I didn't. I was spending 10-13 hours a day working on this project.

So 2 weeks later the program ended; I didn't hear from him, and neither did my sister. After the graduation, I went out with friends and new guy was there. He came over after, and my sister and I and he were celebrating in the morning with breakfast, when we get a call from my Mother, who lives across the country in the Pacific Northwest.

We were happy -- I and my now-boyfriend left to go for a hike. I hadn't had time to really exercise or get outside for weeks. It was lovely! We talked honestly about future plans, maybe he could meet my parents over Christmas.... yatta yatta.

I got back, he left, and that's when my sister informed me that my Mom had called because my ex had showed up at her doorstep, across the country, saying he had ""pictures of me."" She let him in, they had a lovely chat. He showed her pictures of us tango-dancing.

This brings us to now, the next day. I don't know WHAT to do. My Mom is REALLY worried about me and thinking that I'm seeing all these random guys -- I had told her how excited I was about this new boyfriend and so when Mr. Dance Guy showed up saying HE was my boyfriend, she was obviously confused and then got weirded out.

my sister is saying it's not a big deal and that we should ignore this, but also she is not taking me seriously about how I feel about my new boyfriend, and I'm afraid no one in my family will now. She is also reiterating that I shouldn't move so fast with people and doesn't want me to see new boyfriend very often. She thinks that escalating will possibly antagonize Mr. Dance Teacher, and empathizes for him since he is old and attached because maybe this was his last chance to start a family with someone.

*I* think this was a huge power play on his part and meant to intimidate me. I am half-worried half-not that he is turning into a full-blown stalker, and my feelings are complicated by the guilt I feel that I led him on too fast, didn't set up appropriate boundaries, etc. etc.

I went to the police department last night NOT to do anything legal BUT to get advice on the situation and what things I should look for and do. My sister was furious, saying they wouldn't be able to help and that I shouldn't be wasting my time on this or my energy or brainpower -- I still have a lot of work to do to get her a job and owe her a lot of money.

So... what should i do?",17Nov2019,1

480,"I'm socially awkward, but sometimes I find talking to my boyfriend difficult and I can't tell if it's my being awkward or him. Maybe he lacks social skills or isn't interested in maintaining conversation, but sometimes it feels like I'm doing all the work to keep the conversation going. Below is an example from today: 


Boyfriend: You learned Spanish fairly quickly!


(referring to my liking a Spanish meme he posted on Facebook. Not spoken since seeing each other on Friday)


Me: I'm dating you, I've Google translate bookmarked.


Boyfriend: You mean you don't just have the app? 😝


Me: Well, I do now lol


(comment read and he didn't reply, so a few minutes later I asked...)


Me: Did you enjoy your Friday night off?


Boyfriend: I did.


Boyfriend: There was sleeping!


Boyfriend: Without an alarm!


Boyfriend: The best kind of sleep.


Me: Wow, so well rested for once?


Boyfriend: I guess.


Me: At least until work happened...how was work?


Boyfriend: It was busy from the get-go


(him talking about busy work) 


Me: Okay, so work cancelled out sleep lol


(read, didn't reply. A few minutes later...)


Me: Are you working tonight?


Boyfriend: I'm not, no.


Me: Were you in earlier?


Boyfriend: Na, I was sound asleep


Me: Oh, another free day. So up to anything fun tonight?


Boyfriend: I know, so rare!


Boyfriend: I haven't arranged anything


Is this just me or does he not put in much effort to trying to maintain conversation? He could have asked me to hang out, if he didn't want to then fine, but generally could he not have asked how my day has been ect. or give me more to reply to? I get concerned about constantly asking him questions to try to keep the conversation going. It just feels kind of strained to me. ",17Nov2019,1
481,"I'm in a bit of a conundrum here with my best friend/roommate. Hes 27, not bad looking but just needs more confidence. He went through one hell of a dry patch and was kind of an incel for a while. It was obnoxious. In late August he met this girl. She's 20 years old and still lives with her parents. Doesn't work. A cute little thing but jesus christ did she come on strong. Maybe I'm a bit jaded but I told him to be cautious because I got a weird fucking feeling and no it wasnt jealousy. 
 

They were inseparable. He's in love, whatever. 2 weeks ago they find out she's fucking pregnant. My buddy is ecstatic. He is happy to be a dad and wants to propose and everything.   However all of a sudden her mood completely flipped. They fight nonstop. She's now saying how her ""hormones"" are making her this horrible person and how she hates being pregnant etc.  She's only supposedly 6 or 7 weeks along though? It honestly changes everytime I talk to him. 

 I actually got to sit down and talk to him and he told me all these obvious red flags he saw early on but ignored. Apparently, she goes to this hang out place and she's banged like a lot of guys there so he doesn't feel comfortable when he hears that she still goes there. They weren't using protection because she ""cant get pregnant"" and she got pregnant probably the first or second time they had sex. She made a comment that other men have finished inside of her  and she never got knocked up so his sperm must be extra strong. That alone freaked me tf out. He expressed concern that she had gotten around before him but swears she's clean AND he believes her.  But now she wont let him come to the doctors visits and thinks she's going to do this alone so she wont tell him where the visits are. 

This is the weird thing, he acknowledges that this is not normal behavior and then he will completely flip his lid when someone expresses concern. A mutual friend when he told him to get a paternity test and he kicked him out of the apartment.  I'll lend an ear for now but I made the choice of moving out at the end of the lease in because 1. I dont want to be around a baby and I'm sure even if it isnt his, he will still stick around for it and 2. I have a feeling shit is going to go down and I honestly don't want to be there.  

How do I get through to him?",17Nov2019,1

484,"I work in retail at a small chain store. Sometimes in retail, when an item has been in the store for so long, it will go on a clearance sale. At our store, the longer it stays on the shelf, the more the price drops. Some items we have for so long that they actually get dropped down to the price of 1 penny! And it's policy that we take those items off the sales floor for management to get rid of!

Another policy I don't like is about our damaged items. When an item is considered unsellable because of damage (which sometimes is actually something very minor and easily fixable) we take it off the salesfloor for upper management to ""take care of."" What they do is damage the item as much as possible before throwing it in the dumpster.

I find these policies absolutely ridiculous. I wish these items could be donated to our local homeless shelter or to our battered women's shelter or something!

486,"So I met this guy a month ago in our local coffee shop while I was studying for midterms. Let's call him Mike. He sat beside me on a long table since it's the only vacant spot on the area that time. My first impression on him was that he's kind and attractive (im bi btw) and really quiet. I noticed him obviously glancing at me and my laptop every once in a while, and after half an hour, he tried making conversation with me by asking what subjects I'm taking, favourite topics, etc.

I quickly grew fond of Mike over the weeks and I enjoy his company so much, even get to the point where I'd go to the shop and order something and pretend I'm studying just go have a convo with him. I knew more about him and shared a lot of thoughts and ideas with each other. I still didn't like him romantically at this point, until he started buying me a frappe every once in a week. I mean this in a not so creepy way, like he'll genuinely just offer me the drink and all that.

This is where I started having a crush on him, and I think where he started having a crush on me too. He asked me casually if im currently liking on someone, and half-joking I replied I like him, in to which he said he likes me too. Now idk if this is where it started but we kinda just started jokingly holding and rubbing each others hands which think is really funny.

Yesterday though, out of nowhere, he grabbed and tried to massage my thing from under my pants. Yup, he did that. Luckily there's only about ten people in the shop and our booth is located at the very far end, but still it really weirded me out. He then asked me if it feels good and if it's okay if he does that. Panicking but full of hormones at that time, I reluctantly said yes but I was really becoming terrified and scared of what might happen. He did that for about an hour and a half, and afterwards I excused myself cuz I'm about to go home.

Now, I don't really know what to do. I know it's illegal on the first place but idk if ever I'm gonna report it to my dad or brother, it may come out invalid cuz I agreed and enjoyed doing it with him. But I really know deep inside that it wasn't the proper thing to do with someone way older than me, but the fact that if ever I told the truth to my dad, I might put Mike in a really bad situation.",17Nov2019,1

489,"Hi reddit! i'm turning 20 in a little less than a month, and my parents are moving out in February of the new year, leaving me, my older brother, and my sister to figure out where the hell we're gonna go. suffice it to say we're all struggling financially, myself especially. I just got out of a particularly messy relationship, during which a car accident occurred involving myself and my ex. We were on our way back from a party, and we were both under the influence. I was drunk and she was sky-high. Obviously, neither of us were in any condition to drive, but I got behind the wheel anyway. It was only a 5 minute drive back to my place, so I figured it wouldn't be a problem. I got back to my neighborhood just fine, but about 2 houses down from my driveway, I rear-ended a neighbor's parked car. His car was fine, but the hood of my ex's 2005 Sonata crumpled like tinfoil, despite colliding at a mere 25 mph. The neighbor had a security camera pointing directly at us from his second story, but while talking to him it became apparent that he couldn't tell either of us were fucked up, either that or he just didn't say anything to the cop or my ex's father, who arrived shortly after the accident. 

After all the commotion, (the cop let us off with a warning for ""distracted driving"", and the neighbor didn't press charges, but I still had to pay for a tow truck out of pocket) it still fell on me to pay for repairs. (The hood, fender, alternator, and right headlight all had to be replaced, totaling $2500). While she and I were still dating, I got roped up in signing a contract outlining a payment plan of $250 on the 10th of every month. I figured it was the right thing to do, and I wanted to make it clear to my then-girlfriend that I was serious about making it right. In turn, she cheated on me with one of my best friends over the course of a 12 day period. We ended up breaking it off, but I still have to pay off this two-faced whore's car. I just recently started working for my cousin as a subcontractor building sheds and barns, the money's good but not good enough. Especially considering that I'm still paying off legal fees for a trumped up POM charge that occurred December of last year. 

I'm at the end of my rope, and I'm sick of being bled dry by asshole probation officers and this fucking contract. So I'm seeking insight into the possible ramifications of pouring sugar in to her gas tank and being done with it. They can't make me pay for a car that doesn't even start. Short of hoping and praying that she pulls another stupid stunt and ends up wrecking the piece of shit herself, (which could very well end in injury or death on her behalf,) this would be the most humane way of dealing with it, correct?

495,"The title is the gist of it - we met, went on a some great dates with the intention to carry on seeing one another. I then had to go away for a couple months to have knee surgery and recover , and it was during this time he met someone else and had a fling that lasted a couple months. They only saw each other 4/5 times but slept together all those times.
We then had those months apart, still talking most days and keeping contact until we got back to the same city and picked up where we left off.

We are now 1 year into our (serious) relationship and he had every opportunity to bring it up and tell me, but today I saw in his deleted items folder some selfies that girl had sent him.
It absolutely crushed me because I KNEW who she was from some messages I had seen from her on his phone a while back and I got suspicious. 

He then next lied to my face, that those pictures were of a girl his friend was seeing. 
I felt like the Earth had moved beneath me. 
I didn’t know if they were in contact now again or what the story was. I tried to keep it together, not ruin our weekend away. 

I calmly asked over breakfast why he lied to me because I knew who that girl was. 
He then told me everything and burst out crying and assured me that it was well before we were official , he was very remorseful and was terrified to tell me because of how hurt he would make me,  but I feel like my heart and trust has been broken.
(The pictures were in his deleted folder because he said ‘our if respect for our relationship he didn’t want her on his phone any longer’).


Cheating is a NON NEGOTIABLE in my book, but somehow I don’t want this relationship to end and the ‘cheating’ was before we had made it official. Does that hold any weight? Am I buying into a whole bunch of shit because I’m in love?

This is my first relationship and I’ve been happy in it. I’m not sure how to move through this pain and what to do next. 

TL;DR - boyfriend slept a few times with a girl before we were official whose selfies I found in his deleted folder today. He assures they’re no longer in contact since a year ago when it happened. He lied and then I asked why he lied and he told me everything and was very remorseful. Not sure where to turn.

Our whole relationship is based on him cheating on me when I was pregnant, we got back together when our baby was born. I'm still working on forgiving him. We have been living together for more than a year now. 

I'll explain a situation that happened this morning, from my point of view and I need advice on what I should do next. (I dont have many friends) 

Last night, I asked my bf if I could sleep in, because he usually sleeps in almost every morning. He agreed and things being what they are my toddler wouldn't let me go back to bed (She spends most of the time with me, so she has a preference with me). 
So I got up, starting taking care of her, had breakfast etc. While he was on his computer watching a show, I started cleaning around, my LO started getting wild jumping on the couch as I am trying to clean it and got very frustrated. I put her down in the corner because she wasn't listening. And I left in my room to cool off for a minute. I locked the door knowing it is very easy for her to open it. 
Next thing I know her father comes to the room wondering why I would leave him alone with his daughter, is faced to a locked door and he got very mad. He started banging on the door and screaming asking why I would lock the door and leave him in there alone with her. I just screamed back for him to leave me alone. He called me a bitch, walked away and I started cleaning in the room in peace.

He says it was ordered to his house back home (we are dorming) &amp; it’s been over a month. It’s making me question why I spent so much money on a product that he is NOT using. Like if his old laptop is so fucked, why can’t you use the other one? Like do I have a right to be mad? He said he could have been more lenient but was mad I was asking for $50 back lol (because that’s petty apparently) lolll. So I paid him and he was like oh you just gave me the money (but he was being really mean about is so ofc I would lol) anyways, why is he not using his new laptop , why did I spend money if it wasn’t necessary or urgent??

501,"To start things off, my boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for around 3 years now. I have always struggled to be open and honest with anyone in general, which I think came from having a lot of trust issues growing up. Parents split up when I was in my early teens and I got into a number of really bad relationships. Throughout all of this, I have had one friend that always stuck by my side regardless of what happened.


For context, SO and I have always struggled to keep our sex life alive. It is both of our faults, we have tried discussing things multiple times but it always ends up the same which is something we should definitely have kept at more. A couple of months ago I was talking to my best friend, at this point in time I feel like my sexual needs were not being met and I didn't feel wanted. Things ended up getting a little heated between my best friend and I, although we did not go all the way because I stopped things, what I did I would basically consider cheating. My SO had suspicions something was going on with me one day, asked me to be 100% truthful and honest so I ended up telling him what I did. He took it as I expected, he has always been a very kind person and is level headed when it comes to extreme situations such as this. He wasnt angry at me, more disappointed and upset that I backstabbed him with someone whom he thought he could trust. He of course wants nothing to do with my best friend anymore. I know he wanted to give me an ultimatum but if I'm being honest, I dont think I could do that to my best friend and he knows that. I've talked to my best friend and asked if he has feelings for me, his response was I'm just his closest friend that he wholeheartedly cares for and nothing more. That obviously didn't waver my SOs feelings about him, I know I would feel the same. 


I fucked up so bad. He has been the only person I feel like I have ever truly, genuinely loved and cared for but I destroyed his trust completely. From what I've gathered, he doesn't want to break things off. I am worried about the future of our relationship and his mental health especially. I took the weekend to myself but I still feel so lost. I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",17Nov2019,1

So I want to try sonething completely new and instead of having a list of exercises I need to do or books I need to read that I end up feeling stressed because I don't find the time, that maybe I should just drop everything and work on getting to know me.

My dad (who hadn't been around in 10 years prior to my mums death) stepped up and was brilliant. Christmas  is still a sore spot for me as I'm constantly reminded that shes gone . But this year I've suddenly been uninvited to christmas at my dads.

519,"Several months ago my wife and I found a job posting for a position on the west coast that is similar to hers.  We live in the north-east and she decided to apply for it just to see what would happen.  At first I was extremely excited for her and was really pushing for her to pursue it.  After two interviews it actually happened and she was offered the job.  Honestly at this point I feel like we hadn't taken it completely seriously and we agreed that she should accept the offer.  We were both so excited that I don't think we ever considered the negative consequences.  Ever since then I've had a sinking feeling that I can't get rid of.

We have a two year old daughter and right now my biggest concern is how the move will effect her.  We are extremely close with my family and they live nearby.  Both of my parents retired last year and were excited to get to spend time with our daughter.  Ever since we announced that we're moving they've been completely heart-broken.  Every time I think about how they feel right now it's making me sick.  I also have a younger sister and nephew who we visit often.  I feel like I'm making a huge mistake pulling her away from our family.

Part of me is still excited about the move but it's being drowned out by fear and anxiety.  I just can't shake the feeling that this was a terrible decision.  My wife has already put in her notice at work and we still have a couple months before the move.  I'm afraid that we're already fully committed and if I tell my wife that I'm having second-thoughts she'll won't be able to forgive.  I honestly wouldn't blame her because I feel like up until this point I was really pushing her to do this.

What I really need is advice on how to handle this.  Do I suck it up and continue with the move or do I tell my wife I'm having doubts?  I don't really feel like I have anyone that I can talk to about this so any advice is appreciated.",17Nov2019,1
520,"Hey there, r/advice! I'm in a bit of a strange situation with my job hunt. 6 months after graduating from university, I finally found some jobs  in my hometown of San Diego that have made offers to me.

One is ACES and the other is MeBe. Both are behavioral therapy organizations that send registered behavioral therapists to family homes with autistic people aged 1-25.

ACES was the first job I interviewed for offering part time at $20 per hour. Due to the appointment based nature of the job, it's not unusually for clients to cancel, meaning I wouldn't necessarily have steady work. However, ACES has informed me of the intensive training I would undergo to prepare for my role as a behavioral therapist and for the RBT (registered behavioral therapist) exam. Training at ACES is 30 days long. That's great!

In terms of a job offer, they were less forthcoming. They did not offer me a job in writing, which bothered me, but I did highly appreciate them breaking down the training and expectations of me for being prepared to do my job properly. I've responded to the ACES email asking them whether I'll be an At-Will employee and any other essential components that should be included in a job description.

MeBe on the other hand is much the same. However, they have ensured me I would receive a pretty great support system, get paid for last minute client cancellations, and have the option to go full time once availability opens up for me to be able to. However, training at MeBe is a startling 9 days short compared to that of ACES 30 day long training.

MeBe offered me a job in writing which I highly appreciate. However, I'm bothered by their lack of clarity on the exact rigors of the job. Dealing with autistic people means dealing with danger sometimes. There is kicking and screaming, and just a lot of tiring aspects that go into the job description which was fully discussed at ACES. However, MeBe discussed none of this. MeBe is also At-Will so I'm thinking they may have high turnover. I've responded to their offer letter asking them more about preparing me for the RBT exam and dealing with the most physical of autistic kids. I also emailed them about amending their offer to bump me up to $20 to match ACES offer. 

In the hiring manager's pitch, she expressly focused on MeBe as having a great internal employee support system. It's the employee's ideal company. ACES on the other hand was no BS, but no formal job offer in writing except for the ACES manager emailing me how much she'd pay me.

I want you to understand I'm in a situation where I MIGHT be going to Japan next year in September. I'm not telling either company that though. My goal is to save $8,000 before then. MeBe seems to offer more job stability even though it's At-Will but did not clarify the rigors of the job or how much I'd need to prepare to become a behavioral therapist. At-Will would also work great for me because I could quit any time I want.

ACES is wishy washy with their offer letter but has an office very close to where I live in San Diego county (because traffic through San Diego proper is a nightmare which is where I would have to travel to often for MeBe) yet are more forthcoming with job expectations. Are they At-Will? Why can't they offer me a job in writing?

 This all bugs the shit out of me and I need your guys advice so I can put together a game plan. I obviously need a job. Due to the nature of each program, I can only choose one though. I will receive a checkup call on Tuesday from ACES about their offer. I have until Wednesdays to respond to the offer letter from MeBe. 

So what do you recommend, community? Should I follow up with MeBe first come Monday since I'll get a call Tuesday from ACES anyway? I want to make sure they respond to my email replies about their offers. 

Thanks, all!",17Nov2019,1

524,"I’m currently living with my ex boyfriend/baby daddy in his grand mother’s house. 
I moved in because I got pregnant and had no where else to go at the time. 
Before I lived here I lived on my dad’s off grid property.. hauling water , using gas generators , cooking outside , outhouses... it was do able. It is do able. 
But it’s a lot of work especially with a soon to be toddler 
Anyway, I left my dads property initially because of a very very stressful situation where him and I threw blows at eachother one day over the fact his dog was “raping” my puppy. It went on to how all the female poms had to be fixed (6 out of 13 throughout our family) but the males didn’t have to be to because they need to keep their masculinity. Well as ridiculous as it sounds, it was. So I “talked back” 😂 and he got me to the ground. I’m 5 ft tall. I’m almost helpless. Lmao
And I was. (Every time this had happened) So I left the property I lived on for 5 years BY MYSELF , OFF GRID since I was 14 — (before that my father and I lived in his semi trucking long haul for 4 years)— and went with my baby daddy. 
First to a place he had just gotten that wasn’t suitable for me (druggies lived there) and then to my moms garage where we were evicted by the neighbors because it wasn’t a livable environment and then lastly to his grandmas. 
Well I’ve been here almost 2+ years I think, and him and I split up and this and that and I just want to be out of here. 
I have a part time job and only make like 250 a month cause I only have a babysitter for a couple days a week 
So I have no savings really since I buy groceries since my food stamps got cut off and all of my child’s stuff and more. 

I have apartment applications put in but it’s a tiny town I live in and they’re all pretty occupied. And even if I got approved how would I pay for the deposits on utilities and rent? 
I thought about a title loan but I couldn’t pay that and interest back in time with only having a sitter a couple days a week. 
My therapist said I should look into a mobile home for my dads property 
Since my dad went and decided to get married the same day I left his property so he’s been a completely changed man, but how long will that last? I know this man. 
But if I had some living thing (rv , mobile home, tiny house, shed renovated to live in) of my own it shouldn’t be sooo bad...
He made me a 12*12 - 144 square foot cabin he made out of a storage shed 
That my step brother and step mom now live in since I moved out. 
(My dad is a long haul trucker he stays gone 4 months and comes home for 1 month) .. so the property seems pretty legit if I could figure something out. 
My life coach said I should start a Go Fund me and see how much help I can get. Maybe a mobile home? Another tiny house? I don’t know. And I just don’t want to waste anyone’s time if it’s not a legitimate need. And he recommended grants. 
How do I find a grant for housing online that isn’t a scam? 
I only have internet access through my phone right now and my baby would wail in a quiet library 😫😫 
Do you guys have any ideas on what I should do or how I should go about things? 
Even a stay at home job that I can do in my situation that isn’t a waste of time

I'm currently 20 years old and have roughly $50k saved up. I've been running an eCommerce business since I was 18 which allowed me to save this up. Due to this eCommerce business, I was able to start consulting others and start a Youtube channel. In addition, the eCom store gave me tons of knowledge in advertising, marketing, copywriting, and so much more. This is why I have this much saved up as of right now.

The thing is, I'm currently not going to college as I ""dropped out"" for a year to focus on improving my businesses thinking I could take them far. My main eCommerce store has stopped performing as well so I am planning on selling it and starting a brand new one (currently already up and running). But due to this, my main source of income is Youtube and affiliate links from Youtube, which generate $1000 to $1.5k.

I have a car payment, which I leased for my Youtube channel (~10k subs) since it's in every youtube video (tax write-off) and it's roughly $416/mo. In total, my monthly expenses are about $500 as I live very frugally and spend as little as possibly everywhere else. I'm just wondering whether I should consider going back to college again or continue working on what I have?

I’d say it’s been a few weeks and we only recently had the “we’re dating talk.” Admittedly we got physical pretty fast (haven’t had sex though), but we’ve known each other a few months and spent a lot of time around each other. We made out in my car and he left marks on my neck, which my parents saw.

They are upset for multiple reasons (not telling them yet so now I’m a liar, letting a guy “use” me/ being desperate, visible marks, i’m in my first semester of a tough program so shouldn’t date rn, think i’ll ruin my reputation, etc.)

They think he preyed on me because I told them that he was inexperienced (while I was actually more experienced than him). I genuinely believe him based on his inability at first to pick up my fliration cues, the bad/awkward first kiss, etc. Tbh we’ve kissed a lot and I’ve given him feedback and it’s gotten so much better in a short span of time.        

They think he intentionally marked me and is more experienced than he said. I think it wasn’t purposeful and I wanted him to and asked him to kiss my neck because I like the way it feels. It was also dark so it is quite feasible that he did not see them. My dad sees him leaving marks on my neck as huge disrespect to him.

My dad has also made threats about what he would do to him and says that leaving marks on me is major disprect. He also said that I’m gonna do what I want anyway, mentioned whether I was going to introduce him, and also said that he is not and will never be okay with him because he disrespected me by leaving marks and therefore disrespected my dad.

Anyway, my parents are going through a divorce and I feel like they are playing tug-of-war over me. I know my mother would be devastated if I were to go and study in Rome. My father would say that it is fiscally irresponsible. 

I’ve done some digging and the tuition would be the same as it would be at home. I have a wide range of potential scholarship opportunities at the American University of Rome from what I’ve seen by researching. I would also be allowed to get a job with the visa that I need. It sounds so crazy but there’s something in me telling me to apply. The only thing holding me back is my parents. Honestly, my worst nightmare would be to not take this opportunity and look back and wish that I had. Thoughts? Thank you.",17Nov2019,1

I just found out a couple of days ago that my dad isn't my biological father, my parents confessed it to me. I don't know really how to take this or process it. I know it doesn't change anything but it feels like my whole world is coming down on  me. I don't know what to do. I can't even look at my dad without thinking about it. I have decided i don't want to know anything else about it, nor do i want to meet my biological father but still, i just wish they wouldn't have said me anything.

538,"This is a bit of a fucked up story, but basically when I was around 12/13 my mother held a knife to my throat and almost killed me. She was standing behind and had me in a head lock and held the knife sharp against my throat. I’ll fill in some details.

So when I was kid I was put in to foster care because my mother had a terrible drug problem (Meth). She had always struggled with one type of addiction or another. She had managed to sober herself up and my family (step father, twin sister, older brother and older sister) and I, lived a pretty peaceful life until my sister and I got involved in some very serious drama. She didn’t take any drugs during this time but she was scattered emotionally and psychologically. About a year later my eldest sister got pregnant at 13 by her boyfriend and was forced to abort it. This sent my mother over the edge. I don’t remember much but looking back on the situation at the time now, it was very obvious that she was taking drugs.

Anyways, so fast forward about 4 years and at this point my mother is heavily, HEAVILY into drugs. We lost our home (foreclosure) because of her drug problem. She was spending thousands and thousands of dollars every week. My step father was earning around $200K a year at his FIFO job but had to quit because it was too stressful with everything going on at home. There was a lot of DV in my household for a very long time but I can only ever remember my mother putting her hands on me once (she pushed me when I was about 8 because I was saying very nasty things to her and I fell back and hit my head). This night was different tho. About 2 weeks earlier she had failed her second suicide attempt and she was very very very fragile mentally. A fly moving past her face could set her off. She was heavily drugged up and she could barely stand or talk, but she was in such an angry mood - I swear she was thirsty for blood. So my step father and her started arguing and it got pretty bad, I don’t remember much but I remember getting in between the two because she had a knife if her hand. I told her to stop, and I always protected her, so I yelled even harder at my step father to just go somewhere else and that he was always causing the fights and that he was the problem. I was always very mean to him in these situations but only because I didn’t want to get on the wrong side of my mother. Either way, it didn’t work and she put me into a headlock and put the knife to my throat. She eventually dropped it and I forget it happened for a very long time.

This was all about 4-5 years ago and I’m grown up now. My mother has only just very recently (Jan of this year) gotten herself sober and stable. She has a full time job, a grandson, and her marriage to my step father is absolutely amazing. They haven’t argued in over a year, and they go on dates and are very flirty - a couple truly in love. The problem is though, I still remember what happened and how I was treated as a kid (for my 13th birthday I got A (singular) Spider-Man Wii game (I didn’t like Spider-Man, and the wii was like 5 years out of date at this point) that still had the $4.99 sticker on it). She acts like nothing ever happened which I can understand wanting to move past that part of your life. However, she always comments on how I never interact with the family or make an effort to see them, and how we only live once and blah blah, but honestly I find it very hard to be comfortable around her, or anyone else in my family for that matter. Am I the asshole her for not wanting to be apart of my family? I mean sure, I do love them, but I have very bad anxiety, and there’s so much stuff that has happened that I don’t feel like my family are my family if that makes sense? My mother has been very open and honest with me this year, and she is genuinely trying to make amends but I can’t see it happening. Any thoughts or options would be really helpful and sorry it’s so long

TLDR; my bipolar (diagnosed) mother once held a knife to my throat in a drug induced psychotic episode. 5 years later, I feel disassociated from my family and my mother believes I don’t make enough of an effort to see her or my other siblings. She has never apologised, but she has always been there for me in my darkest hours. It was the worst moment in our relationship but I still find it very hard to move on from it all. Am I an asshole kid for loving his mother, but not really interested in having a relationship or being apart of my family at all?",17Nov2019,1
539,"Okay so. This is gonna be kinda long, and I might add a little useless information, Buuut I just wanna paint a good picture so I know what to do. 


I’ve known this guy from Facebook dating for about 15 days. We went on a double date at first, and kinda split from my friend an his friend and we had a blast. We had a lot in common, the vibe was fun, I wasn’t uncomfortable at all. But I also showed up stoned, and I also made sure to get comfortably intoxicated because I have a lot of anxiety if I’m sober an I’m just kinda awkward sometimes.

So we’ve been talking a lot since then, but it started to get kinda fast. I smoke a lot, so every time I’d be really stoned I’d kinda move faster than if I was sober. And I realized I was being misleading when we both got stoned together on our second date and he went to kiss me goodbye and it ended up with his tongue down my throat for like five minutes and him pulling my hair and me being too anxious to be like ew I don’t wanna do this and just going with it.
So after that I texted him and explained to him I feel like my last relationship genuinely did some damage on me and I’m just scared to be physical and I’d really like to keep us platonic for now, and see if something naturally happened between us. I didn’t even want to consider it dates, I just wanted us to hangout and have fun.
I told him he could date other people if he didn’t wanna wait to see or anything, but even after our talk he’d ask if I thought there was a future for us or if I had feelings for him and I just don’t know any of that and wanna get to know each other lol.
I felt like was ready to try again, but I am traumatized by some of the things that happened in my past relationship.  I can’t even say no sometimes because I’m so anxious if possible confrontation. *he hasn’t even shown me signs of being angry or anything my ex just had bad anger issues an stuff.* 

Okay, so the third time hanging out happened yesterday. He came over to go to the zoo with my friend and I. The entire time he’d make comments, he’d try to hold my hand, he’s just extremely physical. He’d also say stupid things that were immature and at times I felt like I was talking to a 13 year old. And I don’t think he’s necessarily some creep or anything. I just really think one of his love languages is just physical connection. But I also think maybe it just isn’t gonna work out between us and I’d like to be straight up just friends who hangout and maybe I’m just not ready to date. 

From just reading this, I just need advice on what to do. Sometimes he does really say the sweetest and most supportive things. He already got me a Christmas present and my friend told me it’s something really heartfelt and thoughtful. And I got him one too.
But overall, I have to be stoned to feel comfortable and be on his level. When I’m sober I’m just the complete opposite most of the time when we’re actually together.
Should I be upfront about how I’m feeling and just say maybe we should just stick to straight up friends but maybe be a little more clear that I don’t want to date..?
Or maybe should I just give it a little time and see if maybe it could be something I could make work an be happy an I just have to get comfortable..? 
I’m sorry this was so long and thank you for the help. I just don’t wanna make a rash decision and make things more complicated for myself.",17Nov2019,1

My school called them and said if I didn't get help they'd call CPS and that's how I got help. My therapist said that not eating to lose weight is a normal teenage girl thing and I was really annoyed when she said that because I just told her I cried for eating lunch and she basically told me to not starve myself because it's not healthy but also there's nothing wrong with me for doing it because it's normal. I'm also nonbinary and my parents are transphobic as hell. Last week they both sat me down and told me that I am a girl just because I don't shave. Anyway, my therapist just told me that I shouldn't be upset when they make fun of me for trying to be masculine because they're making fun of me for looking like a boy and that's my goal. She also told me that men and women aren't that different and basically that gender is a social construct.

543,"Hi,

When I \[M/21/USA\] started college, I majored in Physics with the hope of later attending grad school to study Astronomy. Soon after arriving, I learned that my college gave free music lessons to students that majored in music. I had been interested in studying an instrument for a long time, and took on the double major (the course load for a music major is very light).

In the next 2 years I found myself completely bombing out of my physics and calculus courses, forcing me to major solely in music. During this time I learned that music was a very poor major for someone with social anxiety, as the field basically requires you to enthusiastically seek out opportunities to perform in front of others. That, as well as my lack of interest in ""academic"" music (classical, jazz, blues, etc.) makes it seem impossible for me to make a carrier out of my major, not even factoring in the extremely low salary those with my major end up with on average after graduation.

I am going to be graduating in a few months, and honestly have no idea what I should do once I get out. I am bisexual and have extremely religious and conservative parents who restrict almost every aspect of my life when I'm at home (no internet usage, 10 PM curfew, etc.) and live in a very rural area with a rapidly collapsing retail and manufacturing-based economy. I have about 2,000 saved up from the few part-time jobs I've been able to find over the last 5 years but I have no idea how I'm supposed to handle my debt as well as make a living after I've messed up so badly.

TL;DR: I'm graduating in a major with no job prospects in a place with no job prospects and no money/life prospects whatsoever.",17Nov2019,1

545,"I have started to worry about my mom lately. She works out a lot and eats very little.  

She works out almost everyday, at least 5-7 days a week. She then usually walks 5-8km and then works out on our machine at home. She has sleep problems and back problems, and even when her back problems is really bad she still works out (and i tell her to please take it easy) .  

She almost never eats a proper dinner, she usually eats two hard sandwiches and tea. A lot of the times she just drinks a smoothie for lunch or something else very small. I have seen her eat proper meals, but most of the times (especially for dinner) she doesn’t eat proper meals. I have tried to tell her that eating two sandwiches for dinner or drinking a smoothie is not good for you, but she gets really angry and upset every time i bring it up. It’s like she doesn’t understand what i mean.  

Sometimes she looks skinny, and sometimes she looks underweight and that’s when i get really worried. She looks super small and i have even told her that sometimes, i tell her “mom you look really skinny, i’m worried about you” I also know that she is slightly underweight right now because we weighted ourselves a week ago. She then said “i need to gain a few pounds” and later that day we were grocery shopping and she bought a bunch of low calorie things. 

She eats pizza, hamburgers, sweets and stuff like that still so that makes me think that she might not have an eating disorder.  

I don’t know, maybe i’m overreacting. But she has had anorexia in the past and that makes me worry. It’s great that she is working out, i love that, but together with eating so little and working out a lot, that is obviously not good. She is also a vegetarian so that makes it even harder to get the proper calories, protein etc that you need. She refuses to listen to me.",17Nov2019,1

548,"A coach of mine is under investigation for emotional and physical abuse of their athletes. They were placed on leave for several months but then were returned to work. The verdicts from the hearings (yes multiple) have not yet been disclosed. 

Several articles about this issue have been released. When it was first disclosed in the press our sports team had a meeting with the board directors. We were told nothing of substance except to trust the process. They also explicitly stated that they were not aware of the allegations when the athletes first filed the complaints with the same directors (let’s call them AA) but were turned away. 

I recorded the meeting to make a transcript for missing team mates and also to let the AA know how admin is responding. After months of lack of transparency and frustration and with witnessing admin follow through with a flawed process by supporting a coach fully without them being cleared of the allegations (short version),  I consented for the recording to be used in a follow up journal article. The purpose was to (1) reveal how flawed the process was to the current athletes, the program itself, and of course my former teammates who had been ostracized and ignored and (2) support the movement being made towards a safe sport environment. (Talked with lawyers and was legal due to one-party consent)

This was a tough decision to make but I stand by it as I was able to support the athletes being silenced. I merely kickstarted a conversation that was bound to happen. However, when the article was released there was a lot of backlash from the team. I will be owning up to actions and state my reasoning to them (I knew that leaving the team was a possible reality if I had no support/no improvements were made) but I want to also address their feelings as well. Many feel hurt, angry, betrayed, violated, the list goes on because their words were used without their individual consent. They feel like they can’t trust any person on the team now. While I do not feel guilty for releasing the tape, I feel sorry for hurting my current team mates in the process. 

Any advice on how I can respond to their feelings when I own up to my actions? I will be making a list of why I did it and express my concerns - but what else? 

TLDR: Athletes filed a claim against an abusive coach. Administration returned them to work despite no verdict. Released a tape showing how flawed their return to work process was and how athletes were being silenced. Need advice on how to communicate  to those who feel betrayed and angry by releasing the tape.",17Nov2019,1

It's getting pretty bad to the point where if I talk about a new comic, or TV show or video game that came out he will tell all of us that we are wasting our time and that, that form of entertainment is for the weak minded. The irony is that I study physics for a living and whenever it comes up he becomes defensive and says that why would he waste his time learning what equation are saying like me, when he should be giving credit to the one who created it all.

553,"Just a bit of context, I was raised in a very white neighbourhood in a middle class family. I do not at all consider myself a racist/sexist/homophobic individual.

I was dating a girl for a few months. I'd like to say this was quite serious, we had both said 'I love you', she had visited my family, and I even flew to a different country (unspecified for anonymity) to visit her family. I was really quite in awe of everything about her. 

Then, very unexpectedly, she told me that she had slept with somebody else after a night out with her friends. This really crushed me. Although likely a terrible move on my part, I was obsessively asking her details, such as where was it, what did he look like, what was so good about his personality etc. It came to light that he was 6 foot 7 (2 metres) tall, muscular and black.

Realistically this man has done nothing wrong. He has gone to a club, spoken to a girl, and slept with her on a one night stand. I doubt he even knew she had a boyfriend. However, I do of course feel a resentment within me because he slept with my (then) girlfriend. Since this happened, whenever I see black men (especially taller / with a large physical stature) I seem to be getting slightly racist thoughts. Nothing aggressive or malicious, but I am judging these people without ever having spoken to them. I am immediately reminded of what happened, and it makes me feel angry/betrayed etc and I feel this being directed towards them. Because I am aware of this, I don't actually DO anything to reflect these thoughts, as these people have of course done nothing wrong. However, I am concerned because I cannot control these thoughts and I really do not want to be like this.

In terms of feeling emasculated, yes, definitely. I am 6 foot (183cm) tall and relatively muscular, so I am not used to feeling so small in comparison. However, I am not feeling my anger directed to tall muscular white guys, so I don't know if this is exactly the root of the problem.

He's 19, I'm 15. Back when I was little, it was my father, step dad, or mum who hurt me physically, but then he started doing it too. Eventually, my mum broke up with my step dad, I stopped seeing my dad, and I became stronger than my mum.


He's the only person who I see everyday who's capable of hurting me. And he has hurt me. He's cornered me in the stairs, and kicked me until he was dragged off. He's broken down many of my doors in a fit of rage, trying to get to me. When I was younger, I lived in fear of him. I was a flinching mess.


Now...Now I'm just tired. About a year ago, he threw his shit into my room because I was taking too long in the bathroom.


Also, he's racist, transphobic, sexist...the works.


Any way, we only saw each other for ten minutes today. It was whilst waiting for our mum to dish up dinner. He shoved his hands into my neck multiple times (Which hurts) he pushed me hard into a wall with plug sockets in, which really hurt, and he stuck some chewing gum on me. He also misgendered me.


(Yes, I'm trans, my pronouns are he/him.)


Now, when he's gotten really violent, death threats and all, I've called the police. I actually had to use my old phone to do it, because when I started dialling, my mum realised and took my phone away. She has a ""don't snitch on familly"" mindset.


When the police got here, they said it was sibling rivalry, and to be nice to my brother.


Let me make myself clear, this guy was barging into my door over and over and over again, shouting death threats, and throwing things at me through the gaps he had punched and kicked into my door, and in response, the police told me to be nice to him.


So, I have animals. I have budjies, rabbits, and cats. I can't leave them. That's why I haven't found somewhere else to stay. I can't afford them by myself,whoever agreed to let me stay with them would have to pay for them, and we all know that that's an unrealistic expectation.

562,"So I’m currently a junior in college, and during my freshman year my parents came to visit me to tell me that my mom was leaving my dad. This made my freshman year very difficult for me. 

(For context throughout the story, I live with my dad at home, my mom left my dad because she wasn’t happy anymore)

For the past two years I had to decide who I was going to spend the holidays with. My dad would guilt me if I said I was going to see my mom, and my mom would guilt me if I said I was staying home. It messed me up big time. I don’t particularly have a good relationship with my mom since everything, so I don’t really want to spend the holidays with her anymore, but again, she guilts me if I say no to her. 

I used to love the holidays. But now I hate looking forward to them. I don’t want to deal with the guilt that I’ll get from both of my parents on my decision. I would rather not celebrate the holidays at all any more. But I know it’ll hurt both of them if I tell them that. 

They both see the holidays as a chance to spend time with family (as do everyone), but it to me it feels like their chance to mentally fight over me. 

How do I tell them this without hurting their feelings, or making them upset at me? 

tldr; my parents split in my freshman year, currently a junior, always had to choose who I spent the holidays with, was guilt tripped either way.",17Nov2019,1
564,"I'ma 28F, who struggles with disassociation due to trauma. I have very cyclical depression, and mood swings, and I also have strong reason to believe I am undiagnosed ADD, as I desperately try to stay organized, focused, and determined, and fall short on a daily basis. My mother is diagnosed with ADHD as well, and I have heard it is hereditary. I have looked several times into mental health help, but I quickly get overwhelmed. I feel that medication is something I only recently have considered might greatly benefit me (in the past I have been very opposed), but I don't really know how to find a doctor that not only will help me in finding a balance with medication, but will also spend time listening to me, and helping me work through things out loud. From what I'm seeing in my area, there are a lot of nurse practitioners that are psychiatrists, but the descriptions of the work they do is very medication focused, and doesn't sound very conversation heavy... This concerns me a lot, because I don't want to just be given medication and expected for that to sort itself out. I have a lot of internal baggage that I need to say out loud to someone who can listen effectively and give me feedback, with more objectivity than friends or family -- I have a very difficult time being candid with my loved ones about my inner thoughts, and it is not their job to listen without judgement, especially when it relates to them specifically.  


Should I look into therapy rather than psychiatry, and think about medication later? Or do psychiatrists do both medication management and ""therapizing"", and I just have the wrong impression?",17Nov2019,1

I’m more concerned about my personal trajectory, and hopefully the Proffesional/career will take after my mental state, and honestly both of them are in shambles.

I’ve realized that I’m recognizing the things that are causing me to hurt, and feel dumb for bringing them in to myself, but I feel like I’m just a prisoner to my thoughts. My mind is always racing trying to find solutions to my problems, and I’ll think about them over and over again, trying to imagine different scenarios and going into them deeply which usually just makes me feel like shit again.  

It’s always like a cluster in my head, and if I’m not doing anything, left to my own devices, or feel bad in the moment, I start going down this slope of negativity and I just start tearing myself down.

573,"My ex (19f) and I (19f) were best friends for 10 years and then dated for another two. I had been heavily bullied as a child so I didn't really connect with anybody until late high school, but she had always been there for me and we were inseperable. When I came out I asked her out and she said yes. It was a good relationship; we didn't fight, my parents loved her since they always had, I already was super close with her family. 

Once I started college the distance was miserable, and we both changed as people. It didn't really click as a romance anymore.  We broke up because I wanted to grow and change in college and I felt like things would only get harder from there, but we had no animosity towards each other and are both now happily dating other people.

Since then I've hung out with her in groups, which was great, and accidentally once alone in my house when other people flaked, which was weird. We do a presentation for high schoolers and doing that was much more comfortable, it felt like I could joke around with her like normal. After they presentation we started messaging a little on social media; replying to stories on Snapchat, memes on Instagram, etc. It's not romantic or flirty in any way... She shares my sentiments about how hard it is to lose your best friend of your whole memorable life. 

It's been a year since the breakup and I have a boyfriend. He didn't really like us hanging out alone, especially that time in my house. He does understand how much I miss having female friends though, cause I don't have many at school either. I love him a lot so this isn't like he's being an ass or anything, I'm trying to respect his requests... 

I don't know what to do. I miss my best friend so much, but I don't want to make my boyfriend uncomfortable. I know there's zero romantic interest for either of us anymore, so I want to just hang out with her again and joke around like we used to. Is that weird? Should I even be trying to do this?

576,"So, I'm a gay guy in an open relationship. I have been seeing a guy for a few months. His friend  from India is staying over at his place. He said that the Indian friend was sleeping on the sofa but today, I found out that they were sleeping in the same bed for a week. I told them both off. I told the Indian guy that even if that's common in India, that is incredibly fucked up and he should have known better since he travels around the world. The guy said that they didn't have sex (which I doubt) but that's not my issue here. 

At one point, when my BF's friend came over when I was in his house, the friend said he was tired and went to sleep in the bed. I told my BF what was up with that and my BF said that he'd wake up the guy up later and said that because my BF and I were in the living room, he understands his friend just sleeping in the bed. I thought the logic was a bit weird there but because sleeping with a friend in the same bed, even if they were having sex, is completely unthinkable in my mind, I didn't pursue it further. 

I do think that my BF is the type that would lie to avoid confrontation. And I can see the Indian friend just sleeping in the bed as a given and him not deciding to make a fuss. But a week!? Even if it was completely platonic, that is completely fucked. 

I left the place cuz there's nothing more I can do after telling both of them off. I don't want to deal with the BF for lying straight to my face. Can I just block my BF and tell him to contact my friend to get his money back (he bought a ticket for a trip) instead of seeing him again?

579," I know that title sounds depressing, but I can assure you I am not depressed lol. Basically what I mean is everything I love to do, is hard to make a living out of. Right now I am currently in college and just switched my major to Marketing/advertising because its something I genuinely enjoy doing, but the average pay isn't all that great. So, my next option was YouTube. 

Okay don't cringe yet hear me out. I love technology and I love talking about technology, so I created a YouTube channel(""Preston's Thoughts"") where I just talk about technology news etc. And as of right now I only have 25 subs. Making review videos and just talking about technology makes me happy considering it still falls under the realm of marketing and advertising so I absolutely love doing it(although in high school I was put down for trying to start a YouTube channel by classmates so this is like my 3rd attempt at starting a channel). I have only been at it for about 2 months now, but it makes me wonder if I will ever even grow enough to make a living off of it. Maybe I'm being to hard on myself and expecting immediate results or for me to go viral or something idk. 

Something I absolutely love doing is photography it's like just so much fun to capture those precious moments life gives us that we can just look back on whenever we want to. I also make photography related videos on my channel as well, but yet again I run into the same problem, can I make a living out of this, how do I know I will actually be successful.

581,"I'm a photographer and I keep letting my models ruin my photoshoots because I can't seem to say ""no"" or assert my idea properly.

For example, I did a Halloween shoot and I had planned for having only 2 models (Aly and Blu). Most of my posing ideas were for only two women, but pretty much last minute my one model contacts me and asks, ""Can we include my friend?"" Now her friend (we'll call her Cat) *is* a model I've been wanting to work with for a while, but again I didn't plan on 3 people. However, Aly has been known to get mad easily and I didn't want her to drop out of the shoot because I say no to Cat joining, so I say it's okay (though it really isn't). Well, we get to the location, with Aly, Blu, and Cat. Come to find out Cat had a show (she's a singer/performer) the night before and her feet hurt a lot. I told Aly and Blu forever ago to bring something easy to walk in as well as their dressier shoes because we were going to be walking around the location. Aly apparently didn't relay this to Cat, so Cat doesn't have proper walking shoes. Long story short, we ended the shoot earlier than expected and I got SHIT for pictures.

This isn't the only time either, it's just the best example honestly. I can't seem to assert myself and tell my models no. I don't know if it's because it's a TFP (trade for portfolio) and neither of us is getting paid and I don't feel like I have a right to say no, or if it's because I'm just afraid of rejection. **But does anyone have any advice on how I can assert myself without being a dick about it?**

And I know some people might want to say, ""A good photographer adjusts to changes!""

(But every redditor that knows something about this is obviously welcome)

...I'm not good at drawing and I don't exactly like it...it's not my thing, nor my talent

What I love the most are...

the stories

The stories they tell and the characters they show to which the viewers can relate to (see Steven Universe)...I'd love writing for them, and I'd love for more and more people who feel misunderstood, overlooked...to feel represented and loved, to know they're not alone

Sadly:

• I'm not in America...I'm very far from USA, the best schools are there tho, and they are really tough to get into, not only for their tests, but also for the limited number of international students...so this is already a great disadvantage...a BIG one, as most famous animators are American and they come from those schools (CalArts, NY School of Arts, Rhode Island, Tisch...)

• I don't have a portfolio...lots of ideas, but most in my mind, and they're all ""writing"" ideas

• I'm not super young anymore...Does animation industry prefers younger people?

• MOST IMPORTANTLY...you can't make a cartoon if you don't know how to draw well...you can't just have a story, but an execution too

• Animation is SUPER COMPETITIVE, some people started their works when they were 12 or 14...made a lot of contests and won them (like Rebecca Sugar) in high school...while I realized my dream too late...

There are people that are objectively wayy better than what I could ever make (adding some skills), both in writing and drawing, and they're younger too...so it may be a lost battle, at least, for me, cause the industry would rightfully choose them

~ ~

Now with that said...I still wanna do something in this beautiful world...

《《So, my questions are》》

• Is there someway you can work on 2D cartoons with ""important roles"" (obviously starting from entry level-jobs on other projects) even without drawing skills?

• Is there someone who works specifically in the animation/entertainment industry? What's your bachelor degree?

• an Economic/Business/Comunication degree, with a Master in something art related, could help?

• Are there any online course for overseas students you tried that could actually be very useful?

• Is there someone in animation history (aside from Walt Disney) that was more focused on the writing than on the drawing?

I know that I should work my butt off and start to learn to draw because that's not impossible...but I'd like to focus more on the """"skills"""" I already have and to know if, even if I fail at drawing and at writing too, I can still do something relevant in the industry (obviously I won't become famous like Pen Ward, Rebecca Sugar...)

It's not like I won't try to learn to draw, or to make a portfolio about my stories...but many doors (like important schools) are already closed...I'm trying to consider the ""Worst case scenario""

I wanna inspire people like those animators did, people felt represented, loved and accepted thanks to those cartoons...but if I'm not capable to achieve what they did, I still wanna be a part of it...I still wanna """"deliver something"""" to viewers",17Nov2019,1

Neither me or my gf have had a ‘nice’ upbringing. 
I’ve grown up around crime and have lost my father in a pretty tragic way as a child (id prefer not to talk about it but I will if it helps). I go to bed most times hearing gunshots but speaking to her helps me and she genuinely makes me happier than I’ve been in years. She’s my girl friend, best friend, therapist and the closest to a mother figure I really have. Because of her I’ve been sober for months now. I used to take whatever drug I felt like, cocaine the worst. She’s the person that keeps my head up and for some reason loves me no matter what I’ve said.
I’m not gonna go in depth with her problems because I don’t feel like I should expose them to the internet but her parents haven’t been the best together, she feels lonely, doesn’t see a reason why I love her and is sometimes awkward.
I’ve tried what feels like everything to try to help her realise how much I love her. Whenever we’re together I tell her that my greatest goal in life is to make her smile.

600,"My close friend is out of the state for a friend’s birthday trip. She and her bf have been together for almost 2 years and he moved into her house a few months ago. They’re in their early 30’s and one of his kids lives with them full time (and she’s never been a kid person before.) This is all to say this is a very serious relationship for her.

This morning I was swiping on Tinder and came across a profile of her boyfriend with pics of him from the past year -one of them from just a few weeks ago. It’s clearly not an old profile from his single days. Also, he had his first name on the profile, even tho he normally goes by his middle name.

606,"Hello,

I am a 22 year old college drop out. I am burdened by debt and deal with severe depression and anxiety. I live at home with my parents and work a job that I hate that doesn’t even pay the bills. 

I am currently about 50k in debt and struggling to get by. My bank account is in the negative and I haven’t been in a relationship since freshman year of college. 

My current job is in corporate and I am on a 35k salary. I work 645 to 415 and I work two Saturdays a month as well. 

At home my parents are always giving me shit that I need to buy my own stuff. I have my own phone bill, insurance, food, and I have to pay to use the laundry.

I was a pretty bright student, I had a great gpa, was in clubs and a fraternity and was living life. However I got real depressed when my grandma passed. I turned to alcohol, drugs and eventually self- harm. As a result I decided to drop out and move back home. 

But it still hasn’t been working for me. My job I hate and it takes up most of my day and life. I want to work somewhere else but I can’t seem to land a job anywhere. I studied supply chain, so I have been predominantly looking for a position in that field.

Not too mention I literally have one friend. And all he wants to do is go to bars and drink. I don’t mind the occasional bar trip, but I’d rather just chill, watch sports or just talk about life. My work friends all think I have a great life because my parents bless me with great clothes, I have all the trendy designer stuff. But I feel like I live a lie. 

I wish I could just start life over. New name, new body, new me.  

My question is, has anybody been in this position? Any Advice? Even just a step to move in the right direction?",17Nov2019,1
607,"For reason that I won't go into, I live with someone who exhibits a lot of narcissistic, controlling, and passive-aggressive behaviors.  Among these are an almost literal non-stop need to talk.  This person almost never shuts up.  He is always telling an anecdote, pointing out something he wants you to look at on TV, or just complaining.

This is so extreme that he has to talk even when he has \*(nothing\* to say just so that he has your attention.  He will speak nonsense, make weird noises, or sing songs.  He will repeatedly call out your name just to deliberately annoy you.  This is an adult man who just won't ever shut up.  And he takes pleasure in causing discomfort in his audience.

&amp;#x200B;

For the time being, I can't move or avoid this individual at home.  There is really nothing I can do to stop the behavior if he insists on it, but I'd appreciate advice on how to maintain my sanity in the meantime.

I don't feel comfortable around people that I do not know. With my debate club I had to go to this event where we would be recorded and eventually we would end up on TV. I skipped because the thought of being on TV made me anxious and I was scared that I was gonna look stupid and say smth stupid. So I didn't go. I also started HS this year so I had to make friends. I got invited to a birthday party that I didn't attend because I got scared of the amount of unknown people that would be there. It turned out to be great and my friends had a lot of fun and I regret it now. When I'm around people I'm not close to I just freeze and can't bring myself to join in on conversations.
One time when I was with my friends I felt this huge pressure on my chest and I felt incredibly anxious and confused. I didn't have a reason to feel like that, I was safe with my friends and I knew that. It felt like forever but it probably lasted for like 10 mins. I don't wanna be like this forever, I wanna relax and be social. I wanna have fun without any worries of what would people think and how would I look. I'm confused because I have no problems with being vocal in class when needed and don't mind speaking in front of the class. Any tips on how to open up around people?

She always ignores me and gives me the cold shoulder. She NEVER initiates with me or tries to talk to me. Whenever I try to talk to her or start a conversation, she is very short with me and she puts out a vibe like I am bothering her. When I walk in in the morning and I say good morning to her, she ignores me.

She avoids eye contact with me a lot, but on the rare occasion that we do make eye contact, she rolls her eyes at me. When me and a few of my coworkers are having a group conversation and I am speaking, she won't even look at me to acknowledge me speaking. When I respond to something she says or ask her a question she looks at my coworker next to me as if they are the ones speaking to her and asking her questions.

She is only like this towards me. She is very warm and friendly to everyone else. I don't know what it is about me that puts her off? I have been nothing but nice and respectful to her like I am with everyone else.

Around May, my friend and I had an argument and we didn’t talk for a couple of days. She said that I was ignoring her, I wasn’t but that’s not important. Anyway, during the time we weren’t speaking I would play with my other friend, but I still missed my friend.

Eventually, we made up and everything was going okay. But, when I would ask to play with her should would have an excuse. I didn’t want to make a big deal about it so I just ignored it and kept asking her to play. One time she asked me to play but I was out so I couldn’t.

That was the last time she asked me to play. I would ask her to play and she would gladly join me, but she has never asked me to play since the 31st of may. It’s November.

622,"I moved 6 hours away for for grad school and it’s my first semester here. My last living situation was a nightmare so I keep telling myself how much better this is and I did a really poor job of setting boundaries. 

We’re both grad students and overall we get along fine, honestly we hardly see each other bc of our schedules. She lived by herself last year and I think she got in the habit of not worrying about another person. She‘s sweet but messy and extremely unobservant. I’m kicking myself because when we first moved in together I told her she could use my stuff and that I’m pretty lax. I need to talk to her about some things and I dont know how without sounding naggy. I could afford to buy new stuff before I got to this apartment and really did get quite a bit bc I was under the impression they would last me through my last few years of college. Im not living with her next year which is good, but most of the stuff in our apartment is mine and I’m worried she’s going to ruin things that I honestly can’t afford to replace. Pls help. 

This is what I’ve talked to her about so far: 
1. She used a knife on my cheap nonstick coated griddle. It left huge gouges on it and I got rid of it. Although I’m fine with little scratches, you’re really not supposed to use them when they base metal is exposed bc it’s not healthy bc chemicals. Asked her to not use metal-on-metal on my pots and pans. She offered to replace it but I don’t use it hardly ever so it wasn’t worth it. I got it for like $3 and now it’s $25. 

2. Bills were due on October 28, kept asking about them and she didn’t tell me what I owed her til Nov 14. She told me that more bills would be due Nov 28. Had to ask her to please let me know ASAP because I live paycheck to paycheck on a part-time job and have other bills (yay grad school!).

3. Towards the end of the summer we were relying pretty heavily on keeping windows open so we weren’t using AC all the time. She was smoking a cig on the porch, right next to where my window is, so it was blowing in my face as I was laying in bed (right next to the window). Asked her to please give me a heads up or check to see if my window is closed when I’m not home so that it isn’t flowing into my room. 

4. We both moved in with vacuums. Hers broke prob 2 weeks ago, I asked her if it’s worked here before when she’s vacuumed and she said that she hadn’t tried before then. We moved here in August and both have pets (I have a cat, she has a dog that sheds a ton). She was surprised that I have been vacuuming and didn’t notice. She asked if she could use mine, I told her that’s fine as long as she empties it when she’s done. She used it, didn’t empty it, go figure. I’m worried if she doesn’t get in the habit of emptying it, it’ll get overfilled and break bc it’s from Aldi and again, I can’t afford to replace a vacuum. 

What I need to talk to her about:

1. I need her to either stop using my pots and pans or stop putting my cookware in the dishwasher. It leaves a nasty residue and they take 2 seconds to hand wash. 

2. She leaves food around the house (half-full bowl of noodles in the living room, half-full bowls of cereal in the kitchen, full cups of coffee on the table for days at a time) and leaves a TON of food in the sink strainer. She will leave for the weekend without doing her dishes. In general it’s fucking gross and I feel like I’m constantly cleaning up after her. 

3. Need her to wipe down the countertops after she cooks and leaves a mess. And clean more in general. I’d be totally open to a chore list or something. 

I’m not perfect at all, I’m honestly pretty messy but I keep my mess in my room. I don’t care what she does in her space but I can’t deal with the shared space nastiness. Our place is small. She’s super busy and really stressed with school, but I can’t keep making excuses for her. 

If you got this far and read through my lists, I appreciate it. I guess my advice request boils down to...
1. How do I keep asking her to stop doing gross shit, using my stuff in ways I don’t love,  or ask if we could implement a chore chart? 
2. Am I being too harsh?",17Nov2019,1

625,"Hey guys, update from an old post about shit roommates. Things had been working out for a little while, they're still very lazy and rarely do anything to make the place livable unless housing comes to inspect us. 

A new dilemma has arrived. One that is directly effecting my health more physically than mentally at this point. I've tried bringing it up many  many times but they don't seem to think it matters at all; how I'm doing, that is. 

The issue is as follows:

I have a new job at a supermarket and am in training every weekend from 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. (There's one person in the dept. and she works those hours so I can't be trained after my college classes). This puts me in an awkward position since I have class from 11:30 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. so I'm not tired around 7 p.m.-ish, when I can get a decent 6 hours+ of sleep. This isn't the issue, what ensues during the night from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. is what's distressing me. 

You see, none of my roommates are over the age of 21, but they purchase large quantities of alcohol from someone a state away. They don't want to drink any of it during the week as they have classes (obviously) and don't want to be hung over. So this leaves them with 2 choices: Don't drink it and drink on the weekend. 

They aren't the kind of mellow drinkers some people can be, they are aggressive, loud, angry and destructive drinkers. We don't host parties but they make it sound like there's one in their room, the living room/kitchen and in the bathrooms. 

I don't have a problem with alcohol, but when I have to stay up for over 24 hours because of it, increasing my chances of illness, not excluding heart disease (runs in the family). I have enough stress and sorrow as it is without them doing this, I really can't handle any more. I'm going to try to move in with my best friend and his old lady at the end of the month, at least for the weekends. 

Also, I would like to reiterate that I *have* brought this up to them many times, I let them know that I'm unable to sleep because of their rowdiness and that I get up very early in the morning on Saturday and Sunday. In fact today I reminded them and they told me it was a ""me problem"". 

I understand they like to drink, but I live here too, I buy food, clean dishes, pick up the garbage they leave out and a lot more smaller things. I don't keep them up all night when they have early classes because I wish to be respectful to all around me no matter their past actions. This, though, is just disrespectful and rude. Am I wrong to think that I deserve equal and fair treatment as they do? 

Sorry for the rant.

638,"Hey folks!

So this June I graduated in Biology. I am currently enrolled in Master's programme Ecology and Biology with Nature Conservation. I have realized that I don't actually want to do that in my life. Even I did want to, the job prospects are really slim, especially in my area, and not paid that well. I am seriously considering dropping out of University. I am still doing the most obligatory work because I am just so afraid and anxious about what to do if I drop out.

I want to do something completely different with my life. The problem is I have no idea how to find that  ""something"". I only know what I don't want to be doing. 

I am 24.5 years old. Because of some reasons it already took me 5 years to finish a 3-year degree (one being that I changed my major once already). I feel like my degree is useless and that I have wasted the past 5 years of my life. I really don't know what to do. I don't think I have the energy to start another Master's next year. Also I come from a poor family and it would be about time for me to get my life together and start earning some real money (other than occasional student jobs I do know).

I just feel like I'm at the ""make it or break it"" point of my life. I really don't want to end up doing some minimum wage job for the rest of my life.

  
I think I am smart and hardworking. I can work toward a goal, but what to do when you have no goal? I've never experienced that before in my life. To be so completely lost, no purpose, no plan, nothing to work towards to.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advice on how to find something that I would like to do?

641,"Right now in life I am pretty poor but I’m still able to pay me and her bills and have money left over. I have $0 in debt and after expenses I net $400/month surplus in income which I put some into the S&amp;P 500 etf. I still have a lot of realistic ambition and I respect the fact that starting a business would likely cost $30,000 to get a sizeable return on investment and it’s risky.(I would start a business in Mexico).

My girlfriend is a medical student and about 2 years from getting her license to be a surgeon. My girlfriend is getting a medical degree in Mexico. Now I agree that’s impressive, my girlfriend isn’t happy that I don’t want to go to college. I don’t want to go to college because I would rather become an electrician, a plumber, or a mason. The trades is where I would be happy with work and I would be content with life along with have a real possibility of making $100,000+/year. 

I have not been impressed with the prospects of college, statistics show people make more money with college, but to risk so much debt (even community college adds at least $15,000 debt) for a 60% chance of completing doesn’t appeal to me. Maybe with college you pull $80,000/year in an expensive area. With the trades you might make $80,000 in a rural area.

I am a very hands on and physical guy who is smart, but doesn’t really care for college.

My girlfriend is telling me “Don’t become a plumber, my friend’s a plumber and only makes $12/hour. To me even if that’s true, that doesn’t mean in 5 or 10 years of plumbing experience wouldn’t lead me to a $30+\hour career.

But it’s really getting annoying when I talk about my business idea passions and my girlfriend says that I’m stupid for wanting to do business and that I can’t start a business because I don’t have money. She says that it’s bad luck to plan for a business when you don’t have much money.

I’m not taking out a loan nor are my business ideas that expensive.

642,"Throwaway, any rude comments will be ignored, this is a judge-free zone, cheers! I want to keep this as short-but-detailed as possible. I'm a 21 year old male, when I was younger I had a hair style for years up from 4 until around 14, well one day I went to school with a new hair style and everyone laughed because they hadn't seen that style on me, it knocked my confidence a tonne, to the point where I stopped going to public school and had to get a home tutor. I started wearing a hat almost 24/7 even when my hair grew back because my confidence was still bad, I was having a very hard time, so nobody really ever sees my hair, and hasn't in a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed yesterday that my hair is starting to fall out, not because of hat wearing but because of natural male pattern baldness. It's becoming very thin on the top crown and I'm scared someone will see it but I really want to stop wearing hats, I want to be free but I have a very negative family who will very well make jokes about it and I'm scared it will knock me back in to a dark spiral again. I want to shave my hair down a little and be free but I just don't know how to do it without everyone making a big deal about it.

&amp;#x200B;

It's holding me back from doing so many things in live I crave, any advice would be heavily appreciated. It's not as easy as just removing the hat and shaving it down, I know it basically is and it sounds easy but anyone who's had confidence like this before will completely understand where I am coming from. I don't know what to do and I can't talk to any family or friends about it because they'll sure probably laugh at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot",17Nov2019,1
643,"I'm a college student. I was eating at the dining room with my friends Bob and Sally(fake names for privacy's sake). While I was getting ready to leave, I grabbed a cup of jelly I wanted to bring with me. The jelly had whipped cream in it, and I spilled the whipped cream on the counter. I grabbed some napkins from a table nearby, and attempted to clean it up. I realized that I was only smearing it, which Sally pointed out. She grabbed me more napkins and I finally began to clean it up correctly. I was almost done, but there was still a little cream on the counter. Sally got more napkins and attempted to clean the rest of it up. I asked her to let me clean up the mess. She insisted that she would finish. I got very annoyed, and told her I wanted to clean up the mess myself. Sally rolled her eyes, muttered ""fine"" and let me finish. I muttered ""why do we have to get into these stupid arguments?""

&amp;#x200B;

Sally reprimanded me, of course. She said I was letting my pride get in the way. She said she was my friend and wasn't just gonna stand there and watch me clean up the mess. As my friend, she was going to help. I told her it wasn't her responsibility to clean up after me. She said she WANTED TO help. Bob said ""If you hadn't spilled the jello and if you had cleaned it up correctly the first time, we wouldn't be going through this."" I said the day was the ruined. Sally said the day was only ruined because I thought it was ruined. Then as we were walking back to our dorms, we played in the snow for about five minutes, parting ways in good spirits.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I have interactions like this with Sally on a daily basis. One time, I told a few other friends of mine that she was asexual. I told them that because Sally doesn't like sex jokes, and I wanted my friends to know that so they wouldn't upset her. Sally was offended because she said I ""came out for her."" My mind is blanking on more examples, but there are dozens of uncomfortable encounters between her and I.

&amp;#x200B;

We still hang out. We still make each other laugh. I care about her as a person. I just don't understand why there are times when I can't stand her presence. If we are indeed friends, shouldn't I enjoy her company most of the time? I've only known her for a few months, but I would say I enjoy her company 50% of the time and resent her presence the other 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing: I don't WANT to have negative feelings towards her. I was raised by two people who hated each other. My mom and step-dad never failed to find something to blame the other for. ""You're the reason I'm an angry and bitter person."" ""You're the reason I'm in so much debt."" ""You're the reason this marriage has failed."" They also used me as a rhetorical punching bag. ""You're a bastard."" ""You're lazy."" ""You're ungrateful."" This probably sounds stupid, but I don't want to repeat their mistakes. I don't want to blame other's for my problems. I don't want to be an angry and bitter person. I don't want put out negativity into the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try to work it out with Sally or should I avoid her in the hopes that she will be happier without me in her life? I know I'm not a saint. I have many flaws. I have the habit of using my friends as therapists. I don't know when to keep my mouth shut. I am socially awkward to the extreme. My sense of humor can be very immature.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel ashamed to feel any negative feelings towards her. I guess I'll go ahead and elaborate. I feel like she gets offended too easily. I feel like she is stubborn, a little bossy, outwardly cold (especially to me), crappy even. I always feel like I have to walk on egg shells when I'm with her. I can't discuss religion. I can't discuss politics. I can't have philosophical conversations ( I once wanted to have a philosophical conversation about suicide; she got angry and quickly shut it down).

&amp;#x200B;

So, again, I don't know what to do. I want what's best for her, but I don't think I'm the only reason our friendship is a bit strained at times. We both have mental illness. I can't help but think that has something to do with it. I just want her to be happy and I want to be happy myself. Does anyone have any advice for me?",17Nov2019,1
645,"have had the Saturday following the day after Thanksgiving planned for weeks and we have said yes we will come on that date. At that time, my family had not communicated any Thanksgiving plans - my dad is very busy and my sister works a lot of hours at her job as well.

A few weeks later and my family says plan for the Friday after Thanksgiving, which was no issue, but now my sister (The host) is saying that she might not have that day off, so we might have to do Saturday - but she won't know until the week of, when she gets her hours.

Last year, I spent Thanksgiving with my boyfriend's family, and I think it's only fair to trade off. My boyfriend has said that if we could go to both, we would go to both, so that is not an issue, and travel is not a big factor, even though we may get stuck in traffic - it's kind of part of the Thanksgiving experience; sometimes it just can't be avoided.

647,"I really don't eat a lot. I'm a 21 year old guy, never had problems with my weight. If anything, I was always underweight. I've probably gained over 45 pounds in the last 6 months or so. 

I'm gonna start this off by saying that I don't exercise. I get that I should and that might be the cause of why I'm gaining weight, but I've always heard that your diet is more important than exercise so I don't really know. 

The part that confuses me is that I really don't eat a lot. In a typical day I usually only eat one meal a day - dinner(around 6PM). Usually I'll have a small snack before I go to class as well like some peanut butter crackers(around noon). I never eat fast food. I usually eat a large dinner since It's really the only meal that I'll eat in a day. The only other possible cause that I can think of that I drink a LOT of iced tea. I don't know if that would cause weight gain, but I figured I'd throw it in anyway.

The advice I was given(ty btw) was good but it unfortunately wouldn’t of helped with these types of people and my situation, so I decided to take it upon myself to just drop the whole thing and just not be friends with them anymore. My way of making this decision was that I gave it a second chance yesterday and tried to see if maybe I was overthinking like I do all the time, however nothing had changed. I was still getting the same treatment from them; being ignored, insulted(non jokingly at this point) and just not being included in any conversation. Overall it was just a terrible feeling having to hear how THEY have plans and are doing stuff together and not asking me if I want to go or anything. It’s just complete isolation. I thought I had found a good group of friends but unfortunately it seems anyone can turn you away the moment they decide to themselves-“screw this guy”-. It’s very painful to live with the loss of a group of friends like this considering it’s happened a lot to me.. the whole me trusting someone then just being left behind feeling.

651,"Hi, I am a F16, and recently I have this feeling all the time that the rest of my family (mom, dad, brother M14) don't like to include me in their conversations and there's generally a mood shift whenever I enter a room. For example, usually on the weekends, I wake up a little later than everyone else and I hear audible laughter/joking coming from the kitchen and whenever I go downstairs the laughter stops and the conversations that were occurring before change to bland ""the weather is nice today"" type topics.  I don't fight with my family or am rude/disrespectful, and they also don't actively try to not include me, I just have noticed that gradually this year I started becoming excluded from inside jokes or my parents forget to ask for my opinion when we order food. My guess is that since I do a lot of school clubs/play a sport I'm not home that often, and usually, when I am home I often stay inside my room because I do homework since its quiet there. However, I do actively try and make an effort to connect with my family and make sure to not mention anything about school during meals and focus on what's going on in their lives but I just feel so disconnected to the point where I don't like going downstairs to talk with my family since I always feel excluded from their conversations in general. Additionally, another reason why I don't really like to talk to my parents is that any sort of conversation we have always ends up about college and preparing for my future, and over time it gets kind of repetitive. I would've held out and not said anything but my entire family decided to go on a vacation without me during thanksgiving break without telling me until recently. When I confronted them and asked why, their response was that they assumed I would have a lot of hw/tests/clubs and didn't have time to go anyways.

657,"I'd like to know the general takeaway this subreddit has when it comes to the ""pursuing your dreams vs being realistic"" argument. I'll say right away that I think there's valid arguments to be had for both, but I like some input in the context of my own life.

&amp;#x200B;

It is clear to me that I have been unhappy for most of my life. There's been good times with friends, but anything to do with family has left me sad the vast majority of the time. My family is NOT abusive, but there's a distinct lack of emotion and love that's always been present. Basically, every marriage in my family has been disastrous. There's a laughable lack of emotional intelligence and communication skills despite the fact that there haven't been any separations. My grandparents fucking HATE each other, but still live together as a divorced couple. My other grandpa passed away, but I remember a lot of bickering directed at, and coming from, my other grandma in that house too while he was around. My parents clearly don't love each other and have been going through the motions for what feels like my entire life (I'm 22, and they're in their mid 50's). I am also beginning to suspect that my mom has untreated mental illness. My dad is a very angry person, who seems too have given up on things he loves to fit the fatherly role. I love my parents because they've given me a lot in life, and I feel really fortunate, but I can't stomach all the sadness and rage in this house anymore. I don't want to witness my mom smashing the TV and going with my dad to buy another one; not confronting the issue until emotions spiral out of control again like they usually do.

&amp;#x200B;

These experiences have made me an extremely withdrawn, unemotional person around everyone I'm not very familiar with. In my childhood thought processes, expressing emotion in this house likely meant angry yelling and shit getting broken, and possibly domestic violence (which, as far as I'm aware, has never happened thankfully).

&amp;#x200B;

My disconnected nature has made it hard to find work of any kind 4-5 months after graduation, which has clearly upset my dad (which is understandable). I've applied to things from temp work, to custodial work, to desk jobs. I finally caught a lucky break, and landed a job through my mom's friend that is actually applicable to the statistics courses I studied in college (I lived in my parents house while I attended). I did not have any experience in the industry (produce sales), and that keeps getting brought up by my superiors. I'm a week in, and I've felt so nervous that most of my appetite is gone from my stomach being in knots. I'm sure I can adapt, but I feel really out of place in a loud office full of outgoing older people (some late 20's-late 30's people, many 50 and over). I'm really trying to fit in, but it's clear that my blunted personality makes me stick out like a sore thumb. I think this job has the potential to be fulfilling, but I have my doubts.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends pushing me really hard to leave the job and pursue a more meaningful career, and my family is pushing me to stay in it. I really don't want to say how I actually, currently feel about my job to my family, because they will resort to saying anything to get me working at this place. I'll be assaulted with an endless barrage of forced, obvious, and often unsolicited advice about how ""you need to do this to prove 'x'"" or ""think about how proud you'll feel if you 'y'"". 

&amp;#x200B;

""Just keep trying!""

&amp;#x200B;

*""It was harder for me, so just think about that!""*

&amp;#x200B;

It comes from a good place, but I've never felt truly listened to if I ever voice an opposing opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't know what to feel. On one hand, this job pays well enough that I can finally move into an apartment (I was born and raised in southern California near LA, so there's really no legitimate or safe housing options for the majority recent college grads, and I didn't want to risk moving to a cheaper state/city without any work experience to ride off) and out of this emotionally depraved house I've always been in. 

On the other hand, I'm not especially passionate about it, and I worry I may get stuck in the ""rat race"". Where, in order to keep paying for my new place, I need to stay at a job I really don't love because of the pay.",17Nov2019,1

I am 28 year-old male diagnosed with Asperger's as well as other conditions, working a dead-end, low-paying 9-5 (if I am lucky) job at a large corporation, and struggling to find meaning and value in my life. 

All day I do tedious, boring, and repetitive tasks at work for a small wage, while struggling to navigate the corporate world (i.e., office politics, socializing, and an environment where the only thing that seems to matter is $$$). I find it draining, tiring, and soul-crushing, and all I have to show for my work is a small paycheck that is quickly consumed by student loans and other debt.

Anyone having read this far will invariably say something like, ""Pursue your interests!"" or some other platitude, but my personal life feels as bleak, tedious, repetitive, and pointless as my work life. 

I like to read. As of this writing I have read 52 nonfiction books in 2019. But why read at all? Nobody cares about what I have read, and I'll never use the knowledge I acquire from reading in my day-to-day life (if ever).

I like to write political analyses, usually based on what I am reading. But why? Nobody reads what I write or cares, and usually anything I write someone else has already written a similar (and usually better) analysis. 

My social and family life is - again - as bleak, pointless, and tedious as everything else. I don't have friends to socialize with or talk to, since I can't make friends at all it seems, and because I am 'different' the overwhelming majority of my family has long ago disowned me. 

What's the point of living like this? I spend all day working as a mindless drone for a corporation, then come home read books for no rhyme or reason, only to...wake up and mindless drone my way through the next day???

664,"Hello Reddit, I really need some help here. Let me start by giving you some background information. 

I'm a 15 y/o male and sophomore in High School and will be turning 16 on New Years Eve. I have my driver's permit but won't be getting my license until 4/26. I don't have a job as I live in a small town in North Carolina with not many business (there's a few though, just not a huge city) and pretty much every place (including fast food) only hires those who are 16+ so I don't have a job. I'm prepared to work two jobs once I hit the age to support myself. I don't have a car and I only have $100 dollars in savings, which is a negligible amount. I currently live with both of my parents and a brother (7 y/o). 

Let's get down to it. 

The reason why I want to move out in the first place is too long to fit here and complicated, but I'll respond to comments. I'm not abused and my family is supportive, so no need for CPS or anything like that. I should also probably say that I am aware that I'm a minor and ""supposed to be dependent"" on my parents in the first place because I legally can not do most things, so don't say that. I need real advice. No, I don't care about social life or sleep schedule. 

First and foremost, I'm sure my parents will sign any documents that I need to get signed and I also believe I'll be able to get emancipated if necessary as my parents expressed they will support this, which makes it easier. 

The cheapest 1 bedroom apartment in my area is $775 a month, with water utilities included. Is this realistic if I'm working the maximum hours available to me? Keep in mind, I still have school. 

1. Is there any way I can start building my credit, without having to open a credit card in my parents name? It will go both ways and if they miss payments that will affect me as well. 
2. Should I first focus on getting a car or is it realistic to transport myself other ways, like by bike. My area has no public transportation. 
3. I must be able to financially support myself, so this summer I will try and get two jobs to work as much as possible to put as much money in the bank as I can, and let's be honest, won't be a lot on minimum wage. What type of work is available to me to make more than minimum wage? Online included, I could maybe tutor, but most websites have requirements that I do not meet. Are there any other resources that you know of?
4. Would I possibly by eligible for government benefits like medicaid or SNAP if I am emancipated to help out? How about if not (I think no since it won't be legally recognized that I'm independent, though.)
5. What are the steps I can start taking now to become independent by the time I'm 16? Will anyone even be willing to sign a lease with me for an apartment? 
6. What else should I know? What advice do you have for me? 

I want to get out of here ASAP.",17Nov2019,1

We both have a ton of the same interests and are total nerds about gaming, art, animation, and all that sorta stuff. We tease each other a lot but in a playful, fun way that makes it fun to play around with her. We started sending each other daily ""fun facts"" and talking about them. Things were going great and it was one of the friendships I valued the most. We would also have long, deep talks about anxiety and life and stress and she would constantly assure me I was one of her closest friends and that I meant a lot to her.

In the past week she has almost completely stopped talking. it started when I teased her about some weird word she used (which is usually normal for us) and she got really angry at me and then ignored me when I immediately apologized, as I didn't realize she was taking me seriously. After this she told me she had forgiven me but she had just been under a lot of stress and felt awful. She canceled hanging out which we had been planning for like 2 weeks and basically just stopped talking to me altogether. I could see through social media she's been hanging out with a bunch of other friends, specifically on the day we were gonna hangout too which really stings. 

My anxiety has just been absolutely terrible and I've been feeling dejected and worthless all week. This isn't even the first time she's bailed on me to go hangout with other people which is what makes it hurt so much more. I really thought we had come a long way since then and I would be ""good enough"" or worth her time as a friend to spend time with her, but apparently not. I just feel like I completely ruined the entire friendship, and talking to her about stuff was one of the most stable and happy things I had going for me. I don't have a lot of friends and I can admit I'm a very sensitive and emotional person, but it still hurts. How can I fix this?",17Nov2019,1
668,Hi so on December 6th i'm getting on a plane for the first time. I have no idea how airports work or anything so any advice on that would really help out. Now secondly my family doesn't know i'm leaving. I've had a lot of ups and downs with my family and a week ago we got into such a huge fight i took off to my grandparents for a few days. I'm back home but i don't want to be here. All of my relationships with them are strained and nothing has felt the same for years now. This was just kinda the icing on the cake. I'm gonna take off while their gone and not tell them anything. I just can't live with them anymore it's too hard. Their killing me mentally and emotionally and i'm tired of it. So i'm moving to another state to start a life of my own. It's hard being here. Nothing feels like it's mine anymore. Not my room or even my dog. I just feel like i'm in a strangers home. And what's killing me the most is their trying to be nice but it's too late. The only reason their doing it is because they know i'm done with them both. So any advice on how to survive this would be nice. Thank you.,17Nov2019,1
669,"To give a little info: me (guy) and this girl (lets call her gale) are just friends, and we do not have any feeling towards each other. Occasionally we just hang on the weekends at her dorm and talk about things going on in each others lives or just school stuff. We have a pretty genuine friendship, and we talk to each other about almost everything. I consider myself to be a good friend.

So the situation is, that gale texts me in the morning at around 10am saying that she wants to hang and that she wanted to tell me something, given that I’m the only person she can really talk to. So i say sure and suggest we meet up at around 3-4 in the afternoon. She says cool. So fast forward to around 3-4pm, i text gale asking if its cool if i head over, making sure shes aware that I’m about to go over. She doesn’t answer. An hour goes by, and i text her again to say “whats up? Whats the plan?”. She still doesn’t answer. Mind you, she usually fast at texting back, but I’m not really worried because i figured something came up. So 4 hours go by,  and being curious i text her asking if shes okay, because something might’ve happened. She still doesn’t respond, so I’m starting to get a little worried. I wait a while, and call twice but shes still not answering. I head over to her dorm to do a wellness check at around 10 at night, and her roommates say that they haven’t seen her since 2pm, and that they can’t get a hold of her either. So now we are all worried. I start calling everyone to get a hold of her, or see if they’ve seen or heard from her, but all said no response. Again, she never does this. Eventually i call the campus police, to let them know that she might potentially be missing. I meet with officers, start giving them some details, and they start doing a search around campus. The best guess as to where she might’ve been was at the library, or at this one guy’s house.

At this point, i am currently dying from the anxiety attack i am experiencing, because i am thinking the worst of what could’ve happened. 

Now I don’t doubt that gale can handle herself or anything. But just to add, she’s the type of person that can end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. For example, she is a petite woman, and she walks alone at night sometimes to get food, in which she is highly vulnerable for a lot of things to happen . 

Hours go by, until about 2 in the morning, i finally get a text from gale saying “hey sorry, i had my phone on silent and I couldn’t find it for a while”. (turns out she was at that one guys house) Anyways, so i say “are you okay? I called the campus police, i was worried you went missing” she says “yeah I’m cool”..
So i call back campus police to tell them that gale contacted me, and that she’s okay. They call her to ask some basic questions to make sure she’s not in danger or anything. Gale texts me after the campus popo contacted her and says to me “you caused me so much stress, don’t ever do that again please, even if i actually disappear, and i get you were worried but chill” 

After she had said that, i got really conflicted with myself, because i thought i was doing the right thing. She got angry because i was worrying too much about her, but i had felt i had reason to at the time. (Our city is kinda notorious for sex trafficking and other crimes btw.) But I’ve been thinking about it a lot, and it’s been bothering me that she didn’t really take it that well, and I’ve been feeling that maybe I did too much... 

Thoughts?

670,"This is my first post. 

I'm really struggling right now and this was done through my own stupid actions. So I really screwed up this past weekend. I Stupidly drunk texted my coworker that I was in love with her. To make things worse I am married. While me and my wife have had issues in the past things have finally been going in the right direction that was until this past weekend.

My coworker did not reciprocate my feeling and it is for the best and when I work up in the morning I saw that I sent her a bunch of texts that I don't remember sending. I have since deleted her phone number from my phone to prevent any type of issue like this from happening in the future.

 They are so stubborn and refuse to change because it’s “my house my rules” without considering the effects it has on me and my siblings even though we’ve told them about it.

from move-in day to around halfway through the semester, things seemed to be going really well between all of us. i thought our communication was good and we all seemed to be getting along really well, until one day S and i got into a fight. we were both really stressed and snapped on each other. neither S or A spoke to me for days after that, until i sat them both down and confronted them about what was going on. they said that they were a bit annoyed with a few minor things i was doing, which i then corrected as best i could. i could tell they weren’t being 100% honest, but i decided not to bring this up because i didn’t want to seem pushy or rude.

flash forward a few weeks. things between S and i are staring to improve, but A is still acting really weird around me. she is talking to me less and less and starting to ignore me. still, we had moments where it felt like things might be going back to normal- once, we got dinner together and actually had a nice conversation. however, soon after that, things went back to being rocky again.

recently, A had a friend over; this friend also used to be my friend, but stopped talking to me as A did as well. they were blasting conspiracy theory videos at 12am when i had a migraine and an 8am class the next day, and just wanted to sleep. i asked them (not for the first time) if they could turn the videos off after their current one was finished, and i didn’t hear a response. i, out of anger, said “ok... i’ll take that as a no.” to which i got a very, very pissed off response from A: “i SAID, yes.” 

that was the last thing she said to me. it’s now been a week, and it’s to the point where A won’t even do anything more than nod her head when i ask her a question. she won’t even say hi to me after i greet her when walking in the room.

i know that things going back to how they were before is very unrealistic, but she’s my roommate for the year. i have to live with her for at least another semester, we should be able to at least look at each other and talk about basic room maintenance things.

It ended up showing up in one of his friend group chats, and he messaged me the next morning clearly mad that I kiss and told and that people are messaging him about it. I apologized because I felt like crap for having said anything and having upset him.

I've  told him he probably shouldn't use terms like those, but he will always justify it by saying that he never means it in a derogatory way, like saying it's a joke makes it all okay. He won't take me seriously when I say that the historical context carries over to a lot of people who still get persecuted.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year now, but we've been best friends for many years and I love him to death. I'm in my early twenties he is in his late twenties, the abuse happened around 5 years ago. He first told me about it when we weren't together yet, and he only talked to me, his male best friend and his therapist about it, no one else knows, which is also why I wont get into detail here, he wouldn't even want me writing a post about it but I dont know who to talk to because he forbid me to tell anyone and I just need advice. This woman was his social worker at his school, I went to the same school and I also knew her well (at least I thought) and had a very good relationship with her, which is also why this was such a shock to me. Basically she groomed and gaslighted him for over a year, always told him stuff like ""you were holding my hand just now, why did u do that?"" even tho he didn't do it. Or telling him stuff he just said to her even tho he didn't say anything which made him question his sanity after a while and made him very insecure. He didn't realise what she was doing tho, which is why he continued having a good relationship with her and talking to her every day in school. At the end of the year (it's a weird kind of art school which only goes for a year) she texted him how he was doing (most social workers there had our numbers because we always had a close relationship to them) and they planned to meet to catch up on their lives - again: this wasn't unusual at this school, also most of us students there were in our twenties. So they met up and had a nice talk at her place how everyones doing and stuff until she suddenly made advances, trying to make out with him and touching him. He told her to stop and to back off but she ignored it, she tried it 4 times with 4 times of him telling her to stop and that he does not want this, her being more aggressive every time. He told me after the fifth time he felt so helpless and trapped that he just zoned out and let it happen. Afterwards he drove home immediately. Yesterday was the first time we talked about it in more detail, even tho he still won't go into detail about the abuse. The thing is, he talked about it with his therapist a few times times but his therapist is not a therapist that works with victims of trauma and he says he doesn't want one because he doesn't want to talk about it and he just wants to forget about it. But I still see how it is something that affects him and affects our sex live and his trust in people. He says he doesn't think about it at all anymore and he's over it but I'm scared that someday it will all reach the surface and he will have some kind of mental breakdown because he's always so calm and collected. Idk I just need some advice. Is it better if I just dont mention it again and let him repress it?",17Nov2019,1
709,"Hi guys, I kind of want to join my high school’s cross country team next year as a sophomore, as I played tennis this fall instead and I kind of felt like it didnt give me the physical activity I needed or any challenges. I’m worried about not being experienced enough or too slow, though, or being lonely since everybody already knows each other. Also, idk if coaches like people joining as sophomores or not, or how colleges see 3 years of a sport instead of 4. Do you think if I run every day for the rest of the year I should be able to do it? And do you think that a socially anxious person as myself would feel lonely? Also, would joining track help with conditioning? Idk I guess I just need some advice on what I should do. I quit soccer because the winter seasons got too expensive and I just feel awkward going into unfamiliar sports now. Please give me some wisdom!",17Nov2019,1
710,"tldr; pierced my own ear but wasn't where i wanted it to be. there's a bump now after i've taken it out and just wondering if the bump will flatten down or if its safe to pierce again

so about a week ago i pierced my own ear. i used proper equipment and everything and i've never gotten an infection anywhere in my life despite being an accident prone, just so you know that i probably don't have an infection.

i pierced only one hole, a second on the lobe of my right ear. however it pierced a little bit more upwards than i'd wanted it to be. i took it out today for it to heal and repierce, but there's a lump on where it was. i've researched it and it seems that its just extra scar tissuing; im just wondering if it will flatten down eventually and if it doesn't, will it be safe to pierce the area around it?

before i get a load of comments saying im irresponsible i just want to say that i'm using all proper equipment (sterilized piercing needles, thrown away after one use) and the only reason im piercing them myself is the only professional piercing parlor is about 10km away from me and i don't want to travel that far everytime i want a new piercing. thank you for reading.

also, my left earring fell out a few weeks ago (its fine now) but when it did there was a similar bump.",17Nov2019,1

I'm a 25 years old man. 
All my life, I've always had the impression that life wasn't made for me.

In school, I've always felt inferior to my peers.
They always have something that make them more than me.

I've never had a single female friend. I've never had a girlfriend either. Shyness was my worst enemy.


I was bad in every sport in school.
I wasn't handsome or rich just like most of my classmates.

I was in school, but I felt like I was the one who doesn't have his place.
I was invisible for everyone.

I've always had the impression that I miss something that stop me from being whole.",17Nov2019,1
715,"Hello. 
I'll get straight to the point:

I can't divide my tasks, at all. I either procrastinate on it for a few weeks and do it all at once in a few hours in a single day (because I can't stop), if I'm extremely motivated. Having this load of work really drains my focus really fast, which is barely there. 

At the end of each day of procrastinating I feel like absolute garbage and say to myself that I'll start tomorrow. And I do start the next day, but I'm extremely unmotivated and I fail to do the chosen task.

My focus is also very bad in class/everyday activities and I struggle a lot to do simple tasks like picking what to wear. The only times I am extremely focused is in the programming class where I'm at the top of the class, driving, and playing table tennis, these being the activities I enjoy the most and I excel at (not my words). Most of the time I get a lot of thoughts and it's impossible to focus on one thing/solution, even if it's in my head/solved.

I also failed to get into my preferred university, because I've made an impulsive senseless decision at the admission exam. 

I want to get rid of this issue, I've talked to my family doctor and I mentioned the hyperactivity I have and the focus issues and she referred me to someone who suggested hypnosis to relax. Any help would be highly appreciated. I will also consult a psychologist in the near future, but I don't mind communicating and asking for help from other people who might experience/have experienced this.

TL:DR bad focus, heap of thoughts, procrastinate on multiple tasks and do them in one day, lack of motivation. Do really well on favorite activities/hobbies.",17Nov2019,1
716,"Hi. I’m a 14 year old female, and I’m in a youth group at my church. Last week, I asked for them to pray for my severely depressed friend who had recently tried to commit suicide, and two of them turned to each other and began to laugh and gossip among themselves while staring at me, and then when my lifegroup leader asked who wanted to pray for me, all of them stayed silent and didn’t even want to try. They were talking to each other and didn’t care, whereas they did care when someone else had asked them to pray for their team to win in sports and my leader had to pray instead.

I don’t know if I’m being stuck up, but I found it as extremely disrespectful. I don’t think these precious little popular bitches know what it’s like to have friends like that. I’m still very angry with them, and I want to talk to them about it, but I don’t know how to do that without blowing up at them. 

They also think I’m weird for having friends like that. I overheard one of them saying that ‘it’s my fault for befriending people like that’, but my friends are genuinely good people who care about me as well as I care about them, and I’m very close to him. They just have problems, it’s not their fault.

We tried to end it as friends and we talked about everything, but it didn’t go that way.

Meanwhile, I was heartbroken and defending him from people calling him names, I wished him the best. I then got into a really big fight with my friends, and I felt like I was just spiraling out of control.

731,"Warning: long story.

I spent a long weekend at my buddy and his girlfriends new place for their housewarming party and am writing this from their couch. It started Friday and stretched into today. Over the weekend probably 40 people came by, but most of them stopped by for an hour or so during the day, and it was chill drinking and movies and playing guitar. The nights have had 20 people tops and got a little more rowdy. About 7 of us give or take have stayed the whole weekend while others came and went. One woman (who we will call M) is an acquaintance I made through the my buddy's girlfriend and had met once or twice before. I knew she was married and even met her husband in passing once, but I dont know anything about them or their relationship. 

M is a flirt and we were friendly, but when my ex girlfriend texted and said she was coming to the party past midnight friday night, I decided I was going to leave as she (my ex) had gotten angry that morning when she came to my house and found me passed out on my couch with a girl, (Platonic friend, nothing had happened), and actually punched me in the face a few times and threw me to the ground as she hasn't accepted the break up yet. My friends who were hosting tried telling me I deserve to stay and she shouldn't ruin it for me, and then M leaned in my ear and said, ""You have to stay, we're going to cuddle later. Dont worry, I'll make sure your ex is uncomfortable and leaves early."" I caved and stayed. 

Ended up having a good time and M lit my cigarettes and leaned on me and laughed for a while. Ex left as expected. Throughout the night I picked up on little things here and there, like how I found it odd that no one cared that their married friend was openly all over another guy. In a group conversation at one point M said, ""I dont really believe in monogamy."" And then finally in a private conversation she said that she and her husband have a ""weird dynamic"" and that they were ""looking for a third"" and asked if I would be interested. I said I wasnt sure because that is too foreign to me and she said to think about it but that it's a strange place to be because you have to be very careful about feelings.

The party finally died down and everyone left. We were a little drunk but not smashed. She changed into a cute unicorn onesie to sleep in and I borrowed some sleep pants from my buddy and she got cozy on the couch before inviting me to join her. There were people passed out on every chair and couch and an air mattress on the floor so we talked quietly a bit so no one could hear when she whispered in my ear, ""I really just want to have a threesome with you...or maybe I just want you all to myself"", before kissing my neck and grinding against me. I tried to sleep but she kept making little moans in my ear or pressing against me. She teased me by unzipping the onesie to her waist and pressing her chest against me. Then I realized she was masterbating while kissing my neck. I told her I was just trying to be respectful and she was making it difficult and she replied, ""Please just slip a finger in my pussy"" and grabbed my hand. I caved. She grabbed my dick and we touched each other for a little bit and she said she didnt care if anyone heard her heavy breathing. Then we went to another room and she stepped in ahead of me. When I turned around after closing the door she had already dropped the onsie and then layed on the ground. I went down on her, and that's as far as it went. 

When we were done she hugged me and then said, ""I should have asked permission first. I mean it's fine, but I really should have asked first."" I apologized and she said, ""You're a sweet kid. You have nothing to apologize for."" We went back in the other room and cuddled and passed out. Woke up in the morning and had a cigarette and acted like nothing ever happened. She left and went home to take a nap and a shower, and came back last night after picking up her daughters. She brought them since shes good friends with the people hosting the party and they know them. She put them in the back room with a movie and acted super weird toward me whereas the day before she was all over me. It made me feel dirty, like I crossed a solid line that I was led to believe was much more grey. Once the kids fell asleep around 11, she said to me, ""Finally. The kids are asleep so I can have a drink."" I told her that her daughters were cute and her way with them was adorable. She just looked at me and said, ""Awe, you ARE a sweet kid"" and winked and walked away. She acted normal toward me but didnt mention anything again and wasnt all over me in any way, and when we all went to sleep last night she got back on that same couch we had shared and I grabbed a blanket and got on the recliner. Trying to be better. This morning she said, ""you didnt have to sleep alone."" And I said ""I told you I'm just trying to be respectful."" And she shrugged. She had a cigarette and then woke her kids up and hugged me and whoever else was up and then left. I've been here all day since and it comes in waves that all this legitimately might make me a bad person, and I feel super guilty about it but their ""dynamic"" it still totally unclear to me. I just want opinions and advice. 

Tldr: I fooled around with a married woman with what seemed like permission due to her marital situation, but am unclear if I was deceived or what lines are blurred and feel like shit.",17Nov2019,1

733,"So I started working at my brother's marketing firm three months ago (we're a fairly small company). And I started with a small position. When I began working I starting implementing new ideas/changing things around so that we could be more efficient (most of this was done indirectly by talking with the community managers). However, around this time I noticed two of the employee become more distant with me (one of them is a graphic designer and the other is a community manager). They're both pretty close to each other and I have also noticed them talking about me and giving me a hard time. This all makes it really hard for me to my job.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really get any special benefits. I am younger than most of them, if not all. Although I am not the smartest person in general, I am pretty creative and have pretty basic business skills. I also earn less than all of them.  I really care about the company, but I noticed that  those employees do not like change and organization, which I began implementing as soon as I started working. Im in no leadership role either, but I found myself having to take up on some of the roles when I noticed the community manager not doing his job properly. A lot of time, I end up having to take that leadership vacuum with he doesn't do his job.  

I really care bout this company and I feel that this all makes it hard for us to grow as a company.  Could it be that its a cultural change (I grew up in America but our business is mainly in Mexico)? Or my age? Or even that I am related to my brother. I have tried almost everything, but those two employees just seem to get more distant and distant. I have seen our content creation changed and improve since I started working here.

To specify, I just began dating a guy where we originally bonded over games and our music taste lol. He is a nice guy, but his life long friends have told me that he doesn't open up concerning his own feelings and is somewhat hypermasculine, not the toxic kind though! He also gets annoyed of everyone every once in a while (he doesn't lash out about it or anything like that) and is quite independent, unlike me who is very clingy and needs help from others a lot, though I've been trying to keep that part of me more lowkey. A big point is that we have conflicting political views, but we don't talk about it together because we do love each other and don't want it to get in the way of our relationship. Not to be a downer, but I wouldn't worry about marriage and our political standpoints because it isn't likely haha.

The next day chad tells me how he has been in contact with his crush. This crush was someone he was talking to a month before we got together. He bought up my exes even though I did text them at one point but they are all blocked now. And We had a huge fight and he called me some bad names and I left him. Some awful names he called me.

739,"When I got to school, I just started hanging out with a group of nice guys I met at my residence orientation. They seemed chill, one of them turned out to be my suite mate, so I just hung out with them. 
We met some other people, and formed a bigger group of people.

It’s been almost 3 months at school now, and I’ve started to see how these people aren’t really the type I want to surround myself with (immature, thinks saying the N word is funny and are white, not too many common interests). Only one of them is someone who I actually like to chill with, we both have a passion for art and creating, so we get along.

READ IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE THNG THAT LOOPS THROUGH MY HEAD ALL THE TIME

So, I don’t know if I’m in the right place here, as strangers on the internet will hardly know what I’m like in real life and the situation entirely, but hey, I need to rant so why not come here. First, I am by no means what is considered a simp, even if what I say may be considered simp behaviour, I’m just socially anxious and paranoid, get me? It’s important to know what I’m like, so to summarise what I’m like, I am an INTP according to MBTI, 5w6 according to enneagram, and a Virgo (not that I believe in star signs); this means I am detached from reality, aloof out of nerves and angst, obsessed and paranoid, but funny and creative.

Ok, the last thing before I start, context. I’m not just some guy waiting for a relationship to end because I fancy one of them. No, I and this girl go way back. I’m speaking in the English school system, but I’ll use my age throughout so anyone unfamiliar with age-by-school-year works in the UK. Ok, picture me, year 8 (12), had one girlfriend before but never spoke to her much in real life, only in text. I was a skittish and depressed little guy, like most people I stopped being happy when I was 12.

I got sat next to her, Tia, in my English class. After two lessons we were speaking as she was just as nervous as me. Now, for anyone who got my MBTI reference, Tia is an ISTP and a Pisces (Idk her enneagram but money on the same as mine). We get sat next to each other in my maths class, we have chemistry, I like her. At this time Tia was this gem that I had managed to somehow find and keep to myself. She was mine; we spoke every day on snapchat. She was beautiful, we was eye to eye on literally everything apart from music taste. It seemed whatever I thought, she thought too, we were one whole person. Time goes by, end of the year I ask her out. But, she says we have to keep it quiet. So, nothing changes, we’re going out but we might as well just be friends. To be fair, it was my fault, I was too anxious about fucking things up to advance. The one thing I get from her is a message from someone who also liked her saying she called me cute. 3 months later, she tells my best friend she isn’t interested in me anymore. Get home, cry, talk to her and BAM she’s a lesbian.

Now, meanwhile, in my friend group every one turned on my friend. Long story short, my friend (Ben) went out with my ex-friend’s (Ciaran) girlfriend (Becki). Ciaran was a shit to Becki, he wanted her to choke him without saying he had a fetish for it, he took her to a swimming pool without telling her he had a fetish for water. Ben and Becki are still going out to this day, so it was the right choice. Anyways, Year 10 (age14), a new group with two potential new girlfriends. Over the course of Year 10 it turned out that one of the girls had a crush on me, I turned her down, she didn’t make me feel like how I felt with Tia. Group split again, Year 11(you do the math, I’m 15 here) I have gone from having seven friends to three friends, one of which I reject as a girlfriend because she is not Tia, and I am MISERABLE. I thought of Tia every day, she was the thing my mind wandered to when I rested, I am in love with her.

Now Tia in these years of Year 9 to Year 11 had gone from having just me and my friends and her one friend to being popular. I luckily sit next to her in Year 10 chemistry, we still have chemistry, but the barrier between us makes me choke over myself and I become paralysed with analysis. She dates Ciaran, the guy who like choking. I watch my crush go out with this absolute dog shit human, and unsurprisingly the same thing happens to her that happened to Becki, and I’m not there for her. She and her friends all probably smoked weed and cigarettes, went out and got drunk occasionally, normal teenage stuff that me, the virgin, had never done before.

Rather than I write poetry about my love-feelings towards Tia, I will now describe my most poignant encounter with Tia in Year 11(age 15). She’s sat a table in front of me, I have this class once every two weeks. We speak for a few minutes; I forget about her eyes and how she loves holding eye contact with me. I am a prisoner to these eyes. We talk about our predicted grades for our GCSE (exams) results. I say I’m predicted a 6 (B+) and she says I could get that. Now because of Tia’s eyes, I’m on the verge of crying, I’m shaking like a dweeb (but not a simp) and all I can manage to say is “you’re very nice”

Now on with the actual story.

After thinking I had gotten over Tia, I quickly realise I am not over her. My past three years of school were the worst years ever because I was not speaking to her and I hated my remaining friends. So, schools out, 12 weeks summer holiday, fuck it I’m speaking to her. Now, I had spoken to her on and off in the past three years, but I always stopped to see if she would text me to speak, she never did, I took it as a sign – but that’s just how she is, aloof.

A little bit of info about myself, I don’t believe in fate but I do think things happen symbolically to some extent as it rains on shit days.

Year 12, 2019, I am 16 writing this and me and Tia are best friends again. We both went to the same sixth form (we stayed at our original school) so we speak every weekday and some days on weekends if I am cocky enough.

My year so far since September has been the best of my life. I ditched my old friends and hang with Tia, and her one friend she enjoys the company of. Not to say I don’t speak to my old friends. I made a vowel to get more friends over this year, and so far I’m further than I thought I’d ever have gotten. Tia now is a frequent drug user on weekends, though not as bad as I make it sound. She only does pot and ket, even then it’s occasionally. I smoked pot for the first time with her and one of her friends on this year’s Halloween in a park. Best day of my life.

I had been on holiday to Lanzarote and made eye contact with as many girls as I could to try and convince myself that I’m good looking, and to my surprise everyone I made eye contact with didn’t look away. I kept my gaze for 2 seconds more than just a friendly glance, thus turning it into flirting, and it worked. The reason I say this is that I tried my hardest to do as much growth over the summer as possible, just in preparation for the year where I too become popular. If the introvert girl I dated and fell in love with can do it, so can I.

And it worked. The first time I spoke to her in the school year was amazing, even my friend noticed her eyes on me. I was more confident than I have ever been, I was , and still am, at my peak of personal growth. She commented on my Lanzarote Instagram post saying “you should be a model” (HA!). Remember how I said I believe in symbolism in the world’s occurrences? Well, turns out she went to the same part of Lanzarote that I stayed at, and went scuba diving on a beach that I spent most of the holiday at (HAHA!). PLUS we have identical free lessons on our time table when she has no lesson, neither do I, and it could’ve been vice versa where whenever I have a lesson she doesn’t. She also took English as well, so I help her with that all the time, and we study The Great Gatsby, a book I find perfectly fits my situation (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!). WE EVEN HAVE A PRIVATE MINECRAFT WORLD TOGETHER! She fancies me, I thought to myself. She got a job in a café that’s a 10-minute walk from my house, so every day she works I go to visit her and buy a £3 coffee (I’m going skint but I don’t care) just to see her and make sure she has fun at work. She hasn’t told me I’m a creep and to leave her alone, in fact, her face lights up whenever she sees me at the café. Whenever I’m there, I’m mainly just drinking my coffee making eye contact with her. And the time she works is 5-8pm and it’s dark and raining by 5 now, so I walk through the thundering rain just so I can hear her voice and see her eyes for an extra few minutes of a day where I’ve spent at least 2hours with her. I bet if I ask her out she’d say yes, though I am paranoid that she’d say no because she is nice to everyone despite hating them. I love her, she is not a person, she is my happiness personified into a mythical form that is just as much as an emotional wreck that I am.

I’ve even drawn her for my art project, I’ve shown it to her and I’m giving her a copy for Christmas with a compliment written on the bottom.

One thing though, she has a boyfriend.

Fuck

Well, what now?

I tell myself to wait it out, but I only have until next July to go to the same school as her, she wants to study marine biology, I want to study graphic design. We’ll go to different universities. By the time they end it, if they do end it, it might be time to say goodbye.

I’m obsessed with these thoughts, I, for some reason, worry her opinion on me will change overnight, I need to speak to her to remind me of what I have just said.

I’ve told my mum and my other best friend (Ben) about this, they say almost the same thing. They say she’s probably only going out with this guy because of the title of having a boyfriend. That if I express my feelings towards her, she’ll probably feel identical and might even leave the fuck she’s going out with.

Anyways I’m saying all this now because she is away on a school trip for a week and I feel that when she comes back, I need a plan. And when I say plan, I don’t mean going full Iago and manipulating her.

Now, because of how I am, I am too anxious to flirt properly. I want to touch her, I want to compliment her, I want to tell her how great she is but my mind creates a barrier where I really just cannot do it without crying; something I’ve been doing a lot of recently. When I’m not with her I am out of my mind paranoid I’m losing her. I feel bipolar.

I feel I have a few options:

I could tell her friend, whom I have grown close with as well. And maybe she’ll help me out with what I should/shouldn’t do in order to win her over.

I could TRY and subtly flirt with her/subtly reveal my feelings, starting with subtly touches, then compliments, then phrase “I have feelings for you” in a less obvious way.

I could wait it out, the most painful thing I can imagine.

Finally, I could just ask her out straight up and ruin a perfectly good friendship, a friendship I cannot afford to lose. Giving up her friendship means going back to the friends I hate, back to the three years of agony and depression I faced before.

Call me a simp. Idc, just help me out pls, even if it’s just telling me what I already know.

745,"This happened a week ago today, and I'm still trying to figure out how to feel about it all. So bare with me if I seem a little scattered.

&amp;nbsp; 

A few weeks ago, I had an in depth discussion with my friends about our kinks/sex lives. Honestly, nothing out of the ordinary for us. We talked about being tied up, choked, whether we prefer being a sadist or a masochist. Just...conversations about sex. Afterward, one of my guy friends talked to me privately and said that, based on that conversation, we would be perfect sexual partners. Our kinks/preferences are complimentary opposites and that, hypothetically, we'd have great sex. I kind of giggled and agreed, but I didnt think anything else of it. The other friends we were talking to had said the same thing to me already, so it wasnt out of the ordinary for him to say it too.

&amp;nbsp;

About a week later, he asked me to dinner. I said yes, and said that maybe we could finish our conversation from earlier. Because under normal conditions, I probably would sleep with this guy. But we didnt even make it to our date before all of this shit went down.

&amp;nbsp;

Last Saturday, I was invited to a party with a bunch of our mutual friends, but he wasn't there...yet. As soon as I stepped in the door, I had a shot in each hand. I kept going, and going, and going, and pretty soon I was stumbling around like a baby deer. I haven't been that drunk in my entire life. I arrived to the party at 12am, and my last clear memories are around 3am. At some point, I remember this guy asking what I was up to, and me sending him a picture. It wasnt a revealing/racy photo. Just a normal picture of me smiling. He asked where I was and, with the permission of the host, I gave him the address. 

&amp;nbsp;

Immediately after that is when things started getting hazy. I didnt know it at the time, but he had driven over an hour from his house to get to that party. I've had my other friends confirm this, but as soon as he walked in the door, he was all over me. The room was full of people, all of us just sitting and having a quiet conversation, and this is guy literally kissing my neck, rubbing my chest, putting his hands into my shirt/bra, etc. He was very committed to what he was there for, completely disregarding that there were 10 people within arms reach of us. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, I'm completely hammered. This is where my memory blocks start occurring. I know for a fact he was stone cold sober, didnt have so much as a beer. And I know for a fact that I was not sober. Around 5am, my friends wither all left or went to bed, flipped out the lights, and left us alone in the living room. I remember him getting more aggressive with the kissing/touching, and unbuttoning my shirt. He said, ""Why don't we move to the couch?"" I asked him why, and he responded with, ""Oh, I think you know why.""

&amp;nbsp;

After that, it's just bits and pieces. I know I was eventually on the couch. I know he was ontop of and inside of me, I remember him choking me, and I remember him finishing onto my stomach. Outside of those things, I have nothing. I know I ""came to"" around 7am as he was leaving, which leaves 2 hours I dont remember. I was so exhausted that I just fell right to sleep. I woke up at 12pm, having no recollection of the night before. I went to take a shower, took off my shirt, and found a bitemark on my left breast. That's when it hit me that something had happened the night before.

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to remember as much as I could, but it just wasnt happening. I immediately flashed back to our conversation a few weeks before and wondered if I had caused this. Did I say something or do something to make him think I wanted it? Maybe I shouldnt have talked with him about sex at all. I'm just conflicted. I feel violated, but also cant shake the feeling that this whole thing was my fault. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know what to do or how to feel.",17Nov2019,1
746,"In early September I visited my schools physician to consult with this pain I’ve had since June. 


The pain is constant and sometimes unbearable if I make myself aware of it. It’s like piercing and pulsating and it only occurs on the left side of my head. It doesn’t feel external, it feels internal. If I apply pressure to that part of my head like if I’m wearing a hat or massaging it, the pain aches more.  Now my left eye hurts. So far it kinda but rarely affects my performance. I’m afraid it might hurt some parts of my brain that cant be reversed if I keep ignoring it. 

My doctor said i should get my eyes checked to see if there are any vision changes, and I told him that I just got these glasses last year. He said that people experience different changes when going through  getting adjusted to new vision and just encouraged seeing an optometrist. 

I’m off the eye care and dental care of my family’s insurance so, how should I tell my doctor if he can look further into these symptoms?",17Nov2019,1
747,"I’m [24M] am in love with my friend who [27F] and don’t know how to fix my emotions.

Let me just say I know that I live her, we’ve been friends for years and she just makes me happy but I haven’t ever been able to tell her that I have feelings for her.  When I met her she got me out of a funk I’d been dealing with for a while.  She’s polyamorous which isn’t an issue but it comes into play.  She has one partner currently who’s a great person but who does she want another partner. 

I’ve just felt weird when go out for dinner and it’s the three of us and she treats it like a date. We still do stuff alone, but I feel weird when it’s the three of us. She makes sure that I’m getting the same amount of attention, and I would understand if she were more focused on her partner. But then she’ll say crap like in response to a compliment, Steve thinks that too and then gives me a hug or peck on the cheek.

But I’ve tried to distance myself by not engaging with her.  I’ll cut contact and hope that she forgets about me, but a week is the longest I’ve gone without doing something with her.  She’s a good friend. 

That hasn’t worked and we still do a lot of stuff together.  We just went on a trip to a big city to have fun, run around and get in trouble.  It was wonderful, when I’m with her I’m in the moment and don’t think about my feelings, but the moment the day ends I want to continue to be with her, I want to see her more. She keeps talking about how we’ll still be doing this stuff together for years to come and that we should do something else or stay over night the next time.

I’m stuck because I don’t want to lose the friendship and I want the closeness that a sexual relationship brings.  Should I write a letter just telling her that I have feelings and can’t continue being a good friend while trying to conceal them. 

TL;DR:  I have feelings for a long time friend.  The nature of our friendship is such that things are a bit confusing.  I value her immensely as a friend but my feelings for her and preventing me from having other relationships.  I can never bring myself to tell her.  Should I write a letter, straight up ask her to talk?  I know she prob wouldn’t be surprised but I still feel scared I might loose her as a friend.",17Nov2019,1

750,"So my brother has been going to college for about 3 months now and once a month we go and visit him. (I’m in 7th grade, just for more information). But recently he unexpectedly drove down with his friends and sort of surprised my family (mother and sister). I really look up to my brother so when I saw him I got flooded with emotions and couldn’t say a word. So I awkwardly went to my room and didn’t know what to do so I just started cleaning. And out in the other room I could hear them all laughing and talking and I wanted to join them so deeply but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. After like 10 minutes my brother comes in my room (we shared a room before he went to college so technically it’s our room) and we start “talking”. But as soon as we did I started to cry and be really emotional. I’m even tearing up trying to write this. So I’m wondering why I couldn’t do anything and was so weird and awkward",17Nov2019,1
751,"I recently turned 19 and have for a while had a feeling of not liking my childhood friends. We grew up in a decent area where crimes would happen but not to an extent of worry. My family is a upper middle class household although we weren’t always. In middle school I was a fat out of shape kid who was afraid of social interaction and would only talk to a couple of people. I met all of them in middle school where we would hang out and eventually become a group of friends. Being oblivious to what real friendships were supposed to be like I thought the making fun of weight or how I dressed was normal and was okay with it. Around high school thing s got a little better as we got more mature and everything but there is many red flags that have come up in the past few years that I just cannot ignore anymore.

1. They are jealous of me. After high school my family moved out of the area to a nice suburb where lawyers and doctors live in a big house. They always knew we had a decent amount of cash flow but not truly the amount. Although even back in high school and till now it was sort of expected of me to pick up the tab or cover someone if they don’t have the money and to never expect to back (my parents wouldn’t give me money I had a job In high school and did homework On the side). I shit you not one time I told them i found $20 on the ground and this so called friend made me feel like shit saying I should give it to him because my parents had money and at this time I had a 6 inch open wound after breaking my shoulder and a I’ve drawn to my heart as I had gotten a serious staff infection.

2.  I’m always lying. To me school is the most important thing and graduating is top of my priorities. They live about 40 minutes away from me and I should always be expected when they are hanging out to go and see them but they never will come up and visit me. I should always set all my priorities aside and just go do what they want. What makes this better is 1 of them dropped out of college to pursue a trade that has so far not landed him a job months after graduation and constantly talks about all the money he is going to make and how I’m dumb for being in college and he is going to make
More money then me. While currently I have a better job then him and make more money. Another two Of them are failing all of their college classes and one even transferred to a community college and still is failing classes. So when I tell them I have homework I’m lying just because they don’t care about school is what it seems like so I’m lying because I actually want to graduate.

3. They have picked up habits I no longer enjoy doing. Starting in 12th grade high school and first year of college I started smoking weed that I picked up from hanging around them. (I understand the benefits of weed but we won’t get into those now).  They have become really dependent on it they smoke everyday all day nonstop. They also always claim to never have money but always have weed money. 

This is what has set me off. We recently hung out and went out. It was a far drive and my friend was driving. I gave him gas money to cover the trip and no one else did. We also had to pay for parking (pricy)and no even offered to pay. Just like they expect for me to pick the tab. I paid for everyone and they did not even offer to pay me back or buy me inexpensive food. 

I really have been wanting to cut the off for a while now and the only reason I haven’t is because I really like two of them but cutting my ties with the rest would pretty much ruin our friend ship. 

I don’t know what to do at this point and advice would be helpful.

753,"I'm an 18 year old female who just started college this fall, and I've been struggling with this issue for a while. 

I have frizzy, curly/wavy hair and I recently cut it shorter to help manage it. When I was younger, I used to have very long, thick, curly hair. I'd say in the past 4 or 5 years, my hair has become less than a quarter of what it used to be. When I braid it or put it in a ponytail, it is significantly less than what I remember holding in my hands. Granted, because my hair was originally very thick, it doesn't necessarily look thin right now. I'm just worried that at the rate I'm losing it, it will start to look thin very soon.

Whenever I comb my hair or wash it, I lose so much hair. It's enough to roll into a tight ball about an inch thick. I constantly have to unplug my shower drain, and it gets caught everywhere in my carpet. I know it's not normal to lose this much hair because I've talked to some friends about it and they admit they've noticed I shed a LOT of hair.

I have some theories as to why I might be losing hair:

1. Stress. I'm a student and I get worried about deadlines just like anyone else, but I also wonder if it's that bad to the point that I would lose this much hair.
2. Diet. I'm a vegetarian, and I've done a little research into how a vegetarian diet can lead to iron deficiency, ultimately resulting in hair loss.
3. This one's a little different, but I wonder if I'm washing my hair right. My mom used to wash my hair even when I got much older, so I don't know if I'm doing it correctly on my own. I massage the scalp and really try to clean it well, but sometimes after I shower my scalp feels dry and I can't help but itch it. Could the problem be because of my roots?

I also want to mention that I've never colored my hair and straighten it maybe every other month. I'm just worried because at the rate I'm losing hair, I really think it'll become visible in my hairline. Am I doing something wrong? Should I get professional/medical help? What can I do on my own?

756,"I'm in my mid-twenties and don't have a college degree or any real job skills. The past few years, I've been working for Instacart, and overall, I've really enjoyed it.

Those are pretty big downsides. So I'd like to find another job.

But I suffer from both depression and social anxiety, both of which have made the job search pretty daunting.

758,"Hi Reddit. Was wanting some advice on how to handle this situation as I still don't feel right about this.

The situation may seem trivial or even petty, but there was some pretty serious racist hate fueled insults being thrown around by my ex friend.

So I had a friend who like me is into exercise, but where as I am laid back, this guy is loud and cocky, and often rubs people the wrong way. A few days ago (Friday) I had just completed a long day at work and was relaxing, he messages me on MS messenger asking if I wanted to go to the gym with him.

I say nah, sorry bro I'm tired just had a long day. He immediately comes back with ""are you just gonna stay at home then you jew pussy"". Now he seems to get a kick out of that I am 1/32 jewish, he likes to poke fun at it on occasion, likes hes Eric Cartmen from southpark or something. Usually its nothing to bad so it doesn't bother me.

I tell nah, I've been up since 8, on 5 hours sleep and did a full day of cleaning and prepping my property to be an airbnb (as its on a deadline). This just gets more racist stuff out of him.

I remind him that just the previous day I ask him if he wanted to come for a run, he didn't, no problem. That was fine by me. It didn't go beyond this. But just reminding him of this sets him of on a long unprovoked racist rant, jew this, jew that etc. This is all largely unprovoked given the circumstance, and way over the top.

I eventually calm it down and say I'll go to the gym with him on monday, but half an hour later I think, no this was way out of line, he needs to apologize. I tell none of my other friends talk like this, I don't talk like this, if I did talk like this to my other friends, there would be problems and we wouldn't be friends.

No apology, it starts him up again.

So, I basically say this is unacceptable and block him on all social media. Don't need someone this toxic in my circle of friends.

However, I still feel this guy is going to continue to be his cocky, egotistical racist self. So I am considering contacting HR where he works and just giving them a heads up on the sort of person he really is (with proof if required). He is also ""injured"" and off work, which he really isn't as hes been just having a holiday at his works expense, when hes capable of going to the gym etc.

Basically, I want to put this guy in his place.

A week ago, I decided to tell her how I feel and she said she liked talking to me but wanted to hang out to see if she could see us dating.

Wednesday of last week though she said she didn’t like me like that but we already agreed to stay friends no matter what so I tried to brush that off.

On the other hand my fathers side of the family only talks to me on my birthday and during Christmas, they said my schooling choices were too cost efficient and I should only consider going to a community college if I wanted there help instead of going to a secondary school for a specialized certificate.

Recently my grandfather on my fathers side reached out to me and told me that he was bragging about me to his coworkers and that he had told a little boy that I would get him a signed poster for one of the animated films I worked on before asking me if this was okay. 

He told me to buy a poster, or give him something that was already in my possession related to the film, sign it, an mail it to him and before I could tell him no or let me think about this he gave me the phone to talk to the little boy and this made me feel really guilty. It’s been a week since then and I’m in the middle of moving and haven’t had any time to do this. It’s been a week later  and I’m getting guilt tripped from my grandfather saying that if I don’t do this he was going to buy a poster him self and forge my signature and give it to this kid.

771,"I know I’m a terrible person, but I’m really looking for advice on how to understand and control my feelings. 

**Background:** Jake and I have been friends for 5 years. He has always been a very kind and supportive friend. I was more conservative and not doing anything crazy, he was more rebellious, sleeping around, doing some drugs sometimes etc. We were attracted to one another, but 3 years ago we only made out once and that was that. I felt like a relationship would never work out.

I then met a guy and got into a serious relationship, which was going well. It became long-distance once my BF moved to do his PhD in another city. Around the same time, Jake said he was going to move to that university too. 

**Stuff happened**: My BF and I started having problems that escalated to me being insulted and pressured during sex. We broke up. I told Jake all of this and he got mad at my ex and jealous that I still cared about him. Jake and I went out a couple of times, slept together and talked about our feelings: we had romantic feelings for each other, we were very much alike in many ways, but a relationship would have been impossible because of the distance (tho I wouldn’t have minded it) and other incompatibilities, like me not wanting children etc. We cried together, but decided to stay friends. 

**Nowadays**: Jake has a GF. I see them every time he brings her to my city. She’s not a horrible person or anything, but I wouldn’t be friends with her even if she wasn’t Jake’s GF. I keep comparing myself to her. I can’t stop thinking that the last time I met Jake before he got a GF we were having sex and then we continued sexting. It obviously stopped out of nowhere and then I understood why. I hate her not for taking him away from me (because she didn’t lol), but for not being the best I could imagine for him. I have horrible selfish thoughts like “She’ll give him children but she isn’t as good as me”, “Every girl he had was better than her” etc. 

I don’t find it fair towards Jake, since he’s always wanted the best for me and he was there for me when I was crushed, but I don’t know how to get rid of these thoughts, how to be totally happy for him.

Location: Illinois

Yesterday,  I went to Toyota dealership to buy a car since the car I had was not  able to pass emissions testing due to the catalytic converter going bad.

I  found a 2003 Toyota Rav4 that I really liked. I was initially told that  this vehicle would be covered for 5 days for 250 miles. Since, my  previous car was also a 2003 Toyota(Camry), I was concerned that it  might fall victim to the same issue. I made the dealer aware of my  concern about the catalytic converter going bad and he reassured me that  the exhaust system had been completely replaced recently. Me knowing  absolutely nothing about cars assumed that this included the catalytic  converter. The dealer also showed me a list of things that were checked  on the car and informed me that if anything is wrong with any of the  items checked, I could get them repaired as long as it is within a  reasonable amount of time, and so I decided to buy the car. While I'm  signing papers to buy the car, I was informed that returning it after 5  days or after 250 miles would not be an option. I was hesitant at first  but I decided to buy the car anyway. Unfortunately, I waited until after  signing all the papers and buying the car before asking the question if  I could still get the car repaired if any of the parts on the checklist go bad. After signing everything, they told me that would not be an option. I  express my pain with this, but hey, I got a car I like. I drive home. The next day the check engine light is on. I go to AutoZone. The  catalytic converter is bad.

I'm so  motivated right now do something about this. Let me know if you have  any ideas. Even if I can't get them to pay for repairs, I just want some  form of justice.",17Nov2019,1
774,"So I’m just completely conflicted about moving out .Im an 18 year old girl have just been accepted to college but the college I want to attend is far away (about an hour commute).Ive discusses to my parents about the college I was accepted too and how far away it is...the first thing that they said is that they didn’t like the amount of black and hispanic people that attended and then said “if your just looking for a reason to force us to let you drive ALONE so that you can go to college then you’ll be sadly mistaken when that backfires on you”. They have also threatened to take away my college fund money if I didn’t stay and to that I have a solution since they already applied for FAFSA before I even applied to colleges and I have scholarships under my belt to pay for college as well.They’ve always been really controlling to when I can hangout ,to making me come home from school functions early even when they’ve said I could stay to a certain time (and it will literally be for no reason at all),making me late to study groups,having to constantly flake on friends whenever they don’t feel I should leave the house etc. (I have a car and can drive  but they constantly switch between letting me leave or making me stay home that it causes me to be late).Its not like I’ve been an horribly awful kid either I’ve never snuck out ,drank,smoked ,I’ve always done what they asked and  helped in the house and have always been respectful.Ive never even had a job because they felt I wasn’t ready.And it’s not just those  reasons there’s always some kind of tension in the house due to my father not having a job in 5 years and my mother having to support us and my two little siblings .I’m truly grateful for my mother and everything she’s done but the whole situation has just become too stressful for me and there’s barely any peace in the house I feel almost trapped .I have a friend who is willing to help me move out and her parents wouldn’t mind letting me stay with them I’ll also be able to work jobs over the summer to pay for any extra expenses that I’ll need.So what I’m trying to get at here is I want to know that I’m not crazy in wanting to move I know my situation isn’t as bad as others so I don’t want to seem like I’m suffering from “teen angst” I genuinely just want to know what the best course of action will be because I’ve brought up moving out to them before and they completely just down the conversation every time and turn it around to “your ungrateful,and your stupid for wanting to do that when you could just stay home and have everything paid”even when I said once i move out I’ll visit them on weekends and will help with the bills when I can.I’m willing to work hard if the right thing is to move out I’m very ambitious and when I set my mind to something I know I can do it...I just want to make sure I’m making the right decision.",17Nov2019,1

So I’m sure you’ve all heard about McKamey Manor, the extreme haunt torture house that was all over the news and stuff. People have mixed feelings about it and it’s an interesting topic. 

The only reason I bring it up is because I’m writing a short story/novel (I’m not sure how long it’ll be) about a reporter who, after not hearing back from the undercover reporter who went to the place, decides to sneak in and investigate it herself, sortve like Outlast style if you’ve ever played that game. She ends up discovering some terrifying things (as well as her dying friend/undercover reporter) and tries to escape but is captured and subjected to all the horror first-hand. 

There’s a bit more to it but that’s the main premise, and I’m having difficulty coming up with a title. I was originally going to call it The Manor but I’m not sure if that’s a good title and would like to hear ya’ll’s thoughts or ideas for a title. It would be much appreciated!

If a moment I'm watching is sad, I want to feel sadness. If it's funny, I want to laugh and enjoy it. However, that's not the case. Nowadays, whenever I'm watching a movie with a sad scene, it never goes the right way.

If I go in and just know that there IS a sad scene somewhere, then it's gonna distract me the whole movie wondering if the payoff is gonna work, then by the time it rolls around, I'm sitting there disappointed that it didn't get me. Even when I don't go in blind, when I see a glimpse of a sad moment, suddenly I'm taken out of it and asking myself ""Okay, I feel a sad scene, maybe I'm gonna actually cry this time, because I don't know what's gonna happen.""

It is important to note that I have Asperger's, which is a form of high-functioning autism.

I have never liked to make contact with other people, it makes me extremely uncomfortable, and often I am faced with the situation of someone extending their arm to shake hands, up until recently I have gone ahead and completed it, but I immediately put hand sanitizer on afterward. Recently I decided after watching someone go to the toilet and not wash their hands that I will never shake someone's hand again by choice, but I must find a way of politely and respectfully declining. A few nights ago at an awards evening I won an award which was sponsored by a local organisation, when I went to collect the certificate the woman tried to shake my hand, but I just waved my hands and said ""no, thank you."" She seemed a little offended.

781,"I (30m) have almost unbearable anxiety in general. Social and general. Pushed myself my whole life to get out there. College etc. Got back on my feet after running from a career as a designer. The field is too social and I was too much of a perfectionist. Every day was hell.

Decided to try out the trades and went with Electrician. Good money, benefits, not too much manual labor and all they care about is that you can work, not how personable you are.

Worked towards that 6 mo. Part time school. Then got an opportunity as an electricians helper 3 months ago. Installing solar panels.

Everyday was hard. But I had a journeyman (G) who was nice and outgoing and we bonded. Well for the past month I've been working with a new journeyman (J) and he's an absolute dick. Angry, inpatient, horrible.

J progressively has become more frustrated with me. I forget things because of my anxiety. And get confused. I'm new. I have such an overwhelming amount of anxiety. Idk how to describe it, I'm doing my best..

Got to the point where he was screaming at me, mocking me, throwing shit around because I'm quiet and I was trying not to bug him and find something on my own without asking where it was. Was only looking for the thing 1min tops... he continued to scream at me the rest of the day about other shit...

I can tell he just hates me. He stews. He doesnt want me there. I cant handle it.

I can barely handle regular interaction. I try and push myself to get out there. But this is next level. I clam up. I cant think. I'm a wreck... I almost walked off the job. I dont wanna go back.

Complications: I was working on getting in the union. I was about to take the test. If I quit I'll ruin that opportunity and burn the bridge w this company and union. But, there are other unions ive just got a decent report w this one and would have to start over w a new one. It can take months to yrs to get in. I did however get a job offer to work at another solar company; non-union, Lower pay though.

Just got their health insurance. I do have medicaid still though.

Higher ups, above the asshole, dont give a shit because I'm just a helper. Any small incovinience and they'll just tell me to fuck off. I cant go to them.

My girlfriend lives 8hrs away and I was planning on getting into the union and transferring up there. Which is common. Quiting would put a wrench in those plans. I love her and shes the only person I feel close to anymore.

TL:DR
Boss who I work with everyday hates me. Screams and throws things around because hes pissed at me. It's getting worse. My anxiety is almost unbearable. I cant take it. I just want to quit. I'm 30 tho. This is my 2nd career. Idk what to do. I need advice.",17Nov2019,1

The catalytic converter is messed up as well. It's also a gas guzzler, I barely get 15 miles to the gallon. However it's a car and it runs, and not that bad might I add.

I would like to get a new car but I honestly think the smart play is to continue driving what I have until I can save up enough money to comfortably purchase a new car. Right now I get paid semi monthly, a check almost coming up to 900 dollars. I just started working again so I only have about 5-600 stowed away for a car purchase.  

As it is now I spend a lot of money on gas but I don't have to pay insurance (still on my dad's from when he drove the car) or a car note. If I get a car I'll be paying a note and paying insurance. Of course I'd like to get a car and not have to deal with the problems this car has now, but I could easily end up getting a car that has its own set of problems, and then I'll have to pay to fix those on top of paying for insurance and a car note.

789,"There’s a lot to unpack here. I’m literally just chilling in a Target parking lot because I don’t want to be in my apartment left alone with my thoughts, it just makes me more upset. Okay here we go, this is gonna be long (I think).

So about a year and a half ago I started streaming on Twitch. I love it to death. I’ve even built a community that loves and supports me. I’ve recently started doing YouTube because I now know that I want to turn these things into a career. I’m not really in it for the money (as long as I can survive I’ll be happy). I just want to entertain people for my job, that’s literally all I want. 

I’m in college. My parents are pretty well off (DEFINITELY NOT RICH) but well off enough to where they are completely supporting me through college, I know how blessed I am, although there definitely have been times where I take it for granted. I’m in my 5th semester; I study Criminology. 

My parents only support streaming/YouTube as a hobby. Every time I say I want to work hard to turn it into a career they kind of scoff and say things along the lines of that not being an actual career/not sustainable long term/etc. I always bring up people the MANY people who do it for a career. My dad always tries to shut that down by saying “they’re outliers”. 

True, they ARE outliers but so what?? Why am I not allowed to work hard enough to MAKE myself one of those “outliers”? As for not being sustainable, this sort of career has only been around for the past decade. How does he know??? He literally knows NOTHING about these careers yet he’s pushing all this “knowledge” on me. 

Now don’t get me wrong I’m not trying to drop out of school or anything, I’ve already used 5 whole semesters of their money, too late to back out now and I love my major to death. However, I have just applied for an unpaid internship (that I KNOW I’m going to get) at a local police department for the spring. It’s 9am-5pm Monday through Friday. Counts for 3 credit hours. 

I have no idea how I’m going to be doing this internship everyday from 9-5, taking 4 more classes, streaming 3-4 times a week AND putting out a YouTube video minimum once a week-ish. 

I was talking to him about it and he kept telling me to give up/reduce streaming or YouTube. How am I supposed to achieve my dream if I can’t work towards it????? I don’t know what to do.

Recently he’s been sending me lists of jobs, not Criminology related. He has brought up the idea of changing majors, which I’m not opposed to but that’s literally at least 2-3 semesters of their money down the drain if I do change this late in my undergrad career but I have NO idea as to what I would change it to. He will say something like “you could do anything on this list if you’ve just got to put in the work” I’VE ALREADY TOLD YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO but it’s something you disapprove of/don’t think it’ll work, so I’m not allowed to work towards it???

At one point in my life I REALLY wanted to be in the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI. The only reason I don’t want to anymore is because there’s no way they would let me stream/do YouTube otherwise I’d be so down. 
I’m going to school because I know I need a “real job” in case I change my mind/anything happens.  

Idk I just feel guilty that the career I want doesn’t involve a degree, so I feel like I’m wasting their money. I feel hurt that they don’t want to support what I want to do with my life. I’m deathly afraid of going to a job I hate for the rest of my life (it’s what my parents do right now, and I DON’T want that to happen to me. I have no idea what job I COULD have that I wouldn’t hate so I could work towards my dream on the side. My YouTube has been lacking because it’s so hard to organize a time for my friends and I to film (haven’t tried any solo videos because I feel so talentless and unfunny without them, so I don’t know what kind of videos to make). I HAVEN’T NUTTED IN 17 DAYS. I feel like I’m on a time crunch to make my Twitch/YouTube actually have more success to prove to what feels like EVERYONE in my life that it isn’t a waste of time.

I know my parents are just doing what they think is best. I know they’re just looking out for me. 

I really don’t know what the question I’m asking here, or what kind of advice I’m looking for. After typing this all out, I think I’m only more confused than when I started. Thank you for reading. I don’t know where this went and I should probably clean it up more but I think it’s time for me to leave this Target parking lot, I’ve been here for a while.",17Nov2019,1
790,"*warning this is a long story but if you actually read it you have no idea how much it means to me. No idea. I just need advice from anyone, and I need to vent out my emotions* 

I lost a sibling of mine that I love so much I lost her two years ago. There was no body to bury, no funeral, and still for two years later I have not seen my family even cry a single tear over it. And here I am silently crying me self to sleep, crying home alone every chance I can get. It’s been two years and I’ve only ever talked about it three times with my family. The first time my mom overheard my tell me friend about the death. Now truth is I don’t know what day she died. So I just guessed when my friend asked my what day she died. So I told her what I thought it was, but my mom overheard this and yelled at me. No screamed, because apparently I got the day wrong. (She still never told me what it was) Then I ran to my room and cried. Then the second was when a year ago my brother started to notice I was depressed more than usual. Then I told him I missed our sibling. Then he told me (not exactly in these words) that he didn’t even care that she died, because he didn’t even want another sibling. And there I was crying my eyes out as he sincerely told me he basically couldn’t give two poops about it. Then the third was just three months ago. (It’s been two years since she died)  
The only thing I had left to remind me of her was a plush elephant. But I cited one day will I saw a hole in it. Then she asked my why I was crying as she stitched up the hole in it. I didn’t respond for a while. Until she realized it was because of “Her”. The without even a hint of sadness or emotion in her face she just said this word for word. The words will never leave my head. “Look miscarriages happen all the time, you need to get over it” I was so mad. How could she say that. “Happens all the time” “Get over it” . It was in her body how could she say that. And I know what you’re thinking. Maybe they are pretending not to care, because this is their way of coping. And I’ve thought about that. But you should have seen the look on all there faces when I talked with them the three different times. I can truly say, I honestly think they just don’t care that she died. The today I cried because my family told me that I have been showing “attitude” towards them for a while now. I wanted to tell them I was because I missed “her”. But every single time I brought it up to some one I always end up regretting it. But I feel like the reason I can’t “get over it” like my mom told me to. Is because we never had a funeral and NEVER talk about it. So I feel like if I went to a “safe place” I know. Then buried a note of all the things I wish I could have said to her. Then cry for hours. Which believe me I could do. I have been suppressing all my sadness for two years. And after the argument to my parents about my attitude, I feel like I’m a bomb about to go off. With all my emotions about to implode. So should I go through with this idea and have a funeral? But the problem is what if this doesn’t help and I’m still depressed after? Or what if it’s not like how I imagined it to be? (Would that mean it’s less meaningful if it’s not like how I pictured) Or the biggest con. WHAT IF I GET CAUGHT? Or a stranger shows up, or worse someone I know? Should I do this? Or should I find a different less risky way to deal with the pain? And can I just say that if you read this word for word.

I pretty rarely cry otherwise and the meltdowns are usually over something entirely unrelated to family (ex. last night  I cried for six hours about how it felt stupid applying to law school because I'm so worried about climate change and need to be doing something about it.) Other topics of upset in past years have been about feeling ugly, or not feeling like I fit in anywhere. I thought I'd grown out of it since I really haven't been upset like this since I was probably in early high school, so I was surprised when it happened.

My family is generally quite supportive and accepting of me. We have our usual disfunction like political disagreements, but never anything related to abuse or put-downs. If we have issues with each other they're never discussed. It just seems to trigger something in me that I can't really figure out.

Has anyone else had this experience where being around family, even with no history of abuse or disfunction, brings out the worst in you? I've been in therapy for almost two years now for genetic depression so I might bring this up in my next session if it's unusual.

We’re still hanging out later this week but I just don’t want her to lose interest because I stopped texting,17Nov2019,1
796,"Hi guys....i dont rlly kknow how to say this. I apologize for any grammatical errors here but my hands are shaking so much i can bately type. 

A little background info: I am a 17 year old male who lives with my family (an older sis in uni, my father, and my mom). my mom is very sick. she got into an accident a ffew years ago and has a damaged spine and a very bad injury on her brain that at times causes her to lose feeling or control of the right side of her body. We are in some financial stress as she didnt have a job for the past 4 years due to the law case and injury and only ust went back ito the owrkforce. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have access to my fathers email. He is not aware of this as he thinks he logged out. well while going through his email to get a notification for school (grad pics) i saw something odd. An email from the address of X. And the email shows the first few sentences of the body. So the first few words i read was hi baby. I got suspicious and read the entire thhing and it seems like he is having an affair. At first i thought that it was sent to the wrong email as X called him by a name he doesnt have, im just going to refer to it as ""shithead"" from here on. So I went to look through his sent files to see if he ever responded to this person and he has. They talked about how X had to go to China for job and how its hard to keep in contact, how my father works extra hours for them and they refer to each other as honey baby and a lot of other pet names. They email and apparently message each other at like 2 in the morning and they talked about how he will fly over to china or something later or meet when she gets back. apperantly the in a few months she was supposed to come to here  and they would make their final decision. When i read that my heart sank. Questions rushed into my head and i was at a loss. I came to the conclusion that his friend was just using his account but as i sat on it i realized that was probably very unlikely. the grammar, the format, the words, they are all his. 

No one except me knows about this. I dont know what i should do. every time i see him i get this uncontrollable rage that fills me up with stress and anxeity with wat will happen and if he rlly is cheating. I cant tell my sister because tbh i fear wat would happen to my family. As much as i hate the enviornment and the stress and fights, i just cant bring myself to see it burn down. my family's dynamic is shit i admit it. but i still treasure the moments we have together and im afraid of wat would happenn if everyone were to find out. I know it is selfish of me but im scared. I dont want my sister to stress out either cuz she has finals in uni and wants to get into law school and the stress and problems may cause her to drop marks. 

My mom is sick and out of the country rn so i dont know what i should do about her.

TBH the marriage between my mom and father has been shit. at first i boiled it down to the stress that came with only one person having a job. But even now after my mom has gotten a job its been shit. they fight constantly, he doesnt take care of any bills, he barely talks with my sister or my mother. (my sis and him had a falling out after a massive argument). 

If i keeep this to myself and keep living in a lie, i wont ever be able to hold onto my family ever again in the same view. if i tell them, my family wont be a family. im scared and alone. i havent been able to study for tests or do hmw cuz every time i sit down i just remeber this. my only escape so far has been gaming as it keeps my mind focused on something. so if any here has any advice please help. if u have one through this wat did u do? is there a way i can confirm that he is cheating without making it blatantly obvious (although i know the chances of him not cheating are practically .0000000001% at this point i still hang on to that hope). im so lost and im scared. im fighting back tears rn and i just dont know wat to do. please help me.",17Nov2019,1
797,"My life is a mess, just like my room, I have no discipline to study and I am basically throwing away my life in a way.
The thing is that I really don't know what to do.
I don't want to fail in school but then again I'm like any ""dumb"" teenage kid just saying that it doesn't matter and I'll be fine once I am out of school. I just feel exhausted since more than a year and have been dragging myself through school since then. Obviously my grades are representing the work that I've put in, which is none. I really don't know how to get my life back on track. If you have any advice, I could really use it.",17Nov2019,1
798,Is this possible? I use my nostrils. Its also funny that I used to have different breathing sensation at one point.,17Nov2019,1
799,"Hi ! First of all, I'm sorry if my English is weird, I'm trying my best. 

So, I feel really bad lately. I'm feeling kind of empty almost all the time and I don't have any motivation anymore. 

When I come home from school, I go to my bed and I do absolutely nothing until I go to sleep, most of the time I'm on my phone doing nothing or I sleep (I feel super tired all the time and I have a lot of nightmares), or I spend a lot of time just looking into space. Sometimes I cry because I feel like shit because of this, I'd really like to do things, I have a lot of passions, I like drawing, photography, reading, writing,... but I feel stuck. I feel guilty because I don't spend time with my family anymore.

Everyday, I say to myself ""Okay, today, I'm going to do this, and that, and that. And I'm really doing it this time."" and I always end up in my bed, looking into space, no matter how much I try. It feels like I'm not interessed in anything anymore.

Most of the time, I don't even do my homework, and I don't study for the tests. And of course my grades are getting low, I'm a ""good student"" so it's not that bad for now but it's still lower than usual. And I completely gave up on some subjects.

Sometimes it gets better, but I've been feeling so empty almost all the time during the last two months (My lack of motivation is older, 5 or 6 months ? I's certainly more, I cant' remember)

I would like to see a psychologist or a phychiatrist (I don't know the difference, I'm sorry),  just to talk a bit and maybe to get over this, but I don't know if I'm legitimate or if I'm just having a bad period. 

So I'm asking here for your opinions, Am I just having a bad period ? Shloud I see someone ? Do you have any advices ?  


Thank you for reading and sorry again for my English",17Nov2019,1
800,"In my (18M) final year of high school and there’s this girl I’ve known since freshman year and didn’t really become friends with until last year who is increasingly negative about really anything. She’s always been one to complain but recently I realized can’t deal with it anymore, especially because it’s impossible to avoid her. She’s in my science class as well as gym class, not to mention she sits with me and our mutual friend during lunch (he also can’t stand her). It’s not that there aren’t any good qualities she has, for instance she’s very funny and in the right mood she is a great person to talk to. On the other hand she just talks shit and complains about other people, her family, school work, boyfriends, and really anything at this point. Not to mention she takes absolutely no personal responsibility; she’ll complain about receiving a 0 for something she didn’t hand in... I mean what do you expect if you don’t do it? It’s one thing if you don’t care and get a 0 but if you don’t do something and act shocked you aren’t immediately given a 100 then that’s on you, it’s really unbelievable sometimes. She comes from a unstable house so I’ve always tried to be sympathetic as I come from a similar environment but at this point I’m tired of having my day ruined by having to talk her through something rationally. Becoming friends with her has led other kids to look at me differently as she is known as being difficult and just an all around negative person, something I didn’t fully realize until this year. She hates everyone and everything and I have to hear it about it everyday... The other day I had it when she was complaining about something ridiculous and I told her straight up I wasn’t in the mood and she seemed to respect it for about 10 minutes but before I knew it she’s on to something else to complain about. She has really bad issues mental health wise and I don’t want to feel responsible if I were to tell her I don’t want to be friends anymore because she has nobody else who will talk to her on the other hand it’s making me miserable to show up everyday and have conversations with her. How would you deal with somebody like her?",17Nov2019,1
801,"I was supposed to be smart. My parents warned me about the consequences. I knew what could happen but I didn’t care. 


We are not ready for this. She is graduating high school next year, and I am currently going to a 4-year university *for free*. I have a semi-stable job but I make barely enough each month. My parents are very religious and would be devastated with this news. They don’t even like my girlfriend. 


Our best option would be abortion, but she is against it, and I am going to stand by her decision. I don’t want to be the kind of dad that leaves, I want to be there for my child. But my major is computer science and I barely have any time right now so how am I going to have time when my classes get harder? 


All my life I thought I was a smart guy, I got 4 years for free at a university, I have very good grades, I got an easy job, I was planning on doing a bunch of internships or volunteer work. I had so many short and long term plans but now it’s all falling apart. A part of me is happy because having a kid at this age means I will be there for a bigger part of its life. I will be 36 when the child goes to college, and around 40 when it gets married. But another part of me is falling apart because I don’t want to be a teen dad, and we are not financially, physically or emotionally ready. 


I don’t know what to do. I know it’s not the end of the world but it sure feels like it. I don’t know if I’ll be able to continue at university, or if she will be able to graduate. I am terribly nervous about our parents. I don’t know how I’ll be able to afford diapers and food and clothes. Im so lost. I still can’t believe this is happening. I really need help",17Nov2019,1
