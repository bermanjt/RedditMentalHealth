0,"This is a pretty long post so bare with me here.

Not too long ago I discovered r/orthotropics. Orthotropics are basically 2 expelled orthodtontists trying to prove and push people to the idea that oral posture makes a person good looking, not genetics. They say that if your tongue's resting position is not at the roof of your mouth (it has to be the whole tongue, not just the front) you have bad oral posture and probably ugly and have crooked teeth. They also push ideas that swallowing correctly and neck posture all relate to good looking faces and sharp jawlines. Also, if you're an adult the changes of your face when finally adapting to this right oral posture will be minimal since your facial development is much much slower in adulthood as opposed to childhood (I'm 18 years old).

A lot of people are convinced by this and the r/orthotropics subreddit is growing faster than ever before. Because everyone is getting so convinced and putting out 'success stories' I started to be convinced as well.

This made me extremely aware of how I looked, wondered if my oral posture was correct (my tongue does rest on the roof of my mouth mostly, but I don't know if 'mostly' is enough. I also don't have good neck posture at all) and panicked thinking that I the reason I have my facial flaws is because of something I didn't do when I was younger, not genetics. Thinking it was only genetics before comforted me in a way since I couldn't do anything about it but having that their is a possibility that my current looks were altered in a bad way because of my oral posture as a kid frightens me. All this made me focus on my face A LOT more and started noticing ""flaws"" in it that I didn't see as flaws before.

Their statements on why beauty is so important in today's world made me really upset. Many people in the comments on the Orthotropics YouTube channel as well as the subreddit claim that beauty is the most important thing a person can have and if you're not attractive you're in a major disadvantage in life and this disadvantage is caused by YOU not having good oral posture as a kid, not genetics. I knew that being ugly was a disadvantage in life before discovering this, but not as bad as they claim.

The last straw was a video posted on the Orthotropics channel named ""Why beauty is not in the eye of the beholder"" which he is pretty much pointing out that the flaws you get from not having correct oral posture is ugly for everyone and SYMMETRY IN THE FACE IS KEY for a beautiful face. I spotted a few comments on the video as well that people said ""the beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" was just a coping mechanism for ugly people and people agreed. Even though there were quite a few people that disagreed with the video, the like-to-dislike ratio was still pretty good on their end.

This made me notice a lot of asymmetries and flaws in the face that I had never noticed before. I noticed that my jaw on the right side of my face was bigger than on the left. Probably because of the jaw clicking I have on the right side and me preferring to chew on that side. I also noticed that my chin is a little more recessed than preferred, something that I never noticed before, I thought my chin was fine. I think my face is also a bit long, which according to them is another symptom of not having good oral posture.

Now I cannot unsee these flaws. I cannot see my jaw being bigger, even though I never saw that before, makes me feel deformed. I cannot unsee my chin and see it as normal. I cannot stop worrying if my face is too long or not. I'm not happy to have braces anymore and being excited to see the results since they wont eliminate my other apparently much worse flaws.

I want to see myself as a relatively attractive dude as I saw myself before I discovered orthotropics. I went to the gym and my physique was (is, although I've lost some mass) pretty good, but after discovering this I had no desire to go to the gym anymore and just feel depressed.

It's like this has made me develop body dysmorphia disorder because of this discovery. I was never really 'happy' with my looks before but I was getting rather content with it after receiving a really good compliment from a girl that hasn't seen me since I was 12 years old. She told me I got a lot more masculine and good looking and was amazed how much I've changed. That was probably the best compliment I've EVER received. But I can't take it as well anymore because of all this.

I just want to stop obsessing over my looks. I want to feel okay looking again, like I did before. I actually felt like I had a chance with girls. Now I feel like if I ever had a chance with a girl it's because they just settled with me since they themselves also couldn't get a better looking partner. I want that mindset out of my brain, but I don't know how.

How do I stop obsessing over this and just accept my looks instead of feeling terrible about myself? I wish I never discovered orthtropics, I want this to end.

TL;DR Obsessed over looks after discovering r/orthotropics and other likewise subs that focus on looks. Can't stop thinking about all the flaws I have after discovering that my right jaw is bigger than the left and bunch of other asymmetries that I never noticed before. I want to accept my looks again.",22Feb2019,1
1,"Ok, if anyone experienced something like this or still does, I could really use some advice on how to stop because it's genuinely frustrating me. So as a child, me and my brother would fantasize on are trampoline pretending to be Harry potter or make up stories and jump around as we play out stories. we obviously don't do this now and I'm a 16 year old who has experienced a lot of trauma since then, 2 divorces on my mum side, a brother with extreme OCD who would channel frustrated outbursts as abuse on me, my dad suffered depression and attempted suicide. and now a lot of my own demon I've been struggling with too (anxiety, paranoia, depression) but that's my back story, anyway, I never really stopped these reenactment and it became a sort of coping mechanism, i will find an empty room in my house and jump around will fantasying of being whatever my hobby is at the time, I've also noticed that i become very sexually frustrated after this and get in a loop of doing this, relieving myself and doing this, what I'm imagining doesn't arouse me its just the hyper activity of it all. it is clearly distraction and i have speculated for a while i may have ADD or something, i get tunnel vision on hobbies and can spit out ideas at 1000Mp/h for something I love, and can be bored senseless in the first 5-10 minutes of a math lesson, but i need to stop the jumping thing, I'm trying to make my bedroom a peaceful place with plants and a TV I cant be jumping around in there in case i damage something, I'm very artistic and need to stop so i stop feeling an urge to jump around right in the middle of a painting or something, its not maladaptive daydreaming as I can distinguish reality, but i often even find myself even more upset about myself after doing this, any advice.",22Feb2019,2
2,"Sorry for the undescriptive title. I couldn't think of anything better.

This is kind of an update on [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/as8mqh/should_i_tell_my_friends_this_guy_we_were_going/).

I'll bold my questions.

Okay, so you can read my last post to get some detail, but I'll do a bit of a summary here (my friends and I are 19, the pedo is 24):

So I found out a guy my friends and I know online is a pedophile out on bail. Right before I found out we had all agreed to meet up tomorrow for dinner and a movie/bowling. We all initially agreed to cancel, but 2 of my friends decided to meet up with this guy again. My friends believe the pedos story of him ""dating \[a 10-13\] y/o for over 2 years but we only hugged"". I don't understand how my friends find this acceptable enough to want to hang out with him, plus it's almost certainly a lie.

I told my friends I would love to hang out with them if the pedo wasn't there. They are choosing him over me! These are my best friends over the past 3-4 years, and they are choosing to hang out with a pedo they met 2 months ago instead of me and our other friend who is equally as disgusted as I am. I also said I won't be doing anything with them on our discord server unless the pedo is gone. They chose him there again! I don't think anyone else on the server knows,  **should I put the pedo on blast in the server chat**? I'm hoping everyone on there will agree with me and want him gone and that my friends will then realize how messed up he really is. But I am also afraid my friends will somehow make me out to be the asshole, plus in the past I always stay as far away from drama as I can. Let alone be the one to start some shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I kind of question my friends judgement and morals now. They are really nice people so I'm hoping they have just been manipulated. But like WTF? The dude is a fucking pedo who is about to spend the next 10+ years of his life in prison for sexually assaulting a child. And they want to hang out with him. Not only that, they want to hang out with him over me?! Like seriously I don't have an easy time making friends (shyness/anxiety, wanting nothing to do with people who are into drinking/drugs which cuts out A LOT of people) so I don't want to lose these people as my friends, but I'm really reconsidering it. Shit... these people are like 90% of the reason I chose to go to the college I'm at, or at least haven't transferred out.

I held back on putting the pedo on blast when I first found out thinking my friends would certainly immediately get rid of him. But they didn't and now I really don't know what to do. This situation is pretty much all I've been thinking about the past couple of days and I am continuously feeling more hurt and more angry at my friends. None of it makes any sense :'(",22Feb2019,1

4,"Guys, this is a continuation of my last post. How should I ask the girl to the dance. We don’t go to the same school (mine is a boys only school) so I don’t know if I should ask her over text or at her house cause texting sounds a bit boring but going to her house feels a little over the top. What should I do?",22Feb2019,1
5,"I really need advice on how to make and *keep* friends because I feel like I've forgotten how friendships work.

For some background, I'm a 19f college student at a university in my hometown, so I'm not really far from anyone who I went to high school or middle school with. I'm in my second semester and I started attending with a little circle of friends from high school. However, it wasn't a very tight group since most high school friendships aren't that tight anyway. So due to never seeing each other I drifted away from all of them except for one person, who I ended up having to block all contact with and cut our ties due to toxicity reasons (I don't want to get into the gritty details). So I lost all of the friends I previously had.

I had a class last semester and met some really awesome people in there, including my current boyfriend. We were pretty tight during that semester, but after the new semester started group contact pretty much disappeared. I have a great family but no one is around my age except for my mom's sister, who will be attending my university next year. We're very close but unfortunately don't see each other often right now.

The only friend I really have right now is my boyfriend, and there's nothing bad about that, I could go on for hours about how awesome he is. It's just that I shouldn't *only* have him. I need to have other friends because I can't bother him every second that I want to talk, he's a busy guy and that's not healthy for relationships anyway.

I'm not a particularly introverted or timid person, but I am kind of shy when it comes to actually initiating conversations which I think is how most people are. I know I am a little to blame for my situation since I've had opportunities to meet lots of people. I talked to the foreign language advisor to get some materials provided by the school because I wanted to learn Korean, and he told me about the school's Asian Students Club that he oversees and invited me to join. I was going to but ended up discouraging myself from doing so because I felt awkward since I'm not Asian, which I know is a silly reason. I'm a geoscience major and I was invited to join the geography club as well, but discouraged myself from that too. I was even going to join an anime club but decided not to because I'm not as knowledgeable about it as the other club members would have been. So I know I've kind of sabotaged myself a bit.

I really want to make friends because I hate feeling so alone and I know it isn't healthy for me. How can I make more friendships that will last?",22Feb2019,1

so as I am 18, I still live with my parents. I will be travelling to another part of the country for a gangbang and I have no clue what I should tell my parents?

8,"I had a thing for a guy that I’d known for about two years. I never confessed my feelings as it was inappropriate, and regardless, he had a girlfriend. Anyway, he breaks it off with her and moves to a different country for a job opportunity. Pathetically, i was completely devastated, however i told myself I’d get over it. It’s been a year and a half since he left and my feelings still remain. I’ve had very brief encounters with him during the times he came back to visit, and I’ll admit that I’ve checked his social media. It appears he’s seeing a new woman, and I can’t help but feel like shit. My infatuation with him was addictive and I’ve felt lost and directionless ever since he left.

9,"I’m an otherwise healthy 22 year old female. Two years ago I worked abroad, and I think around that time I developed something where I started coughing up some gross things. At this time, I also developed abscesses in my legs, which I still battle with now (turning up maybe once a year), though these are the only health problem I face. I’m otherwise of a healthy weight, eat well, exercise. 
For the past two years I’ve been coughing up a lot of mucus. For weeks at a time it’s thick and green, almost hard lumps, then that might subside but it’s still off coloured mucus. I never used to cough up anything but now it seems it’s always there, every time I cough, I cough up thick mucus. Anybody have any insight as to what this could be?
Of course I will see my doctor ASAP about it, the only reason I haven’t is because I didn’t think it was anything worth seeing a doctor about, I feel it’s nothing and I wouldn’t go to the doctor about a cough, it’s only now I realise I’ve had it for so long and am starting to get a bit worried. 
Anybody know what this could be? I feel like it’s been happening for too long to be an infection or am I overthinking how bad it is?? L",22Feb2019,1
10,"I really don’t want to break up with her, but I swear I’m tired of everything. I’m her first girlfriend, and she need to realise that if don’t start making an effort, I’m just going to leave. 


I love her because she’s really smart and funny, but love isn’t sufficient anymore. I’m always the one proposing fun stuff to do together (when she got ideas of fun shit to do, it’s always something with her friends), I’m always the one who cook for her, or the one who make kind attentions (littles notes and candies on her desk etc), I’m always the one doing everything in the bedroom (she’s confortable with me, I already asked her several time. She’s just lazy af). She tells me suggestions on how to dress and how it would be nice for me to lose weight and do exercise... When she start making efforts on herself, diets/exercice/general look, it always last a week and then she’s back to her old self. I’m the only one who tries to make changes on the long term. She told me I wasn’t dressing nicely enough, so I bought new “fancy looking” shirts and she was pleased. But she barely make a move to change herself. She just continue to see the same friends, in the same dirty apartment (and she never even tried to come to MY place, because “there’s too much stares”). Sometimes she says mean shit and never ask her if she’s in the wrong.
I got bigass anxiety issues, and she’s probably putting my “bad mood” on my mental health account.


She acts like she’s comfortable the way she is, and clearly, I’m scared to tell her everything. I don’t want her to be hurt, I just want her to realise that we need to improve a couple things. I’m always hiding my mind when if comes to those things, but when I decide to talk I know I can be a bit harsh. And she don’t deserve this.

Any advice on how manage the confrontation ? How should I start, point things in a better way etc... How to not explose and be suddenly mean to her, perhaps ?

Long story short : my girl friend is so lazy I do everything in the relationship. I feel like her dad and it sucks. I don’t want to break up. How can I confront her to this without making her cry or think that I’m the crazy one ? I want our relationship to improve but she barely make a decision on herself when it’s related to us.",22Feb2019,1
11,"A little backstory here, I moved into my place almost a year ago, there are only 3 other units in the building as it’s a very large old Victorian style house converted into apartments. My upstairs neighbour used to live with his girlfriend who moved out about 4 months ago. They were pretty quiet aside from usual sounds now and again. 

After she moved out, his friend moved in with him and it’s been hell ever since. My partner and I feel like we are living in a frat house, loud parties every weekend and some weeknights, which include loud music, singing, stomping, yelling, even karaoke.. We let it go at first because we thought he was just getting over a breakup by doing the usual stuff people do, drink and get a little reckless. But he’s become a total asshole, we had started to text our landlord to ask him to turn the music down, keep noise to a minimum, because it was really getting ridiculous. 

He usually turned the music down but then would get his house full of people to start belting out tunes at the top of their lungs and stomp in unison until they got too tired to go on. Or eventually he would just ignore and keep his party going all night. So we stared to call the non emergency line as instructed by our landlord who at this point served him an eviction notice which they’ll be out by the beginning of April. 

They’d been up there several times already over the last few weeks and he’s been given 2 fines. Our landlord is pretty open with information and told us he mocked us to her and said to continue calling the cops if we want because he is going to continue doing what he wants till the bitter end. 

So we have a really nice sound system and on Sunday morning we put our subwoofers on top of our bookcases close to the ceiling and blared the most annoying music we could find for about 3 hours from 8-11 am. Aqua, smash mouth, black flag, nickel back, slayer. All kinds of shit.

We had made our point and thought it was it was over for a few days. Until this morning when I went to take my dog for a walk, I opened our front door; which opens to a small lobby type area where we all have front entrances and one large door which leads outdoors. 

There was a shovel and an old mason jar with crusted wine on the bottom propped up on the handle of the shovel which was leaned against our door. The shovel and glass fell inward on myself and my dog, thankfully the glass didn’t break and cut a paw or a toe but I think that was the point... I was baffled at this boing trap that was set up for one of us, now I’m pissed after thinking about it and the potential harm it could have caused. It might sound dramatic but if my dog had gotten hurt I would have gone berserk. I texted my landlord about it just a few minutes ago but I really don’t think she can do much about it. Also the other neighbours have also all complained about them and we all have a sort of neighbourly friendship about it, so I’m %99 sure it wasn’t either of them, that only leaves the dicks upstairs.

She would fight with me over the little things, I would do the dishes for her and after I’m finished she would call me ‘incompetent to do anything a normal human can’ because I put a cup the wrong way on the drying rack, which doesn’t sound like anything at all but it always escalates into something bigger and always about my untidy room. My room would be a small bit messy and she would call me stuff like how retarded I am and how I need an SNA and says I’ll never amount to anything in life for 15 minutes while I just stand there with my tears dripping onto the floor. One day she got half the shit in my room from my desk, my nightstand, my wardrobe and threw it all on the floor and dumped everything out of my school bag onto the floor and called me stuff far worse than before. She came into my room an hour later to see me in the corner crying and she just left again.

17,"(NY) Was this sexual assault?




When I was a freshman in high school, I think I was 14, I went to the mall with a junior. I believe we had kissed once or twice before this. We kinda just walked around and looked at things and left but his mom wasn’t there yet so we went walking outside. We went to like a secluded part of the parking lot at night time. The mall has those big lights with the cement blocks so it’s not completely dark. (I figured we would kiss again is why I went back there) He kinda helped me up to sit on the cement block of the light post and we kissed. He was getting hard because of this so he said to me, in a jokingly manner, to either let him fuck me or give him a hand job. He proceeded to take his dick out before I could even answer and rubbed it against me while I was sitting on the block. It was winter and I had pants on so.. yeah. Anyway he stuck his hand down my pants and it was cold so I was a little shocked. I said that I don’t want to do anything here cause of his mom but I really just didn’t want to. He pushes his dick into my pants more so I told him that I’d just jack him off and i did. He came on the ground and grabbed some snow to put on his dick. His mom had texted him saying she was there so we were walking away and I was crying. He knew I was crying. He didn’t say anything. I made myself stop crying so his mom wouldn’t see.

19,"I don't even really know where to begin, I just feel really helpless. I'm about to graduate college with a B.S and it has not been easy. I've struggled with ADHD, depression, social anxiety, self-isolation, regret, and so on. 

To start, all throughout high school I wanted to major in Marine Biology. I took several Marine Bio classes in high school and was deeply inspired by one of my teachers (one of those that really cares about his students and makes learning interesting). His eyes would light up whenever he talked about the ocean, and that passion was imprinted on me. From then on, my major was basically decided. That is despite my teacher's warnings. He told me that marine biologists don't typically make much money (was never about that), tend to do government work living grant to grant, and the field is heavily saturated. Although he encouraged me that if I was driven and passionate, it was possible. Applied to colleges and got both my first and second choices. My first choice was Hawaii Pacific University with a scholarship. I looked at the situation logically and realized that I wouldn't see my family as much, I wouldn't see my friends, the high cost of living, etc. I decided to go with my second choice, despite my teacher warning me not to. His reasoning was that his daughter went there, the majority of the students are in Greek life(Frats and Sororities), and she found it hard to make friends. Well, I experienced that exact same problem. 

My freshman year I struggled to meet new people, didn't like my roommate (no problem with him either), and resorted to visiting my friends back home as I was lonely. I had some friends in my dorm, but didn't feel like I fit in anywhere. I was broke like most college students, but for some reason, felt indirectly excluded because of this. I'd get asked to go out and get food, drink, go to movies, go to a concert, and so on. I would have to always decline, and eventually, the invitations stopped coming. People stopped coming by my room to say hello, and I started to feel extremely lonely. I started to self-isolate because I felt like the only time people wanted to hang out with me was when they needed something or wanted people to go out with. Eventually, the same thing happened to my friends back home. They either moved on with their life, we fell out of touch (self-isolation), or they stopped needing me. Except for a couple of great friends, I was basically all alone. I was able to keep my grades up enough and completed freshman year. My sophomore year was a lot harder for me. 

I had another roommate that was okay, but we never clicked, and just kept to ourselves. I know people tell you not to compare yourself to others around you, but in college, it feels extremely competitive and it's hard not to. I started noticing that my classmates seemed to have particular fields that they wanted to specialize in (Dolphins, coral, seaweed, or even more specific). I also started to see that some of my classmates had connections, internship opportunities, and more because of their specialization. My former passion (that I had a good amount of knowledge in) started to feel foreign for me. The intro classes were super easy, but I struggled with Gen Eds. I never really had to apply myself in high school. I would attend class, do homework 5 min before class, not study and still get high grades, that was it. I never struggled or had to build up coping mechanisms/study skills that many other students had to form. I couldn't imagine having to take 2 semesters of Organic Chem, one of Calc, and one of Stats Being overwhelmed by my classmates, not having great study skills, and just feeling lost, I broke. I stopped going to classes, eating well, exercising, and socializing. A week would go by with me only muttering a few words when I had to. I ended up deeply regretting my college choice and wishing that I had gone with my first choice. I feel that if I had gone to HPU, I would have stuck with Marine Bio, rather than taking the easy way out. I finally decided to take a medical leave of absence and giving up my passion. I switched to another major I was interested in, but not passionate about. It had far less requirements and figured I could make money, so I took the easy way out. 

How do I deal with the deep regret of not going to HPU? Dropping my passion and taking the easy way out? It is something that eats at me all the time. If I had gone there, I probably would have stuck with marine bio, been forced to meet new people, and probably would be happier in the long run. Just say ""Oh well, the past is in the past""? That was my passion! I feel like either depression or the college killed my passion and now I'm just a husk of a person I was.

Now that I'm close to graduating, I'm beginning to think about employment, living on my own, taking care of my health, my relationship, my family, the friends that I've lost, etc. I'm just so lost and hopeless right now, it feels like I'm back to sophomore year again. To make things worse, once I was in a good place, my insurance stopped covering my ADHD meds, telling me I have to explore other alternatives..... right at the start of this semester. I feel like I'm starting to slip down that slope.

In terms of employment, I had an internship last semester, and the company offered me a job as a team leader/manager for one of their buildings once I graduate. This in itself makes my stomach drop. I have no idea how to negotiate the terms on which I'm hired (401k, health insurace, sick days, salary vs hourly) and don't want to be taken advantage of. At the same time, I feel like there are other people at the company that have been there for longer, and would be a better fit for the role. I feel like my degree is basically getting me the job, but I did take 4 years to get my degree. Is it wrong to take the job if I think I can still do the work, even though I haven't worked there as long? How do I go about the conditions in which I'm hired?

Recently I've been thinking a lot about my family too. It's sad to see my parents getting old and their health declining, even though they still have a good 10+ years left. I've been feeling nostalgic, missing the way things were, miss spending time with my family. I feel like since I've been in college, I've pushed my family away, and isolated myself from even them. They ask me to visit, and I'd give them some excuse like homework, exams etc. Maybe I felt guilty, scared to tell them how I feel, who knows? All I know is that when I go home now, even though everything is okay, I have this overwhelming sense of guilt and sorrow. The more I start to be independent, the farther away I feel. I want to spend time with them, but at the same time, I have to force myself to. 

This is the last one, bear with me. The past 2.5 years I've been dating my girlfriend. She's wonderful and really good to me, to be honest she's one of my only friends these days. We both have mental health issues and baggage from our past, and both made that clear going into the relationship. This is my first relationship longer that a few months, and expressed my hesitancy to enter a relationship when I wasn't necessarily in the best place. Despite that, we've been together for a while now, and things have been alright. We've been there for each other through thick and thin, and I love her like crazy. She's come a long way from when we first met. Due to a previous abusive relationship, it took her  some time, but she's lost a lot of weight, is doing better in college, has more self confidence, and a better relationship with her parents (still not great). The only problem is that I'm starting to realize that I can't picture us together for the rest of our lives. I don't see us growing old together, hell the thought of us moving in together is scary. We both don't really have any friends other than each other though. They've all either moved away, fallen out of touch, or we stopped hanging out when we started dating. This has also made it hard because we're together all the time. I love her a lot, but she definitely loves me more and is scared of losing me(abandonment issues). This makes her cling harder and push me away a bit. 

I don't know if I'm unhappy with the relationship because I stopped having my hobbies, friends, free time and that's why I'm slowly having doubts about the relationship. We're both super stressed and struggling, and it would be good to take some time and better ourselves, but at the same time I want to be there for her. I can't just drop someone I love when they're struggling. At the same time, we entered the relationship with the goal of always pushing each other to do and be better. Recently I haven't felt like I've been doing better, I feel like I'm back where I was 3 years ago, while I keep encouraging her to do well. I've honestly also starting having thoughts of other women, and starting to feel like I'm not ready to be in this relationship for life. I guess there is no good time to break up with someone, but is it wrong to stay with someone when they need you? I wouldn't want her to do anything to herself if we did break up. 

All advice is appreciated, especially the hard truth. Sorry it was so long, I'm just feeling helpless and needed to rant.

21,"My boss and I are going to a conference located in a hotel. Technically it's in town (or at least reasonably close to home under normal circumstances), but due to very long hours and unreliable public transportation, I decided to book a room at a different hotel across the street from the conference. My boss found out that I had a room, and asked me if I would let her use it during the day. I feel super weird about this. I like my privacy, we haven't known each other very long (less than 3 months), and even if I had known her longer I'd still feel like it's an inappropriate request for a boss to ask their employee. It's like she was inviting herself into my home (a temporary home, but all the same...). 

Technically I said ""maybe,"" but in a tone of voice that should have been read as a VERY obvious ""no."" (I know I should have been more firm, but I was so surprised and felt so awkward about the request that I didn't react as well as I should have.) Then I suggested she hang out in the conference hotel's lounge or business center, since she said she just wanted to hang out and work a little. 

I'm worried she's going to ask me about it again -- she can be pretty persistent. She's also been having a rough time lately, and the rest of our small office knows it. I'm worried if I say no again, she's going to act sour about it and the rest of the office is going to treat me like I'm being a bitch... But just because she's been dealing with some personal things doesn't mean I should ignore my own boundaries, right??",22Feb2019,4

24,"I don’t really know where to start this and it’s long. Sorry. Our kid is a socially awkward nonconformist ‘genderqueer’ identifying 4th grader who hates school. To get our kid to go to school regularly (they’re often “sick” from nerves etc) and not have nightmares about it fourty-seven times a night, we agreed that one of us parents would come to lunch *everyday* to check in with kid. School doesn’t allow cellphones or similar (we tried that route). Usually it’s me, mom. Despite no clear policy being in place limiting parental visits (its a public school) the school has lately been subtly signaling that they’d like this to come to an end (having multiple people tell me there’s not enough room for me in the cafeteria, the kid needs more independence, it’s causing issues with jealousy etc) and today it came to a head. Yesterday when I went to the school my child didn’t come in for lunch. Lunch is literally only 20 minutes (11:50-12:10) and that includes getting in line outside the building, lining up to get food, finding seats, cleaning up, lining up, etc) and if my kid doesn’t eat lunch they’re unable to focus on learning for the rest of the day. So my kid didn’t come in. It’s 11:51.....then eventually :56 after. I’m worried about my child at this point, because nobody has noticed they’re not there but me, and staff is distracted/ unable to be flagged down. I start looking for my kid. I call their name in the bathroom, no reply. I check the hallways, the door by the cafeteria, nothing. I finally walk down the hallway to the office to see if my kid is hurt and in the nurses office and see them outside the building at a table as I walk past a window. At this rate they’re going to miss lunch period completely so I head outside myself and tell my child ‘hey, my child’s name-you’re missing lunch.’ Sitting next to my child is a new kid who is super Velcro to my kid, but sweet. They both go inside nervously and eat lunch. I noticed the nervousness and after school I go up to both kids in front of the new kids’ parent- who I have a good relationship with imo and we have chatted many times and coordinated multiple play dates etc. at this point-and I apologize “I’m sorry if I made either of you nervous at lunch- I was so worried when my kids name didn’t come in to eat!” So. Fast forward to this am and I have an email from the principal. I can no longer come to lunch or be around other students because someone is concerned and believes I acted inappropriately to their child. I never addressed their child- I’m very careful not to engage with other kids (even my kids friends) because I am really just there for my own kid. The other parent also didn’t send their child to school today because they didn’t want her to be around me in any circumstances. Of course I’m very upset and I don’t know what to do. Other parents come regularly, usually not every day but many come multiple times a week and have no complaints. The other kids’ parent also has not replied to my message cancelling our play date for this afternoon. I’m super stressed out and upset at this accusation and my kid is distressed about me not being able to come to lunch. wwyd?

31,"I should clarify something first. I can't tell you what the letter said because it was sent to my home (we had exchanged letters before, that's how she has my address) and I'm at college. I found out because my mother informed me that I got mail from the state she lives in, and that it ""must be from some friend of (mine)."" I should also add that I don't have any other friends from California, and I have no family members there. The likelihood of it being from anyone else is very, very low.

To make a long story short, she had been manipulating me for a while, however I've always had doubts about if cutting her off was the right thing. She had been causing a lot of trouble in a mutual friend group we were in, and always getting me to do stuff for her like make her art of things she likes, always expecting everything to be about her, and guilt tripping me at times when I didn't comply, as well as treating the other people in the mutual friend group badly (getting angry and guilt tripping when no one was online due to time zones to respond to her, making conversations about herself only, etc). But the truth is, she's on the autism spectrum. There is always going to be a part of my brain telling me that I was wrong for cutting her off completely, blocking her off everything we communicated on, because she doesn't know that what she's doing is wrong. I wanted to help her and make sure she can improve on her shittier behaviors, and at times would dm her apart from our group chat and be like ""Hey, cut that out,"" but she'd go back to it soon after. She was often very disrespectful and rude to others. 

However, we had been friends for 3 years, after a while I got used to it, and I basically believed her the victim, the poor disabled kid who kept getting ragged on because she didn't know what she was doing was wrong. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore, and decided I was done with her. Something in me just, broke. I realized that she's known all along that she's doing the wrong things, because for her whole life acting like that has gotten her her way, and I cut off all contact. Admittedly, I should have given her at least a small ""I'm out"" speech before cutting her off, but hindsight is 20/20.

My grandparents were wealthy and got some properties, which my dad and his 2 siblings lived off (he pretty much never worked). Now he has shared properties and no cash.

I taught myself English (native Spanish speaker) because of my passion for aviation. I am what is considered “smart”. I won a full scholarship for my major, I won a place to study abroad in Boston University for a year.

In Boston I tried to find an internship (it’s a requirement to graduate in my home school), where all the employers basically rejected me on the spot when learning I am not American (even though my study visa allowed me to work after the academic year). Not even an interview. I feel like that is the point where everything went to shit.

43,"So here’s the deal. I’m in an AP photography class, and for my final studio project I decided to photograph the LGBTQ+ community at my school. I felt very good about the photos, and I decided to post them on my Instagram photography account. A few hours after posting them, I received a message from a girl at my school. Let’s call her Sandy.

So Sandy is pansexual, and she reached out to me saying she was interested in being photographed for my project as well (which I plan on continuing during the spring). However, I don’t like Sandy, and it’s because of something she did a few weeks ago.

Long story short, Sandy was giving an Instagram livestream and, after several people in the chat encouraged her to say the n-word out loud, she did it. She said the n-word live in front of 23 of her peers and friends. Immediately afterward, she played the victim and felt no regret for the fact that she had said something so racist and harmful.

I was outraged by this and vowed never to associate with Sandy anymore or watch her live-streams. Now that she’s messaged me, I don’t know what to do. It feels counterintuitive to reject her request to be in a project that’s about diversity and acceptance, but at the same time I feel as though her being part of the assignment would undermine the whole point of the assignment.

I love so many things about him and can see us lasting well into the future. We respect each other genuinely and really have a good time together. We’re falling hard for one another and I really want to make this relationship work. But here’s the problem:

He’s weirdly close with his mom and it makes me uncomfortable but in front of her I act like it’s no big deal cause I’m a fucking a pushover and don’t want to be rude.

It’s important to mention his mom is bi polar, this I understand as my mother is bi polar. But this lady is on another level. I feel terrible for feeling so uncomfortable sometimes because she is so nice! She’s always cooking me food to take home and giving me her things and loving on me. She gives me uncomfortable tight long hugs which I’ve learned to just kill her with kindness with. Cause if it’s been too long I just hold her tighter and then she wants out. Idk but it works every time!

So although she’s so nice and kind, because she’s bi polar when she doesn’t get her way she can be quite childish and from my boyfriends stories, I have yet to even see the tip of the iceberg! 


When I say close I mean every time I come over to see him (he lives with her atm) she’s always all over him, when we try to go to bed she hangs around (sometimes getting in the bed with us) and drones on obnoxiously about just anything. She knows what she’s doing cause she plays coy when she leaves going “oh I’ll goo I’ll go I’ll leave you two alone” then when I say something nice to close the conversation she uses it as an opportunity to bring something else up and stay longer!
 
Not only that but when she gets drunk she gets into uncomfortable details. Normally she just brags about how amazing and one of a kind her son is, but then she drinks and gets unreasonably honest. He’s embarrassed by this but still allows her to be too close. Like he’ll sit on her lap and she pulls him in kissing all over him and hugging him tight FOREVER whispering in his ear. This goes on for an uncomfortable amount of time. I just kind of looked away until she was done kind of thing it was weird. 

She also went into how every day when he was young they would have these dedicated talks everyday before he went to bed about his day or something and it sounded innocent enough but the way she described it was horrible. She would say “everyday we’d come lay and sit in my bed and I’d ask him how his day was and he’d tell me everything and we could talk about anything..” and then she told me she would tell hm about her sex life or give him massages “full body massages” as she puts it. And she gets so into these stories dude like she’s using her hands to talk and elongating her words like it just made me feel so uncomfortable and my boyfriend  was standing right there like “I can’t believe she’s talking about this. Mom It didn’t go down that way.” But if you know her she won’t shut up for anything, if she’s started a story she isn’t stopping even if you yell over her! So she goes into how he’d like his buttcheeks massaged. Like she would “tickle” them or something and he’s even told me myself about something like this but I thought he was super young and she was just playing like teasing like pinching his butt or something but now it’s starting to sound like she’s always been no boundaries inappropriate and the older he gets in these stories the more it creeps me out. 

He also is super guilty about sex like I thought it was hard for me to cum but it took us a couple times of trying before he felt comfortable to have an orgasm. We have really great sex, we are very comfortable around one another and speak openly but that’s because I facilitate open communication and guide him through the process of being open and positive and comfortable during sex. He says he’s never experienced sex like he does with me in that way. He usually never cums when he has sex he says but now he cums at least once (sometimes twice) during our sessions. As sex isn’t really an issue in our relationship, it is important to me to note that he has A LOT of   guilt when it comes to having sex. Like his mindset on it is fucked up cause he has told me himself he feels guilty after he has sex, as soon as he cums. And I’m like no babe it’s okay to feel good, and we talk openly, but only because I take the time to let him know it’s okay to enjoy yourself as long as it’s consensual. 



SO, ultimately I try not to judge this because my boyfriend truly is an amazing person. He’s so kind and thoughtful, he has real creative talent and a beautiful personality. On top of that he treats me so amazingly, always listens, so tender and respectful, kind with his words, never harsh, always there for me. I really feel us bonding hard, we’ve been dating about 6 months now. I just wish he didn’t have this weird relationship with his mom, I hate how it makes me feel. 

I guess I just need to talk to someone about this cause idk how to feel about it moving forward. I feel like he’s perfect except for his too close relationship with his mom. My family really likes him too, which doesn’t happen ever and is important to me. What would y’all do, what do you think? Please tell me if you have questions, I’ll try to clarify anything.

54,"This is a throwaway btw (Think some friends know what my reddit account is)

&amp;#x200B;

So I have an absolutely terrible roommate at my boarding school. before you say so, I have tried multiple times to switch rooms, but for some reason, none of the people who could actually help seem to give a fuck. I haven't gotten any responses from repeated and continuous attempts to move. I have started recording whenever I'm in the same room as him to compile his toxicity. So, with that out of the way, here's the story: I move in with this kid I thought was my friend after constant begging from him. I was his friend, so I say sure, and move in. Almost immediately, he starts nagging and harassing me on my habits, such as not showering much, or not getting out much. I have real bad anxiety around both and am going to a therapist to work on it, and I told my roommate this. His response is (and I quote) ""What are you gonna do, cry? You're a fucking pussy you know that? You'll have to live in worse conditions in your life."" He then proceeds to threaten to tell all my friends about how much of a slob I am if I don't listen to him. I flip on him. No longer is he my friend, he is my worst nightmare. At this point, I started trying to tell the adults what was going on, but of course, they didn't give a fuck. I eventually forgive him when I realise this, because hey, he was trying to be helpful, and he was at some point a friend. He backed off on that, but things only got much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

After I forgave him, he started to be the worst kind of roommate. He refused to wear headphones, ever. He refused to vacuum or take out the trash. He continuously does stuff he knows makes me uncomfortable, because I told him. And, worst of all, he kicks me out of our room and locks the door on me because he wants privacy. (There is a policy in our school that you go to the infirmary if you need privacy for some reason. Also you aren't supposed to be in your room with the door locked, so he's breaking all the rules). So, the obvious solution is to politely ask him to stop and refuse his demands that I leave the room whenever he wants me to, right? Wrong. Whenever I ask him (Keep in mind I try my absolute hardest to be kind and say please and thank you, no matter what and all that shit.) to stop or put on headphones or go somewhere else if he wants privacy, he flips on me. There are three things he always does: 1. He talks about how is life is so much worse than everyone else's, so we should all grovel to him and do exactly as he says, guilt tripping basically. 2. He will start insulting the shit out of me, swear words and all. 3 He will flip me off and do the exact opposite of what I asked (Turn the volume up or go harder with his sexual joke). He also recently has been going on about how I have no manners and never ask politely or say please and thank you. (It's the other way around, if he wants me to do something he will yell and whine until I do. I always say please and remain as polite as I can, I work with kids over the summer, what can I say?) I'm at my rope's end with this guy and something needs to change, or I might do something I regret. If anyone knows what I can do, please tell me, I really need the help.",22Feb2019,3
55,"I'm a university student who has always struggled with writing,  especially with papers that are supposed to form an argument.  The trouble is that when I sit down and try to figure out an objective position on a given topic,  my mind sees the other point of view,  and then the topic becomes more complex.  

For example,  I've been assigned a paper about ""communicating across political differences"".  I'm supposed to form a theory about how best to go about this,  but the moment that I think that I've come up with a good thesis,  such as ""Compassion for other humans should be the focus of communicating across political differences"",  I begin to doubt whether this is true.  Maybe polarization is what keeps a country stable?  It seems like the countries with the most cohesion tend to go off the deep end,  i.e. nazi germany.  For every in-group,  there is an out-group.  So in this way,  the argument gets a bit deeper.  Eventually I'm just thinking about the meaning of everything and trying to find a way to tie that to the paper.

I'm stuck between trying to be honest with my views and creating an absolute mess of a paper,  or trying to bullshit and write something that I don't believe.  Does anyone else have the same issue?  How did you overcome this?",22Feb2019,1
56,"Instead of having a huge quinceañera, I chose a pretty gold ring with five marquise sapphires and little diamonds. I've had it for almost 4 years now and I wear it everywhere, all the time. But-
I went swimming in the first time in over a year at my student life center at the University of Utah. All the lockers are locked up, so I put my duffle bag on a bench and call it good. At 11am, right before I get in the water I think ""Oh, I better put my ring in my wallet so I don't lose it when I swim"" I put it in my wallet and hit the pool for a good 45 minutes. At 11:50ish, I go to the locker room,  get dressed, and get to the train station. Once I'm finally on the train I remember my ring and I grab my wallet to put it on. 
I open it and it's not there. 
I don't panic, if it's not there, it's probably just in my duffle bag. So when I get home I empty out my bag. No ring. I empty out my wallet completely. No ring. I clear out and inspect everything in there. No ring. 
At this point I'm getting really anxious. I call the student life center and ask them if anyone turned in a gold ring with 5 sapphires. They say no, but they'll check the locker room. Still no ring. At this point I'm super nervous. They tell me  can come back and look myself, so I drive to campus (which I never ever do) and look myself. I excpect to see it in the corner I was in, but there's nothing. I check the deck where I was just it case it got caught on my towel. There's a girl's bag in the way, and she moves it and helps look with me. She was super sweet and tells me about all the rings she's lost before. At this point I'm crying pretty good. So I get over to the lost and found desk, practically sobbing, asking if there's anything else they can do. I file a report with my information and leave. I check the ground from there to the train station twice. I get to my car and pretty much lose it. I compile myself enough to call UTA and ask if I left the ring on the train. They say if it has it probably won't get turned in until 10 tomorrow morning. I'm physically sick now. I cry some more and drive myself home. I clear my duffle bag again. So finally, I get ready to take a shower and I'm so desperate to find my ring I'm hoping it maybe got caught in my hair and wrapped up in my bun. Of course that wasn't the case. I cry in the tub for another half hour. I barely compose myself enough to get to my evening seminar, but not before I check the locker room again. Nothing still. Instead of checking again for a third time, I'm writing here because I don't know what else to do. I'm hoping someone didn't steal it (it's not like I had any cash in my wallet either) but anything happens on a college campus. I just want to know I did everything to find it before giving up for good. 
God I'm crying as I write this because I love that dumb little ring so much. ",22Feb2019,1

So i just visited a local cat cafe and felt in love with the most calm and chillest cat there. His name is Toby. I noticed other cats that were there did seem to care about my presence, but Toby was different. Within the first 10 mins I approached him first to see if he wanted to be pet. But he didn't seem interested. I walked away to see the other cats there. So when i approach him again 10 minutes later, he surprisingly sniffed my hand and rubbed his face on it and let me pet him.  I walked away again after a few moments to give him some space. I noticed that he was walking around me and the room and finally plopped on this coffee table that I was standing by. And He let me pet him again. I then went to sit down at this chair was adjacent to  that coffee table where he was sitting at. There was this cat looking-post next to the chair I was sitting at, then a few moments later he gets up and walks across the coffee table towards me and the post and jumps on it and lays there. I started to pet him again and he looked so comfortable then he did when i first approached him.

I feel as if I am going through a serious quarter life crises right now. Just graduated college in May and immediately entered into a public service program known as AmeriCorps. Honestly, I am finding it very difficult to be satisfied working in an office environment. Everyday is a struggle to maintain a positive attitude. Furthermore, I often feel depressed for my current status and position. Don’t get me wrong; working at a non profit is a very fulfilling experience; but I, for lack of a better word, “long” for greater things for myself. I read and study constantly about memorable and virtuous people such as Gandhi, MLK, and other notable ideologies, and aspire to be as incredible as them. I want to do more for my community and the world around, but I do not even know where to start. Every time I try to temper these expectations of myself, they nag at me even more. Am I setting lofty expectations for myself, or, on the other hand, is it all right to dream big? 

So, how do I formulate realistic goals and dreams for myself, without feeling like I’m losing a valuable piece of myself? Will office life always be this miserable?

70,"Please bare with me. I know what I want to say in my head, but when it comes to actually writing it down it's always a bit awkward and disjointed. Sorry for rambling too.

Basically, I'm 17, male and gay. Most of my female friends know, but hardly anyone else. I had never thought about relationships until last year when I had an 'encounter' with one of my friends at the time. It went just about as bad as it could do and is now just an awkward memory (we're still friends though, somehow).

Anyway, one of my other friends, let's call him Mortimer (idk why), is in my opinion, very attractive. I didn't always think that he was, but after a bit of rebounding and time I started to develop feelings for him. Mortimer is a bit of a lad, but he's also quite gentle and sensitive (??). Since Mortimer is laddy, he tends to be a bit flirty with me in a jokey way. I've never seen him act like it with other people that much, but I reciprocate the flirtiness a lot more than everyone else, and this backwards and forwards 'flanter' has somehow ended up in me leading myself on.

It gets to the point where I'll be nervous to open a message on Snapchat, and might even wait a minute to open it so it doesn't look like I'm desperate (I am a bit though). Now, to my knowledge Mortimer is straight, but he's never had a girlfriend and the flirting makes me think otherwise. It's like my brain is just in two completely separate parts. 1 half (the realistic one) is saying ""He's straight, you're going to be alone forever, suck it up"", and the other half is telling me that i have a chance.

It's got to a point where I'm starting to get really frustrated at myself because I always end up being sad when I think about it realistically. I still want to be friends with Mortimer because he is genuinely a nice person, but I don't know how to get over my feelings for him.

Also, bit of a double whammy, how would I even go about finding people who could potentially like me back? I feel like there aren't any other gay people at my school and that I'll just be alone forever :)

82,"Okay, this is a pretty light-hearted post, but I needed some help deciding what to do here.

To preface, I'm a beginning art teacher trying to prepare for my career.  As you probably know, art teachers (as well as other teachers) often carry lots of miscellaneous things to the classroom and back.

My laptop is something I'd always like to keep with me, but obviously keep safe amongst the paint and charcoal and whatnot.

I have two options here.  I have a backpack I got for Christmas that I love.  It's sort of grungy and artsy and it has all of my pins on it and I love it to bits, but it doesn't look very professional and it doesn't have a laptop sleeve so I'd need to purchase one  which is fine.  I can't decide if I'm super concerned about looking super professional considering I'm going to be teaching art so things will often seem messy anyway.  That's the first option.

My second option is buying a nice faux leather tote with a laptop sleeve inside where I can place my laptop amongst other teacher things like my planner and pens and whatever.  It looks professional, which is nice.  The only thing really is it's not very... Me, you know?  Like it represents what I want to be, I guess, which is a nice, organized, professional teacher...

But reality is, I'm pretty messy and I like to wing things and explore.  I mean I guess whose to say I can't use the tote to carry important things and my backpack for art supplies maybe since it is grunge and spacious.  I'm not sure.

It all started a week ago when she stopped answering my messages. I didnt think much about it because I just thought she was busy. She ignored all my messages for 3 more days until I asked ""What's wrong, did I do something wrong?"" because I saw here playing with other people. 

Finally I got an answer from her which almost broke my heart. ""Our friendship right now is too oppressive for me. I need a break and I don't know how long. I was thinking about this for several weeks now."" It just came so suddenly. She didnt act like something was wrong the whole time and she didn't talk to me earlier about it until it was too late.   
I think we could have worked out something but a break is too much for me. 

I don't know how long this break will last and I don't know whats gonna happen after the break. I don't thing its gonna be the same. I just don't want to lose her and I don't know what to do.

88,"I'm confused as to what this guy's 'deal' is.

He was in the same class as me and I found him on Tinder - we matched as I tend to swipe right out of politeness for people I know, his profile claimed he was looking for friends (yes I'm aware that's often bs but just putting it out there, and some people like myself do also hope to find friends as well as dates from Tinder). I know he's in an open relationship and does do hookups.

We added each other on Facebook as it's easier, contact has been erratic which is fine with me as generally I'm unsure what he wants/expects. He'd hoped we'd get to know each other outside class, there's some smoke-blowing with him saying he respects me and felt drawn to me in class. 

The guy has BPD and is a bit erratic right now. 

In his recent messages it ended with him asking 'would you like to get to know me better?' 

I'm not sure what he means by this, if he means friendship then great, if he means sex I'm not totally opposed...but I have to at least know a person before going there, I'm not down for someone just asking me over to fuck. I'm kinda worried he means the latter but as I don't know him I don't want to ask, I just said maybe.

I'm feeling REALLY cautious about this guy, I'm only continuing talking as I've no friends locally. Last thing I want is to agree to go for coffee or drinks just to realise he expects me to go home with him afterwards, you know?

89,"I don't really know how to explain this, but I'll put it simply: last Tuesday a fire occurred in my community, 7 children died. 2 of these children attended my school, and although I never properly spoke to either one of my friends had previously dated one and I knew there names, faces and basic stuff about them. I feel nothing. No remorse, no sadness, nothing.  


that isn't the part that makes me concerned though, what makes me concerned is the event as a whole. 7 children are dead, any normal person would at least feel a shed of sympathy regardless if they knew them, right? why don't I? Is there something wrong with me? Honestly I don't want to talk about this to my friends as the five I currently have I'm either jot 100% comfortable with, hate their guts or they're mourning the loss and would hate me more then they probably do for say something like that.

Towards the end of a long drive I asked my mother to drive me to a GameStop because there was a game I had been wanting. She got upset because of how long the drive to the GameStop would be and was upset I asked and took it out on me. She told me that she hated me sometimes and that I should get a learners permit if I wanted to go somewhere. She told me that I could kill myself and it caused me to have a panic attack. I’ve been in a very bad place with my depression and I can’t get in a car without imagining myself jerking the wheel. I have attempted suicide in the past and she believes it has all been for attention. I had to fight very hard to not pull the wheel after she said all of that. I cried and she got upset with me for crying. Because of this incident and my mental state I stayed with a friend and missed three days of school.

98,"So for a little background, I'm a 20 year old college student (male) and just lost my virginity back in december. I haven't had sex since then and I feel like a born-again virgin, although this time the sadness is due to a loss I am feeling. The loss is associated with being this abnormal college student who has never been in a relationship or even had sex, normally, once (I didn't even cum when I lost my virginity, it was awkward). Despite my efforts to date through tinder and various means, I've gotten rejected almost every single time or I've had to deal with girls who seem disinterested. I'll now give a rundown on some of these experiences.

This past summer I went on 2 dates with a girl who lived in a town 45 min away from me. We couldn't really meet in between because we were out in the middle of no where. She basically ghosted me and we didn't do anything the rest of the summer (she talked about coming to my town for a 3rd date but that never happened), she never really took iniative to message me about coming over or doing anything so I assumed she wasnt interested. Things turned pretty sour when I bluntly asked her at the end if she wanted to hookup (desperate to lose virginity at the time). She claimed I ghosted her and that we could have been something.

Somewhat shortly into the fall semester I went on a date with a girl I met at a party. Conversation was good, no physical contact, but I felt like we both had a good enough time to want to go out again. Turns out she didn't see it going anywhere (I still don't understand how she could have thought this after 1 date).

The girl I lost my virginity to was by a one night stand (actually she came over, we had sex, and she left) after a party. I can understand if she didn't want to continue contact after that but she completely ghosted me without feeling any sympathy for having destroyed shit at my apartment.

Not even 2 weeks ago, I get back on tinder and setup a date with a freshman. Initial date was supposed to be getting doughnuts, but she ended up getting food with me late at night a couple days beforehand. We ended up hanging for several hours, she cuddled up next to me and I made my move but she didn't want to do anything because of her period. I drive her home and we plan on still getting doughnuts after the weekend. We get doughnuts but it's a relatively short date as she wanted to go see some guy talk on campus. She was wishy washy about when we could go out again. We snapped all week and made plans to go out again that weekend until she snapped me the day after and told me she didn't see it going anywhere and didn't even want to be friends. It sounds like she met and started talking to another guy.

Now I just have several girls that have setup dates only for them to forget or bs their way out of them as they seem to be disinterested. This is really starting to annoy me and I don't know what's wrong with me. The only thing I can think of is that I have better game over the internet in real life. In other words, girls find out I'm a physics nerd with nothing interesting about me and get completely turned off. 

If anyone has gone through a similar situation, I'd love some feedback.",22Feb2019,1

Within two weeks of my friends passing, my grades slipped to C's and D's, and my family got me a therapist, who I talked to and felt better. My grades never did pick up again, and I'm only now starting to pick them up, nearly two and a half years later. That's beside the point though. Since then, people noticed that my maturity slowed down, It's been tough, but seeing as I'm now 15, and turn 16 in a few months, I was wondering if there is a depression, that causes me to slow my mental maturity.

100,"So I’m just going to get right to the point here. Lately I’ve been getting sad a lot, to the point where I cry at night. Sometimes for no reason at all too. I just do. I sometimes think that nothing will get better and I should just kill myself. For some context I had some friendship problems like them never inviting me to hang out anymore or even ignoring me completely. Plus added to that I’ve been having a thing with this girl and it’s like not good nor bad. 

My main way of kind of reliving myself from my thoughts and such is either video games or my friends. And I’m not a fat slob either, I play a handful of sports and workout but I kinda lost the mood to do those things since I started getting sad. So I’ve been turning to video games to just close out my life and try to do something. 

My parents are very wonderful people. They help me with stuff and things like that. Stuff a normal parent would do, but my parents do hate the fact that I spend so much time on my computer or just on “technology.” They always try to find a way to blame something on my computer or phone If something happens. For example once I tripped on my way up my stairs and they said because of my computer I got light headed and I wasn’t thinking strait, so I fell and hit my leg. 

I want to tell my school councillor but I’m afraid my parents will take the one of the only things that is helping me close out my sadness. My “technology”. If they do I think that not only I’ll have a hard time healing and not being able to entertain myself or be a normal kid with his technology to go on Instagram and such will be just the absolute worse and will make me more sad. I hate calling it depression because I don’t think I am.

I don’t know what to do anymore. So far I’m just holding this in...

I have been told my a lot of people that I look good, and that I’m not ugly or anything, but I feel the [opposite](https://imgur.com/a/zjHEXBb) 

So anyway, with my ugly ass self, I went and got into a Biology class with this girl that looked right around my age. I thought she was really cute, and lucky enough I got sat next to her. I just scooched into my corner of the table. (One of those black science tables in chem classes and shit.)

He is always in this state of irritation, and often yells at the rest of our family which has caused it’s fair share of fights between my parents.

He says that he has to come home from work everyday, work even more, and then wake up early to get us ready for school. He kept asking my brother and I if we were ok after he stopped crying, saying that the crying just helped with his emotions.

105,"So me and a best friend of 14 years both went to seek therapy after getting into a huge fight that caused us to stop talking.

Some backstory before I begin talking about the therapy:

My friend got angry because I wasn't able to give emotional support when she needed it - but I knew I wasn't in a spot to help. So I said I couldn't help, and that I need time away from the person. (I was upset at the person, but I realized that I shouldn't be. So pretty much I caught my codependency and decided not to act on it. The friend wasn't there to help me when I needed it, but I realized I shouldn't hold this expectation since they were busy) This person got extremely angry and said that I was abandoning them, that I was the only person that they could count on UNTIL NOW, which I responded ""You're still my best friend, and I'll come back. But I need to get over these feelings."" Fast forward a month where I came back, the person was still angry. I tried talking with her, but she was still so angry and tried getting into a fight with me. My emotional response was to step back again and things escalated when she said ""You were my best friend up to now"" where I got emotionally triggered and things went downhill and I ended up blocking her.

Going into therapy, I wanted to let go of this best friend and looked for a nod from my therapist - but my therapist pretty much said something along the lines of, ""Why don't you tell them everything you're telling me?""

So I decided to try one more time to reach out to my friend, apologize, try to understand her, etc.

AND HERE COMES THE DILEMMA.

We ended up talking, but I find out that her therapist said that she was codependent (which I understand and agree) BUT THEN MY FRIEND STARTS HURTING ME AND SAYING STUFF LIKE ""you gave me the delusion of progress"". WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? I would be there for her when she was going through a breakdown or anxiety attack. I was there for her for all the bad things in her life when no one else was. Mind you, this wasn't often. Maybe once or twice a month. Then she continued by saying if she reached out to me, it would fuel the ""codependency and delusions"" and it's so hurtful to think that she thinks this way of our friendship now. All I did was try to be there for a friend, like anyone else would've. Is it really that bad to be there for someone? To care? To listen? To provide suggestions? When my friend ranted at me, I would try to soothe her and then say something like ""Why don't you talk it out with the other person when you're better? They deserve to know this too"" But she was just shaming and saying how she doesn't rant anymore, that I fueled her codependency and pretty much that she moved on and doesn't need me. But now she's stuck on her bf and her bf's friends.

Please, I need thoughts, suggestions on what to do with this person. With myself.

I really loved them as a friend but I can't believe what a huge twist this friendship has become after a few therapy sessions. Do I give up, move on? What do I do?

I am juggling 18 hours, 2 research projects, and paying for life expenses all while trying get through this class. I am sick of grades and ready to just start a career already.

And my scholarship is only for four years, so if I fail, that's it. I currently cannot afford any more classes as things are right now. I've spent so much time with no money coming in doing things that I hate, struggling to balance my mental health all so I can get a degree in a field that I don't even think I want to work in anymore. The best thing I have gotten from my physics degree is programming knowledge.

I mostly wrote this because I need to vent, but I also need advice. Does anybody have any unique solutions or any past experience with this? Should I even bother for applying to good jobs?

Please don’t tell me, “Just finish strong” or anything like that. I plan on finishing, but I cannot retake the class until next Spring. What are my options in the mean time?

117,"I’m a sophomore in high school going to a preppy private school on financial aid. I don’t like being around these kids, they’re snobby and generally look with disdain upon kids like me - not rich. I’ve made one or two close friends but even them, we haven’t hung out outside of school in 1.5+ years that we’ve known each other. Generally, I want to leave.

I started looking at options and came across an early college program. I’d get my AA while doing my junior and senior high school years. I pitched it to the parents and they think it’s a good opportunity so I applied, took the test (did really well), and waited. I just heard I got placed on the waiting list for my location (ridiculously far down, not getting in, it’s a randomized lottery system). They said that if I wanted to, they have a spot saved for me at the other location. The catch? The other location is an hour away. It’d be an hour there + back every day but Friday and weekends.

I have a job and a car, albeit not a reliable car but I’m getting a new one soon, so no worries there. I can pay for the gas and I can get there. I am skeptical though. On one hand, I really want to leave and harness this opportunity, but on the other, I’m worried if it’s going to be too much for me. I really think that I should do it, though, as it’s all free and it shaved two years off of my college.

Has anyone here ever found themselves in a similar situation? Do you think I should pursue it and accept it? If so, how should I convince my parents? ",22Feb2019,2

126,"It’s the end of the day that I’m writing this, and at this point I’m kind of weirded out by my roommate. I (19M) live in a house of four guys. One of those guys (35M) commented on my muscular arms and said how he needs to start working out again. We were talking for another minute and he asked if I “had any toys” in my room which sounded weird considering we were talking about working out. 
“Like massage toys?” I said. 
“Yeah” he said
I said all I use is a foam roller

Then later on he started talking to me about how he was relaxing all day yesterday and jacking off. Also commented that someone walked in on him while he was jacking. 
He then asked “has anyone ever walked in on you jacking off?”
Am I the only one who thinks this is an inappropriate question?

About an hour ago he came into my room and apologized for talking like that, and asked if anyone has ever asked me a question like that before. Then he randomly asks if he can trust me. “With what?” I said.  “oh just in general” he said. 

Should I be worried about this type of dialog or am I just being paranoid?",22Feb2019,6

128,"So, to preface this I’m in my junior year of high school and aren’t really an anxious or stressed person ( at least I think so). Sometimes, when I have to get up and go to school/events I feel really cold and uncomfortable. I feel like my movements are stiff. I honestly have no idea how to describe this and I can’t find anything online about it, but I’ve figured out basically I get it every day when I go to school and some other days with events that might be stressful? 

What’s really weird is when I hang out with friends/are relaxed playing sports/video games/ I get a really warm feeling and feel so much more comfortable. I can’t help but think how much better my life would be if I had this feeling everyday. Sometimes I just feel really cold and it’s so weird. I don’t feel comfortable in my body every day when I go to school because of the cold/weird feeling. I’m not bullied, aren’t stressed about grades, and even on relaxing school days I still get the feelings. I just want that warm feeling of tranquility all the time. 

Is this a normal feeling for people to have? Could this be caused by things that aren’t mental? I just want to know if anyone else had a problem like this and if they could help. ",22Feb2019,1
129,"My roommate and I were on our way to a grab food before her 6am train, and we were stopped on the street by a middle aged man who appeared a bit frantic. He explained that he locked himself out of his car, and he needed money for a taxi because he was on his way to pick up his kids at the hospital. He was persistent about giving us his mother’s number and his silver bracelet so that we would trust him. He even asked us to call his mother’s number, and a woman picked up, confirming that he has two kids and that he can e-transfer our money back later. I'm very uncomfortable when talking to strangers, so I let my roommate do all the talking, but she wasn’t sure how to talk our way out of it. The man seemed desperate, and we wanted to be kind, so we handed over $85 for his cab. The smart thing to do would’ve been to ask him for his full name/ID, ask him to show us his car, and see him call a taxi, but my roommate was in a rush to catch her train, so we decided to hope for the best and go on our way. My roommate later called the number, and the woman said to call back later. So she did, and she believes that a different woman picked up this time, as the woman did not know what she was talking about and possibly sounded different. My roommate then texted the number, but someone responded “who’s this” and then left her on read. Neither of us are able to reach the number anymore, as it goes straight through to a full inbox (I think it may be a burner number, but idk). Is this something that we should speak to a police station about? Or do we just let it go? My roommate’s been beating herself up about this, and I want our money back.

134,"First, please forgive me if text/formatting is messed up. First time poster, and haven’t really done much Reddit-ing before. 

When I was 12-ish my step dad sexually abused me multiple times. My brother did too, and I think that happened before dad (brother was a minor at the time too.) They didn’t know about each other. 

I didn’t remember about my brother until later on in life... about 5-ish years ago. I was always consumed by the hurt and pain of my dad (step dad) doing it to me. My mom found out, dad confessed. It still happened a couple of times. It stopped. They’re still together. 

Last year I got drunk about at a family event and blurted out that my brother did it too. Needless to say, I ruined the night but we all agreed to talk afterward. They told me I “couldn’t do it in segments.” So if I needed to talk and get it all out there I needed to do it then. No more going back to it. 

I know I’ll probably get shit for this, but I forgave my dad. He’s proven that he is completely remorseful and continues to prove it all of the time. I still don’t feel completely comfortable around him, but I forgave him. My mom on the other hand, I can’t forgive. She failed to protect me and that’s what I hold on to. 

I had a child when I was young and had to move back home after child’s dad and I split up. I no longer live there and I very rarely visit. 

I suffer waves of depression from the abuse. I used try to go to therapy/counseling for it, but once I had my child and they were threatened to be taken away from me, I got scared, I panicked and stopped going. I told the police (they got involved after the therapist called them) I did not want to talk about any of this and close any investigation. I don’t know how that happened, but that’s how I remember it. 

The advice I’m looking for is how do I go about getting help for myself without causing commotion for everyone else. I just want help. For me. I just want to talk about this and help figure out a lot of my sadness. 

Please be nice. 

I know it seems scattered. Let me know if I need to clarify. ",22Feb2019,1
135,"My sister and I were having a conversation about our generalized anxiety and I said “I wonder why we both have anxiety - I wonder why it started.” We began to talk about how our dad was emotionally inexpressive and only paid attention to us or gave us praise when we accomplished something. My dad and I aren’t close, never have been. The conversation carried on and she told me she has something she wants to tell me about our dad but never knew the right time to tell me.

She told me he used to spy on her in the shower, used to sneak in her room when he thought she was asleep and look up her shirt with a flashlight. That was all she could remember. She told me that after she told my mom once when she was younger and that my mom didn’t believe her. It was not brought up again until she was out of the house and off at college (around 2006). She called my mom drunk and brought it up. Then her, my mom and dad had a sit-down conversation about what happened - I guess I was at a friend’s house. He apologized to her and I guess it was never spoken about again. Never brought up. Only my mom and now me knows. My mom doesn’t know that I know now.

I have always felt bad and uncomfortable about my body whenever my dad is around. I have a distinct memory of being about 6 and being extremely uncomfortable about my dad seeing me in a swimsuit. I remember feeling I was afraid he was going to look at my body in a gross way. I still feel this way around him in regular clothes. I always wear lots of layers around him and feel uncomfortable showing skin, I’m scared he might be looking at me in a weird way, but I’ve never questioned why.

Now I’m starting to think even though I can’t recall, I may have been a victim of my dad as well. I don’t know why else I would feel this way when I’m around him and why I don’t feel that way around anyone else. My sister said that when I was little she asked me if dad had touched me at all and I said no. I don’t remember this conversation, but I still don’t have any memories of him touching me. What I found weird is that when she told me she had something to tell me about dad, I immediately had the idea that he must have molested her when she was little and I have no idea why that was the first and only thought to my mind. I’ve never thought of my dad like that before.

My head is a little chaotic right now trying to digest all of this and I’m not sure if I can/should tell my boyfriend or friends. I don’t know if I can share that info about my sister because I don’t think she would want others knowing and I know that once I tell my boyfriend things will never be the same between him and my dad again. I feel awful for my sister, but it’s also hard not to vent about it to the people closest to me that I share everything with. It’s a life-altering thing and not talking to my boyfriend or friends about it is stressing me out. Plus, I feel weird and am going to start acting weird I’m sure.

Should/can I tell others what is going on with me? How do I cope with this when I feel like him molesting me made sense, but I don’t have any memories of it actually happening? How do I support my sister?

137,"I’ve (20’sF) been dating my boyfriend (20’sM) for almost two years. For additional background some of his friends were actually both our friends to begin with when we all met for the first time and hung out. This was before boyfriend and I started dating. For more information, boyfriend and I started dating shortly after he broke up with his previous, somewhat longterm, long distance girlfriend. We didn’t mean to start dating so soon, it just happened naturally and I wouldn’t change a thing. 

However this is when we both started having issues with the friend group. Our flirting made them uncomfortable (we hadn’t officially stated we were dating yet but it was known that he wasn’t dating his ex). Our flirting consisted of sending cute messages to each other and being giggly with each other, which sometimes happened around this group of friends. Now looking back, I know that they were most likely uncomfortable because it was so soon after boyfriend had left a relationship. However, it doesn’t stop me from still getting a bit annoyed because we found out they were talking about us behind our back and never told us straight up that we were making them uncomfortable. 

Fast forward to us telling them “hey just tell us you’re uncomfortable with a flirting in front of you since that’s not what we intended.” It was since then that I lost a lot of trust in them and found them to be rather childish. This is also was when I didn’t want people like that to be close friends with me so I stopped contributing to conversations. However, my boyfriend was really close to them and forgave them. So this is when this friend group became boyfriend’s friend group, not so much mine. Just to be clear I’m fine with this and I try to treat them with all the kindness I have (that’s how I was raised and I’m holding to it!) 

So this is getting long so I’ll jump further. Over time, I felt that this friend group kept closing me out and acting like I was boyfriend’s attachment rather than even a person, let alone someone they knew. There was also some passive aggressive behavior from a few of the members directed toward me, which came off as either 1. They thought I had an affair with boyfriend and made him break up with his ex or 2. They were jealous and actually wanted to be with my boyfriend. It’s gotten better since I’ve told boyfriend how I’ve felt, but it doesn’t change that after everything, I feel like I’m either ignored, that I’m forced into the group because I’m dating boyfriend, or that they straight up hate me. 

I can honestly tell you that I believe I’ve never intentionally tried to hurt their feelings but I feel battered and exhausted when dealing with them. I’d love some advice as to help with my mental state on this, or try to change my perspective, or just any advice. I hate feeling so insecure and feeling that I don’t matter as a person in this group. Please help me change that! 


tl;dr 
Boyfriend’s friends were my friends, but now aren’t since they betrayed my trust. Now they act like I don’t exist or hate me. 

Note: I know a lot of this is in my head so it’s just a vicious circle sometimes!! I don’t want to be in it anymore! ",22Feb2019,1

141,"Hi friends. I’m in need of some serious advice. I’m struggling immensely with a really close friend of mine, who has been one of my best friends for about 13 years. 

A little bit of background about both of us- I suffer from PTSD, and she’s had her fair share of intense trauma... She and I have remained friends for a majority of that time, except for the intense moments where I’ve pushed her away due to my illness. At the end of the day, we’ve always been friends.

Things have gotten worse in the last two years; when I began taking on a new role. I’ve been trying really hard to support her in her times of trauma and grief, and have recommended she seek counseling. I recently joined a counseling group to get more help for myself, and have been trying to reinforce positivity in my life in my own recovery process.

She’s become increasingly suicidal in the past year, but it’s gotten much worse in the past six months to the point of where she vents to me every day about wanting to die- and if I try to offer advice, she shuts me down, and tells me things like “well, it’d be better if I was dead anyway, you’d be much better off,” and things similar to that. I want to talk to her about it, but I know her well- and I know she’ll respond really badly if I do. I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells and feel so drained because I love and care about her, but she’s hurting me. 

I’m trying so hard to get her into therapy, but I’m exhausted. I feel like every time I try to get her help it just blows up in my face, and I’m scared to even approach the situation. I’ve even tried asking her boyfriend for help, who is doing the best he can to get her into therapy, but she’s really adamant about not going (she’s nervous, understandably, but continues taking it out on us.) 

I’m curious if I’m being manipulated, or if I’m being a bad friend for being mentally exhausted.

TLDR; I have become my best friends therapist because she refuses to seek help. She constantly sends me really self deprecating messages and won’t listen to me when I try to talk to her about how I feel. Has this friendship become toxic? ",22Feb2019,1

I’m thinking she might like me or something and thought it was weird the one girl came up and asked that since it’s not usually a normal thing to ask someone.

Yet, I realized that a lot of my time has been focused on studying and getting a job that I haven't really developed too many other hobbies.

She’s a very nosy person and she means well but recently she’s been teasing me more. I kind of ignore it but sometimes it really hurts me deep down I just choose not to say anything (I tell her my project idea and she laughs and says she cringes just hearing me talk about it, calls me weird, told me I’m stupid, etc.) 

She’s extremely arrogant and thinks her work is the best and mine is terrible (even though honestly hers is the worst out of everyone but I choose not to say anything to be polite). Anyway a few days ago I got her to help me out with one of my projects (because we’re friends) if I helped her with hers. In the one hour I met with her she belittled me for not knowing all the info, called my idea cringy, and refused to do anything unless I did it her way. As a result, my project is mediocre (because her ideas are honestly bad and I needed the help) and I couldn’t redo it because it was the only time I could do it and I counted on her helping me. 

While she was watching me trying to do everything she asked if I wanted to get dinner after and I said no. She asked why and I just said I don’t feel like it and she called me an asshole multiple times even though I’ve never said anything bad to her ever and she bullies
me nonstop. Once I finished the project she kept asking if we were done yet and then left. 

On top of this the week before I helped her with one of her projects and spent almost 3 hours actually trying to help her stupid idea while if I asked her simple questions that I actually wanted to know she got mad at me.

my behavior is justified considering I’ve never said anything rude to her the entire time I’ve known her and she bullies me. I’m thinking of cutting her out of my life completely but I feel like she also doesn’t know how rude and arrogant she is. What should I do?

148,"I’m very close to turning 16 this year and I want to lose weight (again). I’ve always been a fat girl. I’m 5’4” and my highest was 180lbs. I’ve tried everything to lose weight. My metabolism sucks and my parents refuse to let me diet. We have no healthy food in the house and I can only eat what my parents buy or make, which is unhealthy. To lose weight before, I purged for a few months and always would starve myself or eat a small thing once a day. When I lost weight after purging I went down to 160lbs. A few months later I started working out everyday for 3 hours doing several different workout plans for 3 months and would eat very little then too. I went from 160lbs to my lowest 138lbs. I was almost 15 at this point. I started talking to this guy who was 20 at the time and long story short, he ended up raping me. It was 3 days before my fifteenth and he manipulated me. I lost my virginity right then. I went to the hospital to get a rape kit done and on the sheet I was still 138lbs. One week later, it was my third appointment due to my rape and true police. They checked my weight and I gained 9lbs. I was now 146lbs. I ended up depressed even more and before I knew it, by July I was 160lbs. I’ve always been hungry since then and now I’m 180lbs again. My weight has always killed me. Can someone help me come up with a plan to lose weight again? I would like to lose 45 lbs so I can be 135lbs. Any advice would be appreciated",22Feb2019,0
149,"This is my first time every doing something like this, and it touches on kinda hard stuff to talk about so sorry in advance if it appears kind of stilted or very blunt.

I suppose first I'll open with some background on me. I'm 24 and living in the deep south of the United States, in a very rural area (dirt roads and singlewide trailer parks style rural being common surroundings). Between the ages of 9-18 here I was living in an extremely abusive household. I don't really want to go into details on the stuff that happened but in a lot of ways it was sort of the starting point of the failure cascade that has led to my current situation. I have mostly recovered and put myself back together mentally by this point, fortunately. Because of the things that happened and my mental state back then, I essentially had dropped out of high school, but I have got my GED since then. I have not held a job yet, so no employment history. I currently have roughly 10k in savings which were originally earmarked for college when I was younger and have been untouched. I have a family member in another state who I'm somewhat close to and who I think would help in an emergency situation. I'm extremely well read on many things (I suppose I inherited this from my dad) and like to think that I'm somewhat intelligent. For the past few months I've tenatively been poking at and learning via free online classes and the like to code (maybe javascript eventually?) as a sort of test of a possible future career thing.

So, now for the complications.

I'm LGBT, specifically trans MtF and living in the deep south. I'm early yet into my transition, but this is probably going to make getting a job in my local (rural) area not a realistic prospect. This is the type of town where I routinely hear people talk about how ""disgusting the queers are"" and spew racial vitrol and the like. Generally speaking, one of my major goals in general is to get the hell out of the state I'm currently living in (Florida). Another problem tying into this is, well, I genuinely have no idea how the (non abusive) parent I'm currently staying with would react to it. She is not from the south but from some poking on this sort of thing in general she seems to have some weird and possibly very wrong opinions on LGBT stuff. I can't be sure that she would not react negatively to finding out that I'm trans. It's also a ticking time bomb of a sort, there will eventually be a point where changes just get too obvious to be able to hide.

Essentially what I want is to get out of my current state, or at least the super rural and backwards part I'm currently in and get a job or pursue a higher education. Stuff has come up in the past when I've tried to start moving (literally and figuratively) to just get in a better situation in life but honestly at this point I'm desperate and tired of this enough that I don't give a damn what pressing family situation or the like comes up again, I'm getting out or dying trying. 

If anyone has any advice that could help with this, on what I could do to better my situation, anything would be appreciated. I honestly feel at a loss on what to do.

150,"Last spring I put in an order for a very expensive custom guitar amplifier, for which the builder required a full payment upfront. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I did it as it'd been an object of my desire for a very long time. A 2-3 month wait was quoted and met, but by the end of the wait a very unfortunate event occurred in my personal life which required me to go to Europe for a couple months. I asked the builder that he hold off shipping the amp until I returned and settled back in. There was maybe a 1-2 week window during which I could of received it after it was done, but the situation was very grim and I couldn't care less to deal with something so trivial at that point- not to mention I didn't want to risk having the package held up in customs... and if that took more than two weeks, the package would of been returned- or worse, stolen off my patio. I made him aware of my situation and he was very sympathetic as he was going through something similar. 

Anyways, here's the thing... around the time I left for Europe I noticed an amp made to my amps exact specifications started popping up on his social media posts being demoed by other guitarists, but what's worse is I also noticed it appear on a well known guitar show, where they had it on loan for a couple months... as well as on another guitar show where it was reviewed. I've no way to know for 100% certain that this was my amp, but these are extremely rare amps, especially built to this particular specification, making the chances that the amps in all these appearances weren't mine extremely slim... We've been chatting since I got back in December and I'm hoping to finally have the amp shipped to me in the next week or two, but I'm feeling extremely bittersweet about the whole thing now and wanting to ask that a new one is made... These are \*very\* expensive guitar amps and having paid such a high price I think it's only fair that I get the chance to be the one to burn it in, not a multitude of random players. Having it on loan to someone as a demo unit it could of incurred any number of problems and now that idea of not knowing really bugs me. I did ask in one of my first emails since getting back if it'd been boxed up since it was finished since I hated the idea of it being played/burned in by someone other than me and I didn't get a reply to that particular question... 

The builder has been very kind and compassionate and helpful, especially seeing as he is willing to declare the value low so that I don't get hit with a high duties bill during this difficult time and I appreciate all that, but it feels like I'm now receiving a used item at the full premium retail price. What do you guys suggest I do? Am I totally wrong for feeling this way? ",22Feb2019,1
151,"I know there are probably hundreds of thousands of posts identical to mine out there, but I still need to put my case out there and if you could give it a read and give me your thoughts I would really appreciate it!

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of years back life was good for me (nowhere near perfect, not even 'great', but it was *good enough*). I had just started university and I was eager to study; Every time something related to my degree required work I would put in my full effort. Health wise, I was maintaining a good diet and truly enjoyed going to the gym on an almost daily basis. I was starting to get where I wanted to be in life physically.  Even the smaller things were good, I was up at 6am and started my day out bright and early with an hours worth of reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

As things progressed I noticed some small signs that things were getting 'out of whack'... I was less excited to go to the gym, I was feeling lazier and lazier in the mornings, I was relying on coffee to get through the day, and I had to really force myself to study.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about 6 months back and everything just fell flat. I completely stopped going to the gym, bar an odd workout every other month if I feel a burst of inspiration. My studies have fallen to rock bottom, I'm just not motivated anymore. I have 2 big exams on monday and I haven't even started preparing for them. I spent all day today on the couch watching netflix series and wasting my time. My diet is absolutely horrific, I eat two proper meals a day (sometimes only one) and half the time I just go out to a restaurant to have a meal with some friends (its now at the stage that I have either dinner or lunch outside every day instead of cooking at home).  I don't even wake up early, often I end up waking up at 12pm and then lying in until 2/3pm... 

&amp;#x200B;

Things are just going so wrong now, I applied to a lot of internships back in September and getting a string of rejection emails these past couple of weeks have really just put me down lower than rock bottom.

I feel so tired doing even the smallest things, heck I took breaks even writing this post. It's taken me 3 hours to get this far in the post...

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I try something, it doesn't work. I've made timetables to portion out my time and nope it didn't work. I tried doing things by adding in incentives to my routine and once again that didn't work.  I've tried so many things and I just keep failing at maintaining them. I've been close to making a post countless times already, but up until now I always thought that this 'phase' would just pass and I was just being stupid. Sadly, I now think that I can no longer mark this as a short period of laziness, I've become something which I hate and it makes me so frustrated that I can't change even though I hate what I am right now.

He has done extremely unethical and immoral things, throughout the course of our tenancy, but rides the line just above illegal. Has anyone ever been to an RTDRS meeting, what are they like? did it seem fair? did immoral or unethical behavior seem to have any weight? ",22Feb2019,1
154,"I've been at my job about half a year now.  I'm still in the phase of settling in and I've been having a really rough time the past couple of months.  Although I feel from my perspective that I've gotten comfortable, self-reliant and an increasingly better grasp of my position I don't feel my boss has ever felt I've caught on quickly enough.  Even a few months into the position I felt I just wasn't learning fast enough.  At my last job they expected training/competency to develop over a year or two.  But only a handful of months in I feel guilty at this position like I haven't caught on as quick as I should despite inheriting months of backlog initially since they were without someone for a few months.

&amp;#x200B;

The result is that I am terrified any time I make a mistake or so much as ask a question.  I feel my boss is frustrated with me often, and it's been weighing pretty heavily.  My organization isn't huge but I do accounts payable, receivable and HR on my own.  It's very difficult to fit this all in, in just six hours a day in addition to learning the position as I go, initially going through backlog since before I was with the company and making sure to get all of the accounting information as accurate as possible.  Now I feel I'm inclined to make more mistakes because I'm so scared and distracted by my fears when working.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss agreed to put me full-time but I feel like it's come with a, get it correct now that you have more hours ""or else"" vibe which has me completely stressed.  Its hard to function at work because I'm so on edge about any slightest mistake.  If I forget to sign a paper because I'm rushed I feel utterly horrible.  Even when I just ask a question I feel like I'm going to be looked at as though I can't do my job and the question was basic and stupid.  It's very different for me.  My last boss went to my wedding and we would send each other memes to cheer each other up throughout the day.  No such rapport exists in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have an accounting degree but I've worked in accounting, operations and banking since I was about twenty years old (aka over a decade.)  This is however, my first time working in the industry my job is in.  So there's a bit of a learning curve there.  I'm also new to the software.  Ledger codes, etc.  Despite having a ton of experience, some college and training experience --- lately I feel self-conscious that I don't have a degree.  However, I don't believe that's the point of contention.  I feel like I received minimal training and can't safely ask questions.  Some mistakes I get told to correct also, I swear I was told something different.  I don't know how to resolve poor communication in that way.  Or I'll get told here is a deadline and I'll mark it down and then later get told it's actually a different deadline.  I'm very relaxed about these kinds of things but when I make the slightest mistake on my end I feel like I get hit with a look as though I'm utterly incompetent.

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled to prioritize things and work well with what my boss wants and it's made me really start to lose confidence.  I feel like some procedures were just tossed my way without explanation and I would try to scramble to figure them out.  Questions seemed really unwelcome.  Regardless, I absolutely love my job, my co-workers and the organization I work for.  That's why this is genuinely making me sad.  I'm trying really hard to do my best.  I respect my boss.  They're very smart, and driven.  I just feel like how the training has been stacked against me isn't fair and when confusion occurs the blame gets dumped on me.  In my interview, I stated clear expectations really help me and I don't think the expectations have been very clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Today however, I just finally broke down and ended up in tears while talking to my boss and now I feel horrible and unprofessional.  I was saying how when I got back from vacation I was going to try to have a better grasp on some things that have needed correction and I felt like I was being told that if things didn't improve in 30 days I might not have a job.  I started crying and finally confessed that I felt very overworked, and I could sense frustration to the point I was beginning to wonder if I was welcome or not.  I said I really wanted a future with the company, but it was hard to come to work each day feeling like a failure and too afraid to get clarification on things or even ask questions.  I said I feel I was catching on, but every time I felt I got a good grasp on one task it seems that something else wasn't right.

  
My boss seemed taken aback and was reassuring, but I'm so scared while I'm out on vacation some issue will arise and I'll return without a job.  My dad passed away last year, and this job has been a light in my life and a focal point of energy for me to work hard.  The worst part is I am genuinely working so hard and I love this company and I don't know what to do.  I feel, in some ways, I've been set up to fail by not getting a lot of training and then being looked at as a perhaps incapable on things I didn't even know were needed because it wasn't relayed to me.  My boss is very insular and I get the feeling they just don't want someone popping in to bother them.  The person in the position before me only lasted a month before they were told it wasn't working out.  Before that the person was there for years, and it's some big shoes to fill.

&amp;#x200B;

There are times where my boss will not want to be bothered at all and I don't feel comfortable approaching, and other times I'm urged to get some things done suddenly with no prior warning while I'm trying to work on other things.  I try to get it all done but it seems like with part-time hours so far it's been impossible to get everything done thoroughly.  Now I feel like every single mistake I make or if something isn't done fast enough the issue is utterly blown up.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite it all, I told my boss that I want to hit the ground running and have positive intentions after I return from my vacation but it's just so hard to build my confidence when I feel like I value my job but I'm begging them to see my worth.  Mostly, I feel really tired and depressed.  They seemed on board with taking a deep breath and setting good goals for when I returned.  My boss said I had a future with the company but I feel more self-conscious and I don't know how to overcome it.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is just to go on vacation and know that I've tried really hard to do my best.  If it doesn't work out, I'll look for something out and if I come back and it turns a corner I'll be very happy.  I guess any other advice on how to approach it would be great.  I've been crying on and off all night, it's really distressing to think I might not have a job in a few weeks.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to salvage things but I feel like the expectations are so unrealistic.  I don't think someone is going to master a job like this in six months.  I don't think you can get better without asking questions.  And there have been times, I swear I've asked for clarification, gotten an answer and tried to follow it then told it was wrong anyway.  I don't want to this out because I don't want things to feel adversarial. I'm hoping that by talking to my boss today honestly they'll see that I'm really trying and that the frustration they're directing at me is eroding my ability to perform.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to handle this or the anxiety and worry from the situation would help a lot.  An outsider's perspective would be great.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  I started a new job, and get the vibe I've never caught on fast enough in the half-year I've been there.  Now I'm terrified of asking questions, making mistakes or even losing my job. The anxiety is just stacking on top of me.  I tried to talk to my boss about it and ended up crying.  Now I feel pathetic about getting emotional.  I love my job and the company.  I'm worried things might go awry.  Despite doing my best I don't feel I've always been given the best directions and I have tried to do what I can but I feel I'm entering a point where I'm begging to by heard, or have my value be seen.",22Feb2019,0

161,"Hello all, in a bit of a jam and could use a pointer or two.

&amp;#x200B;

The situation:

The short of it is that my fiance and I are both feverishly looking for *any* full time positions that we are capable of right now and have been for about a month. We are both out of jobs and out of savings for the first time in our adult lives and at the same time, which is harrowing. Also, rent is due on the first, and we only have half of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about the two-fold nature of this problem drives me crazy because even if one or both of us were to be happily and mercifully hired tomorrow, we'd still be cutting it uncomfortably close to the deadline. And that's *if* they paid weekly and started us off immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

What we have done so far:

1) Swallowed our pride, and applied for Public Assistance (cash/SNAP, it's still pending).

2) Asked for help from family and friends (how we got half of the rent).

3) I signed up for Uber/Lyft/Instacart (one car between two people) and am now just waiting for the background check(s) to go through, hopefully soon so I can start driving peeps around and making that sweet dough, bro.

4) Listed extra/unwanted items on eBay.

5) Discounted items on fiance's Etsy store in an attempt to get more sales, only one so far (\*cries in poor\*).

6) May have won $2500 from a car dealership? (We both know it's probably a scam, but hey, imma be pissed if this is legit. Will update after we see if it's just shenanigans tomorrow!)

7) May have a job thanks to fiance's dad?? 

&amp;#x200B;

What we are going to do:

1) Keep applying for any/all jobs.

2) Apply for emergency assistance and see if we can get help paying the rent. 

3) Just keep reaching out, taking every lead seriously, talking to folks and trying everything we can.

&amp;#x200B;

What we are *not* going to do because it's illegal and/or we agreed it would be bad:

1) Becoming prostitutes. He only seems to attract aggressive Asian men.

2) Selling things that would actually cost more to get back or replace, such as our TV/mattress/clothes/kidneys.

3) Stealing or scalping. It's bad, mkayyy?

So, have any of you glorious bastards dealt with this situation/something similar before? Also (more importantly), how?

I'm starting to dread coming to work as I feel that I don't form any relationships with anyone. I love teaching and I love the work. However, this isolation in the work place is starting to affect my outlook on life. 

The hours here can be rather lengthy as I handle multiple classes. Not only that, I usually start my job at 12pm and finish around 730pm - 930pm. I work from 830am to 630pm on Saturdays and have an off-day on Monday. I feel that because of the odd working hours, it's also hard to meet my friends or my girlfriend at any point in time.

What should I do? I love my job and I truly enjoy working here. However, this feeling of loneliness at work just feels unbearable at times.",22Feb2019,1
170,"So, I am your typical almost 19 year-old in his first year of college who doesn't know what to do with his life. I've been trying to find out what direction I want to go, but I really have no idea where to even start.

I hope I don't come off as overly-arrogant when I say this, but I know that I am very smart and capable of doing quality-work. I know that I have the potential to be very successful if I can learn what my strengths and interests are and how to apply them. I just don't know where to even start with that. My knowledge of my strengths is very general (I know I'm a good writer, I have an intuitive understanding of math, etc.) and I'm really not sure what fields I think I could be passionate about. How is a person supposed to learn these things about themself? Where do I even start?

I am a very ambitious person. I genuinely think that I am capable of greatness. But I know that I need to learn how, first. I need to take the initiative.

The job I have now is permanent and I work from home but the new job would be contract for 1 yr and is a 50min commute each way.  The pay for the new role is about $10,000 more per year with the raise I got but with travel, unpaid vacation and sick time considered I am not sure it is enough of a jump to warrant leaving a job I am happy in.

About two weeks ago, I bought Airpods with my own money (I am 13 yrs old). A week later, I lost them. I felt them in my pocket in the locker room changing into my gym clothes, at the beginning of my gym period. By the time, I was changing back into normal clothes at the end of the period, they were gone. I tried using Find my Iphone but there was no luck. Here I am a week later and I still haven’t told the school (because I can’t prove who stole them) or my dad. Now this is where the scheme comes in. I’m willing to sell my PC for around $800 to get money for more airpods and just some extra money in my savings account. But, my dad would notice that my PC is gone and he would wonder what happened, so I have to tell him. When I sell my PC, it’ll be with my sister so my dad won’t know the amount of money he gave me and why i’m taking out $160.

I'm married with kids and I'm sure she's moved on. Plus, we don't even live on the same continent, so I'm honestly not trying to start anything. I don't I feel anything romantically, but I do still care a great deal about her.

I know I could send a super basic message, but she really meant a lot to me and her influence has helped me do great things. And, as I think most people can understand, I want to honestly communicate how I feel.

189,"Hey guys,

This might be very long for you or stupid, but I need other people's opinions on this. And my English is not the best. I apologize for that...

But here is the situation...

One of my relative owes money to this guy because they did some business together, but this guy's calculations were a bit ""everywhere"" which meant he made some errors. He then told my relatives that they owe him $468.99 and he wanted it in cash if possible. My relative lives on the west of Canada, therefore asked me if I could do them this favour to give him the money. They e-transferred me the money and I went to the bank to withdraw it. The guy texted me and called me when he could go pick up the money, and I told him whenever he can and to let me know in advance. And that's what he did, BUT... he never came. For weeks it was like that, I had to sacrifice my time to stay home and wait for him. We even tried to meet up somewhere, but he never came. At this point I was getting annoyed. 

He then asked me if I could wire him the money. I asked him if e-transfer would be a better option since there's no fees and it would be quick and done in a second. He said no. I tried convincing him, but he still said no... He gave me the information for the wiring process and when I went to the bank, I showed him a picture to confirm if the info put was right. Which he said yes. 

That's where the real problem begins... I did not pay for the fee. I deducted it from what was owed to him. Two days later, the wire transfer was canceled because the information was not correct which added another fee that I deducted from the money owed again. Therefore 425$ would be what he would get instead of $468.99. He knew that there would be fees for the wiring that's why I told him e-transfer would be a better option.

It's been months that I am dealing with this guy. Now what I would like to know is, was what I did right? To deduct the fees from the 468.99. Because I have been doing all these things for him so that he could be ""satisfied"" and that I could ""ease"" his life a little bit because he's quite an old man. But right now he's just messing with me by saying ""no do this, no do that instead."" He also blames me and my relative for the fees etc. But why would I go and accept to pay the fee from my pocket money...? This post doesn't sound like it's really problematic, but it's worse than that... 

Now I have sent him an e-transfer of $425, but he is not accepting it because he obviously wants the full amount. And I don't want to take the ""missing"" money from my own pocket to give it to him... I'm already struggling with money and bills. (I am a student living alone).

Sorry if this was long... I just don't want to give him the $45 from my own money when all of this could have been avoided if he had chose to e-transfer before, but it's now that he wants to do it... 

Sorry again guys if this was long... but thank you for your time.",22Feb2019,1

I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, however, I am far from happy. I’ve been looking for a good, decent paying full time job which is proving to be something hard to find. I haven’t gone to school but I make ends meet with some to spare. Recently I inquired to a close cousin who lives in Florida (I’m from NY) about a factory that he helps manage. There’s a plant nearby where I’m from that I thought he might be able to help me secure a position. That’s when he made a proposition: I move into their three bedroom house, rent free, and he hires me. Full time with benefits. Obviously I’m shocked, kind of overwhelmed with the idea of leaving everything behind. But also in love with the idea of being someplace different. Where no one knows me. I’ve visited Florida multiple times. Not my favorite place but I enjoy the heat and don’t mind it. I definitely prefer it to home. There’s a problem with it though. My mother claims that this side of the family stole from her, assets that she was allegedly owed after the passing of a family member years ago. Her claims aren’t true (my aunt was the power of attorney) of the woman who passed, and I’d also be staying with my aunt.

Me and my mother have a turbulent bond, one that’s never been consistent nor particularly pleasant. I love her dearly, but she’s a narcissist with many issues.

This is my last semester of school and this last class is just so damn hard, I think I am already SOL. I am going to talk to my professor this week to express my concerns, ask for advice, and see how to better approach the course, but I legitimately think I have already failed.

I am so demotivated and burnt out at this point. I went to an accelerated high school junior and senior year that was essentially college, then went to college and had to retake the same courses for college credit on top of my major courses, and now, what feels like my sixth year in college, I still have nothing to show for it and am just so done with school and bullshit gen-eds classes and being broke and a school squeezing every last penny it can out of me. I am juggling 18 hours, 2 research projects, and paying for life expenses all while trying get through this class. I am sick of grades and ready to just start a career already.

And my scholarship is only for four years, so if I fail, that's it. I currently cannot afford any more classes as things are right now. I've spent so much time with no money coming in doing things that I hate, struggling to balance my mental health all so I can get a degree in a field that I don't even think I want to work in anymore. The best thing I have gotten from my physics degree is programming knowledge.

I mostly wrote this because I need to vent, but I also need advice. Does anybody have any unique solutions or any past experience with this? Should I even bother for applying to good jobs?

I am currently in Pharmacy School working on my Doctorate, which I will receive in 2022. That means that much longer of not working. I know that it is far off until I look for a job, as a pharmacist hopefully, but this is something that bothers me the more and more I think about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked as a certified pharmacy technician for almost 2 years, and as a therapy aide for three years before that. I stopped working the last day of 2013 a pharmacy tech. My husband is in the military and we were moving. We moved in the beginning of 2014 and I decided to pursue pharmacy school. I attended school full-time, at two different campuses, for 1.5 years and then we moved again. I attended school for another 2.5 years at the next place. 

&amp;#x200B;

We moved again, short term (about 7 months) to somewhere else and I took an online physics course (5 months) that took up more time than I realized it would. In that time I got denied employment from 5 places ranging from a grocery store clerk to a cashier at Starbucks. I was told that as a short term employee who could not guarantee staying long that the amount of time and effort put into training me was not worth the short amount of time I would be able to work there. While here I was accepted into a pharmacy program so I stopped looking for jobs because A) we were moving soon, and B) I was going to be a full-time student again.

&amp;#x200B;

We moved 7 months later after this last move and we are now in Japan. I fly back and forth A LOT because of school. I do not have very much free time, school is all-consuming. As a result, I do not currently work. 

&amp;#x200B;

My explanation for not working has always been because I do better in school when I do not work. Which is very true. When I am in school, school becomes my full-time job. However, this has resulted in an extremely barren resume. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I need advice on how I should handle this. Should this be something that I need to worry about now or much later when the time comes to job hunt again? How awful do I sound from the outside looking in? 

I feel like I look like a lazy terrible person that just sat on my butt the entire time. This is not the case. I worked so very hard to get to the point I am today. I just forgot to be a more well-rounded person. I was so focused on getting into pharmacy school that I forgot that there is life outside of school. I appreciate any advice.

201,"Basically ive (20M) known this girl(20F) for around 4 years of my life. Ive never bonded with people before and she was one of the first. I had a girlfriend when i first met her, then proceeded to have another relationship throughout our friendship and then we were both single for about a year. We became very close and people often thought we were a couple even though we never had sex (or anything close to that, i think we shared a kiss once) . We used to sleep together but nothing ever happend due to myself not wanting too because it was my friend and im assuming because she felt the same.

&amp;#x200B;

So since ive known her ive done something with her every year on my birthday. This year is my 21st and people keep asking me what im doing and where im going etc.. The reason i havent planned anything at this point is because ive still got a gut feeling that she is going to want me to meet her and we can go for lunch or something (im not hopeful of a relationship, just a friendship)

&amp;#x200B;

Last year on my 20th birthday i was an overall dick because i had consumed wayyyy too much alchol and it ended up with everyone going home in a bad mood. I had planned on asking out said girl on my birthday whilst we were at lunch like we normally do but she planned to get her hair done. Anyways time goes by and we dont end up having lunch but we do end up meeting in the night and having a drink etc... The morning after i woke up, and i cant remember it myself from memory but i messaged her that i wanted a date (or something along them lines) and we ended up having it.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time she said she didnt know how she felt about me and had no idea what to do. So without any hesitation i just decided it would be best if we not speak anymore because i obviously didnt want to still be friends with a girl that i had started to gather feelings for. We stopped speaking for a couple of days and every now and then i would get a message, or a call or something to let her know that she was still thinking about me and it tore me up.

Anyway a year has passed now and im about to celebrate my 21st birthday in a couple of weeks. We havent spoken since about 3 weeks after my birthday last year and im considering messaging her and inviting her out to lunch on my birthday just for lunch. Before anyone asks, no, i dont have romantic feelings for her anymore but i dont know if she feels the same way. (something that may be important to the story is that ive actually improved myself so much over the past year that im in the best physical shape ive ever been in(going from 16 stone to 11.5) and looking great in compariosn :P)

&amp;#x200B;

any advice guys?

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know if their is a chance she is still hurting from me cutting her out like that and moving on, I dont think i did anything wrong and tried to tip toe about the situation so much with her because she was like family and the last thing i wanted to do was hurt her. I just dont know if its a good idea to be bringing her back into my life or not because i honestly have no idea of how its going to pan out. Her friends will probably think she a fool too if she ends up meeting me because they know the story and think i should have just been okay with friends even though i started to feel sexual towards this girl.

202,"First off, throwaway for reasons that will be obvious...

Some quick background. I'm a guy who has a female friend with benefits which is entirely open (her and I have had this discussion multiple times). We don't use protection. Our one condition is that we let the other person know if we think we may have been reasonably exposed to an STD. 

I got pretty inebriated with a buddy a few nights ago, and ended up at a strip club in a big US city. Long story short, one of the strippers gave me a private lap dance. During said dance, she began giving me a hand job. She lubricated her hand at some point by spitting in it. There was also a point where she gave me a quick lick on my shaft, but didn't put my dick in her mouth. This all happened very quickly and there was no kissing, vagina on dick rubbing, or insertion. There really wasn't a blow job either, just a quick lick along the urethra, but not the urethral opening. The whole dance lasted a bit under ten minutes and I came at the end. The stripper did not have any physical signs of being infected with anything (like sores on her mouth/genitals). At the time this happened there weren't any issues with the skin on my dick (e.g., cuts, sores, etc.), and it still looks fine. I haven't experienced any unusual symptoms in the past couple days. 

Some of those details may be superfluous, but I'm sharing what I think is relevant - I'm looking for some expert advice/perspective (preferably a non-judgmental and medically trained person, or someone who may have had a similar experience to me in their past) on whether I've likely been exposed to any STIs that I should be realistically concerned about. I don't want to expose my FWB to any serious risks, but I don't want to bring this up if she really isn't at risk for anything. 

Based on my research, it doesn't seem like HIV or Hep are really a concern in this situation, but I'm less sure about Herpes, HPV, Chlamydia, or other STIs I may have realistically been exposed to. I have a phobia of STIs (when I'm not drunk I guess), and I'm unsure whether I'm being overly paranoid in this situation. 

I ask the hive mind of Reddit for its advices. And I will keep this post active so that others may be educated should they exercise the same poor judgment I did and be curious about the legitimate consequences. I am by no means advocating this lifestyle, and I'm not proud of myself here - I'm just looking for some good old fashioned human advice, preferably from those that have something meaningful to say. 

I'm going to bed now, but I appreciate whatever collective wisdom the community has about this. I look forward to reading everyone's thoughts when I wake up.",22Feb2019,1
203,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I use to be able to confide in my mother, but recently something is wrong. She's called me cruel, disgusting, and horryfiying for no reason, but obviously something is going on with her personally, I try to ignore it. I'm homeschooled, and my father is very aspergers, and I can't open up to him (I love him, but he's not good with emotions).   


So, I'm 13. Some backstory, I had a crush on a guy once, but I was VERY emo at that time and I can't tell if it was genuine or I forced myself to believe it, I did that a LOT back then.   
Recently, I've been thinking about it a lot about how I feel like a girl. Then, today, someone mistaked me for a girl, and I said nothing. It just felt right, but wrong at the same time.  
But I also had and have crushes on girls. It all feels confusing (Hell, sometimes I feel attracted to guys). I don't feel like I trust my mom, and I have no idea how to 'come out'. Honestly, I have no idea if I should stay quiet, or what. My mother supports trans people, but I don't think she'd believe me (Emo phase. I said a lot of stuff like this) (For proof I'm not emo: I live a great life, have great times, and do great things. I'm not sad)  


Also, is there anyone I can talk to about this? I feel so alone. Will definetly keep talking to reddit. I like girls, I've dated girls, I've kissed girls. I *feel* like a girl though, and I have for a long, long time. Please help reddit. I hope this gets some responses, I feel confused and lonely

205,"23 M Asian Graduate and jobless.
Both parents work, so me and my sister divide the household chores between us. But it's almost always me who has to handle everything. I have to clean the mess, wash clothes and dry them, put the utensils in the trays after the maid washes them and also drop my parents as well as pick them up daily from work. She is 16, wakes up late( at 10 a.m., it's her vacations) spends most of her time on social media and the only work she does is to make tea once a day when everyone is at home.  I have studies and interviews and it's getting on my nerves to manage everything by myself. She has to be nagged constantly to get her to even fold her bedsheets. Should I slash my palms before her and tell her that everytime she refuses to do her part of work, I will keep doing this ? All I want is to get her to do only her share of chores everyday, nothing less or more.

206,"I'm 18 going on 19 and the subject of moving out of my parents is finally on the rise. I live in a very rural area that has a very expensive housing economy, there's either only huge properties for sale or shitty trailers for rent and almost always both options have a strict no pet policy. I have a pup, 7 months old, and might get a cat if I settle down because my pup gets lonely and misses my family cat when we stay places. None of my friends want roommates, and all people looking for roommates are methheads  (no joke, meth is a huge problem). One of my friends who lives in Portland is looking for a roommate in June/July, when I plan to move out, and he really wants me to move with him. What should I do? The place I live currently has barely any jobs, no places to hang, and is a retirement town. Portland seems like it has way more options, maybe I have no idea though. I'm scared to live so far away from home (8 hours away) but what if I'm happier there? I just don't know what to do.

210,"Husband has begged for a dog since ours died in October. I gave in and suggested a rescue dog. He insisted we go with a breeder because he didn’t want a dog with previous trauma, since we have a toddler.

He found a 6 month old “housebroken” puppy for $500. We buy her. 

The puppy wasn’t house broken. I’m a stay at home mom and soon became extremely stressed with dog messes and the toddler avoiding her potty training because she was distracted by dog. 

I did a bad thing and returned the puppy to the breeder. She refused to give me a refund Bc “there’s nothing wrong with the dog.” I said the dog was advertised as housebroken, but is not. She said “well she goes outside with the other dogs here.” She offered to give me another younger puppy in the future or I could take back my dog if I changed my mind.

The next day I realized I overreacted and wanted my dog back. I txted her. No respond until the next day. All she said was “ r u sure?” Then “I’m at the vet I’ll txt you when I get home” then nothing. I haven’t heard from her. I called, txted, nothing. 

Husband sent a fake txt asking about the dogs and she replied. So she’s obviously avoiding me.


Is there anything you suggest I do to get this dog back?

So I've been pretty introverted for my entire life. In high school, however, I kind of suppressed some of that in order to be more social and enjoy the whole ""high school experience."" Now that I've graduated and left the nest, however, I find myself going back to my more introverted side. I keep in touch with my family frequently, and I have a couple close friends who I enjoy hanging out with, but beyond that I don't want anything more. I'm a 20-something that looks forward to solo walks and days where I don't have to see anyone.

Recently, a lot of people have called me out on it, like I'm ""boring"" or I ""don't get out enough."" Honestly, I'm happy the way I am. I'm good at socializing when I have to, and I try to be warm and welcoming to my coworkers. It's just I'm not a social butterfly, but apparently that's a problem to some people?

So, long story short, should I embrace my introversion, or try to change it?

221,"I'm 25, and recently broke up with my 6-year girlfriend. We were each other's firsts for just about everything. We shared everything together, were each other's best friends, and went through so much together. I don't know how to process this. I feel absolutely horrible and don't know what to do. We still love each other very much, but the relationship really wasn't working out despite that. Not really her fault or mine, we just both slowly realized that it wasn't going to work out. None of the advice I've read helps, and I'm scared I'll feel like this forever.

People have told me that it will get better, that I'll find someone better. This doesn't help me at all. I'm not scared of being alone and have always enjoyed my own company. I don't care if I don't find anyone else. I'm just heartbroken that someone who means so much to me is gone from my life. Sure maybe I'll meet someone that I get along with later on, but how does that change the fact that my best friend is gone? Maybe that's weird, but it feels like these are just separate things.

People have told me that with time I simply will stop loving her, that I will just forget and move on.

I panicked out of the blue and stopped talking to them by blocking their number and all of their social media accounts. They did absolutely nothing wrong - we didn't argue and they didn't mistreat me. I had serious self-confidence issues that prevented me from becoming intimate with other people, so I checked out and isolated myself.

After I blocked them, I constantly checked their profiles on various platforms to see their reaction. Judging from their posts, I think I hurt them pretty bad. So this is probably the shittiest thing I've ever done to someone other than myself. I still feel guilty about it, but I also don't want to overestimate my importance in this person's life.

Now shes teling me that I'm ruining her wedding by not coming at all. I don't want to ruin her wedding, but I don't want to be friends with her anymore. Should I go to her wedding as a guest just so her wedding isn't ruined? Or should I not because I never want to talk to ever again. I already unfriended her on facebook and snapchat, but I don't think she'll notice. I used to be close with her fiancee and he already reached out to apologize too. I've visited them at school a few times because it's close to our hometown, but she has refused to visit me at school because it's too much out of her busy busy schedule, so I'm also surprised I just realized how one sided our friendship has been for the past few years.

242,"Well, that literally. My boss asked for my ass in exchange for that vacancy. We have a very professional working relationship (until now at least) at a party of the company he got drunk he started to flirt (in theory no one noticed) he touched my ass and told me he was going to give Ramírez the vacancy, but that if I gave him my ass I would think about it.

I did not take much notice because he was drowned in alcohol. The next day he sent me to call his office, I thought he would apologize, he usually behaves very gentlemanly and polite (I'm annoyed that he touched my ass, as I said, my boss and I do not have any kind of personal confidence)

He started asking questions about the work, then he gave me a little talk (the weather, etc.) and finally when I left his office he told me that his offer was still standing. I just smiled nervously and left. He is married and I never thought it was like that. I asked him a bit about in whatsapp and he told me to give him my ass 10 times, without a condom, all day at the motel and the vacancy would be mine.

The truth is that I'm thinking about it, the vacancy is very attractive in serious, more than twice the salary and much better benefits. I have not said anything to my boyfriend.

About a week ago I did something at school (I’m in high school) that my teacher didn’t like and I refused to apologize because I didn’t think it was such a big deal. Ever since then they have been really rude to me and I decided to not show up for a day. I’m kind of notorious for now showing up to school but I struggle with depression and body dysmorphia and it really affects my ability to even leave my house. On days that I feel extra dysmorphic I try to hide my face to be more comfortable with the fact that I’m out of my comfort zone. I think my teacher thinks I’m just an irresponsible delinquent now and maybe that’s why they’re being mean but I don’t think that’s a good excuse for a grown adult to act this way. Today my teacher was helping me with something and got too close to me which makes me uncomfortable because I don’t like when people can see close up of my face and they were acting really rude, almost like they didn’t want to be there helping me and was reluctant to even sit there. The fact that my face was clearly visible coupled with the angry vibe I got from my teacher made me start tearing up and I asked if we can continue later because I was starting to cry. I don’t want to go to school tomorrow but if I don’t I’ll just look worse to my teachers. What should I do?? I’m even considering dropping out and I’m having suicidal thoughts. ",22Feb2019,1

My ex and I split about two years ago. He has since moved on with the woman he cheated on me with and now has another child with her. 
We have 50/50 custody of our son. 
Recently my son has been calling me by my first name. I’ve never told him my first name (he’s 4) he’s only ever known me as mom/mommy. 
After asking him he reluctantly told me his dad and his girlfriend have told him to call me by my first name. 
Why? I have no idea. I don’t see a point in bringing this up to his dad, as he will just deny it. But I believe my son, and also know he wouldn’t have heard my name anywhere else. (Family refers to me as “mom” when he’s around)

254,"Hey Reddit! First post so please be gentle. So I've got a bit of a guy problem that's gotten really mixed reviews. I'm hoping you guys can offer some extra insight than what some of my friends have put in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm F 20 and he's M 19. So there's this guy that I've gone out with a couple of times now ( both times went really well and last time he invited me back to his place to chat more and asked if we could hang out again as I left). So I'm thinking things are going pretty great and up to this point we've had a pretty steady text flow, so all is well. But in these past couple of weeks, there was an abrupt halt to our communication and I feel as though our one-sided messages are akin to me holding hands with a lifeless body or a wet noodle.

My pretty open-sided texts will go unanswered for days and it feels like I've gotten a bit of a cold shoulder. Now, this would be a case of cut and dry ghosting ( a 'polterguyst' as I call it)  and I would just cut my losses at this point except that each time he does text back - maybe 3 or 4 days later- the messages are always really enthusiastic and positive. This last time, in an effort to gauge if he was still interested, I asked if he'd want to do something later this week. He said, ""that'd be fun did you have a time in mind?"" but never responded once I got back to him about when I was free. 

I'm a bit confused as to what might be going on here and because we haven't known each other for very long, I'm not sure what to make of it. If one were to read the texts without looking at timestamps, it would read like a pretty normal conversation, but I'm not sure how much response time equates to actual interest. Some have said that waiting a while means I'm probably not on his mind at all and others have chalked it up to him just being busy (it is exam season so I'll give it that). So guys, pls let me know, do you all think he's busy? Maybe lost interest? Is playing some weird game?  And better yet, what would you do in this situation, move on or be patient and see where this leads?

Brittany is not allowed to have male friends, and a boyfriend would definitely make her padre flip a lid.

A bit of background: I'm super dedicated to this club and I attend most meetings, she is an officer at the club. Also popularity wise Im on the low class and Id say she's in the middle class. She is also one year older than me

So my first red flag is when she kinda orders me around during an event. I mean I was ok with it at first cuz thats what officers do but then it got extensive. Im still dedicated so I do them.

Then during another event I catch her whispering to someone else about a task and she suggests assigning it to me because apparently Im willing to do anything. The other person declined and I was grateful for that but I kinda was a bit let down that someone would say that.

Lastly during a meeting she is talking to other people while me and a friend are walking by to a vending machine and they start talking about me when they see me. I didnt catch exactly what they said but I could tell that it was meant to be condescending.

271,"Since may 2018 I've been out of school, I've been going to a psychologist and psychiatrist ever since then due to past trauma's in my life. The road has been very slow but as of now I'm going to the gym 5X a week, have a cleaning job for 2 hours every tuesday and friday (I know it doesn't pay bills, it's just to hold me accountable on a schedule, something I need to built up gradually) and I'm doing volunteer work as a costume designer/maker at an amateur theatre group one town over. I know this is a gap year, because I'm not actually attending school and not working a full time job, but I'm not sitting on my ass doing nothing. I'm actively trying to better myself, and it's just very difficult for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have a big difficulty communicating with people. I have autism (something my parents never wanted me tested for when I was younger, so I got myself tested when I was 18/adult) and for most of my life I was always told by my parents to just ""behave normally"". I've adjusted quite well, but communicating with them is something I struggle with a lot, and quite frankly I don't want to see them/talk to them most of the time. This is mostly because of my past (from which a lot they don't know/I don't want to tell them) but also because they drain so much energy out of me when I have to communicate with them. When I express my feelings they only counter with ""but we give you so much love, we don't know what to do with you, you're wasting your life away at the moment"". When I stay silent I get to hear ""You're snapping at us, why won't you tell us anything, what's wrong with you?"".   


Yesterday I snapped at my mother after she asked the same question 3 times, and I gave the same exact answer 3 times (within a 2 minute conversation). I bolted upstaires to my room, I do regret snapping at my mother, but I have a very difficult time communicating that to her. I wanted to apologise but before I could even do that just now, not even 10 minutes ago my dad came to my room while I was changing clothes, he knocked and I said ""not now, I'm changing clothes, what's your question?"". He just walked down the stairs again without saying a word, I opened the door a bit and repeated ""what's your question?"" He said ""nothing, you're just always snapping at us and there's no reasoning with you""   


One thing lead to another, the conversation was held with the door closed between us because I was still changing clothes (I still haven't...) and he told me he wants me out of this house.

I know nothing about money, I was never taught anything about loans, banking, saving or anything. I currently have only a 1000 euro's in my savings/spendings account.

I really want to get out of here, I can't handle this anymore. I know a lot of people will call me vain and young, I don't care. I was forced to grow up when I was younger, I really want to tell you I'm more mature than I might seem. And even if I'm young and dumb, that doesn't excuse me living in a horrible household, where I'm not being granted the time to think about my future at a reasonable pase. A year ago I was excited to go study architecture/engineering or chemistry. Now I'm sitting alone all day working on costumes (which I love) and being scolded by my parents in the process. They're blaming me because my sisters are all doing so great, they're studying and have jobs. But what they don't see is how lifeless they are, they aren't happy. One has a drug addiction they don't know of, the other is being forced to stay dumb and happy. ",22Feb2019,3
272," 

I'm a teacher at a christian private school in the American southeast. The school is one of those sterotypical religious private schools (costs an arm and a leg to go there with plenty of strict rules) I'm not particularly religious or anything but they offered me some pretty good pay so I signed on as their history teacher.

Recently I attended my first big staff meeting and I started to pick up on a few things said by the other staff members. It started out pretty fine, one of the teachers and the principal went on a small rank about ""snowflakes"" followed by a bunch of ""triggered jokes"" which I found unprofessional but nothing note worthy. Then they got onto the topic of LGBT people, particularly a few of our students who were trans. Saying how people these days were all confused and how ""He doesnt need boobs he's just mentally ill"" followed by a comment about how kids these days are being ""brainwashed"" into thinking theyre lgbt. At this point I was a little irked, being bi (the staff doesnt know) hearing these comments rubbed me the wrong way but whatever, I didnt expect every person here to agree with me so I just continued taking notes for the meeting.

Then I started hearing some stuff thats borderline invading personal privacy. I found out the Principal uses her daughter's Facebook account to spy on what the student's are doing on facebook since a lot of them have her added and will confront them about what they do online if it doesnt agree with her morals. There is also an unofficial ban on relationships at the school. They'll use the facebook thing along with normal school gossip to find out who likes who and do their best to keep them apart. They brought up a love note that a girl had written to a boy during a meeting and read it aloud to laugh at it, they took it from his desk so he would never know that this girl liked him. There was also a form sent home that went way too far into detail about the personal lives of our students and their families with a long list on the last page saying ""check any that may apply to your child"" with things like ""smokes, has sex, is rebellious, masturbates, watches pornography etc"".

I can not be the only one who thinks this is way too far for a school. But I have no idea what to do about this, I need this job so I dont wanna risk being fired by speaking out but I want the best for these students. Do I tell a news paper? The school district? What do I do?",22Feb2019,1
273,"One of my friend is recently absent from school. It is already day 3. What I heard was ""'family issue"" from the person in charge for our club (you have to tell him that you're not going for club activities). 
I have a ominous feeling that it is because of his mother. I know his mother has cancer for a while now (I'm not sure which type). 
I feel like I should probably say something? Like send a ""I hope you get better soon""? Something to do that won't be weird even if it didn't actually happen.
Any advices?",22Feb2019,2
274,"I'll have to delete this eventually as he occasionally checks my reddit. But anyway, I moved in with a friend and his family several months ago. Everyone here has a car, a couple people have two cars, except for my friend. He's 19 and doesn't have a license, and as far as I know he's never driven a day in his life. He has a part time job at a place that's a bit too far to walk, and he also doesn't know how to ride a bike. I don't think I've ever seen a bus around here.

I have no problem giving him rides to and from work and even other places as long as I have the money for gas and the free time. Lately, however, I've picked up a 12 hour night shift 3 days a week so I can pay rent and buy groceries and save money for the future. I work from 7pm to 7am and usually sleep from around 8 or 9 am to 5 or 6pm. My roommate works from 11am to 3pm, so obviously I'm sleeping during those times. Everyone else in the household is usually at work during those times as well, so he has no way to get to work other than if I take him really early, then go home and sleep, or sacrifice my rest to get him there at 11. He also has to stay a couple hours after work to wait for someone else to get off work and pick him up.

I've been urging him to get his license for a while now, ever since he got his first job in December. I can teach him to drive (I'm 21 and have been driving for almost 4 years, I also taught one of my exes the basics). Anyone else in the household could also teach him. His mom and her boyfriend have both offered at least a couple times. There are literally 5 people in this house with different schedules who could teach him any time he wants. His mom's boyfriend has a car he never uses, and would likely be willing to lend/sell it to my roommate. His brother also has a car he rarely uses, since he takes his work van to work. I would even be willing to lend him my car if he ever needed it and I wasn't using it (like if I'm asleep, say during the day, when he works).

He has every opportunity to take the nessecary steps to be able to drive to work, and yet he just hasn't. Since he also doesn't know how to ride a bike and has expressed how scary it was to try, I assume he's just afraid to get behind the wheel. I've told him multiple times that we would start in a big open parking lot in daytime in dry conditions, and that I'd do my best to make it easy and not nerve wracking. This isn't enough for him. He'd rather sit in the breakroom at his job for hours every day and complain about it.

As a side note, I'm also slightly annoyed that he's being hypocritical about something. I'm from Texas and have very little experience driving on snow and ice. It's terrifying for me, and I lost control of my car one day trying to get to work and called off. For a while I just called off any time a storm came through, but my roommate said I need to learn to drive on snow so I can get to work. I was still paying my rent on time consistently, and I know I won't lose that job for being absent in bad weather, so I don't see what the problem was. Yet I buckled down and learned to drive on snow and ice so I can get to work every day like he wanted (I also want money). Yet he can't learn to just drive or even ride a bike.

I've talked to him about it several times, and he's never given me an answer as to why he doesn't want to learn, so I can only assume he's just scared. I don't know what to say to convince him that this is nessecary. You can go without a license if you live in a city where there's public transport and you can walk or bike to a lot of places, but we live in rural Pennsylvania and everyone here has a car. I don't believe he can go his whole life without a license. There's no way he can afford to uber/lyft to work all the time.

tl;dr: Roommate is probably afraid to learn to drive, but his schedule doesn't line up with anyone else's to get him to work. This is a rural area and there is no public transport. How can I convince him he needs to get his license?",22Feb2019,2
275,"I will be moving to start law school in the fall. However, I’d like to get a job from now until I move. It’s just difficult (understandably) to get someone to hire you (especially in the town I currently live in) if they know you’ll be leaving in 4-5 months. I’ve interviewed twice for a local book store (it’s a chain), and I’m pretty sure they’re going to call me tomorrow to hire me officially. They do not know that I’m going to be leaving. I did mention in one of the interviews that I was “thinking” about law school and that if I had to move I’d transfer to another one of their locations— well, truth is I’ve done a lot more than just “thinking” about law school. I’ve already been accepted to a couple schools and I’m pretty sure this chain book store is not in any of the locations of the schools I’ve applied to. There’s that, and also the fact that I’ll be doing law school full time and won’t be working a side job— some schools don’t let students work while in school I’m pretty sure. So transferring would pretty much be out of the question anyway. But I felt compelled to at least mention something in the interview. They just don’t seem to think my leaving will be anytime soon. Certainly not in 5 months. 
I guess I just have a guilty conscience. I don’t know what I should do. Should I be honest? Should I just say hey, look, I’m leaving to law school in 5 months, and if you don’t want to put the time and resources into training me only for me to work their for less than half a year, I completely understand. And should I just (as difficult as it may be) continue to try and find a more temporary job? I don’t know. What’s the smart thing to do here. Am I overthinking this too much? ",22Feb2019,1

to find the right people. i work as a food delivery driver so my days consist of total isolation and then hanging with my gf. ive applied to 6 different jobs that people my age would work however none of them pay as well as what im being payed now, and all of them have rejected me. ive gone to parties to try to meet people and it just never worked out. ive tried bumble for friends and literally no one my age uses it for that. i ultimately want friends that i can smoke and drink with, but also are intelligent and have a good head on their shoulders. any advice as to what more i can do to meet people like that?

278,"This is going to take some explaining but basically I have this friend I’ve known since I was 17 years old, we have been best friends since that time (I’m 24 now) meaning I’ve been his best friend for 7 years. Anyways he used to live down the street from me and moved away only 45 minutes away but we fell out of contact for 2 years after literally hanging out almost every day our entire teenage years. Anyways fast forward to late 2017 we got back into contact picked up exactly where we left off we both apologized to eachother and we literally started hanging out every single weekend, he was living on his own so I’d go visit him we have a great time and I’d do this for every weekend  which literally had us closer than ever and better friends than ever. If you’ve ever had a best friend you can confide in and trust then you know the feeling I’m talking about. Fast forward again to mid 2018 about 7 months ago a girl he used to date back in high school got back into contact with him, anyways she had a boyfriend who she legit had been dating for 7 years. Within a month she had cheated on her boyfriend (with my friend) and then broken up with him after he found out literally broke the guys heart in the rudest way. Anyways now her and my friend have been dating. Whatever because he’s my best friend I didn’t judge him. Now every month progressively my friend has turned into a shittier and shittier friend to me, not only does he literally complain about this girl 24/7 to me when he talks about her but he gets majorly flustered when talking about her even going as far as saying she hides her phone from him which is sketchy in itself. Now the past 7 months he’s slowly not talking to me, we hangout at most once every 7 weeks, he couldn’t give a shit about me doesn’t even take an interest in me or talk to me or act like any best friend should. So I told him I had my issues I wanted him to Atleast try to talk to me once in a while cause I’ve got shit going on it’s nice to have somebody to vent to about my problems cause he’s my best friend. Once again 3 months pass he’s treating me way worse being a shit friend. Tell him again listen dude I’m getting a certain vibe from you is something going on. He says no we move on. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, my grandpas on his deathbed, I havnt seen the guy in 7 weeks I’m just trying to talk to him because I’m stressed and I’m scared my grandpas going to pass, I text him once and explain what’s wrong with my grandpa. Guy responds no joke “That sucks”. That’s it. Nothing else. A week passes and my grandpa dies RIP to him, he messages me giving his condolences. Gives me the shittiest condolences I’ve ever seen, hasn’t one time since asked how I am. I have atleast 5 other people who have consistently contacted me asking if I’m okay how I’m doing since he’s passed you know like a friend would do? This guy is too busy in his own bubble with a girl he talks shit about, whenever they break up for a few days he goes and tinder’s fucks a random girl then doesn’t tell her. Like am I wasting my time? All my new friends are new friends I’ve had for only a year and I feel like I’m grasping at straws with my so called “best friend” because he’s one of my only original friends from my teenage years left. Should I cut this guy out of my life? I told him I’m tempted to cut him off he says “I’m not his wife so stop acting like one” and that “he’ll see me when he sees me”. I’m just over it, am I being like over dramatic? Am I acting normal for a guy who chills with somebody a lot and we’re best friends and then they fuck off? I’m literally in the lowest part of my life and he couldn’t even care less. Can somebody give me advice? Am I wasting my time with this guy? I seriously feel like it’ll never change. How should I handle this and has anybody been in a similar situation? This guys girlfriend has RUINED our friendship straight up. Then he’s acting like I’m being irrational for being upset about how he’s changed as a person.

I was enjoying some time yesterday, playing Mario Kart and CS:GO, when I hear a slight *knock* on my window. I open my blind to see two fairly new adults, who I had never met before. They ran away, laughing, still recording. I shouted out my window for them to f\*\*k off (sorry for language), and they ran into a side lane next to my house. This was not the last time. 

About 45 minutes later, the same people came back, but with an extra friend, who looked about 16. I assumed him as one of their brothers. I heard the bang on my window again, opened my blind, and sure enough - it was them. They started running away again, this time towards the direction of the main road, and disappeared out of sight. 

I found this very upsetting and strange (keep in mind I am only 13) and I really need some advice on what to do.

While I was off getting married I wanted to come back to a clean house. Before we left he had made a mess with the dishes and I just stacked them neatly because I couldn't be bothered doing them again and when we got back they were still in the exact same spot. He has now filled the sink and chucked some dishes in (5 hours ago - seriously) and has not touched them since.

 Also the bin hadn't been taken out (even though he knows when bin night is). 

Plus my cats litter hadnt been changed (even though this I asked him to do and my cat is on cage rest so was stuck in a small space with her giant turd for God knows how long) I am constantly looking after his cat even though he doesn't ask me to - he just abandons her without telling anyone and I feel sorry for her because she misses him. 

Again - hes an adult. Is it so bad that I want him to pick up the slack without having to baby him? If I ask I feel like I'm nagging. If I don't nothing gets done.

Also, people with ADD tend to have hyperfocus abilities ( I think that’s what it’s called), but basically they can focus on things they like for hours. In my brothers case it’s gaming and reading ( mostly gaming). He could play for hours and when we get him to stop he gets really agitated and frustrated, we have set time limits for him but apart from gaming nothing else really interests him. And so when he does play games he can read for a while , but after that he has nothing to do and I guess that’s a problem.

301,"In my junior year of highschool I broke my elbow and tore my ucl in a 7v7 during the summer. I worked my way back and then I became a key player and then got all region. My head coach never seemed to like me though. I always thought it was because I was best friends with the quarterback and maybe he thought I was a bad influence. I never thought I could be a bad influence because I was an all a’s student who rarely got in trouble and did no drugs. I mean this guy would never congratulate me or compliment me or anything. If I was tearing the defense up during practice he wouldn’t say a word but if my backup caught a ball he would be cheering his happy ass off. The only time I ever heard him cheer for me was when I leveled a dude who was about to smoke our quarter back on the sideline. He was saying “that’s how you protect your QB!!! That’s how you do it!!” I literally don’t remember any other time. Well going from out for 2 and a half months to starting by the 6th game of the season and literally within a week becoming the: punt returner, kick returner, and starting receiver I would get to be a captain at least once right? Nah this dude never chose me to become a captain. I always thought I deserved it as no matter what I would teach my backups the best ways to run the routes and I would always be cheering if they scored during practice or the J.V. Games. I was one of the leaders for sure and quite frankly the best receiver on the team. Well anyways after having a breakout junior season I knew going into senior year I’d be starting right away. At first I was starting and then I noticed this trend of all the coaches disrespecting me for like no reason. My weight training coach kept telling me I was going to be beat out by a freshman. We got a new transfer receiver who was really good and he kept saying “look out he’s comin for ya.” I figured they just wanted a little competition. Once summer workouts and training began I was clearly the starting slot receiver and he was the starting wide out. Well since I had secured my position all of a sudden every single week they would bring someone from a different position to mine and I would of course coach them up and help them out but they were clearly never fuckin better than me. I rarely drop passes. Like maybe once a week or sometimes I’d have a bad day and drop 2 passes or something. But like nothing bad. Well one day I dropped my 2nd pass and all of a sudden I got taken out and they put this kid who was horrible in the starting slot. I thought they were just mad at me or wanted me to take a break. But no for like 2 weeks straight I didn’t even get a single rep in. I finally started getting reps again and got my spot back but it was split 50/50 between me and this kid that honestly sucked. My coach would yell at me during practice “ur a 5’8 white kid, you gotta be perfect or YOU WONT PLAY.” And I always got so pissed when he said that because it was fucking practice I’m not suppose to be perfect. I can’t be perfect. Welp my junior year I had established in 6 games that I was one of the best punt returners in the region and Everyone knew I was. WITHOUT EVEN PRACTICING PUNT RETURN THEY TOOK ME (ALL REGION RETURNER) OUT OF THE STARTING SPOT AND PUT ME AS 2nd STRING!!! This killed me inside. I went home and cried. Like I was torn. My favorite part of football was being taken away from me without a cause. We hadn’t practiced it yet so why would I be 2nd string. One day I asked “if we haven’t even practiced punt return, why am I 2nd string? I got all region for returning last season” and my favorite coach on the team said “FINE, you really wanna know why you lost the spot??” And I was like “yeah.” And he said “(the other guy) is more athletic than you!” So first off athleticism has nothing to do with punt return. Discipline and balls is punt return. You think all those white guys in the nfl returning kicks are the most athletic on the team? Hell no because you don’t have to be. If you can make someone miss while understanding field position and when to fair catch you can be a Returner. So I had lost my starting receiver spot because I dropped two balls in one day (literally everyone else would drop like 4 every practice) and I lost my return spot because I was not as athletic as the new transfer kid. The Tuesday before our first game our coach said everyone was going to have a position battle. We did a hard nosed 11v11 whoever is the best at their position wins. I literally in 4 drives scored twice and probably had like 9 catches and over 150 yards. I dropped one ball that would’ve been a touchdown but I had to dive into the ground for it. I looked up and saw my head coach shaking his head. The end of practice they go to call out the starters and I was like “fuck yes dude I was the entire offense basically I definitely earned my spot” and when they get to my position they call TWO OTHER players before me. I was a fucking third string. I had literally never played better than I did that practice and because I dropped one ball I became a fucking third string. I made up in my mind that i was tired of being confused and hurt and I was honestly becoming depressed. So the day before the game I decided to quit. When I told my coach I didn’t love football anymore the first thing he said was “ what about what you said to your teammates during the summer?” (I had said I love them like family and I still play football because they bring joy to the sport and I know I have to have their backs) this caught me off guard and I just said “things change I guess” and then my coach said “the only reason you are quitting is because of your girlfriend. She has you on a leash!” And then I got pissed and was like “she literally did not influence this one bit. This is 100% my decision. I was mad she quit softball this isn’t because she quit her sport.” And he said “ironic how you were mad at her for quitting and look at you.” He also said “if you would just catch the damn ball you would start.” And I said “you see me drop one pass and you get so mad but if anyone else drops a pass you don’t bat an eye” then he said “ the only way I’ll let you quit is if you do it like a man and make a speech in front of the team today that you are quitting.” I said “okay sounds fair.” (I was shocked he didn’t even try to talk me out of quitting. Then he challenged my manhood by thinking I wouldn’t stand in front of 120 of my closest friends and tell them I quit) all my teammates were constantly asking “why aren’t you starting? What the hell?” Like literally 6 or 7 people a practice would ask. They saw what was happening to me and some of them were even saying they would just quit if they were me. So I made a speech. Totally unprepared and awkward but I did it. I wasn’t even done talking and my coach interrupted and said “ALRIGHT. 👋.” As quick as that and that was how he said bye.my teammates also told me he flicked me off as I was walking out of the door. Then he went on a rant about how it was bullshit I was quitting and that they weren’t allowed to talk to me and shit. I still had weight training with all of them. I lost friends cuz of this dude. So NOW that you have heard the whole story I will tell you what I need advice on. Today my best friend (the qb) and I were talking in party chat on PlayStation and I brought up that i still wonder why coach Webb hated me so much. Well my best friend told me that coach Webb told him that I reminded him of his younger self and that he expected more out of me. I don’t know how to comprehend this and I want to DM my old coach and ask him if this is true and stuff. Should I do it or what. I can’t sleep at night because I draw up scenarios in my head of what went wrong and how I could’ve changed it. I need closure or something. How do I get it. ",22Feb2019,1
302,"We went from fwb in the first few weeks of college to great friends and then started dating.  I specifically was okay w/ it because of how nice/innocent he seemed, even if I didn't think he was super hot or anything.  Tbh, it was initially a low risk situation for me because he wasn't super conventionally attractive and I didn't think he was going to hurt me - but we ended up loving each other so much.  

After a year and a half, he suddenly tells me that he thinks HE can do better - and that he loves my personality, but was never physically attracted to me, and that is super important to him.  He adds for good measure, that I could never be his type because he likes white girls (I am dark-skinned).  \*\* Note that this statement comes on the heels of him finally telling his very controlling white (read: racist) mother that he has been dating a black girl.  His mother was very against it and discouraged him from dating me.  I told him that I was okay not being together if it caused conflict in his family (Crazy Rich Asians style) - but he insisted he loved me and we were okay for about a month.  

**My main problem:**  I'm being reverse friend-zoned and I don't know how to deal.... Is he just shallow?  Is he lying to reduce the cognitive dissonance w/ his mom's opinion? 

After knowing and loving someone so closely, should looks really matter to him? (I'm generally considered cute by males of my peer group, so its not like he has to deal w/ some heinous deformity) Am I crazy for feeling so betrayed?  Should I be more offended that my personality/love wasn't enough?  It is kind of screwing with my perception of myself - if someone who I think is average looking thinks they can do better than me, am I even as attractive as I think I am?  Even though I didn't think he was attractive initially, loving him made me see him as attractive to me - why isn't this the same for him?  

I know he doesn't owe me a relationship - I would have been totally cool if he had said he wasn't interested from the beginning, however we have been dating for almost a year and a half and its been the happiest time of my life!  I really don't want to sacrifice our friendship and recently, he asked to be fwb - is this even possible?  Is there any salvaging this?   
 My heart hurts... how can you find someone to be an amazing person, but not physically attractive, but also somehow hot enough to sleep with casually???

I'd appreciate any thoughts/comments - this is a complicated situation and I am lost.  

 tl;dr: Boyfriend of 1.5 years tells me I was never physically attractive (possibly racist motivation) - and wants to be fwb going forward (until he finds someone he likes more, presumably)",22Feb2019,73

I was walking my dog as usual and about half way in I found this man tied to a tree. My path is down the road, up a street, and back behind my house (crossing the backyard to get back into my house.) At first I thought it was a headless mannequin (his head was far back) with clothes on. I thought someone was playing a joke on me because I frequent this area a lot and maybe someone doesn't like the way I dress. As I got closer, I started seeing the details of the body. Fingers, pants, the sweater. Only when I saw the flipped back head with a stretched, twisted neck did I notice. The man was hanging from a tree in front of a light post. The man was hanging not too far from the ground. It appeared he jumped off a little ledge next to the tree. I quickly walked back home told my dad and he contacted the police.

I was shocked at first but now after I feel the same. I feel like it never happened at all. I feel like it was an event and now it's over. My mind is calm. Right before I decided to post this I've just finished some food. My first thought was ""I'm eating manwich and fries right now and a man commited suicide right behind my house."" I only have a few thoughts about this. Did he want to be found the way the whole situation was? Was his last thoughts thinking of my home, watching me make food in the kitchen? Was the way he was situated a cry for help? Did he see me and want me to stop him?

308," 

So this has been bugging me for a while and I have discussed it with only 1 person.  
Here are some details:  
Last year my school went on a trip to Poland and she kinda made contact with me (I was sitting with my friends but the seat next to me was free) by sitting next to me and we started talking about the basic stuff you talk about when you want to get to know a person.

A few days passed with nothing special happening really, until we (a couple of my friends and her, some of my friends also knew her) went to a mall in the evening and before we went back to the hotel, we went to the playground next to this mall.  
There was a swing there (the kind of swing where multiple people can be on at the same time) and she noticed. She asked me if I wanted to try it out and I said yes because I like those swings.  
It was already late at night, so there were a lot of stars.  
We went to the swing and instead of just sitting in it, we laid down in it and then started swinging.  
She noticed the stars and asked if we could lay down for a while to look at the stars.  
I obviously complied because I like looking at the stars.

After this, our trip to Poland was over and she asked me if we could sit together once more.  
Mind you this trip took over 14hrs back home and she sat the whole time beside me.  
We played games, talked and laughed together and slept.  
We didn't really talk after the trip as we didn't share any class and me being the unsocial person that I am, I didn't have the guts to ask her number.  
I realised that I developed a crush on her but didn't dare to tell her as I never have been in a relationship and I'm not the bravest person out there. I don't like to put myself out there.  
I talked to a close friend of mine who also knows her that I liked her. He told me to confess but I still didn't do it.

I thought I got over her, but it seems that I didn't and it keeps me busy and keeps me from doing the things I should be doing.

I also do not have any contact with her anymore.

310,I only found out after our mom passed by a close family friend and confirmed it with our dad. I'm adopted as well but was told by our mom at an early age because I'm Korean and only our mom was Korean.

311,"I have a few mental health issues, one of them is anxiety. I’m not sure what to call us as he is having a few troubles of his own but still calls me his and says he’s not been attracted to any other man or woman since meeting me. 

Yesterday I met his close friend who he’s currently living with, there were minor communication problems as he’s southern (considers himself a Redneck, and probably the most kindest one I’ve met too!) and uses plenty of the slang to go with it while I’m half British so we were confusing each other because half the time we couldn’t understand what we were being told. 

My probably SO found this funny and adorable because we both looking to him for help whenever we said something we didn’t understand. After a while I got a little anxious and started to shake, after making his friend leave for a while because he thought it was his fault, he told me he thinks I’m not ready to meet anyone else and that his friend is sorry. 

I feel guilty because his friend did nothing wrong. I know he worries over me a little but I’m a little worried he’ll be slightly over protective over my health after that. Is there anything I should say to him to make sure he relaxes over situations where my mental health visibly takes over? ",22Feb2019,2

314,"As the title states, my mum and fiance hate each other. I'm not sure how or why this all started, but it first showed 4 months ago when I ended up in hospital for a while. My mum became over protective and basically pushed my fiance aside. 

I noticed this change in her behaviour and asked my fiance how she felt, which ended up being quite hurt and annoyed. 

I messed up by telling them both to go out, get a coffee and talk things over. I was still in hospital at that point and didn't go with them. I don't know how the conversation went but it started one hell of a toxic rivalry. 

Anyway things stayed quiet until today, my birthday. My mum came over to see me, but instead ended up breaking out into a big fight with my fiance and blowing things right into the sky before storming out. I got a text message later on saying she has no desire to see my fiance anymore. 

We're meant to be getting married early next year, but now this has thrown a big spanner in the works. I have no idea what to do or how to handle it. If anyone has any advice, I will truly appreciate it.

322,"So back story: two years ago, at the same time of the year, I had a real nervous breakdown. I started having panic attacks and at one point I didn't sleep for 3 days; I saw a doctor and got help. I've been on antidepressants for 2 years at the lowest dose, and I have therapy, and it helped tremendously. I had a breakdown because I was putting so much pressure on myself to excel and be the best at school, and I just burned myself out. I learned to be kinder to myself and to just focus on graduating, one day at a time.

Here I am now. I graduated. And... There's a big blank in my life. I graduated in political science, but I had a negative experience with student politics back in december and they totally ruined my reputation. This made me disgusted from politics, and therefore, I no longer know what to do with my degree that is in something I dislike. I want to help people and be useful, make a small change in peoples life, not fill in paperwork for days just to make money. So yeah, I used to be able to look forward graduating as a motivation to push myself and keep going, and yet now that I have my degree I feel like everything ahead is a black hole. 

I used to be relatively fine but today it all caught up to me. I've been having back to back panic attacks since 8 PM (its now 5h30 AM). I managed to sleep a little but I woke up a few hours ago because my heart was pounding. I do realize that I'm anxious because I'm putting pressure on myself to find my path, which is the same pressure I was applying to myself 2 years ago when I hit rock bottom. I am TERRIFIED of relapsing to the person I was 2 years ago, not being able to control her anxiety, yet I know that I have grown and I have tools to deal with my anxiety. There's no reason why I would go back to how I was 2 years ago, but still, it's a thought in my head and it scares me. 

Tldr: having anxiety due to obtaining my degree which I don't know what to do with. Putting pressure on myself to find a path which gives me massive anxiety. Caused me to have back to back panic attacks which hasn't happened in 2 years and I'm scared of relapsing.",22Feb2019,1

I was hoping to get my own house this year but it doesn't seem like that will happen. So I'll be 31-32 by the time I finally move out.
-

-
Ok so here's the details for the like 3 of you that will be interested. I'll try to keep it short.

I went to college after high school. I moved in with a gf afterwards. We lived together for a couple of years but I wanted to further my education, so I went to school out of state. I managed to rack up about $100k in student loan debt and $10,000 in credit card debt.

I graduated in 2014 when I was 26. Things didn't work out with my gf during school, so I moved back home. 

After school, I had to do an internship and still take an entry level position making about $28k my first couple of years. Then I got a huge raise in 2016 to around $50k and got really aggressive with paying down my student loans. 

Now I'm making about $60k (before taxes, closer to $50 after taxes). Most homes in this area that I would consider are around $150,000-$200,000. I applied for a home loan shortly after getting my raise to $50k but they said I had too much student loan debt, so that's why I worked so hard on getting it down. 

I was told I need about $10,000-$15,000 for a down payment on a house. So I've been doing all I can to save money: cook at home as often as possible, I don't go out often, I try to only buy things when I need them (not when I want them). I currently have about $800/month in bills and probably spend about $1,000 in groceries and gas. 

But I had some unforeseen expenses come up and I don't think I'll have my down payment this year either. So it will be at least 1 more year of living at home. I'll be 31-32 by the time I move out. 

I feel like people understood at first, but now people are definitely asking just how long am I going to live at home. And I feel the same way. I'm incredibly frustrated and embarrassed. It has affected any potential relationship. I have brought 3 women in total home and they all say it's not too weird because I live upstairs pretty much by myself. But it definitely holds me back from inviting people over.

I can't help but feel like I'm missing something. I feel like making as much as I do, that I should have my own place. ",22Feb2019,2
328,"Wondering if I can get some advice from some fellow students (or previous students) out there!

I am a computer science student in my 4th year at university. I’ve done my fair share of group projects and have two years of experience working as a software developer intern at 2 large companies, along with many various other part time jobs, clubs, volunteering etc. I’m also very friendly and am generally a people pleaser... safe to say, I’ve always worked well in groups and have never had any problems. 

I’m currently in a class where 35% of our mark is based on one semester long group project. There are 8 people in each group (randomly chosen). The point of the project, is to teach us to adapt to changing requirements, because there are very little specifications to start off with (just that it needs to be a text based adventure game in C++) and three iterations, where each iteration new specifications are added based on what would be most difficult for us to implement based on our current design. I get the point, it’s a lesson. We were not assigned specific roles and were just told to do it. 

We are graded on our peer evaluations and quality code contributions (tracked via GitHub). 

However:

Coincidentally, three of my group members already knew each other and were friends. It seems like they basically went home on the first week we were assigned and wrote a TON of code early on, without discussion or agreement from the rest of the group. This caused immediate friction on our group chat, and even now, a few weeks later, basic questions are being responded to in an unfriendly way. So personality clashes and no one wanting to ask questions out of fear right off the bat. The group chat is very aggressive and cringe-y to read. I’ve honestly never seen anything like it before. 

I’m not a fan of confrontation and so I’ve been asking for work and asking questions as delicately as I can and not getting involved in the arguments, but my problem is that I just can’t understand any of the code they’ve written enough to do any work. The code is complex and difficult to change and read, and I’ve spent days trying to figure out how I can implement suggested new features whilst trying to keep their design relatively intact. I’m 100% certain it could have been done so much easier just by looking at what they’ve done and the requirements, but anything at this point would be completely changing everything and I don’t have time or energy to propose that at this point. 

This is a problem I know other members are experiencing, however some of them are more vocal, and most of them are just throwing random code out there that eventually just gets trashed (but they are technically contributing I guess). One of them is particularly vocal about  trying to understand and wanting to change it, but is constantly being shrugged off, the other ones are kind of like me and trying their best but not confrontational, and are pushing code that never gets used or is eventually trashed so it looks like they’re doing something (I really really dislike doing this and I’d say I’ve done it the least). 

The final result for me is I don’t get to contribute that ‘quality code’ for the marks, and i am feeling extremely inadequate. 

This might seem like a small problem in the grand scheme of things, and I’m sure it is, but it’s causing me a lot of stress because I’ve never been the kind of group member to not contribute and, obviously, I want to pass this course with a good grade! I’m taking 4 other courses and this is only worth 35% of one of them, but it’s taking up all my time and energy when I also have multiple midterms worth nearly that much almost every other week, so I just can’t dedicate as much time on this as I’d like too. 

Also, the teacher has been useless in this situation. He’s said before any social issues are part of the learning process, and no one has explicitly said anything horrible to anyone, it’s all just very passive aggressive. 

Though, I think one thing I’ll do is talk to him to get his advice so at least he knows I’m struggling and trying to contribute. 

Any other advice is welcome. Sorry for any typos as i wrote this late at night way too late stressing about this project !!!

329,"CW: This might be upsetting to read for people.  I talk about bigotry and prejudice.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a young American white man in my first two years of college and most of my opinions of others are shaped by some kind of prejudice.  I can't keep racist, sexist, or homophobic ideas out of my head despite attempts at mindfulness.  I am also possessed of very little compassion for those less fortunate than me, and the thoughts that cross my mind when I hear about poverty or immigration or climate change and so forth seem objectively alarming to me and I am not sure why they're in my head.  I don't have any serious political convictions but given the things that float around in my head I don't think I could fault you for calling me a fascist or something to that effect.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know when exactly I started thinking this way, but I got very politically agitated during the 2016 election, and at one point even went so far as to chant with friends at anti-Trump protesters.  ""Build the wall!"" and that kind of thing.  I don't feel like that is necessarily the worst thing.  However, in the last year or so I've begun to feel more aggressive impulses, and have found myself almost relishing news of various tragedies like shootings and violent political incidents.

&amp;#x200B;

I had kind of a shocking emotional epiphany recently re-watching ""Saving Private Ryan"", and realizing that I was experiencing feelings of resentment toward the American soldiers at D-Day for being misguided or something.  As a child I wanted to join the army and was very proud of my grandfather's service in WWII, so this genuinely shocked me.  It made me realize that I need to do something to shake these extreme thoughts but I'm not really sure where to start.  Many of my friends and loved ones are of different races or sexual orientations, and I myself am basically quasi-bisexual, so I recognize the cognitive dissonance here.  But, in the last couple of days I've been feeling really disgusted with myself over what kind of harm my ideas could have wrought, and while I don't expect I'll ever be a liberal in the American sense, I'd at least like to walk back from this edge I seem to have been close to tipping over politically.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone changed their mind from this sort of thinking successfully?  I have been trying but I still catch myself thinking really messed up things no matter how mindful I try to be about it all.  I would really appreciate any kind of advice about this.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I keep catching myself thinking like a Nazi.  Don't like it.  Please help.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, mods, if this is the wrong place for this I would really love it if you could maybe suggest a better sub when/if you remove it from this one.

333,"I used to be a super happy, fairly outgoing person. That was about 6 years ago. The last 6 years ive noticed a fair amount of depression. For 2 years it was very bad but i was able to finally shake it and climb out of it partially. I still find myself slipping back occasionally but for the most part its a steady mild depression. I also have a pretty good amount of social anxiety. Some people i have 0 problem talking to other people i will physically shake and my words will be shakey as well. At first i thought maybe im just a pussy and cant talk to girls but then i realised it also happens when i talk to guys. Some pretty girls are easy to talk to some arent, i can talk to people in authoritative positions over me such as my boss, higher up execs in the company and even police. But some people i just have trouble talking to. Anyways to the point. I recently hurt myself and was given codeine for pain killers. I noticed when i take them the anxiety seems to go away. I feel like myself 6 years ago, now i know codeine is an opiate and i know they are very addictive and destructive so i really dont want to make a habbit of taking them. Is there anything i can take to have the same effect that wont destroy my life? Im not really big on drugs only have done pot and shrooms but pot increases my anxiety and i dont really want to make a habbit of sipping alcohol all the time.

334,"Ok, so me and my bf don't want to get married. We just don't feel it's needed and we are happy as we are, why change that!

But we are very committed to each other and people forever ask when we are getting engaged. My bf wants to get me a ring to symbolise commitment, exactly as engagement would be, but we will not be engaged due to our views on marriage. 

The issue is, I feel NO ONE takes our relationship seriously. In my family all the couples that are getting engaged or married that have actually been together just a fraction of the time me and my bf have get treated like they're 'solid' and a stable couple. Just because they want to rush to marry. We don't want that, we both agree on it, but other people seem to look in and judge that it's because we aren't happy together or something. 

When the time comes that I get this ring, can you guys give me examples of how I can announce this without it sounding unimportant? I want it to be taken just as seriously as when someone gets engaged. But I just don't know how to word it to make it sound that way 🤔",22Feb2019,1
336,"Backstory:
I rent an apartment in a duplex in a small Midwestern city. A few days ago the landlord notified me he was selling the place and, as per the lease, he would give me twenty four hours notice whenever anyone is to enter my home. I woke up two days ago with people looking around my home, no notice. Since then a menagerie of people have been through poking around the house.
Most people looking at the place have become really excited when they find out I'm out of the initial year lease and month to month. A couple put an offer in and the inspector has come through. I overheard their conversation (through the floor while they were in the basement) they want me gone so they can take the first floor.
I have 1000 dollars to my name and I'm freaking out. My SO is suggesting we stay with her parents and buy a house. I only came to this city for school and that's way to settled in. I'm afraid of getting stuck here. I function so poorly without stability. I'm afraid I'm going to fall so far behind in school from this I'll lose my tuition assistance.
I really only need an apartment with my couch, desk, bed and bicycle. What should I do? I've been homeless before and I'm terrified that's where I'm heading again. Not having the stability of my own home is freaking me out. Any advice would be welcome.",22Feb2019,1

I am aware of this and I want to work towards the best version of my self now, which is what he wants for me too. I realised that as college starts up again, we have the same class together. I'm so incredibly nervous and afraid to see him in class, im still suffering quite a bit and at this stage im not sure when I'll be okay. I guess I want to know how do I survive/cope/react to seeing him in class. we both agreed to be friends and stay in each others lives after we both heal.

338,"Hey everyone, my mom is having an issue I'm hoping someone could help find a solution to. Her house has a sump pump to help prevent basement flooding. For about a week and a half now, the sump pump has been running continuously, pumping out about a gallon of water every 60 seconds.

When the issue started, temperatures were below freezing and the ground was completely solid. My mom called the water company, and they sent someone out to look at her meter. We already knew there wasn't a break in our line, which he confirmed, and thought there may be a break somewhere along the main line. The technician said it was probably due to the ground thawing. They slapped a $100 charge to her bill and left. Since then, the temperatures have been above freezing. All the snow is melting and the ground is thawing, so even more water is being pumped out per minute. A couple houses down the street just had their pump burn out and their basement flood so now my mom is going into full panic mode about hers burning out.

Any tips/advice on what she can do? I know nothing on the subject, but if temperatures hadn't been above freezing for quite some time prior to the issue how could there be that much running water underground for the sump pump to be pumping out if there wasn't a break somewhere?",22Feb2019,1

On top of that, I'm not really that good at it. I don't think it would be very financially stable because it takes me much longer than others to improve. I am in my second year and realising that it's just not my cup of tea and not what I want from life.

I've never actually had a job in my life and I'm in my early 20s so it's gonna be hard for me to get a well paying job straight away, I'm not expecting that. I just want to eventually be able to be happy in what I do. Which I originally thought being an illustrator could offer, that isn't the case.

So what should I do next? Should I stick uni through trying my best which isn't improving my grades? If I don't continue onto third year, how would I find out what I DO want to do with my life?

Recently me and my band started touring all around the country and we book shows ourselves. We arranged a gig at a very populated city, however, the venue owner is a lot of trouble. Pretty much never picks up the phone or calls back, took him 2 weeks to create the event, ignores most messages on Facebook.   


Recently I asked him how much will we get paid and basically he gave us a disrespectful amount. Not only does it not cover half of the expenses, but it doesn't even cover the FUEL! Basically, we will be funding 80% of it. We have to rent a van, pay for the fuel and not to mention, it takes about 2.5 hours to get there.   


Now, he has bands play there often and he owns a lot of food chains across the city, so I know he is not broke. Not only that, we will bring in a lot of people to the concert which will drastically increase his sales.   


Since he is so evasive and possibly agitated all the time, how do I ask him for more money without coming off as disrespectful?",22Feb2019,1

Ever since I've been suffering terrible back pain but will not get any financial support for medical treatement as I have been deemed guilty (even though I was not)
Worst part is, the bitch claims her knee hurts even though she walked just fine after the accident and now I may have to pay for her damage my entire life even though it was not my fault.

352,"The back story starts like this, a month ago a friend of a few years and I had gotten that emoji on Snapchat that shows you both talk to each other the most. It lasted all through January and then disappeared after we didn’t talk for two days straight for some unknown reason. Not going to lie it hurt my feelings pretty badly, but I didn’t do anything about the actual emoji and for ask him if he was alright. 

It came back, and I was fine for a week. It would come and go, and I was a little bit bothered by that even though I had no right to. I at first didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to come off as too clingy, but then something made me point it out. All he said was that he was all over the place, which was understandable because I knew he is dealing with some though shit right now, but I was still unsure so the next day I asked what he had meant. He explained and then I explained why I liked having the emoji there and how it made me feel like I mattered to him. 

Later that night I asked to hang out a few days later, and he said he couldn’t. An hour later I was about to send him a message when he sent a paragraph explaining that he needed a break and would talk to me again in a few months. I immediately felt my heart shatter because I knew deep down that it was probably because of what I had said regarding the emoji. I tried to ask what was wrong and apologize, but got ignored.I had said a similar thing a month before and he took it much different, saying it was understandable and comforting me by saying that really it didn’t mean anything and that it wasn’t like we weren’t talking every day, so I figured when I said it this time it would end up just the same.

 I was wrong I guess. 

Now I have to deal with the guilt and confusion of wondering if it was because I mentioned the emoji being gone or really if he will ever speak to me again. I tried sending him something today, but got left on read again and now I truly think he just wants me to go away for good.


Am I overreacting in believing this was because of me and that he’s angry? Or could it have been a coincidence and have nothing to do with me? I really just don’t know how to handle this or what to do, and I’m convinced I ruined everything. Help.




**Tl;dr:** I pointed out to a friend of many years that the emoji on snap that shows you talk to each other the most was gone. Now they are taking a “break” and won’t talk to me at all. Now I feel like totally ruined our relationship.

353,"So I live in a house where the top floor is being rented out and is separated into like 5 rooms, while the bottom floor is where my landlady and her husband lives. They're both very nice, I mean I know she's nice! I don't really talk with the husband but the few time we did exchange a few words he's always normal and nice.

Today however, I come back from work and immediately get into my pyjama when I suddenly got a very strong cigarette smoke smell from my shirt. It wasn't just a light whiff, oh no it was as if my shirt had gone clubbing all night to a ratchet bar.

The issue is I don't smoke. The only person I know for sure who smokes in this house is the landlady's husband! And everybody has fixed jobs during the day except him so no ones usually in the house except him during working hours. It's so weird, I just don't know what to think. I started sniffing around all my other clothes and nothing else smelt like cigarette smoke. My pyjama bottoms are starting to smell like smoke the more I sniff at it but that may just be my head playing tricks.

I don't know what to think. I don't have any proof obviously! And why would it smell like smoke, like what did he do just take my shirt and smoke at it!? It's just weird and I feel weird and I'm just concerned but I don't know what to do or if I should even do anything.

363,"Hi Reddit! My (24f) boyfriend (27m) and I just moved into an apartment together for the first time since we started dating (about a year).

We moved to a new state and while I’ve moved and had apartments of my own (he’s only lived in a house owned by his family), I’ll admit that we moved into this one a little hastily. It’s a nice two bedroom, and both rooms are almost exactly the same size. I didn’t really care which of the rooms we used as the “master” because it makes little difference to me, so he decided based off of safety/accessibility and all of those things I don’t often think about. 

The place is a little dingier than we realized at first walk-through but due to time constraints, we decided to just go for it, and so far feel that we’ve made a good choice. A majority of our furniture won’t be here until mid-March but have our necessities. I’ve noticed in the room and bathroom that we’ve designated have a strange smell that the other does not. He thought I was crazy at first then stated last night that he could smell it, too. It’s not bad, per se, it’s just not pleasant either? It almost smells like it was a child’s room and I don’t know how to explain it because neither of us have children, but it just has this oddly distinct smell that reminds me of tiny humans. 

We’ve cleaned a lot and have candles lit but I can’t seem to get the smell to go away. It’s starting to drive me a little crazy. Oddly, the room has no windows but a door to go on to one of the two balconies (both rooms are identical). I don’t want to leave the door open as there’s no screen/second door and I’m a big wuss when it comes to bugs. 

This turned out to be longer than expected, but any advice on, hopefully, getting this smell out would be greatly appreciated! Especially before our mothers visit!

365,"Here we go.
So, my old boss sold the (very reputable) bar about 6 months ago to a couple of sleazy Russians. I told him I would stick around as long as he paid me (the general manager) half my salary per month. His reasoning for keeping me around is because he is still owed a couple hundred grand from these new owners and wants to make sure the bar stays afloat.

Two weeks in, new boss shows up to the bar drunk and causes a scene. I tell the old boss that I don’t think I can work for these people. He gives me 5 grand in an almost apologetic way and leaves it at that. I keep on trying. 

Fast forward three months and nothing has changed and I haven’t received another bonus cheque. I’ve gotten a job offer for another location for better pay. I obviously take it and agree to stay on at my old job for partial work and salary to ease the transition. No hard feelings from new bosses. 
Here comes the fun part. 
I sit down with the old boss to tell him the news and he absolutely LOOSES his mind. Packed restaurant I front of tons of people. He accuses me of “formulating a plot” to “scam money” from him and the new owners and that they are crazy to keep me on in any way. He then threatens to meet with the new owners and tell them not to keep me on and that when he’s through my name “will mean nothing in this town”. 
His reasoning is that he doesn’t believe they need to pay me, that I can’t possibly work two places at once, and that I owe him more time for the 5 grand (bonus cash with no clause or contract) he gave me three months ago.

376,"Tl;dr -- Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. After several years of dealing with  severe depression and my life falling apart, I'm trying to rebuild. I've sought therapy and medication and am determined to get back on track. I moved back home and got myself back into school (community college) with a plan to improve my life and be reinstated into my original B.S. program. I've been searching for a job and have reworked my resume multiple times, but I keep striking out over and over and over again. Before I attempt another round of retail/coffee shop/customer service applications, what can I do to improve my chances? I'm a good worker and I have a lot of relevant experience, but I keep getting looked over.  How do I stand out?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also enrolled in an A.S. program in computer science. My ultimate goal is to be reinstated into my B.S. program at university after being dismissed about 4 years ago during my depression. I'm doing well in my AS program and the skills I gain can help me get out of the retail job cycle and doing well will also help me make the case to be reinstated for my B.S. Is this a good plan?

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the long version if anyone is interested:

I'm trying to rebuild my life after about 4 or 5 years of severe depression. The kind where you're trapped in your own mind, can barely get out of bed to eat or go out to do the shit you need to do. Where taking a shower required too much energy so I would end up going back to bed. It got so bad at one point that suicide was on my mind almost all the time.

 It was triggered by an emotionally traumatic event for me and I fell far. During this depression I dealt with homelessness (living out of a car), being robbed while sleeping in said car (thief smashed a window while I was asleep and swiped my backpack and laptop). I went from being an As and Bs student to failing my classes and eventually being dismissed from my university. I went from someone who was happy and  I was proud of being to someone who I couldn't even recognize, a shell of who I used to be. School was my identity. I loved learning and being a student, failing out is the biggest shame in my life right now. 

This isn't a sob story, but I needed to explain where I was coming from. Eventually I sought therapy and medication and it helped so much. I learned so much from my therapist on how to get out of the hole I was in and how to move forward. I was on fluoxetine and it really lifted me up after about a few weeks of my psychiatrist adjusting the dosages.

I was living in the Bay Area at the time and my therapist and I had talked about me moving back to LA where I grew up. Things would be a little cheaper there, I would have my best friends who make me happy just by thinking about them, and I could get away from whatever negative energy was around me in the Bay Area. So I quit my job (I tried to transfer to a location down in LA, but it didn't work out), rented an SUV and moved back home. I had a very dysfunctional childhood and this isn't the best place for me either, but I needed to go somewhere I could be physically safe. 

Well, now I'm here in LA. I took to heart the lessons I learned in therapy and it's helped me to keep my head up. I applied for Medi-Cal here and was approved so now I'm going to find a new doctor and therapist so that I can continue my therapy and medication. I'm no longer in that severe depression, but I'm not quite out of the woods yet. I still have work to do to fully recover. 

I learned about SMART goals from my therapist and I think I've made a good one. I'm back in school at community college getting a AS in computer science. It's a STEM field that's related to my original program. I got straight As last semester and this semester  I'm on track to get straight As again.  In the medium term it allows me to obtain a degree that will help me get better jobs than just retail and allow for some better income (I've never made more than $18k in a year and I'm now in my late 20s). In the long term if I continue to succeed (and I'm determined to) I can seek reinstatement in my original program at my university  and complete my BS. In other words, this plan gets me back on track to achieve my goals. I think this is a SMART goal. 

My next step is to move out of the house I'm in right now. There are too many negative memories and bad energy from childhood in this house and living in this house was the source of a lot of my anxiety and milder depressions when I was in my teens and early twenties.

I can't take this step until I find a job and start earning some money again. I have 4+ years of retail and 3+ years barista experience and I've been applying to jobs every day, but I get no response back 90% of the time and the other 10% is an email saying that they're going to move forward with other applicants. This hasn't happened to me before. I'm getting turned down for entry level retail jobs at places like Target, Petco, Best Buy and other retailers that I've been applying to. I know how to work customer service jobs and I know how to do it right. I've never had bad reviews or write ups, I'm a good worker. But I keep striking out with applications. What do I have to put on my applications and resume to land me a decent customer service job that will work with my school schedule? Or are there other jobs I should be targeting outside of customer service? I'm putting the same things that got me jobs at places like Target and Costco in the Bay Area, but down here in LA I'm 0 for like 50 at this point. How do I stand out and get an interview? I've redone my resume multiple times now and nothing is sticking.

Also, I hope my plan to get back into my program at university is reasonable and sound. If anyone can offer advice or guidance on this plan that I've come up with I'd really appreciate that, too.",22Feb2019,1

378,"When I was in school ,one day I read in a book about twitching of the eye.It was written that if your right eye twitches then something nice will happen to you and if your left eye twitches then something bad will happen.This thing comes around  in a story of my religion's mythology also . After my brain came to know about this idea , I observed that my eye is flapping more frequently. Sometimes 20 minutes straight(Before my exams ) .My eyes never used to twitch earlier .And since I was very superstitious those days , I thought that God is communicating with me using this method.Yup, judge me. After some time , when I stopped giving importance to this thing , it almost stopped . Occasionally sometimes it used to happen.Not as much as it used to happen earlier .Is there any scientific phenomenon that describes this ?

The tips I've found when I googled it was :
*Look at a Cute Girl* : Tried that, I didn't want to become creepy and even though she was cute, I was still too tired to focus on her.
*Drink Lots of Water* : This one has worked for me sometimes, but like today I was in band and I drank a whole bottle, but I was still falling asleep. 
*Pinch Yourself* : I can do this until I start falling asleep and it leads me to stop pinching.
*Go Take a Walk* (to the Bathroom or somewhere close and Back) : This one helps until I come back to class and I feel like once I sit back down, I start falling asleep again.
*Try Focusing on 1 Certain Thing* (like Teahcer's Hand or Face) : This is the ones that bored me and just made me feel sleepy even more.
*Drink Soda* : This one helps for like 10 minutes when it hits you, but then you crash even worse when the effects finish.

382,"Long story short, I’ve got to know this guy and he became my fp and we kinda clicked veeeeery well.. I ended up liking him and I confessed to him but he told me that he wasn’t ready to get in a relationship cuz he was still recovering from this thing he had with another girl that left him, we stayed as friends later and ended up splitting due to my unstable mental state and how he wasn’t very communicative with his thoughts and emotions. Now after a month or so of not communicating well, he told me he was at his worst and he needed my help by sending him pics that you know slightly nsfw. I already knew he was very lusty and that his last option as a coping mechanism with his chronic depression is by mastrubating, so I wasn’t surprised by that. I ended up refusing to send any because to me that is the stuff you’d have when you are in a romantic relationship with someone.( put in mind that we live in a veeeeryyy religious and a reserved society) He ended up telling me that he is willing to get into a relationship with me and he will seriously devote his emotions and time which I knew he wasn’t fooling around when he told me that, tho he agreed with me that he is willing to do so just for these lusty stuff. 
Thing is I feel like my emotions for him are taken for granted, like I do want to be with him cuz he is a really great human being when lust isn’t there... but to be in a relationship with someone that consciously made himself like you and direct his energy towards you just so when he is need of it you are there to help.. makes me feel disgusted and used. 
Basically, it broke me down how the whole time we spent together and all those nights we texted through and when he was all caring and affectionate was  all an act just to get me satisfy his lusty needs. 
How to deal with this? It really did break me down and I feel like my trust issues will get even worst because of this. ",22Feb2019,2

385,"So just over a year ago I made a new Reddit account after my last one ended up getting too centred around mental health stuff. I started off mainly posting about one or two interests, but as time has gone on I've contributed to lots of different subreddits, and looking back at my post history now it's probably a good representation of my life. I thought it was very unlikely that anyone I knew would ever find my account (since most of my friends don't know what Reddit is), so I have posted some personal stuff that is fairly tame but I wouldn't normally share with anyone - like about a crush and my relationships with family. 

Recently though I've had a bad feeling that someone I know from college has found my account. They haven't said anything direct about it but have been acting quite strangely around me for months. For example I had mentioned dropping a class in a comment on Reddit once, but then changed my mind a few days later. When I started attending the class they were shocked to see me there even though we'd never spoken about it. A couple of other similar things have happened (that I won't go into).

One half of my brain is telling me that my intuition is right and I should just delete the account and start a new one, even though it means losing the karma and all the posts/comments that I was proud of. The other half is saying that I'm being too paranoid and there's no need to start again. I have no evidence that my account is being watched, after all. Does anyone have any advice?

TL;DR: I have a feeling that someone I know from college has found my Reddit account and now knows a lot of personal things about me, but I have no concrete evidence. Is it worth deleting my account or am I likely just being too paranoid?",22Feb2019,1

He has expressed many times that he doesn't want her and we fought for a good six months soley on the things she would do because she was too touchy with him. When im with him she is constantly texting and calling to play games with him or talk, and i recently went through his text messages with her and found some alarming stuff on his end, like telling her she has a big butt and her asking some shady shit.

I asked my boyfriend the ultimatum question of me or her (as a question, not to actually go through with it) but he refused to answer saying he shouldn't have to choose and should have both. His anger resulted in him punching a hole in the wall. We are constantly arguing about this girl and I've confronted her about it before but she doesn't understand. I'm tired of her sleeping over at his house (with othet people) getting drunk with him, being all over and touchy with him, and constantly texting him. I don't agree with it. Ive tried talking to him but he gets very angry fast because weve talked about it so much. I don't know what to do, I want to break up with him but st the same time i would feel miserable without him. I feel like it would be dumb to dump someone after this long over this but its been fighting for 6 months and I don't know what other routes to take.  Hes expressed how he already chose me from her from the start, but they hang out every second of the day and she wears provocative stuff around him and prances around to get his attention especially. Im sick of it, and its gotten to the point that I don't want to hang out with any of his friends when she is there, like ive started cancelling plans on the weekends if she is there (the only time i can see him is on weekends because of school) She also loves to get drunk and I've been there on numerous occasions where I yelled at her because she was too much with him. I honestly don't know what to do anymore.

388,"tl;dr version:

Got talking to (I perceived to be) a great lady on a singles website.  I live on the east coast and she lives on the west coast, but we text, talk on the phone, and video chat every day for about 4 months.  Last week, she flew to a city on the east coast for a bachelorette weekend and we agreed to meet in-person for the first time when she was free from activities.  She was really excited to see me and most of our conversations leading up to our meeting were positive.

We met on Valentine's day and spent time having drinks, snacks, and talking at a local restaurant.  She was excited to me and vice-versa.  As I drove her back to her friend's place, I put my hand on her leg and she reciprocated by holding my hand and rubbing my hand.  It was sweet. We kissed each other on the cheek goodnight and we parted ways.  She left with a big smile.

The next morning, we got together again, but her demeanor had changed.  She seemed aloof and not as friendly.  After touring a local landmark together, we went to lunch.  At lunch she dropped the bomb on me: ""I don't feel we are clicking"" and ""I don't feel we have chemistry"".  I'm stunned.  She goes on to tell me that she didn't like my unwillingness to move to her hometown (which, 8 days prior, she was fine with).  She also didn't like my ""unwillingness"" to meet her friends.  I explained to her right there and then that I had *no* unwillingness to meet her friends...I just felt it was a little awkward since we weren't yet romantically an item.  I had just met her in-person for the first time less than 24 hours ago. I said I want to meet her friends but I also want to spend some time exclusively with her too.  She said ""I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling it"".  

Sending flowers and asking for a second chance is probably a waste of money, right?",22Feb2019,1

390,"All of my sober adult life I’ve been a very manic person. I over-react about most things. I’m often referred to as tightly wound.

391,"I (21M) recently re-established contact with a girl (21F) I know for about 8 years, a few weeks ago.

We hung out back then, but it somehow faded out, and now recently I just wrote to her (will tell why later) and we texted etc. over the last few weeks and she seems to be nice. We found out we have some similar interests, things in common and such. Playing video games is one of our common interests. It happened that we agreed we could meet up some time and play two certain games (One is a game I like that she hasn't played and vice versa). I invited her and tomorrow she's coming to my place. I'm still with my parents and so is she.

Now the game changers:
- 8 years ago, I had gotten to know that she had liked me in a more than friendship way.
- I initially had liked her too and had always thought she was kinda cute back then. (It was her behaviour that had changed at some point into something strange that made me want to take a distance a bit.)
- We never truly ""broke"" contact, it just faded out. We had Facebook or so, over the years, and occasionally wrote a thing or two over the years. There was never a conflict or such. I recently contacted her to ask whether what I thought was true (that she liked me in a special way) and to tell her that I had been kinda worrying about it all these years, had it on my mind and that I'm sorry in case I hurt her and I never mesnt to do that. It was true. She said that she had kinda liked me, and maybe even for something more than just friendship, but it wasn't like a heartbreak or so and that I didn't need to worry about it.

But she was kinda interested that I remember all these things, that's what it seemed like and what she said. She probably was impressed. We had a nice conversation and I want to find out more about her and she probably wants to find more about me too.

So... we kept on writing, had nice convos about stuff, malltalk and more, I sent her memes (after I asked her and she told me that she likes memes) and now we're meeting tomorrow for the first time after so many years. We're going to eat an ice cream and then go to my place to play video games.

Problems/questions:
So far, it all seems good, but I don't know what to expect from this...
I'd be fine with us being friends. I don't know if I want more. I don't know if she wants. I don't know whether I should be open for it. I'm not sure how to behave tomorrow due to this.
I think I'd be just chilled and such... and treat her like a normal friend. But what if it is maybe more thsn that, potentially a date for her? I guess I'll see what happens, but... I'm just not sure. Not sure what to do and/or expect from this.
She's rather cute, but I'm not really sure if she's my type... I never had a relationship yet. I'm not sure what to do and whether to be open for this becoming more. But especially, in the first place, I'm not sure what to treat it as, tomorrow.

TL,DR
I re-established contact with a girl I lost contsct with 8 years ago. We're meeting up tomorrow at my place (parent's apartment) to play video games. We talked the previous weeks and she seems to be nice and we have common interests.
She liked me in a special way back then.

Last year I moved to a new high school for my studies and I hate it. I have a large group of friends and they're great for letting me join their group but I don't really have a good connection with anyone there. I can't join another group because the grade is really segregated.

That's ok though because I still had friends from my old school which I still keep in contact with. However, our friendship has been drifting apart even though we were really really close for 4 years. Today I met up with my few close friends and it was so awkward. I was the only one initating and carrying convesation. I was so excited to see them but I really didn't feel that from them. I feel terrible as I have tried to maintain what I saw as a valuable friendship but clearly I won't be as close to them as I was before.

I just feel so lonely in my new school. I have plenty of ""friends"" but nobody to really confide to. I don't know what to do. They don't purposely exclude me, they're lovely, but I know I just don't fit in that well. I just genuinely don't feel a connection with anyone and I feel so isolated.

Also kind of dumb but I haven't been in a relationship or kissed a guy ever even though I'm almost 18 and it's dumb but it is taking a toll on my self esteem. Valentine's day definitely didn't help with that either especially since I kind of messed up my last ""almost relationship"" because I was too nervous around him.

Now I’m going to need an excuse for my mom as to why I was on my way to school, but still somehow couldn’t make it to first period. This rules out my usual “I overslept” excuse, and she has my backpack in her classroom so I can’t tell her I left my bag at home and needed to turn back (which is my usual backup). Obviously she knows I had my phone because I called her on my way to school, so I can’t say I left that at home.

408,"I've been trying so hard to make my mom happy, and proud of me, but she just doesn't see anything good in me.

When I was in fifth grade I was bullied pretty badly. I'm talking pushing me, teachers throwing my entire desk (books and all) out of the class and forcing me to drag it back it, rumours... You name it I've probably been through it. All of this caused my grades to drop to an all time low, and eventually, around 7th grade all of the pressure, and bullying got to me and I started cutting for a while.

I remember in fifth grade, I had a though of jumping out of my 4th story apartment's window and end the pain.

Cut to eigth grade when my parents made me switch schools. I found new friends, and I picked myself up, and started working harder and smarter. My grades went back up, and I had a healthy social life now, but I'm still too scared to socialise with anyone because I'm svared they'll turn against me again.

I've been trying so hard. I stay up till 12:00 AM studying, I have tuitions for subjects I'm not doing so well in, I'm doing MUN, and I'm writing a book of poetry. I've been achieving the best grades I can. I'm talking A*s, As, a one or two Bs in all of my 8 IGCSE options. I've tried to be more social with everyone, but for mother it's still not enough.

She criticises everything I do. There's not enough A*s on the report card, I'm not doing enough extra curriculars, I'm still rude and have an attitude, and I'm still too fat. I've done everything I can to please her. I starved myself in the first quarter of 2018 to get skinny (didn't work, I got fat again). For reference I'm about 5'6"" and 69.5 kg, so while I do look a bit heavy, I feel fine. I stay up later to study, and I'm starting Finance Club and the Further Math Club and I plan to start volunteering at a Special Needs Centre and work a part-time job over the summer. 

Even then though, she'll find a way to put me down. Today it was how I chose to wear a comfortable pair of shorts and a T-shirt instead of wearing full length pants, and how I served my friend more food than both of us while at a restaurant today, even though she is cutting Calories to make us both lose weight.

I've been looking at so many universities abroad (Canada, Singapore, Sweden, Germany etc.), but my mom always says she'll come with me there. I promised myself that as soon as I turn 18, I'll live for myself, but it seems so far away.

I'm tired of trying so much.

I haven't told anyone, not even my friend, but I want to fucking die. I've never wanted to die so fucking much. I am as happy as I can he throughout the day, but by the time I go to sleep at 2:30 AM? I'm considering killing myself. The only reason I'm holding back is because I have a little brother, and I love him so much, and I don't want him to be alone, and because it's illegal to kill yourself where I live.

409,"For context to all of this: My father is extremely unstable and suffers from heart disease. He divorced my mom 4 years ago and lost his job and turned to alcohol which almost killed him. He lost most of his money from the divorce and has been raising me and my sister (who’s an adult and has moved out now) using his pension money. He hates my mom because she cheated on him. I live in Europe.

Last night during a fight he screamed at me that he’s going to take his own life once I’m an adult because he’ll have no money and will have to live off of social security (?) because he’s very sick. I suffer from depression and anxiety, so all of that was a bad trigger. I ended up having a breakdown because of it. I couldn’t stop screaming and I told him to stop saying those things, but he wouldn’t stop. I began to hurt myself and he still wouldn’t stop shouting at me about him committing suicide and killing my mother. He kept saying horrible things to the point where I had to leave. 

I told him he needed help and this wasn’t healthy. I know what it’s like to be suicidal, I attempted suicide last year but failed. I go to a psychologist now to deal with my mental illness.

I know all of this is extremely abusive of him, but he doesn’t understand no matter how much I tell him. I don’t know what to do. I left yesterday home and stayed the night at a friends.

I’m back home now and my mom just informed me that my dad is now harassing her boyfriend and telling my mom that she’s the reason why I tried to kill myself. I told my mom about last night and she’s advising me to call the police, but I’m scared. She’s currently out of the country, so she can’t help me. I don’t know what to do. I feel unsafe, but I need the reassurance that this all won’t go south. I don’t want to lose my dad and I’m scared this will push him to the edge. I love my dad so much.

410,"I'm in college and met a really cute and cool girl through the music school. We are playing in the same show together and sit pretty close to each other. I had never met her before but immediately thought she was really cool and beautiful so over the course of a week or so I striked up a few quick conversations just talking about music and her instrument and other things like that. Turns out we have a few things in common and blah blah blah.

Ive caught her looking at me about 15 times a show and she will usually look away or sometimes kinda smile when I notice. I also realized she has been parking next to me every day except when she drives with her friend, although even they parked next to me a couple times. I've caught what seems to be her and her friend looking at me and then smiling to each other or texting back and forth from across the room but I could definitely be misreading that and drawing conclusions. She's never really iniated a conversation with me but she's kind of a shy type so idk what to make of it. She doesnt really initiate conversations with anybody. When I have talked to her she's kept the conversation going and also seems to laugh at any kind of joke I make even when it's not that funny. The first few rehearsals and shows I was glancing over in her direction constantly but desperately trying not to look like a creep, and she wasn't really looking at me too much but a few days later after I talked to her once or twice I can see her looking constantly and looking me up and down out of the corner of my eye.

I've looked at some of these dumb articles online about the subtle hints that a girl is into you but most of them involve things like them constantly touching you or things like that, and none of that has happened. We barely know each other and just met a week and a half ago so I was hoping some people had some advice on more subtle hints girls may be dropping. I just want to make sure Im not misreading everything because I'm so into her and then end up looking like a creep haha.

I haven't been single since I was in high school so I'm really an idiot when it comes to reading the signs a girl is into you lol. I think I'm definitely going to ask her out but don't really know how to approach it. I'm kind of nervous about rejection so I was going to wait until the end of our string of shows so I dont have to sit there for 4 more days if she says no, but if anyone thinks these are signs I should have picked up on let me know and I'll get the damn courage to do it sooner!

As a bit of a back story, this girl has had a rough life so far. With both parents facing drug addiction and jail time, she bounced around foster homes. She faced abuse from one of those homes, and had a physically abusive boyfriend for a while.
Just before Christmas she found a safe home with my best friend (her uncle), who previously knew nothing about her except her first name.
Tonight she broke down and spoke (barely) about being raped, and showed a more recent message from the same person asking for sex and admitting rape, “I’ll just come around and overpower you again like last time”.
For now, she has blocked him on all social media etc. It is a fragile situation. Of course we want her to pursue legal action against all the people who have done her wrong, but that will be a long road. (Has anyone out there been through anything similar and have any advice on how best to support her?)
And another question, I want to beat this scum bag to a pulp along with everyone who cares about this girl. I know his name, Facebook and Instagram. Can I do anything without jeopardising any potential legal action that might be chased down the track?

We’ve known each other since summer and we immediately really got started to get close and we hang out most of the week we do a lot together we have favorite restaurants we are kind of like couples and I like him but he does not like me so we’re just friends and we’ve clarified that multiple times. But we still do a lot together I watched his house because he has a lot of pets for over a week during the holidays. Sometimes he gets really down and I get really down and he’ll drive down to see me even though I live pretty far even though it’s late at night to go ahead and make sure I’m OK and when he’s done I’ll go take him his favorite food or ice cream or candy and we just do everything for each other. So in the morning on my commute to work he will call and we will talk. Today I could tell he was either really tired or just kind of getting unhappy with him I made a joke and he didn’t like it and I know he normally doesn’t like it but you acted more irritable than normal call mom then I was talking about something and asking him questions and he just responded K not responding or answering my questions and this made me mad and I said we don’t have to talk if you don’t want to then silence so I said ok then I’m hanging up.. then I think he started to say something but I was so mad at this point I hung up. He called me back then asked why did I do that and I explained there is no point in talking with you if all you are going to do is say K. Then he said I’m just tired in which my reply was then I will let you go, go back to sleep. He said no let’s talk. I was really irritated and just kind of done with this conversation at this point so when he asked me what my plans were for today I said I didn’t have any and he said we’ll maybe I should let you go I don’t want to talk to you it’s not really fun to talk to someone who is irritable. I was overreacting and So even though I was very angry but I still apologized. Then he said whatever to my apology which  made me pissed. And he said I do it all the time and that I’m a hypocrite. We are supposed to hang out on Saturday but I don’t know if I want to see him for a while right now because I really didn’t like his response to that maybe I do say whatever when he apologizes but the whole series of our argument the whole series of leading up to everything just made me so mad.

I think about all the times she said something passive-aggressive to me or made racist comments. All the times she gave me unsolicited advice and judged every little thing I did.All the money she cost me by stealing or breaking my stuff and lying about it. I was sort of forgetting about her until a couple months ago. She sent me a video of myself that was kind of embarrassing. I was drunk, head banging and pretending to play guitar with a rock song in the background. I pretended to think it was funny and I answered her question about how I've been. In my message I asked how she's been and she looked at it but didn't reply. So I un-friended her on Snap Chat because she obviously just wanted to upset me so she could feel superior.

I'm considering sending her a long text message explaining why she's not as innocent or perfect as she pretends to be. I want to list off all the shit she put me through over the 2 years we lived together.

I know it's more mature to forget about her and move on but part of me feels like this is what it would take for me to move on. But, she might even like that cause it would prove to her once and for all that she has been getting to me and that I have been thinking about her.

Last years I moved to a new school half way through the year, I was pretty bummed out but i knew I was gonna make new friends. It was a very small school, as there were only 12 people in our grade but that only made people from other grades good friends. I was fine with that and thought I thought I would have a great time at this new school, but some kid in my grade started calling me crippled because I have bone deficiency and my fingers were a little curved and i walked with my back curved. They called me spider fingers, monkey arms because i have long arms, and they said i have a potato head because i have a weird shaped head. I didn't say anything because im a really shy guy. But next year it got worse.

A Korean kid came and we seemed like good friends at first but then things turned bad. He taught two other guys some korean and they started calling people names including me. I was curios what they were calling me but a month later I over heard the guy that called me crippled say it meant the N word. I was shocked but i never confronted anyone about. Then a few weeks later he started telling everyone that I don't take baths.  I understood why he said that because i came in late to school without bathing because i had to go with my brother for a surgery and came back really late. But i finally realize that this guy hated me because he would intentionally aim for my head when we play dodgeball or played with pool noodles, and its kinda confusing because I don't mess with anyone. I just mind my own business. Now a days I hear people talking about me behind my back and i realize why the other grades hate people in my grade, because they ALL gossip. Except me.

Short version: Im having a hard time in school with people calling me names and It upsets me but im a shy person and don't feel like confronting them. I would make new friends but its a small school with 13 people in my class including me.

Within moments of my interview I was offered a supervisor position. Of which I gladly accepted as it’s more up my alley and the pay is $4 more than minimum wage! ( I didn’t see the supervisor position when I applied or I’d had applied for it). 

My point and advice is... just keep going and doing, even when discouraged and want to quit or walk out, you never know what will stem from it, you never know what you’re walking into. Listen to that voice nudging you to stay/ do/ be.

I meet with my advisor every semester to talk and discuss what classes I will take next semester.

440,"About a year ago I (26f) got an admin job at an extremely small vocational school 5 minutes from where I live with my Mom—there were 2 employees on the admin side of the school and the owner of the company was my direct manager. In given the reception desk right by the front door. My first week there I was given a dollar raise by the owner of the company because of how well I was doing. 

During this first week, through casual small talk, I discover that the owner and my Mom used to be friends when they were young. Not good friends, but they knew each other. Remember this, it will be important later. 

My 3 month performance review happens with the owner and I’m told my performance had been ‘fair’, that I’m not at all an independent worker and I need to take more initiative. I’m a bit surprised since I thought everything was going well but of course I’m professional during the meeting. Immediately after the owner announces to the 2 employees that she’s  impressed with how well I took the criticism and how professional I was.

I make an honest effort to try and do better. About two months later my boss takes me by the shoulders and tells me I need to have more confidence and I’m too shy and that I need to ‘fake it till I make it’. I’m embarrassed because at this point it’s my personality being criticized and not my job performance. I go home and vent to my Mom and she tells me I need to talk to the owner and tell her how I feel. I’m an EXTREMELY non confrontational person but I agree with her. 

The next day I do this. The owner and I go into her office and I try to tell her I’ll take all the job criticism she has for me but that I don’t appreciate her commenting on my personality. I don’t get even half of that out before she denies having said anything like that, says she can’t be expected to walk around on eggshells in her own business, and kicks me out of her office. I’m very upset by how the meeting went, so I go to lunch and text my mom to let her know it did not go well. This was a big mistake.

I go back to work and try to get through the rest of the day, but the atmosphere in the office is extremely tense. 

Around 2pm I’m sitting at the reception desk doing my work with another coworker standing near me. My Mom walks in the door, very angry.

Long story short my Mom makes me walk off my job and I’m too blindsided and mortified to do anything but follow her. I haven’t contacted or spoken to anyone in the office since.

Besides the fact I need some therapy about this whole clusterfuck, how the hell do I move on to other jobs? Specifically the fact that most jobs make you fill out an application and list your full employment history. If I omit this job and the interviewers find out about it they could terminate my application. If I include it there’s no stopping my former employers from telling this whole story and ruining any chance I have of getting that job. I can easily leave it off my resume and explain away my leaving that job if I’m forced to bring it up in an interview, but what do I do about the actual written application? ",22Feb2019,1

448,"I don't know where to ask this.  And obviously it's not a super power, and probably more common than I think.  But I'm really good at a couple silly things that I would like to turn into practical use.

1.  The least important one probably.  I can hear nearly any voice on the TV and instantly recognize who it is.  If I've heard someone's voice once, I can recognize it instantly somewhere else.  I don't know if this is normal or not.  But with celebrities now doing commercials, my wife is always surprised by me immediately calling out the celebrity talking.  Even if they are obscure I can usually think of the show they were on, and then google their name.
2.  This one is a similar, as it has to do with audio memory.  But situational.  It shows itself when I am listening to a book on tape.  Driving my car or riding my lawn mower.  When I go back to my physical book to find my spot.  I can read a sentence, and know immediately where I was and what I was looking at when I ""heard"" that sentence in audio form.  So I can pretty quickly find my spot since I know either how close to home or how close to finishing mowing I was.  It is very vivid in my brain.

The main reason I am asking for advice is that I am SUPER forgetful.  I.E. My wife will ask me to do 3 things while she's gone.  And I will listen.  Then 10minutes after she left I've forgotten at least one of them.  I have to always write everything down otherwise I will forget it.

I'm just curious if there's a category my brain fits into that I should follow certain things when trying to remember.  Or if it all simply boils down to me being more interested in the book or show, so it digs into my memory much better than my wife annoying me with chores I have to do.  I kind of lean towards the latter, but wanted advice regardless.

452,"Hi - to jump right into it, my s/o has been struggling w his depression for a while now. He’s had trouble in the past, but recently it’s gotten quite bad to the point that he has debilitating physical pain. He is still the same motivated, smart, kind, and funny guy that I love so much, but he sleeps all day sometimes and it hurts to know he’s in pain. It’s also affected our relationship (more so in the past, though). He can be very withdrawn &amp; not want to speak at all to me and we used to get into arguments about it, but I’ve recently tried to come to a better understanding of his mental health. 

I know his diet isn’t the best and he doesn’t workout. He also hasn’t seen a therapist yet. So, I know right off the bat those three things need to be worked on together. But, I was wondering if there’s anything more? Any vitamins (omega-3s, fish oil, adaptogens?) to help lower stress? Any excercises to lower anxiety? Any easy excercises that we can do together that will help boost his energy without overwhelming him? Obviously I know that depression is complex so I’m not asking for a cure, but just any small things that can help lessen his pain.  

Furthermore, those of you who may have depression or have a loved one who does, is there any advice or wisdom you want to offer in terms of being a more supportive and understanding gf? I tend to be a really hands-on person who wants to help in any way possible, but I know it can get overwhelming for someone who needs their space like my s/o or else he will get anxious.

TLDR: I'm a high school senior, and I'm afraid I may not pass my finals (which are on-going at the moment)  
I have sleep issues, and concentration/focus issues, and I practically cannot study anything that I don't like / am interested in. I haven't done any studying the entire year, haven't attended any classes either, and managed to pass all the exams until now.   


Starting with my sleep issues, my sleep cycle is very random. I sleep whenever I'm tired or when i'm extremely sleepy and I just cannot fall asleep before that (I've tried to sleep on convenient timings before, I just can't. Sometimes I end up just lying on the bed, staring on the ceiling/wall for hours doing absolutely nothing. I spend weeks trying to correct my sleep schedule then the next day, it all goes to shit. Sometimes I go on for multiple days at a time without ANY sleep. Typically I sleep at 4-5 am and I can wake up whenever, and I just can't do that because exams/classes are at 9am, and I can't go there deprived of sleep, and not being able to think straight.  


Getting to the other issues, I can't study. I haven't studied the entire year, and obviously I need to go through my entire syllabus in 1-3 days for each subject(Physics, Chemistry, Math and Electrical Maintenance 1 &amp; 2) and I just cant be arsed to study, for anything..

455,"For reference, I’m 24F. I’ve been here 7 months now. I went into this job with a large amount of confidence. I have always had the reputation of being efficient, organized and getting things done. I rarely make mistakes.

 Now, 7 months later, after working with my boss, I feel the exact opposite. My boss has me doing the work of 2-3 people. It’s an obnoxious work load which I’ve mentioned multiple times. The response was “I have people doing triple your work load, you don’t have that much work”.

Because of this, I make small (not catastrophic) errors. When a small error is detected he’ll send me 3-4 emails with rude remarks like “why are you so careless?” Or “I don’t understand how an error like this is made”. And the whole team with be CC’d. Today he said “I think the elephant in the room is that you’re not good at what you do.”

I constantly feel like no matter how hard I try, or how meticulous I am, he will find a way to find an error. I work 10-12 hours a day to keep up with the work load. And one day I worked a normal 8 hours because I wanted to go out to dinner for a change and the next morning I got an email about how I’m expected to stay late to complete tasks (my boss saw on the camera what time I left). Meanwhile when interviewed I was told the hours were 7-3:30 (8 hours).


I feel like I am constantly trying to impress him, but to no avail. Every time I reach a goal, the finish line is moved further back.

I haven’t been eating lunch (no time or the stress makes me lose my appetite). I’m anxiety ridden which also contributes to me making more “mistakes”. I’m breaking out in acne on my face and body. I’m constantly nauseous. I cried on my way to work on Monday and on the way home on Thursday after being scolded for coming in at 7:15 instead of 7. And I’m just not happy.

456,"Posting from a throwaway account:

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to change my last name. It is something I have struggled with my entire life (36M). Its a terrible last name. A name that is easily made fun of, and made for easy jokes. I have always dreaded meeting new people, or starting a new class (especially in college), or even just placing a food order over the phone, because eventually, I would have to give them my last name. And even at my current age, people *still* make comments or little jokes about it. They may think it is no big deal, but when you have been dealing with it all your life, it just gets hard to deal with. So I would love to change it to my mom's maiden name. I like her last name so much better, and I feel like it would make life so much easier. I always wondered how my life might be different had I not always been embarrassed by my last name. I wouldn't dread meeting people or being more in the public eye, because I wouldn't have this stress lingering all the time. However, a couple issues...

&amp;#x200B;

First, I have two kids. They are 4 and 2, and have my last name. My wife kept her last name. Not because of mine, but because of her degree and career, it made more sense for her to keep hers. But the two kids have my last name. They aren't in real school yet (oldest still in preschool), so I figured it would be good that if I were to change our last name, to do it before they went to school. I just really don't want them to go through what I went through growing up. Bullying just seems so much worse in todays age. I don't want them to be an easy target.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, they are the only grandchildren for my parents. I am the youngest in my family, yet my older siblings have had no kids. So I was the first. And when they were born, my dad made a comment about how the family name continues. I love my dad so much, but I don't know if he ever realized how hard it was for me with this last name. I don't want to hurt him by changing my last name, and I don't want him to think it reflects any way on him.

&amp;#x200B;

One quick note. I know it is possible to take my wife's last name for me and the kids, however, she has a last name that is similar to mine in that it is easy to make jokes or comments. So it would basically be a lateral move, and would put me in basically the same position.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for some advice as to what to do. I really think it would be beneficial to change the name, but there are definitely some issues to deal with. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",22Feb2019,1
458,"[Here is my original post for context.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/a2pcw7/my_dog_keeps_getting_attacked_by_an_emotional/)

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I contacted the Department of neighborhood Services and opened a case. I provided the video footage, and shortly after an inspector contacted me saying he would make sure the GS was up to date on shots, and give the owners a warning that if it happened again they would have to detain the GS to access his behavior and whether he is safe for the public without a muzzle. Since it was the first time I had reported the attacks and I only had [CCTV video](https://www.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/a330p5/cctv_footage_of_one_of_many_attacks_from_an/) from one attack he said there wasn't much they could do since, in the eyes of the law, this was a ""first time""  attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the inspector contacted them, I ran into one of the owners of the GS and she informed me that their plan was to only take the back staircase and allow us to use the elevator in the apartment. She also said she had plans to get her GS fixed and take him to aggression training classes. Another three weeks passed without incident and I ran into the same owner again, she said they had since gotten him fixed and she believes it helped his aggression issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another two weeks pass and we are now up to date, and I have been noticing the GS in public more. They seem to be walking him in the front of the building (where most people walk their dogs) and I have had to go out of my way a few times to avoid a public run in with my [Australian Shepherd](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9v60vx/ranger_just_got_back_from_his_first_trip_to_the/). I have also seen them coming out of the elevator on the first floor.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning however I had another scare. It was an encounter with a male who I have seen walking the GS many times, and even was walking him during one of the incidents when the GS attacked my Australian Shepherd in the elevator. I saw him leaving his apartment as I walked my Australian Shepherd into the elevator, so I pulled my AS in close to me by his leash, assuming the GS owner would walk by the elevator to take the back stairs knowing his dog is aggressive. Instead, he allowed the GS to lead him to the elevator, and began to say ""good morning"" as he and his GS (who was hunched over pulled towards me and my AS) took two steps into the elevator. I began to panic (since his dog goes completely crazy) and say ""no, no, no, no"" as they stepped in and he greeted me, and as I was speaking his GS began lunging towards us and barking and growling extremely aggressive. My AS was cowering behind me bark/howl screaming in fear and I bent down to hide my dog (instinct that I know could get me in deep trouble). The owner seemed surprised and had to lean against his dogs pull to try to subdue him, and physically strained to get the GS out of the elevator. He was able to without the GS actually biting either me or my dog, and I pushed the elevator close button to get away ASAP and was not able to say anything to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am completely baffled by what happened. They know their dog is aggressive, and the man was present and walking the GS on a separate occasion when he actually did attack my AS. Why would they then try to get in an elevator knowing their dog is aggressive? Why are they using the elevator again at all? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is where I need advice. I am afraid that if it happens again I will not have video footage of it happening again and my apartment building will not address it again, or the inspector will say I need some type of proof. Should I wear some kind of body cam at all times? Should I talk to the owners again? Should I contact the inspector before I do anything? Since he didn't actually bite my dog, would they just blow it off? I need advice bad, I am so annoyed and concerned about this situation. Walking my dog has become scary knowing how irresponsible these owners are.

468,"So I am in yearbook and a part of yearbook is to sell yearbook ads. I undersold so one of my friends gave me an ad for the teacher sponsor of a big club. I waited a while to do the ad and today I tried to make it but then I saw that the pages for the ads were all submitted for publishing. Do I tell my yearbook adviser what happened? I am close with the teacher I sold the ad to and she didn’t lose any personal money (because the school paid for it) and teachers often don’t buy yearbooks so the chances of her noticing are slim. However, I do feel guilty and feel like I need to tell my adviser what happened, but a part of me is scared because I really want to be an editor next year and I feel like I have a good shot at it but I think this could ruin my chances.

While texting, I told her my intimidation and awkwardness regarding getting intimate but I deeply have a desire to have my first kiss with this girl who's my first love.

I also have some alcohol issues that I’m now seeking help with(too little too late unfortunately), I didn’t drink all the time I would just occasionally drink excessively and end up getting horribly sick. 

My so of nearly 4 years gave me the ultimatum last time it happened and I put the nail in that coffin last night.

It wasn’t my intention to end the relationship, I love the man I just couldn’t get my shit together.

But now I have to decide what to do next, I don’t have a ton of money in savings(3k) or anything as I’m a full time student and my income covered our food costs etc. 

He has all the savings and is going to pay to have my tires replaced and provide me with funds to get to wherever I decide to go.

I don’t know what I want to do, I can talk to my grandmother and move in with her back east until I graduate.

I can find a job and a place out here on the west coast that I like, but I won’t know anyone.

I can stay in this town here and hope getting help and staying in touch(he values our relationship and would rather call it quits now so that we still have a relationship) would demonstrate that I can be responsible and possibly get him back.

I can also go join the military.

My fiancee and I are trying to figure out what to do about a registry for our upcoming wedding in April. Our problem is that we already have a lot of kitchen items, bedding, etc. through just being in college. So we aren't really looking to add kitchenware or other things to a registry.

Instead, my fiancee has had the idea of just asking for cash from people that want to give us gifts at our reception. We're not demanding gifts by any means. But we don't know how to politely ask for cash instead of other gifts that we'll just have to end up selling anyways.

474,"I become good friends with a coworker. We talked daily and hung out weekly. She was dealing with a lot of personal life stress and I was helping her through it, and although she was a bit dependent, she was always very sweet. However, halfway through us living together, she started becoming increasingly passive aggressive, angry, accusatory, demanding, and hypocritical. She was never like this before. Then, she went out of town every weekend for a month and got a new boyfriend. Since then, she has done the following:  
    
* Asked me to watch her dog for a week, I said I could not, and she got really upset with me,
* I finally said I would watch her dog for 2 days to help her out,  
* I woke up on Sunday at 10:30am, was about to take her dog out, and saw dozens of missed texts and calls from her angry that I hadn't taken her dog out,  
* I called her and said I had just woken up and was about to take the dog out, and she accused me of intentionally trying to kill her dog, that I am an untrustworthy friend, and that she will never be able to trust me every again,   
* I told her I would take out her dog and send her photos every time I took her out so she would know the dog was taken care of (I was upset that I had to do this to regain her trust after I was doing her a favor for free after I had said I couldn't do it),  
*  After she returns from her trip, she starts passive aggressively texting me that I left a light on overnight and accuses me of costing her a ton of money, even though we get free electricity at night   
*  I explain to her it was free so it doesn't cost money, say i'll be more conscious of it so it won't happen again except for an occasional accident, and let her know she is welcome to go into my room and turn lights off if I happen to forget, but she immediately says I am attacking her and not addressing her feelings,  
*  She accuses me of being mad at her for weeks, I explain that I have never been mad at her and she doesn't believe me,  
*  She tells me her boyfriend's dog is staying at our place for a week, and I ask her if she can keep him her room during the work week so the dog didn't eat my dog's food, and she refused and made me lock up my dog that week,  
* She called me a bad friend for missing her birthday dinner even though I had explained I was out of town for my Grandpa's 90th birthday,  
*  She got very mad at me for not knowing she was crying in her room and trying to console her when I had no idea that was even happening and she said a good friend would ""just know"",  
*  She told me she wanted to move out at the end of our lease 2 weeks before I had to put in a 60 day notice and gave me 2 weeks to figure out what my living plans would be,  
*  She told me she would be happy to extend the lease to give me more time to find a place, and when I asked her to extend for 2 weeks, she accused me of trying to take advantage of her, 
*   She moved out early with all of her furniture and turned in her keys without cleaning anything before leaving  
*   I asked her why she left without telling me or cleaning, and she responds accusing me of calling her a bad friend even though she has ""always been my friend and there for me"" and for being negative and irresponsible and that it was clear I would take care of cleaning  
  
I am so confused because everything was fine before. She was going through a bad breakup and she really needed me through the process and I was really there for her. She was always very sweet. Once she got a boyfriend, it went south quickly. 
  
  
THE QUESTION: This behavior seems abnormal. I am not sure if she just used me during the breakup, or if there is something bad going on with her new boyfriend. I don't know if I should talk to figure out what's going on, or if I should just move on. She has had big falling outs with 3 of her best friends since her new boyfriend.

A few months ago one of those friends (let's call them A) told me they liked the guy as well, I was really conflicted on whether I should tell her we like the same guy (he will be B) but I decided not to due to the amount of drama it would cause. Recently I've found a guy (we'll call him C) who I think is really attractive but I don't have any romantic feelings for him at all. I told A that I liked C when I really didn't because I didn't want her finding out we liked the same guy.  Then A's best friend(D) also my friend revealed that she liked C as well. So now everyone thinks I'm competing with my friend over C and they all know, including me that I'll never get with him because D and C are already really good friends. 

Now the problem is that I really want to get to know B, I have his number and we talk and I think he genuinely likes me so I want to slowly slide in and see if it can go anywhere. But, I'm using C as a cover-up of who I like so I can get closer to B without anyone thinking I have ulterior motives and so far everything's fine. But now I'm scared of getting any closer to B because if A finds out I've been trying to 'stealing her man' behind her back, she'll throw a tantrum and try to turn the whole world against me.

I really want advice on what I should do in this situation and if I should be straight forward and tell A that I like B and not C and go for it or stay hiding and try to slide in without anyone knowing.

487,"Hi, im an 18 year old male and I feel too stubborn to solve my dilemma atm. 

So, to start off, I´ll explain my situation. Start of last summer, I started dating this cute girl. It seemed perfect, as her friends are friends with my friends and so we created a big circle of friends. We felt really connected because my SO and me just understood our problems so well. We spent a LOT of time together, like every free minute we possibly could and it was awesome. Then in september my work started (I had a long break after I finished school in june and then) and I couldnt really get used to having a rather tight schedule, so I wasn´t quite motivated with my gf back then. I told her at some point and obviously she accepted it and knew we could move on after this down-phase. That´s when it all went downwards. She suddenly didn´t want too meet anymore by saying ""she had no time rn"". But when we did meet, I recognized, smth was wrong with her. She wouldn´t open up the same as before. I asked her many times what was wrong with her. ""Nothing"" or ""Nothing to worry about"" were her answers mostly. This went on for around 6 weeks, when we met again some time. We hadn´t met in about 3 weeks and were only texting few times a week as she acted very repellently. She FINALLY explained me her problem. She told me she was in therapy for an eating disorder. Looking back, I admit that I was kinda apathetic in that exact moment as I felt betrayed by her for not telling me anything for all this time and also because I just was told that my parents would divorce. We didn´t talk much this day on and wouldn´t meet for another 3 weeks or so. She then asked to meet again and I knew what she would tell. I still had a little hope that we could fix our relationship, but mostly I knew she wanted to break up with me. So I accepted it rather silent (I´m a huge introvert and a bit of a misanthrop in a good way, if that makes sense) and just agreed to her that this wasn´t a relationship anymore. I contacted her every once in a while to check if she was good and such. I still have feelings for her, I have to admit, otherwise I wouldn´t write this wall of text rn. Fast forward to about now. I bought some tickets for a local event from her as she was selling them and we talked a bit. She didn´t seem to have thought about anything she did concerning us, I explained her my thoughts about us. We both know we can´t avoid each other, as we have nearly the same friends. I asked her if everything was ok between us and she replied ""yes, that stuff is in the past"". Right know she is treating my/our friends exactly like me in our relationship (not telling anything what is wrong/just being very repellent). Yesterday I called her and asked if we could meet again some time, to see if we would really ""be ok"" with each other. Her only answer was ""I don´t want to deal with you anymore""... Well, that escalated quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I need you help, if anyone still reads this confusing text:

I´m kind of cocky about this and want to ""pay back"" to her for the way she treats everybody around her, just so she realizes what kind of a rude person she has become. Mostly I don´t want her to be alone after going through this hard time, as more and more friends of her turn their back to her. She really needs to wake up imo and not be captured by her disease anymore because that´s why she suffers from it so badly as far as I can tell.

This is not an act of hatred or something, I just want her to wake up from her deslusional dream.

IF ANYBODY UNDERSTANDS MY PROBLEM, PLEASE JUST LEAVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS

I really appreciate you even reading the text, thanks.",22Feb2019,1

this has been going on for a long time.

But now he is in between jobs and trying to figure out his career and managing a stressful relationship with his father who is makes impulsive decisions. He’s been kinda depressed, negative, and lately been starting fights with me. It’s gotten to the point where I told him he needs to start taking care of himself and to be a better version of himself or I can’t be here anymore. I have to remind him to have basic hygiene and to change his clothes. I recommended he go to therapy to work on himself but he refuses and puts it off.
Now he started video game streaming and is planning on making it a full time gig for the time being. I have been nothing but supportive but I’m trying to get him to see the bigger picture.

I have been seeing a therapist and told her about our fights and some things that bother me in our relationship and she said that he most likely have ADHD. I did some research and it seems that the problems I have been experiencing are all common in ADHD couples.

498,"Hi everyone

I am a 23F. I have this stupid gaming/chat room app and i was bored so i was playing a game. This one guy (23M) started flirting with me and I was like oh what the hell. So we started chatting casually. Eventually we exchanged snapchats. 

We both live in the US but in different states. We started sexting pretty intense on snapchat with pictures. He said he has a business meeting in my state next month and that we could meet up. He never told me his last name and never showed me his full face. I only saw part of his face &amp; his small pic on the game chat. 

I got a bad feeling about this guy, so i took his first name (pretty uncommon) and city (he had told me the city) in Facebook and lo and behold. Married dude. I know it is him because there was a pic of his dog and the caption had the dogs name (I saw the dog on snapchat). 

The thing is also, he has a newborn. 

It all started to make sense. The generic username, the brand new snapchat account, never showing his face. But it was weird bc he would brag to me about how easy it is to cheat (although claiming to be single etc). He even casually mentioned wanting to have kids etc. 

I have not since spoken to him other than to test him. I told him ""lol youd probably still hook up with me even though youre going to be married"" and he said ""lol no im loyal"" (LOL). But before, he told me he wanted to hook up regardless if he was married or not. 

What should I do? I want to tell the wife because I think she deserves to know. But I have never met these people. I also do not know if this guy is dangerous. He knows my first name, age, and city. He does not know my last name. 

How could I go about this being safe? Should I just not bother saying anything and just block him? What if he hurts the wife. I never got proof or any reason to think he would be dangerous, but you really never know.

How do I avoid this? I drive an Audi and was thinking about changing over to a used/old car instead because I know my friends feel weird when they enter the car.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think I should do/stop doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any online guide or anything to being/acting like a normal person?

501,"Hey everyone, so my SO and I have been together for about 6 years now. We have been through ours ups and downs together and I might have ruined that last week, it's important to note that I'm her first bf and first person she has had sex with while I've had prior sexual experiences and dated other people. For the longest time I've always been worried about being her first bf because I've heard so many horror stories of people ending relationships to see if the ""grass is greener"" and I mentioned last week that I would be open to the idea of inviting other people into the bedroom. We've talked about it before and they seemed really open to the idea actually, we even were thinking of ways to go about it...but not much conversation came out from it after. However this past time, I guess I may have struck the wrong nerve because it feels as if my SO has completely shut down from talking about it. I said that it wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me if we didn't consider more sexual exploration, but I did say that it is possible and (totally okay IMO) to be bored with a sex life when you're with someone for so long. She keeps asking me if I'm happy with her and I 100% am, I guess it's just something I wanted to be on the same page before we ever go through another slump (we did about 2 years ago and almost ended our relationship over it). I wanted my partner to feel like they could be open in the future (she's said before that she's thought of having sex with other people) nstead of going behind my back. So I'm just lost, she hasn't really talked to me all day and I'm worried I definitely ruined my relationship. Has anyone else been in this situation that can offer some advice? Am I screwed?",22Feb2019,1

506,"I'm currently living in a house rental with five others, but due to a disagreement, I found it's best for me to leave. The only issue is that apartments are expensive here. I've been looking through the ones available and a two bedroom is $2,000-2,200 average. At the moment I only pay $550 for my room. I'm most likely teaming up with two others to look for a place but with split rent and the fact that I'd most likely be getting my own room in a two bedroom situation, my rent is looking to be $800-$900. There's a possibility it could be four of us teaming up; if that were the case we'd probably end up needing a three bedroom which pushes rent for an apartment to around 3 grand easily. Would it just be easier to stick with an apartment where everything is already included in bills (water, wifi, electricity) or just find another house to rent together?",22Feb2019,2

508,"Hi all. I really could use some solid advice. I'll give some background on my situation. I started dating my boyfriend my sophomore year of college. I was head over heels for him. Good looking guy, on the hockey team at my school, tall, in good shape, really funny personality, etc. Our relationship was great...until it wasn't. See, I suffer from OCD, anxiety, health anxiety and depression. I played soccer at my school and I ended up getting into a terrible situation with the coach and it really fucked up my college career. This made me super depressed and it really took a toll on our relationship (bf and I). Our senior year, I had to study abroad in Cuba for three weeks (from end of December to Jan.) Right before this was a nightmare of a time for me. I was stressed to the max with exams, I thought I was dying from cancer (health anxiety folks will get it), soccer wasn't going well and I would go cry to him every single night. This took a HUGE toll on our relationship. Not to mention, he was super controlling of some aspects of my life. He didn't understand he was being that way and I didn't communicate it with him but I was in such a dark pit, I didn't want to put anymore strain in my life.

I leave for Cuba and we were on decent terms. I had an anxiety attack before I went to Cuba. For reference, I'm Cuban-American and speak Spanish but I've never been there before without my family. I was going with a teacher and some classmates I hardly knew. It really freaked me out. While there, for the first week, I was still absolutely hell-bent on thinking I was dying. I made my roommate (bless  her soul for dealing with me) to legit check my eyes everyday to see if I had jaundice. Weird shit like that. About a week into the trip, we met some students from the University of Habana, who we would be spending time with. The first time we met them, we just walked around the Malecon and got some drinks at the Hotel Nacional. A few days later, we went to the beach with them. This time they brought another student from the university with them. We got along really well with the students, danced a ton with them, drank with them, etc. This new student ( we will call him Rafa for the heck of it), and I got along super well. He was cute, nice, very polite, very helpful and loved dancing salsa with me. The next day, Rafa and another student took a few of us girls to a baseball game. Afterwards, we went to los Espacios and danced with the damn night away. It was so much fun. Rafa and I decided to get each other's number and hang out the next night. I was very weary because I was super infatuated with him and felt like I could completely be myself with him but I didn't want to cheat on my boyfriend. We hung out and just talked and learned more about each other, played cards, danced bachata a bit and then he went home. As the days went on, I felt less and less for my boyfriend. I felt I had been held back a ton. I was  happy, doing things I loved to do, things I was never allowed to do with him. I hung out more with Rafa, we all went to clubs (uni students and us students) together, had parties together. Finally, the last day before we left, we saw the students. Before we were leaving Rafa kissed me. It made me so so happy. 

I got back to the US and immediately, like an asshole, broke up with my boyfriend. I had been thinking about it since the middle of the trip but I felt it was right at the time. I needed time to figure out who I was and do things that made me happy. I completely broke his heart and I felt terrible. I kept in touch with Rafa but it soon became difficult because of how infrequently we could talk. He was such a genuine guy. Always interested in hearing about my days, making me smile, told me I was his valentine and wrote me a super long, amazing message about it. He wanted me to come back so we could spend time together. He was aware he may never be able to leave Cuba and I may never be able live there but we had something really special. I gave him mi pulsera favorita the day before we left. I ended up missing my ex and we got back together and I ended things with Rafa. He was so hurt. I felt terrible. I still do to this day. My ex, now bf, found out he kissed me and we danced together. He was hurt and held it against me for so long. I do love my boyfriend, I see us having a future together... but at the same time I don't. We fight a lot. I still feel controlled sometimes. I can't do anything resembling MY OWN culture around him bc it reminds him of that terrible time. I've dragged two guys through the fucking mud while I was trying to find my way out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is now: It's been a year. I miss Rafa. I miss Cuba. I miss being able to freely indulge in my culture, speak my language, listen to my latino music around my boyfriend.  I love my boyfriend but sometimes I wonder if I can see the light at the end of the tunnel for us. I don't know if I can. I don't know if I can give it all up. I recently saw a picture of Rafa from December and he was still wearing the bracelet. Then I saw more pictures throughout the last year and he was wearing the bracelet in every picture. Could it be for style? Maybe. But at the same time, it has a moon hanging off of it so it's slightly girly lol. Do  you think he wears it because he still cares for me? Misses me? I want to get into contact with him but Idk how to. I'm scared he hates me for hurting him. I blocked his number and deleted it awhile ago. What do I do about my relationship? I'm just so lost. I plan on returning to Cuba in December with my best friend  but I can't do that if I'm still dating my boyfriend. When I'm there, I would love to see Rafa. I hate this. ",22Feb2019,1

510,So this might get kinda ranty sorry in advanced. Little back story here first. Mom is pretty controlling and manipulative so we don’t have the best relationship but I love her. Im not close to really any of my siblings. High school wasn’t the best for me. I wasn’t bullied or anything I just lacked serious self confidence. Met a girl I liked and she led me down a bad road. Drugs alcohol that sort of fun stuff at 14/15 years old. Now I have a really close knit group of friends there’s about 6 of us that have known each other for our entire lives but two of them saved my life. They talked to me and let me know I was fucking up. Semi got my shit together enough to graduate high school but gpa wasn’t anywhere near good enough for college and I was done with school. I joined the military as a combat medic and pretty quickly found myself deployed to Iraq. I was happy because it’s what I wanted. I was fucked up when I joined and was honestly hoping I died over there. It was a win win in my book man I got to get out of this shot life and the government pays my family 400k. Well got back from deployment and made some less than smart decisions and now I’m on my way out after 4 years and have nothing to show me it. I fought my own legal battle for a year and ultimately lost. I never told my family anything that happened because I honestly thought all charges were getting dropping and so did my lawyer. For the past 3 weeks my depression as never been lower. Everyday I drink myself to sleep or I’ll just lay in bed thinking about everything I’ve fucked up. I honestly think about just ending it but I know it would hurt my friends and family too much so I just sit here day in and day out in misery hoping one day I’ll get everything in order for good ,22Feb2019,1

So we basically have talked about all the ordeals we encounter in this period of time and we have ea ch other's back. In the very beginning of this friendship, we were both extremely polite to each other and as time went by, we were much more familiar and talked about a lot of really private stuff like masturbation and family relationships. We always make fun with each other as well.

Well, so the flirting(perhaps) starts this year i guess. Sometimes he would ask if i missed him, my answer was an absolute no. What followed next was him saying ""but i miss you"". 

When i mentioned i wanted my old friend(female) to be my hall mate next year, he would answer""i wanna be your hall mate"".

We play mobile games together and sometimes i can't bring up the voice chat. He would then be sad and say""but i really wanna listen to your voice.""

We’ve been close friends for a good while now and always found a chance to hang out after/before school and throughout the week. Basically a Harry, Ron, Hermione dynamic.

However, we haven’t hung out or talked all that much in a little over three months now. I try to initiate and make plans but my friends are either usually busy or cancel at the last minute. 

I stopped asking since I started noticing the trend early on but last night, both of them wanted to see if I was free this week to hangout...come to find out they initiated because they wanted something from me. It really hurt my self-esteem and this is the first time I’m really experiencing something like this. 

An important thing to note is that they have been going through life changes recently and are figuring themselves out. I try to put myself in their shoes and look at things from their perspective, but I still can’t shake the feeling of something isn’t right. 

On their end, they have one another and don’t need that much company anymore, but I’m more of a let’s hang out anytime kind of person. Even at my busiest, I still tried to maintain my social life. But for them, it seems like the opposite. I do have other friends, but these guys in particular are/were? my close friends.

Do I confront them about it? Do I just distance myself even more? I’m not confrontational, no matter how much I wish I was. 

My ideal response would be to outright call them out and say that what they asked really rubbed me the wrong way for the reasons above, but I’m not quite sure that that’s the best option. The more comfortable response is to be a little petty and start being as equally as “busy” as they were and refuse to help them.

I'm 27 and currently living with my mum, I get paid well in my job with no debt or struggles. My mum is a relapsing alcohol what I mean by this is that she will go clean for 1-3months and then an event will happen be it a holiday like Christmas or a birthday party and then she will drink every day non stop for between a week and 2 months.

This is becoming such a drain on me, and my family, 2 sisters and 2 nieces.

I currently pay my mum rent it's actually the mortgage payment each month and I know obviously she needs it which isn't a problem.

What is hard is that when she is drinking that's all she does she then turns it around on me saying I'm causing her stress etc she then tells me to leave the house and move out.

Now annoyingly i can do this, move out that is and for the past 2 weeks I haven't been living there.

She has just texted me asking if I have transferred her, her ""rent"" which I did anyway as its on a standing order. 

I have come home today and she is currently in bed with around 6 wine bottles in her room drunk.

Ive picked up my dog and taken him for a walk, contemplating what to do, this is becoming too much for me, but if I leave and move she'll lose the house and there is no way in hell she will give the house over to me.

 when she is drunk I'm constantly worrying silly things like, what if I wake up and she has disappeared or, she's tried to od (these things have happened before) so I'm barely sleeping. 

What's even more frustrating is that when she is sober she is lovely but she really doesn't understand her problem, as they say an alcoholic will never admit they have a problem and when you talk to her about it she just fobs you off. This has been going on since I was 6, so a good 20 years.

L is 12 
A is 13

I am currently 15 turning 16 in June. My step brother is 11 years old and will be 12 in May and is transgender and has been since he was 3 years old. Because of this he has ran into some uncomfortable situations when he tells close friends. I will refer to him as K. K told one his close friends L, we recently had a new student join and on the first day whose name is A. L told A that K is transgender and is physically a girl but mentally a boy and wants to be a boy. 

Me and A became friends instantly as it's a small school with only 25 kids. Me and A got to talking and it got deep. She told me she wears hair extensions and that she was adopted. A brought up K and said how annoying he is (he likes to speak in a British accent sometimes) A mentioned something L told A about K and said she couldn't say. I already knew exactly A was talking about. I was mad that L told A when K trusted L. She told me how on the first day L sent a text message to A saying how K is trans. I stayed calm and asked her not to tell anyone that she knows or worse not to call him by the wrong pro noun. 

I am mad at L. K trusted L and L betrayed him by being so open about it. I understand they are young but K trusted L not to say anything to anyone about this which she did for an entire year until A came around.

533,"So, our company has gone through some massive restructures recently. I previously grew to hate my old role and wanted to leave/change roles.

I have the option now, but feel like I'm being kind of a burden as I keep being given random interim tasks to do while I try to study to get into another field within the company. (though the company can't help mentor me too much, so I'm on my own)

The tasks I've been given aren't to my liking and I struggle to do then well. As such the company keep giving me other stuff to do. It's left me feeling disorientated and confused, as they keep suggesting different roles relating to the field I want to go into (code). As such, I keep having to change my area of study, while doing tasks I don't rightly enjoy.

Should I just suck it up, do the temporary roles I dislike and continue to learn in my spare time?

If so, how do I force myself to do this role I dislike well, while trying to keep my eyes on an ever changing goal?

 Just as I started to gather an emergency fund I see myself being forced to take away money off of it just to get by. I wanted to make that first step snd save up an emergency fund, then get myself in investing in stocks or something aside from workung, yet I've never felt safe enough financially to do that.

I am in a situation where I am taking a class I hate. This is not my major class it is a general education requirement for the university, however, there is another class I can take in summer or next semester.

I mean the problem is university chose this course for me, I did not have the choice there. When I realized I would give up everything not to take this course, the drop deadline was gone :( .

My GPA is like 3.90 and if I choose not to go to this class and get an F, GPA will drop to 3.81, considering I get all A's in other classes which is a strong possibility because I am a hard worker for classes I care about. 

I am kinda lost, sometimes I tell myself ""I can do this, this is the last GE class you are required to take, just do it, this last time!"" and sometimes ""Screw this(losing 0.1 of GPA over nothing), I won't take it, I won't risk under-performing in classes I care about""... You get the point

545,"I was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside;

548,"So, I'm 19 (about to be 20 in April), I dropped out of college due to mental health issues in May 2018 (somehow survived a full year in college), and since August I've been staying with my parents. Nothing was the issue but I did fall into a pretty deep depression and didn't start to actively look for a job till January (last month) and was able to snag a pretty decent job, fairly quickly. By my third week, I was contacted by a past friend who I thought was still a good friend to me but when it came to my sister and mom, that's a whole other story. 

So this friend had the most fucked up child and teenage home life that I've seen to date. She acted childishly in her teens bc she was robbed of that feeling when she was a child, I understood that from the get go. My sister and mom sorta understood that and got along very well with her. My family was very close with her and she was constantly a character at our household. Towards the time period before I went off to college, she started to be slightly manipulative towards my sister, and her actions when we went out were also pretty obvious manipulation, i.e. to wait staff and workers in clothing stores. My mom hated people who did what she had been doing and tried talking to her and my mom, before all this started to pile up, was practically a second mom to her and the friend typically listened to my moms advice. Though, at this point, I believe my friend had stopped caring and started to walk all over my mom, who can be a slight push over but is very blunt. When my mom saw this, she confronted her about it and got into an argument. AN argument so big that I was told to block her number and not be in contact with her. \*Note, I severely suppressed memories leading up to my departure for college and I don't remember much of the summer, nor my first semester at school, so I have to constantly ask why it was such a big blow up and my mom and sister always just say, ""she's manipulative and trashy, you shouldn't trust her.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, the story that leads up to my advice:

This friend contacted me after watching a video i posted, where i commented about how i was suppose to be in D.C. in May to live there but since my depression dipped me pretty low when I moved back in with my parents, those plans were cancelled due to money not being there. 

Her message pretty much goes like this (sparknotes 'cause it was a lot): Hey, i saw your video and i completely understand where you're coming from. The feeling of not being able to do anything while being depressed is so shitty. Gives an update on her life and she tells me how she's now married, stay at home dog-mom and is financially at peace. Then proceeds to offer me a room in her soon to be D.C. apartment that she is moving into in May and it's rent free and i don't have to pay utilities or anything! That she'll be in that apt for a year and I can come live and leave there when ever in that year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in fucking heaven! I have this 1 in a 1,000,000 opportunity and I just know right away my answer is going to be yes. But before I respond i FT my mom and sister together and i read out the whole message to them and I told them both to respond in a personal and non personal way. Meaning, first think about yourself in this situation and  then think about me, and all the shit I've been through with staying in our hometown. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their response as follows:

sister: ""you know how I feel about her and how she is very manipulative but I get how this might be for you bc you were closer with her and understood her more.""

mom: ""well the mama bear in me doesn't want to see you get hurt by her again (me: I have no idea if i was hurt by her actions towards my family or not bc I seriously can't remember shit from then) but I know how much this means to you. I would have to talk to her.""

&amp;#x200B;

Ok yea, fair enough. I get off the call and i respond saying I would have to think about it (no i wouldn't) and that she'd have to talk to mom and sister and i give her their numbers to contact them. Within that week, she messaged them and neither my mom or sister have gotten back to her. (This happened Jan 23 and its now Feb 22) I'm frustrated at this point and have started to just point blank say that after my sisters college graduation, that I will in fact, be leaving. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to have this proper adult conversation with my parents without being shut down by them. My dad is saying he doesn't want me to go bc he deadass came to the conclusion that I would be staying at home till I get married...................yea not happening dad. Sorry, not sorry. My mom won't talk about it with me and will try and spin the convo into a mental health conversation and I don't even bother getting my sisters input at this point bc she's just being a raging bitch about it.

553,"Heya folks. First time posting in this subreddit. I know this may sound like an immature/stupid question, but I'm having some trouble emotion-wise and it's been affecting my schoolwork. I'm currently a college student and have been heavily focusing on getting my my life back in order. My dad has a PhD in Business Philosophy and my mom is working towards hers in Psychology. Both of them are incredibly smart and are the biggest role models in my life. My dad owns and runs around five businesses as well contracted with the Department of Homeland Security. In the last two years, my older brother ended up accruing quite the debt from both reckless purchases as well as failing a whole ton of college classes and ultimately dropped out and is still living with us but will be getting kicked out very soon. I had (up until these last two years) very good grades because my parents were always very adamant on that we wouldn't be able to fulfill our lives fully without a college degree. However, in my last year of high school, I burnt out. Hard. I mean close to stop trying completely, and it cost me my enrollment into a four year college.

After two years of struggling with school and my job, I finally feel like my life is getting back on track. Because I wasted so much money on classes ( failed one and got D's in three others) my parents decided that I and my older brother will be paying $600 in rent until we move out/get our GPAs to a good level. My grades are definitely doing better and my GPA is slowly getting back to a good level. However, I'm left feeling very tired. Even now I still find it hard to muster up the motivation to do my work at school. On a day to day level, I feel... empty. Not happy, but not sad. I don't get the kick out of my hobbies like I used to and talking with friends feels more like a chore than fun. I don't have any desire to do well in school, but more like I would rather go to school than pick up a third job. I get the feeling that my parents have given up on my older brother and are now expecting me to raise above the bar and succeed where he failed. Sometimes, I'll just get this huge wave of bad vibes. I'll get really... sad straight outta nowhere, maybe even cry a bit, but when it's over I feel lighter.

Point is, I feel like an empty jar. Thinking of the times of I had in high school with my buds or my first crush makes me envious of my past self. Why can't I feel as happy as back then? Why don't I feel happy now? Why don't I feel anything now? Am I just being a teenager? The past two years have really sucked for me and my family. My grandma got breast cancer. My other grandma  has stage IV cancer and won't live to see another two years. This past october, I was diagnosed with a Macroadenoma, a brain tumor that is located near my pituitary gland. About the size of my eyeball. Already talked to the doctor about how it could affect me emotionally, said that it wouldn't. Treatment for it is probably the best it could get, and for that I am thankful. Sorry for jumping around on topics, just trying to shrink the wall of text. Feel free to ask any questions.

557,"First and foremost, I hate this place and I am in the process of getting out, but I still need a job. Also, I work at a small business with five coworkers and two bosses. No HR.

I found out last year from a coworker that everyone got bonuses in 2016 and 2017 at this Christmas dinner thing my bosses usually do after work. I am never thrilled to attend, but in 2016 and 2017, I couldn't go because my wife had class and I had to get home to take care of the dog (he's cooped up all day). I found out I didn't get my bonus. I confronted my one boss who handles finances and he blew me off. Communication here sucks... So from then on (I know it's petty) I decided I wasn't going to greet them anymore, but understandably it caused tension. I've been doing that for almost a year. Hoping I'd get out soon, matters back home took a nosedive (long story), and we spent the entirety of 2018 selling our home and moving. Sadly there was no Christmas thing in 2018 because a coworker was hospitalized for three months and I'm still here covering for her because she's the only good person here.

Anyway, I do graphic design here and I'm a photographer on the side. I always bring my camera. I have taken pictures of products with my personal camera here to speed up my work. Every year around this time, my workload increases, as I create trade show materiel. My other boss asked me to shoot a product for him. I want to refuse on principle. Does this sound good, or should I just suck it up and keep my head down til I get out?

&gt;I will take pictures for you, but because I didn’t receive my bonus when everyone else did for the past few years, I think it’s fair for me to not use my personal camera or phone for this service. Camera maintenance is not cheap and I already spend $50 per month on the design software I use here. I’d hate to make it about money and all that, but I hope you understand where I’m coming from. 

TL:DR I work at a small company. I found out I didn't get my bonus when everyone else did. I do graphic design and shoot product photos with my personal camera when needed, but no longer want to after learning of this bonus issue. My boss is expecting photos for a trade show thing, but I feel sick using my camera when he couldn't care less about me.",22Feb2019,1

I wasn't friends with B before last semester and we started talking when she told me how 'torturous' her roomates were. She told me how they would constantly judge her, use her stuff without asking and be mean to her on purposes. I felt bad and told her she could stay at my house for the two month vacation and then we can move to another room when the college begins again. We both moved in with A the following semester. 

It was going well for a while till like a month ago when B started emulating everything I did academically, she joined the same classes I did, she even approached the same professors I did and she went to the same personal tutor for french I did. 

Then her ex-roomates got drunk, came to the room and started crying and then they were magically fine. B started being mean and was never in the room and I felt betrayed. 

(I recently got a new plant for my desk) 

And today I heard them bitching about me because they thought I was sleeping.

A: She anyways doesn't understand shit about anything
B: I told her if she could keep the plant alive for a year I'll consider you responsible
A: I feel so had for the plant, that's not fair

564,"Hello there,

“I’m self-conscious”, “I just don’t know how”, “short of sleep”, “don’t have enough time”, “have no energy left from work”, ""just my genetics"", ""I hate how I look and feel"" …etc. These are some common thoughts/feelings keeping people from staying consistent at the gym. 

What if there’s a way to resolve these roadblocks and be positively encouraged and motivated towards our fitness goals?

I am currently conducting a case study on fitness mindset and motivation, aiming to help others gain clarity and possibly motivation towards their fitness goals.

Please share your thoughts, troubles, and advice. 

If you're interested to share your thoughts in person, heart-2-heart, I would really like to connect with you!

565,"So, some background. I'm 19. I've been really shy and quiet my whole life up until now. I used to put on a generic persona to keep away from attention. Recently I've forced myself to come out of my shell and be the real me. At my part time job someone was talking about how communication at work is important, and another person said ""\[chiefbanditofrito\] thinks communication is about always talking and never shutting up!"". Another time this same person said to someone else in front of me that I was annoying. A different coworker drew a picture of Donald Duck's head and pointed at it, saying ""Look! I'm \[chiefbanditofrito\]! Squawk squawk!"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of their tone of voice at time etc. it seemed like playful teasing except for when I was called annoying which I wasn't so sure about. These same people have normal conversations with me and will walk over to talk to me sometimes so they can't find me that bad. I can be loud and silly at times but I would hope it wouldn't be a huge negative at my age. Don't get me wrong though, I respect people's space/feelings and if I got the feeling I was genuinely pissing someone off I'd back off promptly. Do you have friends who you can find loud and annoying? Is it a deal-breaker for making friends?",22Feb2019,1

Well I just got sent home right at the end because my ""leadership"" grades didn't make the cut. They tossed my ass on a plane home. Embarrassing as hell because my whole  family was rooting for me and super proud.

568,"Two years ago, I decided to create another identity. This was done as I felt life is too short and I wanted to view the world from different people's perceptive, so I made another life. Over the two years this identity, who I'm going to call Selina developed her own likes, dislikes, friends and overall personality. Selina has become a completely different person, to the extent of us sharing a body.

Now the problem is that I feel she has become too independent, affecting my own decisions and taking control at random points.  Yet I don't have any personality disorders (as far as I know) so I don't know why or how she is taking control. Originally I was the one in charge, acting as her, although she has become more that an act. The thing that scares me the most is that when she is in charge I can see what see is doing, but I can't do anything anymore.

I'm afraid that one day she will take full control or worse, do something bad. This may be me just being paranoid and she won't do anything but I can't help and fear. No one in her life, or mine knows about us. What should I do?",22Feb2019,2

I'm currently living at home with my mother and two brothers. My middle brother (I am the youngest) has invited to stay some random old man he knows, and failed to tell any of us he was coming.

Apparently he is here until Sunday (according to my mother, im not sure if she knew he was coming). I am worried this man will be here much longer. He is very old, probably 70+, and seems to have some kind of speech disability (perhaps an unfair assessment but he could have some learning disabilities).

For what it's worth my brother is 26.... 

What do i do? What if he doesn't leave? I am sure this looks like I am overreacting but my brother is 100% the kind to invite someone to live with us despite not even asking the rest of the family. We would obviously had said no. Why doesn't this man pay for a room somewhere if he wanted to visit?

Maybe it's rude but I have zero interest in interacting with this guy. Quite frankly I want him gone asap.

570,"My boyfriend of 3 years has allowed our sex life to go to shit. We get intimate maybe once every two weeks (mind you we LIVE together). He won't go down on me (did it all the time in the beginning) but always expects a bj. He lasts about 1 minute in bed, then won't go for round 2, and won't even go again later in the day. He starts playing video games like an hour before I go to sleep so that's why it's so rare, like wtf???

I know I just absolutely dragged him, but I am so in love with him I don't want our amazing relationship to end because of our awful sex life.

BUT, I have had very emotional talks with him about how it makes me feel insecure and shitty, and why it makes me so sad that he always wants his needs met, but even when that rare time comes, he does not care about satisfying me at all. He always says he doesn't know why it's happened but he's never going to let it happen again. No matter how many talks there are, there is just no improvement. 

I have been struggling with this for so long. When I was satisfied in all aspects during the first 2 years of our relationship, we never had a single doubt in each other. It was such a healthy and trusting relationship. Now, I can start to see the doubts, and I know why. I have been tempted to get satisfied outside of us on my own and not tell him, but I am in a rut. I don't want to cheat but I don't want to have to end what we have built.

573,"So this is such a long story but I will do my best to shorten it. Anyways, my friend married a woman from Mexico (he's Mexican himself also). He had a kid with her but he went back to the states to try and sponsor her for citizenship. He told me they were in an open marriage and I could sleep with his wife whenever I'd like. Puzzled at this, I told him I had no interest in doing so. Fast forward a few years and he bring her here to states to initiate the citizenship process. We first became friends and then she started coming on to me in a very obvious fashion. I was concerned about this and wanted to tell my friend about it. All I asked him was how his marriage was doing? he started freaking out and saying things like ""why!? is she talking shit on me!?"" and I told him to calm down as it was just a casual question. I knew having a rational conversation was not possible and dropped the subject, still under the impression he had an open marriage.We started talking more and she would tell me about how irresponsible my friend was, like him taking nearly 2 years to initiate the process and her having to work and raise the kid by herself down there. She told me she was frustrated how he let himself go, didn't even have a car, and even began to physically abuse their kid. We eventually started talking more and became closer. She then started doing the sweetest things for me. Eventually after resisting for months, I broke and started getting physical with her. This went on secretly for around 3-4 months. It seemed very obvious and I though my friend knew about it and didn't care with his whole open marriage thing. I brought up his marriage again, hoping to have a rational conversation in which I finally did. I asked him if he still had an open marriage , in which he said he doesn't want to do that anymore. At this point, I was thinking ""uh-oh""; so I said ok and dropped the subject. I wanted to stop but by this time I was in way deep both physical and lovewise. We tried to quit but we couldn't since we became so attached. Eventually we had an argument unrelated to that and she broke up with me and said she wanted to fix things with my friend again. About two weeks later we were hangin out again and it led to a kiss which brought us back together. It was then me who said we really should stop this and she should try and fix her marriage with my friend. This on and off thing went for about 3 more months till it's finally in the current state it's in now. No woman has ever treated me so well in my entire life, but I don't want to backstab my friend either. So here's what I'd like to do: I want to make sure she gives it one last chance to fix her marriage with my friend. During this time I want to get back in to the dating scene as well. If after a few years she ends up divorcing my friend and I still haven't found the right one, we could potentially get back together. It's so hard for us to be ""just friends"" though right now after what happened. However, I don't want to lose her completely either :(

&amp;nbsp;


Here's where I need help: My friend is going back to his old ways and it frustrates me as I feel he doesn't deserve her. Yet, he never did anything TO ME so I refuse to backstab him. Good friend, bad husband imo. She is giving it the best shot with him and making the effort and she will have her green card likely in the next few months. What would be the best way to keep a healthy distance from her so my friend can do his best to fix his marriage? but yet, not make her to feel as if I've completely forgotten about her on romantic level. please help

578,"I (25f) am preparing for a big exam which falls just in 2 months. I belong to a very conservative Indian family. My parents have a lot of hopes resting on me in terms of career. Like any traditional Indian parents, I too was not expected to have a bf (31m)
But I do and he wants us to get married. 
He wanted to meet my parents and has been telling me to make me get him to meet my dad asap. My dad as I mentioned is very conservative and didn’t let me be out with boys so it will be a shock for him. 
Plus I do have curfew at home, I live with my parents who are pretty strict. 
I have been planning to get a job after this big exam of mine and asked my bf if he could wait some months so even if my dad lashed out on me and gets completely angry I would be then done with my exam and can easily look for job and move out and then live with him. 
I have already told my mom about my bf and he met her. 
My bf has also changed jobs and stated at bigger level with less income- another reason why I want to push it for later so he has some stable income before things go further and if I have to move in with him I won’t be a burden to him. 
I also want my dad to not assume that the time I should have spent to prepare for my big exam I was out there wasting time, mingling and doing things that will ruin my career. That is one of the things I am afraid which could happen. As I have been told a year back in uni that I should focus on studies rather than boys when my dad saw me with a guy classmate. 
So I don’t want him (dad) to just shut us out completely and ruin the chances of a good impression of my bf. Plus my dad has a habit of taunting and when he doesn’t approve of my actions he taunts which hurts me to the core and I get so affected I can’t get out of it for weeks which could affect the studies.
I have a history of depression as well and I want to postpone the meeting with my dad pry for 2 months till my exams are over and till when my bf is fairly stable in the new environment. 
Now the problem is my bf just told me that I am being selfish and I am thinking only about myself and not about his feelings and wants. 
He said he doesn’t care about what my dad says and is okay if he says no- so he can chart his own plan how to handle things from there if there is a no- for marriage. 
Also his parents and friends who are all married have been pushing been pushing him asking when will he be married as he tells me his mom asks everyday. Which makes me wonder is he doing it just because he is bein g pressured or by himself. 
He is not financially stable and also borrows money from me which are my saving and doesn’t want to give me any answers on how will we work as a family. 
He tells me that we will see what happens when it happens which freaks me out because I am a very planned person. 
He says this same thing even for the meeting with my dad. He says he just wants peace of mind and wants a quick answer and can’t wait any longer and calls me selfish. 
In Indian culture it’s seen as something is wrong with a guy if he is not married by age 30. Although he says it’s not it, but I have a feeling he is rushing in too fast. He says he needs to be married before he is 32. 
He keeps telling me I am ruining his life by making it late and he only started talking to me about our marriage 4 months back when he came back from his friends wedding. 
I really don’t understand what to do. I love this guy, he has always been there for me and always encouraged me to pursue my dreams and go after my career and now all of a sudden he is telling me to get married to him. I don’t have a job yet. He seems angry and annoyed all the time and I know it’s the marriage issue. 
But deep down, I don’t know if we or him are ready for marriage. He has some debt and still borrows money from me. He has no savings. Has also borrowed some money from friends. He wants me to get a job in any field that I can do I can provide for our house. I have been preparing for my big exam which will help me land a good job but that is not a concern for him right now. 
I don’t understand. He never talks about how we will handle our finances or if we have children how will we provide for them. Just tells me I think too much and he will see what to do when time comes. 
I really love him and I don’t want to hurt him and I also want to get married to him as soon as I could. I only asked for 2 months. 

Am I being selfish. Should I be looking at this from some other perspective that I am missing? Am I the bad person in this? Am I overthinking the marriage? AITA for not caring about his feeling? Should I just get married and think about the other things later as they come along because let’s face it you can’t control the outcomes always? 
Any advice would be appreciated! ",22Feb2019,2

I KNOW he has a past, we aren’t young enough to not have a past, so why do I struggle like this and what can I do to alleviate this? It’s going to end up ruining our relationship if I can’t get a hold of this issue. I’m on medication which helps my symptoms but the jealousy never changes.

Just a disclaimer, i'll be talking about one of my biggest troubles and set backs that has bothered me since i could remember, so I would love any of the help i could get.

Recently over the past 2 or 3 years, I have had thing one thing that was constantly on my mind, stuttering. It was a problem ever since i learned how to speak. A long time ago (probably preschool through first grade) i took speech therapy at my school that my mom signed me up for. I had no clue what the purpose was at the time but i really wish i did. Then i stopped for a few years and then went back for a few classes around when i first started intermediate school. After a few of those classes i didn't know why i was even in that room with someone teaching me how to speak when i could do that perfectly fine on my own! I convinced my mom out of it and I have regretted it ever since. Im now half way through 8th grade and its been more of a trouble than ever. Over the years, its slowly gotten better yet its still noticeable. I have troubles on a few certain letters or sounds: W, y, m, h, and a few more. Ive came to a conclusion that i have trouble making sounds from the back of throat and the tip of my lips. If anyone has any advice on exercises or techniques to slowly wear away it it id be overjoyed to ever hear back from anyone. Ive been working up the courage to ask my parents to go back and do speech therapy and i think they would be accepting of it too. Ive talked to friends about it and they are all very supportive of whatever i decide to do. I just dont want to be like this forever. I have watched videos and done exercises, some working and some not, but feel free to ask questions because theres lots more which i just didnt put into this post.

*tl;dr I met my ideal woman but I'm not sure if I should marry her or keep looking behind her back*

So I'm 22 and I've been trying to get a wife since I was 17. However I was always unsuccessful until now due to being too young / actually having standards / being a bit of pshyco. Anyway about 6 months ago my mum set me up with the girl, let's just call her Amy. Amy was randomly selected out of a bunch of girls mum had in mind for me. We started dating, hit it off like a house on fire and were supposed to be getting engaged 3 months ago but I broke it off.

I felt like Amy's body wasn't up to scratch and also I wanted to see all the other girls on that list for comparison. We broke up and got back together a few times in that space of time and it's been an emotional roller coaster for the both of us. All the other girls on that list either weren't available or had things wrong with them. I went out with another girl briefly and left her for not being hot enough / being a former fatty.

Also Amy ended up looking amazing (8.5/10) and she agreed that in the future I could have another wife if I wanted to. So when I'm 40 and she's hit the wall I can go out and get another one. I went out with her one time and noticed how I'd only seen about 4-5 girls hotter than her after spending a whole day out in London and I told her I was sure about marrying her. She told me that she was getting sick of the situation and was about to leave because it wasn't getting anywhere.

So now I've got this hot women who's fixed everything that was wrong with her who's ready to marry me. I've already told her I'm sure about her. I think she's my ideal woman and we get along well and understand each other. Everyone I tell this story to (family / therapists) say I should just marry Amy. But I'm finding it hard to settle with her and I'm still debating whether or not I should go to the Muslim speed dating event on Sunday in the hopes that I might find a white 18 yo model looking girl (and risk Amy finding out and messing up our relationship).

So questions

1. Should I got to that speed dating thing?
2. Why am I worried about committing to Amy when she's perfect now?

Please note: We are still platonic at this point and marriage means spiritual marriage not legal marriage.",22Feb2019,0

585,"We started dating \~11 months ago. I'm 27, she's early 30s. She has mentioned previously that her ex and her broke up because he was way too focused on his career and kids were not his top priority. She goes on and on and on about how she's always wanted to have 2 kids, and that I would be a great dad.

I've made it pretty clear since the very beginning that I'm not interested in having children in the next 5 years. I'm young and I'm very successful at my career. My salary is in the top 1% in the U.S. and I want to use that to enjoy my 20s and early 30s without the financial burden of 1 or 2 kids. I want to travel, to party, to go out, to explore. If I can enjoy my life for a few years without that added responsibility, why rush it? Hell, even if I get to 40 without kids, it's still a pretty good age to become a father!

She just doesn't accept that. Tried to break up with her more than once, but she always comes back apologizing and saying that she loves me and she just wants to be with me. Then everything is good until she has the next freakout. I'm tired of this.

On Wednesday we had a huge fight again because she was trying to get me to have unprotected sex with her, and when I refused she started crying and telling me that I'm wasting her time. She stormed off, we haven't texted or talked for all of Thursday, and then she starts texting me again today saying that she just wants a hug, and that she feels lonely.

What. The. Fuck.

Another thing that worries me is that she has on many occasions said how she admires me because I'm young and so financially stable. She also mentioned that she always wanted to quit her job and try to start a company or some other business, and that having 1 stable parent is so great.

This totally freaks me out. Sounds to me like she's obsessed with getting pregnant to lock me down and then she will quit her job and leave me to pay all the bills + support the kid while she tries to start some business for which she has no plans, no concrete ideas, and as such will likely fail.

596,"[I’m very sorry for my grammar and spelling] 

I (everyone mentioned is 18) don’t like parties and stuff like that that much. I do go sometimes but i don’t like to dance or talk to other people. Which makes me an introvert. Nevertheless I usually have no problems to make new friends expect for the part that I am very picky no matter what. 

Its my 4th. out of five years on this school and i get along with my hole class. I have even moved in a flat with one girl to make live easier for both of us and it works out great. I became friends with her quite quick when school started. 

But she is not the one i was thinking about. There is an other girl in class. In my eyes she is smart and has a good sense of humor which i always liked on her for the past years. We sit next to each other in Class and talk every day, sometimes more and sometimes less. I never really thought of wanting more than that but this year she seems a little bit more open to conversations and all that stuff towards me and others. That made me gain more interest in her as usual and i would like to see her more often. It is amd has always difficult for me to interpret usually everything to be honest. Which means i don’t know what to respond to every message. And i can’t tell if she likes me the way i do. Of course I could just ask her but i don’t think that we have done that much together for that to not get strange. And i really dont want to screw this since i really like her and we still have a year of school left. Which would make times in class hard and unpleasant for both of us. We do hang around sometimes like today. And we talk about a lot of different topics. But i am at that point where i don’t know if we could be more than friends. 

That said i would appreciate some opinions or advice on what to expect or what to do. 

ps. my school is like 2h away from home which made me loose a lot of friends and being the person i am i don’t really have anyone to talk to about something like that in real life

597,"My dad recently got out of prison,  and I am one of the few people I'm his life willing and able to help him get back on his feet.  Emotionally speaking,  I believe I'm the only person he has to confide in.  He and my mom divorced years ago and have  just recently gone back on speaking terms. 

He's never had a great relationship with my brother, and since I was a teen he's always vented to me about him as well as my mom. I really feel there is an unhealthy parent-child dynamic between us.

But now that he's out of prison and having all these struggles looking for a job, plus living on his own with no people to talk to like he did in prison, plus having lady problems, plus other stressors, and he still wants to vent to me about EVERYTHING.  He doesn't have much of a filter and obviously no sense of boundaries. It's making me so uncomfortable!! Today he was in tears on the phone with me because he is upset that things aren't working out with his long distance girlfriend but he is desperate for a physical relationship. Come on dad, you are talking to your daughter! I don't want to think about you having sex!!!  I'm not even very comfortable talking about him dating at all,  much less sex. I would totally have pushed back if he were not cryingat the time....  I don't know,  am I being too nice? 

The reason I am hesitant to lay down my boundaries is, I feel like I'm all he has.  He clearly NEEDS a friend to talk about all this to. Otherwise, he gets so lonely and depressed...  I'm sort of afraid he might hurt himself. 

What do I do? How can I establish boundaries at this point? Is there a way I can help him without talking bad about my brother, or having any more TMI situations? ",22Feb2019,2

I don't mind the odd person over but she's really pushing it. She also lets them hang out in the house even when she's not around. She hasn't so much as hoovered in over 3 months, I've been doing all the cleaning. I could go on, sadly.

The obvious solution here would be to talk to her, right? I've tried twice now. The first time I told her she was doing something I didn't like she just insulted me and told me that I was a terrible person and, honestly, it left me crying. I tried once more recently because she pushed it again and the same thing happened. She doesn't address the comment I make, just verbally attacks me and makes me feel horrible until I drop it.

I'm just at my wits' end. My anxiety is through the roof, I'm scared of doing or saying anything in the house in case she turns on me again and the strangers always in the house isn't helping either. I'm scared of how this is affecting me mentally because after a stressful day at work I just come home to more stress.

610,"How do people do everything they’re supposed to do? All I can really accomplish each day is to go to work. Here are all the habits I have been meaning to form for years (I’m 28): 

-grocery shopping regularly 
-cooking/eating healthy/lose weight 
-exercise
-hydrating
-laundry regularly 
-cleaning the apartment regularly (dishes, vacuuming, taking trash out, cleaning bathroom, etc)
-checking the mail
-responding to texts/emails on time 
-flossing
-showering more than 2x a week
-paying bills on time
-cleaning the cat litter 
-quit smoking cigarettes
-grow savings account 
-get a credit card
-get regular haircuts 
-clean my car

-make time for family 
-go to the doctor/dentist 
-probably more that I’m forgetting

I want to give as accurate a picture of myself/my life as I can, so here is some context. I’m generally considered to be functioning. I’m really really good at my job. I have diagnosed depression/anxiety, which peaked during 2011-2014 and has vastly improved since 2017-ish. I am a caretaker by profession, and in my personal life am basically primary emotional support for several friends with mental illness (more severe than mine, at this point in time). But I really don’t know how to fit all that responsible-adult stuff into my day while still enjoying life, and it causes a lot of stress. 

A normal day for me looks like this: 
6 am wake up. Smoke and go on my phone. Get ready for work. Work. Come home. Smoke and go on my phone, or chat with a friend if they come over. Make a microwave meal or order food. Watch one tv show during dinner, fall asleep during that. I work 50+ hours a week. 

I know everyone is going to say I should stop smoking weed and then I’ll have time do everything, but does that mean each day just has to literally be work and chores and nothing else? Is enjoying part of my day/life irresponsible? That seems silly honestly. 

I just feel like I’m drowning in everything I’m supposed to have been doing all these years. And it’s all so embarrassing and tied together. Like as an example, I feel like I can’t date people because my home is too messy for people to see, and I’m too anxious about bodies to be sexual anyway. (No, I’m not asexual; I experience sex drive and sexual attraction). So until I learn to clean and eat healthy, I can’t work on dating. 

I want to be okay with not being “correct”, just like all the cool inspirational people in my circle. But the desire for self acceptance doesn’t actually make the anxiety go away.

Since she came back, a few of her other buds have brought their diffusers in as well. So my cube area constantly smells like a bunch of different oil concoctions and it is strong.

I have always been very sensitive to smells and am prone to migraines. Usually I get a migraine for a couple days each month at the beginning of my period. Since she came back, I have had 13 migraine days out of 43 days. The difference is notable. Any time I smell the diffusers, i feel woozy.

I asked her friend to turn hers off today and she was mad about it.

617,"Hi, I'm new here, I hope I'm not doing this wrong.

I'll try to keep the background info concise, but it's a bit messy.

Background:

I'm an emerging artist and I used to have a studio at an artist run gallery which was run by my friends from uni, and my partner was also one of these ""facilitators"" but he brought a special set of skills, as he coded the entire website and designed and printed all the posters and wall text for every exhibition. He was integral to the operation. 

There is an artist in my city who is quite accomplished, but regularly engages in 'call-out' culture, and has the power to take people down. Some people consider her a bully, but me and my partner were somewhat friendly with her. (Don't be racist, she won't call you out) and she applied to do a show at the gallery, and they accepted it (likely to gain clout off her notoriety as they all didn't like her) and the time comes for the show to happen. This artist emails them saying she doesn't feel good about the show because they haven't been providing much support or updates on how they are going to install/promote the show. 

My partner drafts up an apology email with detailed info on the install and promo. 2 other facilitators don't like this, delete his email draft, and write out a very rude email that infers she is demanding and a bully. They then pull me aside (I'm at the gallery with the facilitators,  partner is at home) and tell me my partner is too nice, and its very important this artist is put in her place. I feign agreement, but I also subtly advise that perhaps it may still be better to just appease her and be nice, and speak to her in person. They didn't like that.

The next day, my partner is feeling upset about being shut down. He generally feels that his input into the gallery space isn't respected, and they just boss him around and tell him how they want the website. This is solidified by what happens next. They have been trying to organise a meeting for weeks, with all the facilitators, but conflicting schedules make is hard. they pick a time, but oh, this person can't do it, so they rebook to a time, that my partner cannot attend. But nope, thats fine, they'll just fill him in later. 

He arrives at the gallery immediately after the meeting has ended, to pick me up (I've been in my studio all day, and as such I know their meeting took about 3 hours) Our close friend facilitator (She's the important one, so I'll call her L) says 

&amp;#x200B;

""We've taken minutes for you, but DO NOT READ THEM UNTIL TOMORROW""

&amp;#x200B;

We go home, and naturally read them immediately and there is only 3 touch points, and in the middle, in all caps in big fuck-off red letters 

\[PARTNER\] CAN NO LONGER LIASE WITH ARTISTS, MAKE ANY DECISIONS AROUND GALLERY MATTERS OR RESPOND TO EMAILS. HE MUST ONLY DO THE WEBSITE

&amp;#x200B;

Followed by a list of changes they want on the website.

Keep in mind, they are all equally in charge, there is no hierarchy.  

The fallout of this, is my partner writes a resignation letter (There is other stuff that lead to this, but noone wants to read all that) And I decide to also leave the space, because I stand by my partner. They insist on having a meeting, try to make me leave, but my partner wants me for support, my partner cries, its a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, L was our best friend at the time, we had done an AMAZING exhibition together (that I secured for us, on my own basically, and got us a massive budget) and we were VERY close. But I felt like she didn't back us or stand up for us at all during this time. But ignoring that, I didn't think this should stop us being friends. I tried to organise times to meet up, she shot them down.

&amp;#x200B;

I accepted that she didn't want to be friends, and I let it go. 

But 2 days ago, she messaged me, out of nowhere. This is MONTHS, maybe almost year after all this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

 ""Hey, remember me?""

&amp;#x200B;

I was happy to hear from her, but I also felt like we needed to clear the air, and this was just another prompt for me to talk to her, rather than for her to actually say something of substance to me. But, I decide it's just better to take it as a nice thing and I reply:

&amp;#x200B;

""Hey :) Of course! How are you? I've been hiding from the world and working at xxx""

(I'm working so I can move overseas, and I'm also going thru therapy for PTSD and she is a aware of this)

&amp;#x200B;

And that was 2 days ago and I've been on read ever since.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like she only did it to make me think of her again, or to have the upperhand by leaving me on read. I just want to block and unfriend her, but I feel like I might be being dramatic... is there anything I can do? Every person I speak to is just like ""Oh well, get over it""  and I'm like, ""I DID! She's dragged it up again""

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more satellite events to this, but I feel like this is all the important events.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any advice. Thank you very much if you read all that. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: Had a falling out, friend messages me ages later ""Remember me?"" I send a kind reply, she leaves me on read.

620,"I have an online friend who I met four years ago. Ever since, she has been really active on YouTube and deviantart, so we usually talk to each other a lot. Until recently, she hasn't been active for almost a month and I'm getting really worried. Like, what is happening to her? She lives in a different country from me so I have almost no idea.

The last time she went missing before she came back again, she was gone for a whole two months, but she never told us why. After she came back for a couple of days, she was gone again, hasn't posted anything for three weeks now.

I think she is likely on a hiatus, but there's also a disturbing possibility that maybe she broke up with her bf and now is depressed and doesn't want to talk about it. In the past she has stated that she has depression. When Valentines day came along, I was kind of expecting her to post something about her boyfriend but she didn't. All i noticed is that her boyfriend, who i'm also acquainted with, liked a post about being single on Valentines day. This is exactly what made me think that she broke up with him.

I haven't spoken to her in so long, so I tried sending her a message, once a week. She hasn't replied to any of them. This has been concerning me for many days now and it's not good for me. Another thing is, that on deviantart, you have the ability to hid your activity so no one knows when was the last time you were active on the site. She hid her activity, so she either really hasn't been online for very long, or, she actually has been online but is just ignoring me.

628,"I work with a smaller company here in my home town. I am the sole IT guy, and I manage lots of stuff, and am constantly learning stuff, and I enjoy it most of the time. My issue comes to my pay, and experience. I am pretty young, only 19, but  I have  my bachelors in network operations and security, along with over 20 certifications in the field. I am only being paid just over minimum wage to work full time, and they won't be paying for my continued education I am taking now either. (Full time job and school). I have enough in savings to pull out of the job, and just hunker down and finish school, and get my masters in the next 1-2 years. Sometimes I feel like it's not worth the stress and the work, but at the same time it is giving me experience in the field, and something great to put on my resume (years of IT experience before I'm even 20). I'm not sure, I could be overreacting, or being one of those entitled people.

630,"My moms abusive ex left her back in December.  He just went to work one day and didn't come home.  I already suspected he was going to leave for a few weeks before he did because I noticed him slowly moving his stuff into storage and thought is was weird.  I was happy when he left because he mainly targeted me with his abuse, but of course I understood that it would be hard on my mom so I kind of avoided the subject of him.  For a few weeks it seemed like things were looking up.  My mom was angry and acting unbothered, she had still cut off all contact with him as far as I knew and I really thought this would finally be the time he doesn't come back.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she started talking about how he started messaging our account for our dog that he thought my little sister (his kid) ran.  At first I was kinda iffy about it, but thought it was maybe okay since he was saying some really fucked up shit (told who he thought was my sister to kill me) and my mom said she was just entertaining it and screenshotting stuff for proof.  Well, then she started talking about him in a positive light again, reminiscing about old times I guess, and she'd get mad at me whenever I said I didn't want to hear it.  Then she started getting mad at me when I'd talk about how abusive he was and she'd claim it never happened.  Then she started texting him and talking to him on her own social media accounts.  Now he comes around to the house at least twice a week.  She says stuff to my sister about buying a house with her ex (my sisters dad) and moving in with them, and I'm not even a part of the picture when she says that stuff.  She thinks I don't know, but my sister tells me everything because she hates her dad.  My mom is at the point now where if anyone says anything bad about him she gets mad and claims it never happened and that he wasn't abusive.  He's sleeping over this weekend so he can drive her to a doctors appointment early in the morning, and I'm afraid he's never going to leave.  This is how it always happens, he says he's just staying for a few days or until he can find a place to stay or some other bullshit excuse and then he just never leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has a lifetime if physical damage done to her body because of him.  She's practically crippled, and when he's living with us her blood pressure is so high that she's been at the point where she could have had a stroke or a heart attack twice.  She gets so stressed out to the point where she literally can't move her legs because she's always in pain.  I don't know how to explain it and I know it sounds like a stretch, but honestly he stresses her out so much that her body responds and she's in constant pain to the point of not being able to move.  It's like she's forgotten how bad he really is, or she's really convinced herself that her idealized version of him is how he really is.  She thinks he's changed and that he wont be that way again.  She makes every excuse under the sun ""he's on his meds"" ""he apologized"" ""he's started asking me about my crystals"".  I can't stand to listen to her talk about how he's changed when just from spending less than a minute with him, it's painfully obvious that he's still exactly the same.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help her.  If she doesn't cut him off she's going to literally die.  Whether it's from her having a heart attack or a stroke, or from him beating on her.  I know that they've been together for 15 years, I know she loves him, but she can't keep doing this to herself and everyone else around her.  I can't even try to talk to her about it or she calls me controlling and starts freaking out.  She's constantly gaslighting me and twisting things around in her mind, and I honestly can't tell if she believes the things she's saying because it really seems like it.  I'm at a loss.  I don't know what to do.  As much as she treats me badly and I hate it, she's still my mom, and I can't just watch her keep doing this to herself.  She can't just keep letting him back in and convincing herself things are different than they are, she's going to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only is she affected, but my sister too.  My mom neglects my sister and my own health when he's around.  My sister is obviously depressed and she's always angry.  My sister hates her dad.  He may not consistently abuse her, but occasionally when he's going after me or my mom, he'll hurt her to get her out of the way.  My sister even stopped going to school.  When he left, and when my mom wasn't talking to him, my sister was a lot more stable and going to school.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  Law enforcement never helps.  Every time without fail, they take his side.  They always say shit like ""he's just having a bad night"" or as soon as they realize my moms native they start refusing to help us.  There's just nothing I can do, I can't even talk to my mom reasonably because she just starts freaking out.  Does anyone know how I can help them?  Having him around is messing up both my mom and my sisters lives massively, it feels wrong to move to my dads and just leave them like this.  What can I do other than calling the police or calling CAS?  Or is there a way to call CAS and for it to remain anonymous?  If my mom wants to keep doing this to herself, there's nothing I can do, but I can't just watch my little sister go down this path.  I'm stuck, I don't know what to do, I really need some help.",22Feb2019,1

634,"There is an eSports competition being hosted for the first time at my high school (they have a sponsor and everything, called CyberpowerPC or something, theyre supplying the prizes). They advertised it on Instagram and on our schools news, but the thing is not everybody has Instagram and plus a lot of the teachers dont broadcast the school news (its a live news show streamed on Youtube that lasts 15 minutes, broadcasted during our ""homeroom"" class). They only put up posters for it around school 2 days before the competition, and honestly it takes time to find and compose a team (plus there are only so many gamers at school, a lot of people were already in teams). But what I feel is the most unfair is that it turns out there was only a 32 team limit, which nobody knew about, so basically only the first 32 teams to apply were entered in the competition. They never said anything about this first come first serve policy, so a lot of people after the 32 team mark were dropped out instantly. The whole event is organized and overseen by students, and Ive already asked them but they say that if they did allow more teams then the number ""has to be 2^5, so 32 teams, 62 teams, 128 teams, etc"" which I feel is dumb. Either way, they refused to add all of the groups that signed up, saying ""we're doing 32 lol, theres no way in hell we're doing more"".

638,"I could use a little feedback. I have been helping setup a small promotion for a budget video game where we give out various amounts of steam credit and other prizes to the winner. Every week we ask a question, or pick a random winner based off of page likes and so on, you get the idea.   I'm not including the details because I am nervous about this coming back to me somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

This week the winner has baffled me. We contacted him telling him he won $50 (in steam cash) and congratulations /etc.    
 Steam money is an online video game store in case you didn't know.  Then we asked that he friend our steam account so we can transfer the credits. Instead of accepting our friend request he instead goes online and posts about how the giveaway is a scam because our giveaway account has only a few friends.

&amp;#x200B;

He is right that our promotional account does only have a few users since we just set it up, but I don't see why that would alone be a red flag. I then notified him that we needed to link the accounts to do the electronic credit transfer, however if he wasn't comfortable I would be happy to just mail him a gift card.   He was very upset and wouldn't give me his address either and keeps posting negative things about this promotion.

  
I am truly confused what we did wrong, we were totally professional through the whole thing.     Plus I am a nervous about what happens when the company president realizes the giveaways I am supposed to be doing might have created negative attention. What should we do with his winning money?   I feel that we need to still give it away, but is it fair that I pick another winner at this point?  ugh",22Feb2019,1

After the first date we spent everyday for the next month together. I had to move back to where I was going to attend college and once I got there he distanced himself and I could feel it. He posted a photo of another girl on his Snapchat and so I blocked him (his Snapchat not his number) (in hindsight this was an impulsive mistake as I had no proof of any relationship between the two of them other than my intuition). We haven’t been in contact since and that was a month ago.
I recently ended up moving back home where he lives (not because of him there were different factors involved)
My question is do I let him know I’m back home or just continue to let go.

645,"CW/TW domestic violence &amp; r*pe. 

I (28f) work in hospitality mainly on weekends, with minimal shifts throughout the week. My boss likes me to work weekends because even though I’m little (5’1”/155 cm), I don’t take anyone’s shit &amp; I have no problem banging on doors &amp; kicking out people causing issues, usually light arguing or smoking inside the hotel room. 

To make a long story short, a week ago today, a guest was violently raped &amp; beaten by her boyfriend for over an hour as I was helpless &amp; couldn’t get into their room as we have actual keys &amp; several of our rooms don’t have duplicates (I’m getting ready to get into this issue). After calling the police, having him arrested, &amp; making sure his girlfriend got in the ambulance okay, I started making a Risk Management book because my boss wasn’t answering the phone at the time of the emergency &amp; this isn’t a big chain hotel, so we don’t have anything more than an employee handbook stating call trees, shift times, &amp; dress code. It’s just a tiny mom &amp; pop hotel owned by a local family (which is really no excuse as to not have what I’m about to mention). 

So as I’m making this Risk Management Book, I’m referring to a lot of state building codes, fire codes, etc. 

This is when I find out that not only is this building in violation of at least 7 different health &amp; safety hazards, I recently found out that the hotel owner (my boss’ boss) has been docking pay from my coworkers when the cash box is off at the end of their shift. This is against both state &amp; federal regulations for wage payment &amp; collection. The most recent time it happened, it was more than $140 &amp; the elderly woman that worked that shift had left the keys to the cash box on the counter &amp; a guest had stolen it (camera footage verified). 

I already used my chain of command &amp; went to my boss first with my concerns. She was completely dismissive, accused me of trying to take her job (I’m not, I’m just angry that I got in trouble for how I handled the rape last weekend on my watch so I want to make sure guidelines are in place so it doesn’t happen to another front desk associate), &amp; said she doesn’t want to bring it to the owner’s attention because he’s in his late 70s &amp; doesn’t have the ability to handle this “hotel drama” (boss’ words). 

Now that I have a bit too much on my plate with all this knowledge, I have no clue what to do. i already used my chain of command &amp; I got the shaft. I need to bring up the fire &amp; health code violations, but how do I tell my boss’ boss that he’s breaking federal guidelines?

TLDR: I found my place of employment has a lot of building code violations &amp; my boss’ boss is breaking federal &amp; state payment laws. My boss won’t help me reach out to the appropriate person to handle the situation. What do I do?",22Feb2019,1
646,"Hey, 

So I'm having a really tough time. I am bipolar and was off of my meds for a while. I didn't go manic, but I somehow thought it was a viable option to become an author and make a living on it, not realizing how incredibly competitive, not to mention unpredictable, that is. I've written several drafts of books but they are just not that good and I'm starting to realize it. My ego was pretty high though and it was a dream of mine. I thought I could also become an English Professor, but I also didn't realize just how competitive that was. I used to be a biology major, and was actually getting by with Bs and Cs in the subject, but I switched to English because I was more passionate about that and I felt biology was too male dominated. Now that I'm on my meds again, I'm realizing that I was just feeling really insecure and had a hard time setting boundaries. Plus, I was having a lot of obsessive thoughts about boys and this was distracting me from my studies. It's still by no means an easy subject, but I was able to pass or get a B in the classes. I am really struggling right now with whether or not I want to go to school for a Master's and PhD. in English with the job market the way it is. Part of me is just sick of school and wants to get a decent job already. I don't have one right now and have a hard time having the confidence I need to during interviews. Any advice?

Met a guy a couple of months ago and he drunkenly  told me he liked me. I wasn’t sure how I felt but I told him to add me on FB and we could talk.

I messaged him the next day and didn’t get a lot back, I invited him to town with some friends but he wasn’t in my city for the week. We had zero communication for the next few months, until I saw him again last week at a party. We talked in a group setting but before I could talk to him one on one he got very drunk. Saw him again last night, and again talked in a group setting and a little bit for one on one BUT I got the vibe for some reason that was he not necessarily avoiding me, but didn’t seem overly keen to have big conversations like we did the first time we met.

I’m a bit annoyed honestly. I think he thinks I rejected him that first night, but I honestly didn’t (at least not in my mind) and I was (am?)interested in getting to know him more.

654,"Hi all, I'm a somewhat long lurker to multiple threads and I've only posted about three or four times.
TL;DR Title, basically - Skip to bottom/last paragraph.

Full Story:
I was about to keep friends when I was younger but lost most of them when I moved states and we were all elementary school so no phones/email/brain capacity to ask our parents to exchange numbers so we could talk.
I switched friend groups often in high school and currently have kept 0 friends post high school but occasionally we talk (like once every 7 months).

I’m a 20F and cannot seem to keep friends.
I THINK I have a pretty okay personality. I take friendship seriously and appreciate everyone I decide to bring into my life, otherwise.. They wouldn’t be here if I didn’t want their company or to be friends. I’m a very traditional friend kind of person. I love to bake and cook and love to cook for friends. I’m also artistic and love to make arts/crafts/paintings for friends and although I’m sometimes stingy with my money, I like to buy little gifts for my friends that make me think of them and don't mind treating meals. I don’t drink or smoke, so I can never use that as a way to bond over shared experiences and I think that hurts my chances a lot but that I can live with. I don’t belittle anyone that does, I’d just prefer to not be around when they start doing it.
I have a job, I'm not a moocher, I don't beg people for things on the games I play, etc.
I treat people the way I want to be treated unless they give me a reason not to. I’m pretty forgiving and easy going and I understand people are busy and may have mental illness problems. I myself enter bouts where I don’t want to talk to anyone for a day or a few days and always let people know when I’m emotionally unavailable. I dont unload my mental illness problems usually unless Im having a really bad day/week, and even then I always ask if it’s okay and I try to keep it minimal because I don’t want to scare them away with all the trauma I have.
Sometimes when playing league, I get frustrated, especially if the “friend” im playing with likes to troll or be confrontational in the chat as I am 100% a non-confrontational person.
I DO however sometimes bring up when the person is becoming distant, giving them the chance to just say “Hey, I think maybe we aren’t compatible as friends but I wish you the best” so I can leave it at that. They usually make up some excuse and then go back to slowly ghosting me.

POINT IS: I always strive to be a great friend. I’m a shoulder to cry on at 2am, give decent advice I’ve been told, have no problem doing favors as long as they don’t become a habit and I understand life gets busy and that people aren’t available 100% of the time. I’m not clingy, etc and a lot of people tell me I’m really funny! I also know that looks gets you attention so you may get more friends and I (in my opinion and a lot of other opinions from what I’ve been told) am not ugly or anything. I have a good sense of style and take care of myself. Most of the people I meet now are through league, since the people who work at my current job are about 30-50 years older than me so there’s no discussion really. I had someone that I've known on league for about 2+ years and we talk off and on but the cycle usually goes:

He messages me first, I reply and we talk every day/every other day. Eventually after 1 1/12 weeks it fizzles out where his replies get more spaced until I've messaged him a few times (usually twice or three times) and he hasn't replied or made effort and we stop talking until he messages me again weeks or months later. He always tells me he has a crush on me and for a while I had a slight crush on him, too, but it quickly went away once this cycle began.

I always hear about people who’ve had the same childhood friends or friends from high school, or they’ve just been friends for 8+ years and it always makes my heart heavy and it makes me so envious. The longest friendship I’ve had was about four years and that one ended recently this year because we got into a mild argument about gender roles in relationships. I agreed to disagree and told him I valued his opinion but it wouldn't change mine &amp; he never texted me afterwards, even when I asked if he still wanted his birthday gifts (his birthday was the week after the argument). I kept trying to reach him for about two weeks before I gave up. I think about him often and also have his mom’s number. I’ve wanted to text her to ask if he’s okay because he also struggles badly with mental illness and has threatened to kill himself on multiple occasions so I get worried.

It’s really starting to take a toll on my mental as I don’t forget easy and hold grudges for eternity. Since I don’t forget easily, I hold on to a lot of memories and good moments because I have a lot of bad memories. It aches a lot seeing something and being reminded of someone who you used to be friends with and tried to keep… x15 or something. Or wanting to send them a video you found but knowing you can't. I think about it a lot and cry about it and I wonder if there’s something wrong with me that I simply just don’t see.

SO, now I’m asking you, reddit. Based on what I’ve described do I SOUND like I could be a good friend? Like, if you knew all of this before you met me but knew you were meeting me, would like want to have me as a friend? Do you guys have any ideas on keeping friends? I apologize as well for it being lengthy and can delete/edit if mods want me to.

I’ve been asking her for the past week to stop snapping me and leaving her on opened / read at all times. 

Today in first block she finally hit my limit and I told her 

“stop snapping me or I’m gonna block you and tell your boyfriend that I had to because you wouldn’t leave me alone”

Her response “no, I don’t care, you can’t control me, he won’t give a shit”

So what did I do? I ducking blocked her and texted her boyfriend that I had to block her because she wouldn’t stop texting me 

Fast forward to second block and I come in (I sit across from her) and she throws an entire bottle of water on me and calls me a bitch and pussy 

Fast forward to lunch and her boyfriends texts me  “leave her alone or we are gonna best the shit out of you”

Then I get a screenshot of a text message from an outside source saying “they are saying anon (me) sent a dick pic to them” I did of no fucking such and now she’s spreading it around the school

Also, I'm a closeted atheist and my parents are Muslim who force their religion on me. They don't believe in religious tolerance, so outing myself as atheist while I'm living with them isn't gonna work.

It's not just me that's in this condition. My mom is utterly controlled by my dad and has no freedom whatsoever. She isn't allowed to go out with friends, she doesn't work.

When my dad is at home, we aren't allowed to watch TV, play video games, or literally do anything to wind down. 

I don't think that continuing to live in this environment is going to be conducive to my mental health. I've been skirting around this for a long time, but it's time to move out. 

Never going outside or hanging out with your friends is no way to live, and I won't let my dad control me the same way he does my mom.

668,"I have a very complex relationship with my mother. She was a stay at home mom who was very doting to my brother and I as we grew up. She was definitely overly protective and worried excessively about things. In fact, she just has very bad anxiety in general that she should be getting help for. I would always see her panicking and freaking out about things, which ultimately impacted me and how I dealt with my own anxiety. As a result, I’ve had a lifetime of trying to undo the general sense of panic she instilled in me. 

Anyway, being a mother was her whole identity as she never had a career or made her own path. Her parents were distant and dismissive, so she spent her adult life being a hover-mom as an attempt to overcompensate. 

It didn’t start to bother me until I got older. As a teen, I was bullied badly in school so I saw my mothers concern and dedication as a positive thing. As a young adult, it began to drive me insane. When my brother and I moved out, she had an identity crisis. She began drinking more and reading conspiracy theory websites all day since she didn’t have a job. Her drinking made her bitchy and shallow, and she would slur and be embarrassing in public. The combo of the two made her very hard to deal with. Her theories and view of the world became skewed. 

I went on to graduate school, got a good job, became an independent woman. I am almost 28, I am single and I don’t want kids. I’ve spent years trying to get help for my anxiety, while she’s never sought help for hers... despite desperately needing professional aid. She doesn’t relate to me anymore and I don’t relate to her. 

The most infuriating part is that she tries to mother me all the time. She doubts everything I do or say and tries to explain how I could be doing it better. For example, she just called me to tell me I can’t go out of town this weekend because of a travel advisory. When I said I didn’t want to hear it because it won’t be that bad and I can’t get my money back, she got angry and brought my dad into it. 

I’ve told her numerous times that her drinking and weird theories make me uncomfortable and yet that doesn’t stop her from doing it/discussing it in my presence. She interprets my lack of needing her advice is me pushing her away. The truth is just that I grew up and stopped needing help, while simultaneously she became more difficult to be around. 

TLDR: my mom is an overprotective, hover mom who drinks too much and reads conspiracy theories all day. She needs help for her anxiety but won’t get it. Instead, she hyper focuses on me and my life, even though I’ve grown into a successful, independent woman. She can’t handle it and I find her mentally unhealthy. 

Please help me. If you’ve been through something similar, what did you do?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25f and I come from a poor dysfunctional family. I live somewhere where I need a car to get most jobs around here. And any jobs I could potentially walk to are hours away and too much of a commute for me to even bother with. Public transportation doesn't go to these jobs or anywhere close. So it would be a waste of money to take a bus and still have to walk 2 hours to get to that job and home everyday. I have a bladder disease so because of that I didn't go to college. And my parents wouldn't let me anyway because at that time they forced me to get a full time job at that time. I did manage to finally move out... parents divorced...so I don't see my dad and don't have to deal with him abusing me anymore. Which is good.  But after I moved out I unfortunately got sick and was out for 3 days with pneumonia and my boss fired me because I couldn't come in. It was rough and I was jobless for 3 months but still had rent and bills to pay. In april of last year I got another job but then my appendix burst and I was out for a month no pay too. I didn't get any unemployment and was only getting like 20 hours or less a week for work. Couldn't afford my bills and rent and had to move back in with mom to her dismay. She doesn't really want me here. And I didn't have much of a choice because I was hit with so many bad things and unforeseen circumstances last year I couldn't be prepared enough for it. I was even smart and saved money but if you have no income it obviously drains after a while. Since I was 17 I've been begging for my mom to take me driving which she rarely does. Even at 25 I've renewed my permit over 6-7 times. And every time it lapses because she doesn't make time for me to learn. I try making plans to drive once or twice a week (Like wednesdays can we make an effort to drive?) and she'll agree  but then procrastinate or hang out with her boyfriend over me and Im in the same spot I'm in.

I'm unemployed right now trying desperately to find work with no luck. My mom charges me rent and utilities so I can't just not pay that either or I'll be homeless.

679,"This may be long and convoluted. Please bear with me kind souls, I really need advice.

Background: 

I am currently struggling with intense deep seeded mental health issues. Ive been through the worst heartbreak of my life as well as many other new eye opening traumas about me/my life/ life in general that have been surfacing which had previously been suppressed from my childhood. (Yes I am in counseling)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, around 6 years ago I adopted a middle aged dog from the local shelter when going through a different kind of depressive episode. I could barely function and adopting this being in need of my care gave me purpose and filled me with joy. I've loved my dog with all my heart since that day. He was malnourished and had never really been outside, I cared for him and he has flourished. Caring for him helped me care for me too. We've traveled together, he sleeps in my bed, he's constantly on my lap, we go hiking, on walks, &amp; lots of snuggle.

&amp;#x200B;

However, recently, one of the things I've been dealing with is realizing that no one in my life has ever been able to love me in the way I feel I need to be shown love. I always always feel like I love the other person more than they love me, I know it's probably unhealthy, I'm super sensitive and needy, whatever. I don't know exactly how to deal with this, it's new and I'll figure it out in time (or not, who knows). I've recently been learning about self-love, which was a totally new concept too and that's been good to explore.

&amp;#x200B;

However, here's where it comes to my dog. He is also very sensitive and needy, he is very aloof and demanding as well. I used to pour all my love into caring for my dog, and making him feel loved. I feel like I can barely do this for myself now and his needs are so overwhelming. I care or him with the basics or course. Food, water, potty, walks, even snuggles when he asks for them. But what I never cared about before is that it's all on his terms. If I am sobbing, or even just sad, he doesn't come to sit with me. He'll leave if he doen't want to sit with me. He doesn't care. He isn't moved by my emotions like some animals are, naturally drawn to comforting their human. He is just a very aloof dog. But recently I realized my dog is like everyone else in my life. I'm always there for them, I give them my all, but things are always on their terms and I don't get even close to what I need back.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so strange about it all. I guess I resent my dog for being a not nurturing dog? I just don't know what to do. I'd never let my dog go uncared for, I'd never neglect his health and well being. Just, not loving him in my heart the same as I used to pains me so much every time I look at him. He deserves to be loved, and I just have so little to give right now. I resent that he doesn't love me in the way I want to, and need to be loved. Just like everyone else in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I find my dog a new, loving, caring, home, where someone(s) will cherish him? Or do I just cart him around with me. Being my dog, doing what we've always done, but feeling so hurt and abandoned every time he tries to push himself onto my lap at the most inconvenient time for me, but never when I need it most?

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea. Everything feels like such a mess. I know things will change and I'll figure out my life and mental health eventually, but until then, do I just go on caring for, yet resenting my dog, even though he doesn't care either way at all, or do I find him a new actually loving home and really focus on healing myself?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My dog's aloof-ness is triggering my mental health &amp; highlighting my fears that no one is capable of showing me love in a way that will actually make me feel loved. Caring for him is becoming increasingly hard for my heart. Do I find him a new loving home, or suck it up because I adopted him and he is my responsibility?",22Feb2019,1

686,"So, I just made this account because I believe in writing down goals and meeting them. This new account will count as that written down goal. So, like the title says, I messed up big time. Here's the background. I am currently a High School senior finishing up his last semester until I ship away to college to study computer science. My school offers students the opportunity to take college level course and earn credits from the state university. This is an extremely useful option for students because the state school will submit a transcript stating that you took their college level course. Over the Summer I signed up for 3 of these classes; two in the fall, one in the spring. I took both classes in the fall and decided that for the Spring semester I would take a web design course provided from my high school. So the counselor dropped the class ... or so I thought. She called me into her office today saying I owed the college 250 dollars. I explained that my parents can not afford this charge. It's sudden and we are struggling as is. On top of everything, why would I pay for a class I didn't take!? That's insane. Unfortunately, I signed a paper in order to take the classes saying if I missed any payments they can take away all of my credits and deny me of my college transcript to other schools. This is HUGE because a big part of my application was boasting that I took college classes. Once school's I've applied to find out ""I didn't take the classes"" and that ""I'm lying"" , they will not want me.  I'm extremely scared. I worked so hard in the first to classes! Ok, I am going to get a bit personal here. My parents are having pretty big relationship issues. They have been fighting so much lately over finances. Something like this will cause a huge argument. I'd rather die than have something like this drive them further apart. I intend on paying this fee myself. It's the only way. Can anyone please post recommendations on how I can acquire the funds. Words cannot express how important this is to me.

689,"I'm 20 years old, female. I'm also a lesbian and my mother (59F) has a very big problem with it. It's always been something my mum was iffy about and it has caused our relationship to suffer immensely. A few years ago, I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to suicidal tendencies and thoughts, and severe mental breakdown (it all came from the deteriorating relationship between me and my mum, grades, finals, my mum not letting my best friend visit, etc.)

I recovered and my mum had a proper scare. Yet she still isn't thrilled about my sexuality. I suppose it's difficult to change views, especially if the rest of my siblings had fit in her cookie cutter way of raising kids (they're not as homophobic as my mum, surprisingly).

Now, that wouldn't be a problem if I just kept my relationships to myself. However, I want to take my current girlfriend (23F) to my cousin's wedding as my +1. She's so sweet, genuine and funny, I really want her to accompany me. I informed my mum and she started getting worked up about it. It wouldn't be an issue if I took a guy, but because I'm taking a girl, she's... Not taking it well.

I could pull out the ""I'm either going with my girlfriend, or I'm not going at all"" card, but I'm afraid that my mum doesn't really care enough about me.

Any ideas? Any advice? I really really want to go, and I want to go with my girlfriend.",22Feb2019,4
690,"I feel as though life has no meaning or purpose..everyday is just as dull as the last if not more. Im a failure in several ways..
Im in college and last semester i did so bad i got put on probation. This semester isn’t going any better and i feel like after this semester I’ll probably get kicked out of my school. I cant keep up with my work and i have lost all desire to keep it going.
Next my relationships..i had one girlfriend for 2 years and then she dumped me over text and ever since then ive felt miserable and depressed. I rarely meet girls and if i do then they arent ever interested in me. I try to be happy and polite and everything but it never seems to workout. Something always happens and they either lose interest and we become friends or they instead hate me. I feel all alone. Most of my friends are in relationships and are happy. Some are engaged and many are close to getting engaged. A few are already married and/or have kids. Meanwhile I can’t even find someone who will stick around longer than 2-3 weeks. Idk what I do wrong. Ive gotten so desperate that I’m now using dating apps and thats not going any better. So obviously something about me is horrible and nobody wants to be around me
Life is a complete mystery to me. Idk what point i have to even live at this point. I started taking pills for depression a few months ago and was going to a therapist but it became too expensive so i had to stop. I honestly feel like it’d just be easier for myself and everyone else if i just ended it all. My family and a few friends are all i have at this point. Nobody else seems to give a damn about me
Is there any reason to keep going? Do i have a purpose in this life or am i just completely useless?

I drawl I’ve been doing it for a while and I’m not that best at it but I’m good enough to where I get compliments, my friend just got into drawling because of me and I didn’t think much of it until recently. She started posting it to insta and not only are they super bad but I feel like she is copying my art style z also she is trying to sale her art and it’s just awful to watch, I could understand if she was 13 or 14 but she’s 19 almost 20 and it’s embarrassing to see her posting bad art and telling people to pay her for it. She constantly says that she has natural talent and that art is so easy for her but it’s obvious she doesn’t understand anatomy and I’m honestly starting to feel embarrassed for her. I don’t want to be a bitch but I want her to practice and get better (also I’m kinda upset that she’s stealing my art style since I’ve been working on it for a long while now, and it’s something that’s super personal to me)",22Feb2019,2

693,"For the past two year I have infrequently posted my political opinions. When I did post, it would be in a snarky tone, mocking the other side. Mostly comics, screenshots of news articles, hypocritical statements, you know. My frustration and anger with US politics grew and grew and festered inside of me. 

My work situation is isolated - I answer phones but do not sit near anyone and do not have anyone to talk to. I would browse Twitter and the New York Times, etc. just growing angrier and angrier. It got to the point where I had to unfriend my best friend IRL because I could not stand the thought of being associated. 

At the time I felt like my actions were justified. Looking back, I am filled with regret at my childish behavior and disdain for the party currently in charge. I have not been active on my Facebook since January of 2018 and I have not posted anything to my Instagram story since January 2019 (I plan on sticking with this for the year). I now know that I cannot judge and must let others think what they want. I can't be in control of everyone which is hard because I get anxious when things don't go how I thought they would. 

I feel like I publicly (at least to all my social media friends and family) had a freak out and now I don't know what to do. I ""silenced"" myself by not posting anymore but still feel like I am being watched / being hated / being judged / being the worst.  ",22Feb2019,0

On mobile, long post. Sorry.. 
I had a best friend for a few years straight. We will call her Stephanie. Stephanie and I were inseparable for years and went through everything together. During our friendship she would be in and out of relationships, putting me on the back burner every time someone new came along. I didn't date anyone for more than a week because all my time went to her. Until I started talking to this incredibly sweet, handsome and loving man. Having just found out my dad was dying from cancer a month prior to dating him, he helped me a lot when she didn't know how to. (Situations like that make her anxious and she shuts down) we pretty much fell in love within a month and a lot of my time started going to him. Before we met Stephanie was my only friend so I was basically on standby waiting to hang out with her so this was a huge change. She started to be passive aggressive towards me so I talked to her about it and realized how I made her feel so we worked on it together until she got a boyfriend too. We hung out as a group a lot and  had fun that way, until I got pregnant and shortly after married (early so my terminally ill farher could be there) She really likes to smoke hookah and weed and I cut all unhealthy things out when I got pregnant for my baby. she pretended to be happy for me for a while until admitting that she was mad that I was pregnant because I'll have even less time for her. being pregnant saved me in a lot of ways because my dad passed away when I was 10 weeks. If I wasn't pregnant I would have drank and smoked myself to death trying to cope with the loss of my Dad. We wrote her into baby books as Auntie Stephanie and talked about how she would still have time with me, just with a baby too. She seemed excited for me again. Then our communication started going in and out and I felt us drifting apart. Right before I had my baby she asked how we were doing and then suddenly after he was here she was completely MIA. I waited a week to see if she would make an effort to see us.. She didn't. I asked her if we were still friends and she said that our friendship was too stressful for both of us because she was new to the whole "" mom thing"" like it was her who had just brought a new life into the world and suddenly had a ton of responsibility.. I just feel hurt and abandoned by someone who said they'd never leave. ",22Feb2019,1

696,"So I’ve had two of these dreams now recently. About 2-3 weeks ago I had a dream about being at my uncle’s house. Near the end I was sitting with my mom on the porch and my uncle was standing behind me. He said something like “turn around and look up”. So I did and he just put his penis in my mouth? It was really weird. Then my mom and I leave and she basically yelled at me in the car, saying that I shouldn’t have trusted him. Now in reality, my uncle wouldn’t do anything like that. 

Last night I had a dream about being at my dads house. For some reason we were talking in the doorway to the bathroom and he basically picked me up so my legs were wrapped around his waist. He carried me over to the wall so my back was against the wall. He said something like “this is the way you used to touch me when you were little”. I immediately got myself off of him and started yelling at him. I don’t remember what I said. I then went to go find my stepmom and tried to tell her what happened but she wouldn’t listen. Throughout the rest of the dream I only remember following my stepmom around waiting for her to listen to me. I eventually woke up before we could have an actual conversation. 

Just like the dream with my uncle, my dad has never touched me or abused me sexually. When I was around 7 my mom and dad got divorced. My sisters and I lived half of the week with dad, the other half with mom. My dad and I were very close around that time. At his house I was kind of put into this “little mommy” roll because I tried to help him out any way I could. I changed my youngest sisters diaper, I made us food, I washed dishes, I cleaned. I remember loving helping my dad. He was very distraught after the divorce and if I didn’t do those things we probably wouldn’t have been able to live with our dad. I also remember having very strong feelings for my dad. I don’t think they were sexual, because I was 7 I didn’t know what sex was. I just remember pretending to marry him when we would play together. I remember my dad putting me to sleep and we could cuddle. I remember him giving me a shower up until I was around 10 when he told me that I was too old to take a shower with him. I’m the oldest of my sisters and I also remember one time before he married my stepmom, he told me that I was his favorite. Once my dad and stepmom got married I remember not resenting her at all. I loved her, and I still love her, like she’s one of my parents. 

My dad and I had that close relationship up until around when I started high school. We fought nonstop. I hated him then. I really wished that he would die honestly. He was an alcoholic then and it made him bitter. I was about 15-16 so my hormones were all over the place and made me irritable. So as you can guess, that wasn’t a good mix. We fought so much all the time that I would cry myself to sleep pretty much every night. At some point when I was in 10th grade I remember one certain week it was really bad with the fighting. I just remember everyday going to school and this one girl who I was kind of friends with would ask me “were you crying last night?” And I would just shake my head. My dad also would get into fights with me right before school and I would get to school and still be crying. One time I refused to go to school because I looked bad since crying ruined my makeup. He made me go anyways. Eventually in 10th grade I moved in with my mom full time. 

After I moved in with my mom, my relationship with my dad basically turned business. We wouldn’t really see each other much and when we did I would try to not talk about my personal problems. We did fight occasionally but it was easy for me to move past it because I wasn’t living with him. So fast forward to last summer, my summer before college, my dad and stepmom take us on vacation to Disney. The trip was great up until my dad started disappearing a lot one day. The hotel had a bar and we all just assumed he was there. He came back to the room one night and just passed out on the bed. My stepmom looked through his luggage and found that he had snuck in vodka in those little travel shampoo bottles. So the next day my stepmom told him what she found and he said he was sorry to everyone and that he would stop drinking so much. Fast forward again to Christmas 2018, I go over to my dads for Christmas dinner. It was fine up until he started drinking. I got mad and tried to leave. He came out to my car and drunkenly tried to get me to stay. I wouldn’t. I left and the next day my sisters call my mom saying please come pick them up. So my mom picks them up and now they aren’t living with my dad and stepmom anymore. 

Since then my dad and stepmom have been separated. My dad is renting his own apartment for at least 3 months. Since all of this happened my dad and I have grown closer. He apologized to me for everything. He was sorry for what I did when I was little by helping him out all the time, he was sorry for all the fights we had when I started high school, he was sorry for always drinking. I do feel like my dad and I are fixing our relationship. I realized now that I am getting stronger feelings towards him. For like 5 years it’s felt like I haven’t had a dad. It felt like he was almost a stranger. When he would hug me I felt trapped. Like I needed to get out. Now recently when he hugs me I feel safe. I feel like I really do love him as a dad. The only way I know how to describe my feelings towards him is that if feelings were on a scale, my feelings towards my dad would be close to sexual, but I would never have sex with him. I feel like this is how I felt when I was little. 

I’m sorry for the long post. I just really want an answer to this. I hated those dreams. I was scared of my dad and mad at him for what he did in my dream last night. I just want to know why I’ve had these dreams. ",22Feb2019,1
697,"I’ve recently been rejected by a girl I have very strong feelings for, problem is we’re in a fairly close friendship group of four people, all who are aware of the situation. Recently she’s told me that she’s started to feel uncomfortable by me being around alone but still wants me as a friend, and I still want our group to last. They’re all trying to be understanding of my feelings and say they’re worried about me, but I don’t know how to deal with it because I can’t really get help from them. To make it worse, she’s having a party tomorrow which she says she’d love me to come to but I know it’s going to be weird and awkward and I’m not going to have many people to speak to, at the same time if I don’t go I’ll end up feeling even more depressed and sorry for myself than before.",22Feb2019,6
698,"So today I’m visiting my uncle and my grandmother who I haven’t seen in a few years. Last time I saw my grandmother, I really only saw her for like a day—but this weekend I’m staying with them and I’m likely going to be around them quite a bit.

The reason I’m posting here is because I was wondering if anybody could give me advice on how to act or be around my grandmother.

I say this because when I was 14 I found out my grandmother seriously abused my mother and my uncle. Some of the stuff she’s done is really screwed up, and ever since I’ve found out I can’t look at her the same way.

But to her, she’s always seen me as her sweet grandson, and I know she’ll be happy to see me, but it’s hard for me to find out that my grandma who I thought was sweet and kind was actually a manipulative, physical abuser.

I’m going to see her in a bit, like 20 minutes-ish, so some of you may not read this until I’ve already seen her—but I’d still like advice on how to deal with her for this weekend.

The whole reason I’m going is because o had to spend a lot of time discerning if I should go or not, but after a conversation with my brother, I decided it was the right thing to do—even if I can’t be around her, because people don’t last forever, and this might be the last time I see her.

So, any advice for this weekend?


TLDR;
Please give me some advice on how to deal with or be around my grandma who I found out is abusive. I need help on how to act or be around her, since she doesn’t have a clue that I know about her actions.",22Feb2019,1
