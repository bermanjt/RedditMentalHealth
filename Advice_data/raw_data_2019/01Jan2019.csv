1,"this is kinda a confusing story but i’ll try my best to keep everything together and all making sense.

basically, me and my boyfriend have been dating a while. things were going good until a few weeks ago. he’s not the greatest at showing affection or any feelings whatsoever because of his past with his dads side of the family and verbal and physical abuse. he began to become distant and cold. i gave him space, talked to him, and let him know that i was there for
him. we had recently came back from a trip to Florida with his grandparents so it was a bit confusing why he was this way now. time went on and he didn’t get better.

now, a couple weeks ago he went a few hours away to his moms to visit during break from school. randomly he texted me “we’re done” with no context whatsoever. i called him crying, desperately trying to get an explanation to no avail. a couple days later he texted me saying he had heard rumors of me cheating on him with a “friend” of mine

(friend is in quotes because our families know each other but we had a thing last year and he completely used and abused me. i want nothing to do with him and he makes me SICK beyond words)

when i read that text my heart dropped. i’ve been cheated on before and i vowed i would never put anyone through the pain i felt. i don’t know who told him that, i don’t know the full story, but my heart hurts. i don’t know why he would believe someone else especially since he knew my past with this guy and he knew that i’ve been cheated on before as well. i also don’t know why he wouldn’t bring it up to me in any way before ending things. 

i know this is long but i just want to ask for advice on how to engage in a conversation about this. he gets back this Saturday but i don’t think he’d want to see me. i’ve given him space to think but i don’t know how to bring it up. i want to clear my name if anything, and i’m hoping i can get another chance since the claims were completely untrue and i love this boy more than anything. if anyone has anything they can give me it would mean a lot. there’s a few minor details i left out but i didn’t think they mattered to the gist of the story

again, all i’m asking is for advice on how to re-engage with him and how to bring up this topic to tell him that it’s not true and how much he means to me. 

thank you :)",01Jan2019,1

Hi E - my parents wanted me to relay to you that they noticed the couch in your room is destroyed.  They indicated that when you moved in, it was in great condition and now it would need to be replaced. 

They told me that the original couch cost ~1500 but are looking for 1,200.00 and are NOT open to splitting the cost like the floor. They were audibly upset on the phone.

They are asking that you make monthly payments of $200 on top of your rent until the couch is repaid.

Thanks,

Hi H, I'm sorry to hear that your parents are upset about the condition of the couch. However, the description of the couch as ""destroyed,"" is inaccurate.

    The damage to the couch is normal wear and tear. The only damage, other than purely cosmetic damage, is the faux leather is peeling up, and one of the feet is bent. Neither of which require more than normal use to occur.

   I have rented this room for the better part of five years, during which I sat and layed on it frequently. Additionally, the couch was already visibly used by the previous tenant's when I first moved in. Meaning, that this couch is at the very least five years old, and without an original receipt of the couch, it's in all likelihood significantly older than five years. 

  Asking me to purchase your parents a new couch, to replace a 5+ year-old couch, on the basis that while I was a long time renter, I sat and layed on it, is unreasonable. Even after reducing the stated price by twenty percent, It is still unreasonable.

  I have taken responsibility for other damages that your parents have asked for, including the glass door and the floors without complaint or excuse, as I felt I could have been more careful. However, this request is unreasonable. I have always acted in good faith with your parents, and I ask that they express the same good faith towards me.

Thanks,
E.

Hey E - appreciate the response.  Obviously as I am not there and can't verify neither story and condition of the couch, I'll try my best to mediate the situation.

I do agree with your sediment that wear and tear is totally acceptable, but from the description they told me, the couch is in a condition such that it would need to be replaced if the room is put back in the market. 

 The couch from my understanding was relatively new when you moved it. So 5-6 year life span under normal wear and tear shouldn't result in a replacement.

 I'll chat with them, relay your message and keep you posted.

Thanks,
H

Hi E,

I spoke to my parents and although they are in agreement that normal wear and tear is acceptable, they believe the condition of the couch is beyond that. 

They've cited that the couch in the living room was bought at the same time and made of the same material and is no where near the condition of the couch in your room.  In addition, they and myself included are a bit perplexed on why you have a knack on wearing out things a little more than other tenants (floors, doors etc...), again they cite the floors from the other basement tenant which is in pristine condition.

Their basis on couch replacement is based on the fact that once you move out they will be forced to replace it for the next tenant.  They unfortunately do not have the receipt.  

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
H

But when it came down to actually having sex it was a bit of a struggle. We tried doggy first but I tried finding the vagina but I guess mistakes were being made because I couldn't find the hole(I mean I found it but didn't if that makes sense), we tried multiple other postions like cowgirl but we couldn't get the stick in the whole that way either. Finally we tried missionary which seemed to work out and we both felt it. 

So my question is, Is this going to be normal? Will I only beable to have sex in 1 position, or was it because we both had no idea what we were doing to make the other positions work?

19,"22 F if it matters. I'll give as much TL;DR context to my life as I can.

4 years ago, 2 weeks before I left for college, it was found out my dad was cheating on my mom. Thankfully, I was gone for the semester and didn't experience the disaster immediately. I was off enjoying myself, experiencing freedom for the first time, etc. Of course I knew what was going on but I didn't want to hear it. My mom and I were always best friends because my dad ""worked"" (lied to us about that, saying he had 3-4 shifts per week but only had one), and of course I wanted to be there for her but I was far away and she talked to my sister about things, not me, because I am much, much younger than my sister. Parents stay together.

When I get back from my first year at college, I realize how fucked they are. I know my dad has always had depression, but it was so, so bad, and to this day has gotten worse. That first summer back my mom was going to therapy but didn't give the therapist all the information, they didn't know how bad it was. I had to call 911 on my mom for running off in the middle of a night while having an ""episode,"" had to talk her into putting the knife down, watched her cut her own clothes up with scissors on the floor because of the insanity that my father caused her to have. This was the worst summer of my life. Screaming every night, having no one to talk to because I couldn't bring this up to friends, and watching my mom deteriorate, as well as my dad.

My father and I were never close. He always made fun of me, my weight, and my interests. He is one of the reasons I developed an eating disorder at age 13, and have always wanted to hide my creative side (makeup, cosplay, etc.). Didn't matter because he'd be off at ""work"" and me and my mom would have fun. Well, now she won't let him out of her sight and she is a completely different person. She lost 30lbs quickly after this all happened due to stress, and over the past 3 years has had much work done on herself to feel confident and ""look good"" for my dad. She acts like a bimbo on purpose. Buys sexy clothes. which discomforts my sisters and I. He yells at me, and never seems to be happy with anything I do. He has made me cry in front of my friends. Out of me and my two sisters, it is safe to say I am the smartest and most successful at such a young age (I am not bragging, just stating what others have told me). I'm not asking for constant praise or anything, but I seriously cannot say the last time my dad initiated a hug with me or said ""I love you"" without me saying it first. My mom has said he gets jealous of me (I know, it sounds insane) because of the time I spent with her all these years, and he didn't get that time with her (and me I suppose).

Her episodes have gone to daily, to weekly, to monthly, to now just periodically, but her mentality stays the same. She works but will not let him (they're retired and money is fine so it doesn't matter). The person he cheated on my mom with is Hispanic, specifically Puerto Rican, and now she verbally will express her distaste for them. Calls Hispanic people trash. Gets worked up when she even sees something related to Spanish. They would never, EVER let me date someone of that background, I would surely be scolded (not that it matters rn anyways to me, I am happily talking to someone). Tonight, we were eating some leftover Christmas treats. They LOVE Italian stuff. Want me to marry an Italian, went to Italy, etc. Her sheer ingrained racism from what happened makes me sick to my stomach. In my mind, she is choosing to be fucking ignorant. I had fucking Hispanic friends in high school, and will even say, ""Mom, do you think (insert name) is trash?? Because you are saying that they are."" And she just dismisses me, or rolls her eyes. I have told her, time and time again, how her racist comments make me angry and to keep them to herself. Anyways, we were having cookies from Italy. She doesn't see that it says ""made in Italy,"" and says ""They're probably Spanish!"" I say that the languages are very similar because they're both Latin origin, and French also has similarities. She takes her dishes and cookies and slams them into the sink, walking to the back of the house. Gets the keys, asks my dad to ""Come for a ride"" with her. This means, time to chew him out.

This just happened, and I am needing to vent... this happens almost every time I am home though. If not something about my dad's cheating past, it is about me doing something ""wrong"" in my father's eyes (i.e. washing the dishes made him scream at me and me cry in front of my nieces 2 days ago because I wash them differently than he does. LITERALLY.), or my mom being racist, or acting like a fucking bimbo and testing my patience. I love them both, but she is going crazier, and he is just unbearable to be around and my other family agrees.

I feel anger towards them, and have sworn to never live with them again (I graduate soon and don't want to move back in at all). My mom says ""well we will see,"" but I would rather take a slight financial fall by continuing to pay rent where my college is until I find my career job (the search is going very well) instead of moving back in with them and saving maybe $1500 by not paying rent. I feel bad saying I am angry at them, and that they bother me, and that I don't enjoy being around them, but I cannot help it...

I've had increasing symptoms over the past year or two--weakness in my hands and arms and legs and hips, trouble chewing and swallowing, and my skin has become super-sensitive upon being touched, among other things. About a week ago, my boyfriend announced to me that he has become enamored with my younger sister (who is not disabled). She is also pretty and he jokes that she is stupid and a terrible human being, (though neither one of those to her face) and he laughs at her all of the time. (She thinks he's laughing with her when he's really laughing at her.) He wants me to have a conversation with her to tell her that he likes her and to convince her to like him. Over the past few days, they have been writing to each other on Facebook and having a great time with it. He keeps telling me all of the funny things they are writing to each other and said that he misses falling in love and that she's a lot of fun. My sister is bipolar and refuses to take meds and anyone who knows her, knows that she is no picnic to be around, especially as she has a history of being horrible to her friends, family, and boyfriends, as well as making huge life decisions because they offer short-term gains. He knows all of this and thinks that he can ""handle"" her. I've pointed out that it's tons of fun to flirt with someone, but it's different once you're living together and real-life settles in (i.e. chores and other obligations). I should point out that she is currently living with her boyfriend (of five years) who pays for everything and she ridicules him and nags him non-stop. My boyfriend wants to start dating her while she's still living with her boyfriend (say, wha?) and he's still living with me (say, WHA??!!)

He says that if I agree to let him live there until he finishes school in the spring, he will send me money from every paycheck and buy the house across the street and continue to help me with things.

I love my mother. She is one of the most important people in my life, and is practically the only family I have left. However, due to a combination of cultural differences (she was born in Japan, while she gave birth to me in the US), differences in circumstance, and inherent personality differences, she approaches various situations differently than I do. Which would be fine, except she tends to impose her views on me and this leads to a lot of conflict.

About my mom. She grew up in 60's/70's Japan, which was not a kind era to women, especially those with aspirations. She was also physically and mentally abused and eventually neglected as a child, living in poverty while having to basically raise her younger sisters throughout her school years. She came to America because she wanted to be a doctor, but both Japanese society and her own family were preventing her from doing so. Since then, she had to fight her way out of poverty, fight to complete her education (while raising myself and my brother), and eventually she achieved her dream.

She is an extremely smart and admirable person who went through a lot to get to where she is today, and I respect her. She means well, and wants to give my brother and I an easier upbringing than she had. However, this means that she projects herself heavily on me (as the elder sister), leading to a lot of problems.
-She tries to control what profession I go into and how I go about my day-to-day life. When I first told her in college I didn't want to be a doctor and instead become an engineer, she threatened to stop paying for my tuition. This was effective, as throughout high school and college, she had banned me from having a job in order to focus on studying, so I had no money saved up to support myself at that time.
-I have chronic depression with the occassional major depressive bout. She has very little understanding of depression, as she grew up in a culture that wasn't great about mental health in general. Any attempts at having a conversation about my depression leads to her getting angry and not understanding why I can't just logic my way out of it or work through it.
  -example: she will call me a ""failure"" or say my ""mind is diseased"" on a regular basis. Calling me a failure is seen as motivation in her eyes, due to her childhood, and the ""diseased-mind"" bit seems to be the best tact she can muster... a relic of older Japanese culture.
-Any time I express doubt or want to do things that deviate from her plans, the authoritarian parenting style she learned from Japanese culture combines with her strenuous life in a way that makes conversing with her hard. She either tries to shut me down and prevent me from making myself heard, or she shuts down and stops engaging in conversation, feeling hurt an betrayed.

A lot of what my mother does borders on emotional abuse, and while I love her, she often exacerbates my depression and I have been drawing myself away from her.

I have made the decision to temporarily stop persuing my post-bacc education and leave the state (my mother and I live in the same town atm). I plan on either getting a job or doing americorp for a few years as a way to help with my mental health.
She doesn't know yet.
With the way things have been going, I fear that she will either disown me or otherwise attempt to control my actions keep me from doing this. I worry that things will escalate in such a way that our relationship will be irreparably ruined.
If the conversation goes too badly, I will likely cut communications with her for my wellbeing, and I don't want that.

How do I have this conversation? How can I explain to my mother that I am not doing this to betray her? How do I tell her that a lot of her behavior, while well-intended, has actually hurt both me and our relationship?

My parents are Chinese immigrants who came to a country in Central America. They’ve been working 90 hours each week for over 25 years without taking days off so my brother and I could have an education. I just turned 19 and I’m starting college in a month.  

I’ve been helping my parents at work (small store, much like a 7/11 in the US. My mom and I work as cashiers and my dad stocks merchandise) since I was 13. I’d get off school and go straight to help them. But now since I’m going to college and it’s obviously going to take much more time and work, I won’t be able to help them as much as before. I’ve even considered forfeiting education so I can help them at work but I want to get an education. 

My brother (23) lives with us with his wife. He just had a baby and all the expenses were covered by my parents. His wife is taking care of the baby and won’t be working anytime soon (which is common in my culture). 

I just can’t help but feel pain each time I look at my parents because I feel like I’m betraying them by going to college and not finding a husband and settling down (which is what they want but they’re letting me choose my path in life).

Healthcare where I live is ‘free’ but it takes months or even a year to get a consultation. And we don’t have much money to afford going to a specialist to check up on my mom. 

I feel bad for not being able to help them, and if anything happens to my mom I’d blame myself. I love her too much and it breaks my heart every time I look into her eyes.

My guess is that they think I’m doing something illegal, which I have no clue where they would get that idea. If I even think about giving an argument, I’m being disrespectful and that everything i own is because of them. Theres nothing illegal/bad on any of my social media, but thats my private business, so I’m very against giving them my accounts. But if I disable the accounts, that looks suspicious as if I was doing something illegal.

33,"For some background, I'm a teenager in high school who's working in fast food. I have very high functioning autism, meaning that I usually get around fine as I've learned how to deal with most social interactions. Most people can't tell that I have it unless I tell them. Conversely, I have a lot of trouble communicating in unfamiliar situations, and this is one of them.

My boss is a cool guy and the workplace is fantastic, however I'm trying really hard to focus on school and I don't depend on the money that I receive from work at all. Hell, I only work 1-3 days a week, however the simple idea of having to go to work is extremely stressful to me. I'm really neurotic, so it's unbearable to be stuck at work when I know I'd otherwise be writing an essay or studying (I've made the mistake of choosing a program that's very high level for me, so I essentially have double or triple the work compared to most kids).

The point is, I have no idea how to tell him I'm quitting. Like, the literal sentences that I will say to him. I've kind of dug myself a bit of a hole already, as he asked me what my availability is after winter break, and I panicked and told him Fridays and Saturdays. I suppose that implies that I still plan on working, when in reality I want to quit two days before the break ends. As I said, he's a cool guy, but he's kind of intimidating and I'm fucking autistic. Not a good mix. I don't plan on beating around the bush or using some complex metaphor to get across to him, however I don't think I'll be able to speak properly if I try to be super blunt. My mom says to keep it simple and formal, like, ""Thank you for the opportunity to work here, however I'm letting you know that I'm quitting,"". Uhhh you could increase my social skills by 10 times and I still wouldn't pull that sentence off. Also, I work in a food court, not Wall Street.

34,"Hiya Reddit(:

When I was 20 years old, I found myself at a point in my life where I was completely lost everywhere except geographically.  Two years prior, I fell hard into a crystal meth addiction that robbed me of everything material, emotional, and spiritual.  I was nothing but a shell, void of everything except the drive to find more ice.  I went to treatment for three months, sober living for 11, and stuck with that routine for about a year and a half.  With that I was able to get a little taste of what life is supposed to be like, which is what is giving me the direction to make this post.  Quite a ways into my 23rd now, I am damn close to where I was 3 years ago, but I still have some sense of direction about myself, but not much.  I'm at the jumping off point now, and I don't want it to be in the wrong direction...  For as much of my life as I can remember, I have always wanted to live in some part of Europe, more specifically Northern Europe.  I think I want to turn this low point in my life into a radical (hopefully) positive change, and also follow my dream of getting of of the States, and into Europe.

Bit of backstory. YCS is in Sydney this year, and since me and my friend live relatively near he convinced me the year before to join, honestly it seemed pretty interesting. I barely play the game and only play occasionally but thought it would be fun. I am no expert in Yugioh, have like 2 shitty decks figured they were good enough to enter.

This is where the problem lies. My friend texts me and says my decks arn't good enough, they will be smashed. I tell him its ok, just wanna mess around honestly. Then roughly 3 weeks later, he texts me saying he went through a whole lot of trouble to get all these cards to improve my deck. These cards are expensive, total being around $75 aud. This is all without me asking him to do this.

I don't want to spend that much money on something I barely play but don't know how to break it to my friend gently that i don't want the cards he has gone through so much trouble to get. What should I do?

This is unfamiliar territory because all dogs I've met generally like me. This dog has a sketchy past before they adopted it so it has high anxiety and skittish...I don't take it personal or anything. But this dog has tried to come for me two times this evening and the owner was able to calm it down.

But in feb this dog will be here, without it's owners, which not only means it will already have more anxiety, but if it wants to bite me, there's no one here to calm it down.

I have a month or so to plan. It will be here for 10 days. Part of me was considering staying at an AirBnB...but I'm also kind of mad about it because I already pay rent and I shouldn't have to be annexed because I don't want to stay in a house where I could get attacked by a dog. 

I haven't yet spoken with the owner about this but I do know she already agreed to dogsit. She works 12hr shifts so wont be home much. I have most of my classes crammed in a few days/week next semester so I'll be home alone with this dog a lot.

I love dogs. I don't want to get bit. This isn't my house or my call. And the renting situation is under the table so I have no legal rights.

My mom quit smoking 5+ years ago. About 4 weeks ago she went through a very stressful event.... The next day she bought one packet and told me within hours of having the first ciggerate. She is having a very stressful time at the moment in general though.

Anyway she promised she wouldn't do it again. 2 weeks after that I found evidence of smoking while at her house. I confronted her about it and she was completely honest, saying that she was disgusted by it all and had really truly quit this time. I believed her but asked her that if she DID ever have another cigarette to tell me within 24 hours. I've been saying all along I'll support &amp; help her through this to quit.

Today, I found more evidence again at her house of her smoking. More effort had been taken to hide it this time I think? But she hasn't told me anything, she hasn't admitted it..... I asked her how she was feeling with the ""quitting journey"", whether she was tempted &amp; how she was coping. Mom said she was doing fine, coping well etc.

*Now we move onto the bigger problem.* She is my ONLY family, and she has very severe heath issues. So do I. My conditions are made worse by being around smoke to the point where I struggle to be near smokers at all. Mom is in a bad financal situation (big part of the stress she is under) and also has health issues that could be made worse by smoking.

I don't want to lose her. I don't know how long I have left with my mom and I love her so much. It feels like she is pushing me away and talking away our time together by risking herself like this. But I'm clueless as to what to do. I have never smoked, so I don't understand what she is going through.

I started at like $14.50 an hour (I was a temp employee) and it was a shit show at first. I barely survived getting fired. At the time, I had extreme issues with drug addiction. I never used everyday but almost all of my extra income (after bills were paid) went to drugs. I was then moved to another department because they were hurting for people. This was strange that I got hired on. It sounds like i'm going to brag here, but it's the absolute truth. I was insanely good at that job. I could do in 4 hours what it took everyone else 8 hours to do. However, my attitude was absolute shit. So, I was ultimately hired on, and my pay raised to 15/hr, based purely on my ability to get the job done quickly and efficiently. I continued working here and then I don't fucking know what happened but something clicked and I started to get it together. One day I just got tired of relying on drugs and I threw a whole gram of heroin down the toilet. From that day forward, almost everything about me improved. I started hitting the gym. My attitude was no longer much of an issue (though it still did cause a few problems from time to time). My boss, who had to correct my behavior on several occasions, gave me an insanely heartfelt compliment about how impressed she was with me over the past few months and how much I had improved as an employee. She eventually moved to a new department and I got a new boss. For a time me and the new boss had a good relationship. I worked with him for about 3 months and then he called me and said ""hey, we are raising your pay to $20.19/hr."" I was blown away. Didn't know what to say. From there I don't know what happened. I guess I just let it get to my head that I was untouchable and everything deteriorated from there. Eventually I got hooked back on drugs (that;s definitely what started my path to being a shitty employee again). It started with my 70+ year old neighbor selling me his lortab prescriptions. Then, I was laid off from that job and January 5th, 2018 was my last day. I was given a pretty large payout (roughly 6,000 dollars). On top of that I withdrew my 401k and that was about another 6,000 dollars. That money has been squandered on drugs and shit I don't need. I did buy a roughly 10k dollar car for 3,000 which was a great deal so that;s good but other than that, yea I fucked myself pretty much. Anyway, I quit doing lortabs in favor of Kratom (literally the dumbest fucking drug in the world). It's cheap. It's accessible. It's a good high. And that is the current beast I'm trying to get off my back. I've been close several times to being done with it for good. I made it about 6 days with zero kratom a couple of times before I had mental lapses and found myself right back to square one. I tried suboxone and honestly that shit is way worse and I would just rather do kratom. So. Here I am.  Currently looking for a job, and I guess the one positive I do have is that I actually quit smoking weed, and with Kratom being legal and not easily discovered on a drug test, I can most likely pass a drug test. However, I'm terrified that whatever job I do get will ultimately be lost because I can't figure out how to quit doing drugs. I would love to find a way to spend at least 2 weeks in a rehab but I don't have insurance and I can't pay out of pocket. Idk what to do. Idk where to go. Idk who to talk to. This is my last resort. I'm sorry for the long post, and honestly i'm sorry for a lot of things because this is not the life I had planned for myself. Any and all advice would be appreciated and I do know I need to quit drugs and I have an extreme desire to do so but I lack the proper knowledge of how to execute this desire. Thanks.",01Jan2019,1

I’ve been living with my aunt and uncle for the past couple of months, and I don’t think they know tomorrow’s my birthday. I thought my parents were gonna tell them, but I don’t think they did.

I have a tendency to overthink things, and to overthink overthinking things, etc. Here’s what’s been going on in my head for the past few days:

**Two days ago**

*I should tell them.* They’re gonna feel really bad if I don’t and they don’t do anything for it.*

*I shouldn’t tell them. It feels really silly, like I’m begging them to make a big deal.*

*I should tell them. It may feel silly, but it’s gonna feel even sillier counting down to New Year’s Day.*

*Ugh, I’ll deal with this tomorrow.*

**Yesterday**

*I shouldn’t tell them. They might already know and might be planning a surprise that I’ll ruin.*

*I should tell them. A spoilt surprise will disappoint them far less than nothing at all.*

*I shouldn’t tell them. Besides, it’s too late for them to do anything anyway.*

*Ugh, I’ll deal with this tomorrow.*

**Today.**

It’s an hour and a half to my birthday. My aunt and uncle and their family our downstairs, as well as a few people they’ve invited over, and their counting down the The Day and I’m panicking.

I’m not sure if I’m panicking because I care about my birthday, or if I just don’t want to deal with the awkwardness and second-hand embarrassment. What should I do? Should I just let them forget?

I have anxiety and depression and she uses my diagnosis against me when we get into an argument. We had a huge argument that just wrapped up with her telling me that “I should’ve aborted you.” I called her stupid and an idiot for expecting me to just take her shit. I have no contact with my extended family (they’re crazy as well). and I have no friends in my area as I have low self-esteem, which results in me refusing to put myself out there.

The only person I had was my grandfather and he passed away in November 2017. Since then, I’ve had no one to reach out for support other than my psychologist and psychiatrist. A couple of months after his passing, my mother said this to me over the phone. “Your grandfather only saw the potential in me, not you.” She has called me a leech, bitch, the f word (I’m straight by the way), failure, mistake, etc...but that right there, was the most hurtful thing she ever said to me.

86,"Hey  

Sometimes one ask oneself what is love. I think I can tell what love is about. It is about attention, if is about constant care, and constant interest. When she is around, there is barely a minute you cannot think about her. You are acting like you are currently engaged in some other funny business, while you are surely checking her out secretly. Whom she is talking to, whom she pays attention to, what she does, how she is doing, whether she is doing fine or not. She is the center of your world. And you know why she is the center. It is not about the way she flips her hair, it is about the similarities, about how she cares. Her benevolent heart, her affectionate behavior. Her beliefs are gracious. Is she perfect, you have asked yourself occasionally, but the answer to this question was always clear: she is certainly not. And you have also always known: perfect is boring. Instead you value how she approaches the world, sometimes even naïve, profoundly imperfect. She struggles with past events, with future developments, with everything but the presence. You surely try to help her. And when you do so, she hugs you, telling you how much she values you, even loves you, saying “ich hab dich lieb”, you just cry internally, desperately, because you know that this love is about caring, about interest, about helping, about being there for one another, about friendship, but you realize that this friendship is not about loving each other, at least not in a way you deeply desire. You help her, every time she needs help, you are there and you are the one person in her live she cannot miss. You are her bodyguard her saviour in need, her big brother. But, then you realize, you are her brother, not her boyfriend. And you will never be. You need distance, you need detachment, you need to dissolve this attachment, but how is this possible when you are living right next to each other, when she ask for your presence constantly: are you supposed to ignore her, to hurt her? Are you supposed to flee in a foreign country, to reset your live, to meet other people, maybe another girl, maybe having all that funny business again? What is this about you ask yourself, late in the night, maybe a bit drunk.

I will try and make this as short as possible and try to be clear because I’m kind of frantic.

I saw him a handful of times more but eventually didn’t think this was something I was interested in pursuing so I decided to cut the relationship off and did.

96,"So I (20F), have been friends with a couple (18F &amp; 21M) for just over a year now. We've been very close since meeting and have only strengthened our relationship together. A few times, me and my female friend have shared some drunk kisses with consent from her partner, and have apparently discussed having a threesome with me when they've been alone. About a month or two ago, my male friend bought it up with me, and I said I'd be interested in having a threesome with them. 

Cut to the end of this year. I had just spent about 5 days away with them and had a lot of fun. The night we got back, we and our other friend went and had some drinks and some weed. We got home, and continued drinking, and it was clear there was a lot of sexual tension between us. When our other friend went to bed, things lead into other things, and we ended up all sleeping together. It was all very nice and fun between all of us. We all slept in the same bed and cuddled together.

We slept together again the next night (New Years) and again, it was great. In the morning we cuddled and stuff again after sleeping together in the bed.

But here's where it gets a bit complicated. My male friend and I went and had a cigarette together after we'd had sex and his girlfriend, my female friend, was asleep. We began talking about the experience. He asked me if I was okay since he and she both know my mental health is kinda frail. I assured him that I was. He then went on to explain that he was very happy, and that if I found someone I wanted to pursue a monogamous relationship with, then it would be disappointing but okay. I laughed. Then, he said that it wasn't like I was their girlfriend or anything, and I could do whatever I want. I had a weird reaction to that but tbvh I don't care enough about the comment lol. But it's strange, because he has been treating me like a partner ever since we had the first threesome, you know, kissing me in the morning and playing with my hair where he hadn't before, and leaning on me and putting his arm around me where he hadn't before. Dunno if I'm reading too much into it here.  My female friend has not been treating me like a partner, just for clarity. 

He also mentioned that he was sure that I'd probably start to care for my female friend in a more intimate way now. I agreed with his assumption. I said that I'd probably be a little bit attached to them for a short period of time and then even out. I think he took it to mean that I wouldn't leave their house, and said that they'd want their alone time which I confirmed with him, but then we started talking about other things.

Anyway, this is getting long. Basically, I have no idea what to do, because without some clearer boundaries I worry of our friendship breaking up, their relationship breaking up, etc. It's strange, cause we seem to work as a threesome, and realistically speaking, I'd like to sort of be their girlfriend, and I really enjoy having sexual relations with them, but the messages I'm getting are mixed. My male friend does a lot of the talking and sometimes I worry that his knowledge on the situation is not fully accurate, or a generalising sort of thing where his personal opinion becomes everyones. I am also fried of him passing on my half formed thoughts about it to his girlfriend and the communication becoming fuzzy.

I'd like to talk to them about it, but I want to talk to my female friend first. I don't really now what I'd say, and I don't want to do My Special Thing (ruining something before it's even begun) by overthinking and coming on too strong at the beginning like WOW DATE ME GUYS, but I was thinking that I could ask about setting some ground rules for it all. I'm quite pleased with that idea, but I don't know how to phrase it without coming off like I'm Not Chill, or that they think I think They're Not Chill.

So this girl I've known for around 3 years so far, lets call her ""K"". So K and I have been talking for quite some time. We're both Army vets, we met overseas in Kuwait, and we hit it off and outside of a few small arguments we talked pretty much every day there and we still talk pretty much every day. Unfortunately she lives up north and I live in Kansas.

So just a few days ago, she actually came down to Kansas and we hung out quite a bit. She literally brought me TONS of things that I like for Christmas. Like, we bought each other things but she bought me at least $30 worth of my favorite chocolate ALONE and this is definitely not the first time she has done something like this. The first night ended with both of us having a few drinks at a bar and sort of making out in the parking lot before going back to our places, and the second night we went and did some exploring down in the southern part of KS. Making out with someone probably means nothing when you've both had a few drinks, right? I had a few other moments to make a move but I didn't, specifically because of the problem below.

To be perfectly blunt, I am madly in love with this girl, she definitely knows I'm crushing hard, I've even told her I've never met anyone like her in my life, but I don't have a clue how she feels about that because I can't really get her to say or even hint how she feels, and I'm terrified of the awkward moment where I say something and it ends up that she's just THAT nice and values me as a friend. I don't know whether to just hold her as a good friend and move on with my life, or wait (She says she wanted to move to KS in the next year or two, but never said specifically because of me)

Prices go up all the time, there’s inflation, etc. but it’s nice to know income increases too. I mentioned it to my SO, not bragging, just happy, and wanting to share the good news. A few days later my SO mentioned that we should readjust our bill responsibilities, since now I make more. I have more money, so I should pay more for our bills. They did not get a raise, so they don’t have more money coming in, but now their bills should be reduced. Lol So who is getting the raise now? I pay $2700 for the mortgage, they pay $1200. Now they are proposing that I pay $2800 and their portion should go down to $1100. And maybe next year, I could even go up to $2900, and they would only have to pay $1000.

Needless to say he recently lost two employees and is needing replacement which is great timing. I was able to come in and drop off an application and physical resumé. Within 24 hours i got an email saying that they would look at my refernces and schedule an interview. That was 2 days ago. This morning i was awoken by a call from the hiring manager scheduling my interview this Friday at 10. This all sems like it is happening very smoothly and quickly which i am very happy about.

I can’t help but feel hurt. Not only because they cancelled on me, but because we are very close friends. We have known each other for years and hung out all the time. This has never happened before.

All I’ve done so far is this. I slid up and asked them where they were. They told me and I responded with “Oh. Ok”. I was hoping to imply I was hurt.

I don’t want to outright say I was hurt, since I don’t want to sound self centered or rude, but I do want the message to get across that I’m hurt. It’s ok for them to hang out together, but to just cancel on me and go by themselves isn’t the way they should do it.

The only greatest thing going for me was this relationship until it wasn't.  I have decided to focus on myself and be the best person i can be. I decided to further my education and im getting back into it finally after 3 years. i got into the school i wanted. However for some odd reason im not feeling depressed or as sad as i should be. Im not constantly crying or an emotional mess as i thought i would be. i do have break downs here and there. i do have nightmares of him with other women which do really get to me.

I believe her brother is in his late 20s to early 30s so he's older than I am (I'm 22). He seemed really chill and laid back, I really wanted to talk with him but we seemed to have nothing in common. 

Then later on, my brothers casually make homosexual jokes around me ( mostly not geared towards me ) and I just laugh with them slightly nervously. If he was single &amp; talkative I wouldn't mind hanging out with him, but I just kept my feelings to myself. 

When I see another manly man I sometimes get attracted to that more than a woman. Women are just impossible for me to date as a guy.

120,"My friend (28F) and I (22F) had discussed going out for New Year's. She said she was down to do it as long as she was feeling okay. She had been fairly sick throughout Christmas. Well December 30th comes along and I once again ask her if we are going to do anything and she decides to flip flop about her still feeling sick but will probably be okay. I keep suggesting places to go and she doesn't give me any sort of confirmation. Finally she again says she thinks she'll be too sick to go. It seemed to me like she never wanted to go in the first place but was stringing me along for some apparent reason. 

She had been suggesting all semester about planning dinners and doing stuff over the Christmas break and so far nothing has occurred. Why do people do this? It is only disappointing to me especially when I've been there for her through the problems she's been dealing with and she has yet to show me any sort of reciprocation when I've had problems. I'm feeling used and I don't like it. 

What should I do? I don't want to initiate contact with her after our discussion last night because I think she should be the one to reach out as I'm tired of trying to make the effort to confirm some sort of plan for us to get together. I thought I had developed a very strong friendship with her over this past semester in school but it is starting to seem like as usual she is another person who I cannot rely on to be there for me or to commit to plans.

It was out of nowhere and a big shock to the both of us.  Growing up my mom had constant bad boyfriends that had a lot of bad affects on me, because of how they treated me or my mom. She took a break from dating for around four years, and once she had found him it took awhile for my to trust him, but we let him into our lives and I considered him like a second father to me. He left pretty abruptly several days ago and I feel so brokenhearted but not nearly as much as my mother of course. They were planning to get married in May and she is just destroyed now. My mom grew up in this city and has lived here her whole life and so have I. We have always talked about moving growing up but we never did. I suggested yesterday because I genuinely think it would be great for my mom to get a fresh start. I am currently 18 and I just finished the first semester of my freshman year of college. I have all my friends here, who I have known for my whole life, and our entire extended family is here also, that were fairly close with. I was planning on moving after I finished my bachelors anyway, even though it seems hard to plan that far into the future. I have a feeling all my friends will be moving out of our city eventually, and I'd miss my family but I know I would still see them more than a couple times a year. As you can tell I am really going back and forth with myself on this. I think it would be really great for my mom to get a fresh start, and she told me she would love to move. I would probably have to take a semester off college before returning in the fall if we moved right now, but I know I would still be able to graduate on time. thoughts on whether or not we should move or just any general advice on how we an get through this hard time?

126,"So, I have a friend who's been using everyone in the friend group.

Let's call this friend Jasmine.

Jasmine started off as an innocent, shy and quiet girl who seemed nice enough.

Asked me to include her in our friend group.   
She seemed okay, so I did. 

Everyone took to her very quickly, and I was happy with that. 

In freshman year, she was cementing herself in the friend group.   
In sophomore year, she 'wheeled' with a very, very popular guy in our friend group, and got a lot of fame and popularity in our school for doing so. Let's call the guy Gary. After she gained enough popularity, she decided she didn't need me anymore to introduce her to friends, and starting treating me in a condescending way, and brushing me off all the time. No one noticed/called her out, but I'm used to it, since no one thinks I care or can get hurt.

Anyways, there was some drama in our group that resulted in two people getting the boot. One was the person who started it (unfairly) by making claims about some girl in our group being a perverted stalker, and the other was the accused, who could never mend her reputation despite the accuser being proved wrong. 

She eventually ditched Gary, after she milked him for all his popularity. Gary around this time started getting depressed and suicidal thoughts, and tried to go to Jasmine for help. Jasmine literally told him ""Ok that's nice"" and brushed him off. Got super pissed over this and tried to cheer Gary up, but Gary felt super worthless because he always thought Jasmine was basically his best friend. Anyways, after this, I started to notice a pattern. She never hung out with people ""useless"" or ""uncool"" (By this I mean no partying, drinking or drugs) and would only text me if she wanted food or notes. She would literally sit next to me and play Township, while expecting me to take notes for her as well. We also did a group project together. My grandma fell down the stairs during this time, and I had to spend lots of time at the hospital. I was also diagnosed with anxiety, ADHD, Asperger's, depression, as well as some other things that I didn't share. I did around half the work, and then told her to do the other half. She literally told everyone I didn't do anything, and that all I did was sit and watch her work. (Another lie, she was playing Township while I asked for updates of my grandma's status) She also joined in on the bullying I faced, and I literally had fucking recordings, but no one would believe me despite my evidence. 

Anyways, start of junior year, she's been a real bitch and only talking to people who still benefit her. I'm so sick of this, but I'm worried that no one will believe me, or that it'll cause more drama in our friend group.",01Jan2019,1

134,"I woke up today and it sounded like my mom was talking on the phone or something.

It turned out it was just sleep talking. She takes ambien to help her sleep.

So I went to get water, and when I walked down the hall my father(who was also in bed) turned around pretty fast. It seemed like I startled him. And then I thought why? Was he raping my mom? 

But maybe he was just turning around. People do that. After this my mother made the occasional moaning sound, but this is normal and she has sleep apnea. 

I also checked and he lied with his back to her as she did this. 

He didn't get up to close the door or anything. 

Shortly after my mom had a coughing fit and that woke her up. So if that woke her up, surely THAT would have too. 

But she was very out of it and still kind of snoring, but speaking coherently.

She got back in bed and also immediately fell asleep again. That freaked me out a bit. It is a symptom of sleep apnea, though. 

This all happen at six and she took the ambien probably at 1 or 1:30.

I heard her get up in the night, so maybe around 3:00.

She got up another time and tried to get into the bathroom, but I was in there, so she went back to bed and, again, almost immediately back to sleep.

Not long after, she got up and did what she had to, but went back to bed again and same story.

I'm thinking, considering her behavior, that she would've reacted to being raped like that. 

Both times I talked to her she understood and was coherent. Maybe I should see if she remembers these incidents of me talking to her and the coughing and so on. 

But I'm really scared. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this. I don't know what to do or how to get peace of mind. ",01Jan2019,1

So like I said a few months ago he was showing me something on his camera roll and I saw that he had saved a nearly nude picture of a girl off of social media. I didn’t say anything about it at the time and I don’t think that he knew I saw it either. I asked him about it the following weekend and he said it was a hot girl he saw on twitter and he saved the picture so I could go back to it and I wouldn’t be notified that he liked it. He couldn’t really give me a straight answer about why he saved it but I told him it made me insecure and he promised he would not do it again. He was showing me something on his camera roll again a few weeks later and I saw another nearly nude picture of another girl. He at first tried to deny it but I called him out and he broke down and told me that he saved another picture of a girl off of Twitter. I have seen these girls on my twitter TL before so I know he isn’t cheating and they were not personally sent to him. I found it very hurtful because he knows that I have a lot of body confidence issues and I recently told him how unfollowing a lot of IG and twitter girls who posted a lot of nearly nude photos helped me since I wasn’t making the mental comparisons as much every day.

147,"I've been working a few hours per week in an office for over a year, there's a guy who's looked at me a lot but never really talked to me - until the Christmas party two weeks ago when he was drunk, obviously different environment too. Anyway, fast-forward to tonight and he messaged me on FB, we chatted a bit, and he was tipsy so he said the following:

&gt; Yeah your awesome, well if I'm at it, you're canny hot like 

 I said he was wrong and obviously drunk

&gt;Nah haha I speak the truth! I'd prob get bollocked at work but you are lovely and have a cracking arse  
&gt;  
&gt;And legs

For reference apparently at work there's strict rules about staff like him getting involved with staff like me, also he did acknowledge he wouldn't have said this to me if he wasn't drunk. There was also a bit in the conversation where he thought I said I liked him, and I said I'd like to go to a gig with him so he may have taken that the wrong way. Awkward. 

Generally if a guy makes a comment like that I'd think it was creepy, especially as it was straight to telling me I had a nice ass, I like being able to have normal human conversations without something like this being aid out of nowhere. But he was drunk and in general he doesn't com across s too disrespectful, so should I cut him some slack on this? ",01Jan2019,1

I have a great career and have money, I have a super close supportive family, good friendships with people I love and trust, fulfilling hobbies and talents that create beautiful things, I work out frequently and am fit, I take care of my appearance and consider myself pretty, im well traveled and do it often, I’m in therapy currently working on myself and have been all year, I have no problem going to see a movie by myself or whatever else. I also put myself out there with dating, giving a ton of different types of guys chances, talking and having several dates to get to know them before letting it end out of mine or his disinterest, im extroverted and polite and positive. All the stuff I should be doing right? 

But I cry myself to sleep at least once a month because I am just tired of not having a man that really loves me and chooses me and accepts me. Someone to share my great life with and to support and give love to. I feel like no matter what I do to make myself feel complete its just never going to work. Because marriage and love is really the thing I truly want and have always wanted. What if I’m just never going to find the right guy? 

What’s next for me? Antidepressants, trying to get into a religion so I can believe it’s all gods plan, settling for a man I don’t have feelings for, or continuing to do what I do, wait it out and just cry a lot?

162,"I’m not proud of this story but please read the whole context before responding. It’s quite a long one so bear with me.

I’m a 23 year old male who works in a retail store. I am planning to leave this job in April to travel overseas and have been sinking all of my disposable income into paying for the trip over the past six months.

In July last year, a new girl started at work, 19 years old. She is very attractive and very flirty. We started to hit it off, so I asked her out and she said yes. However, over the following days, she started brushing me off and then txt me out of the blue to say she was in the middle of a bad breakup and wasn’t actually ready to date.

I’m a pretty emotionally vulnerable person (father and brother both committed suicide and consequently I’ve developed real difficulties allowing myself to be vulnerable. Which I’m working on.). So this hit me pretty hard; but I think handled it reasonably well.

I did really like her and kept talking to her over the following weeks but in the end she went back to her ex. So I had to give it up. Ultimately we stayed friendly at work and I confided to her my emotional vulnerability.

I spent the following six months focussing on me. I let go of my attraction to her and put my energy into working out, planning my trip, learning languages and practicing guitar. I’ve had a really good year in the end.

Then two weeks ago, this girl (who has now been single again for a few months) txted me out of the blue and asked if I wanted to go out some time. I was absolutely elated because, as I said, I’m really into this girl.

So I went out with her and, aside from a few awkward moments, it seemed to go well. She even txt me not fifteen minutes afterwards and said she had a good time.

But the cold shoulder started happening and it became obvious she was backing off again. I confronted her and she revealed that she was really unsure about things. Sometimes she really likes me and sometimes she has doubts. She also said she thinks being single just works for her at the moment.

I was a little hurt and reluctantly reminded her that I’m not in a good emotional state for her to play games with me. Which, I knew would pretty much close the door on this relationship ever happening. But I felt I had to be honest.

A few days later, her friend tells me she’d just spent her day off driving to another town, two hours away for a Tinder date. I was pretty annoyed considering what just happened. In my frustration, I sent a passive aggressive txt letting her know that I’d been told about what she was up to; and then I decided to just ghost her going forward. I wasn’t giving her anymore of my energy.

Well that must’ve gotten to her because two days into ignoring her, I came out from my lunch break to find her new Tinder friend waiting in the store. They immediately went off together for about half an hour and must’ve had a good time because they decided to have a little make-out session in front of me.

I was seriously furious. I mean, it really, really hurt. Just a week ago I’d been on a date with her getting excited about the prospect of finally getting to the next level. And she was encouraging me the whole time.

I caught up to her as she went into the back room and I really lost my temper. I mean...I was out of line. I raised my voice, swore at her, told her I thought she was a cruel, bad person and, probably, in the heat of the moment I might’ve come across as pretty intimidating.

She ended up in tears. And when I saw her crying, it really struck me how I was behaving; so I relented immediately. I apologised as profusely as I could and did everything I could to calm her down. But, of course, she was mad at me.

I’m really ashamed of how I acted. I mean, I can’t reconcile myself as being someone who would harass a co-worker. I feel morally abhorrent. But I’m still angry at her for fucking with my head.

And as well as the guilt, I’m now worried about my job. If I lose it before April I won’t have the money for my trip and it’s gonna really create a hard situation for me.

I talked to two mutual friend of ours (who are also fellow coworkers) and they’ve both surprisingly backed me up in the situation (thought not condoning my outburst). Apparently the girl had been telling everyone that we went out and that I was the one who had asked her to go. I’m known to be an extremely honest man, which is thankfully working in my favour, because both of my friends believed me immediately and are telling me that it isn’t okay for her to be making out that I’m instigating everything.

Anyway one of the two co-workers sat down with the girl and apparently she’s agreed not to go to a manager about it, so long as we move on and I leave her alone going forward. But I’m wondering if I should be nervous? I have to work with her tomorrow and I’m concerned her new man might show up to confront me, or she may even change her mind and pursue action against me with management.

I’m conflicted because I’m genuinely sorry for the way I acted towards her and I’m also wanting to protect my job. I know I fucked up. I know I can’t take back what I did or justify it. I guess if management ask me about it, all I can do is be honest about the circumstances and how I behaved; then try my best to express my guilt and desire to repair the situation.

What do you think? To what degree is my job really at risk here? Is there anything I can do to make this girl feel safer and less resentful of me in the aftermath? Do I even deserved to be forgiven?

This has to have been the most mental things I’ve ever done.

Tldr;

Coworker asked me out, knowing I really liked her and have major emotional hangups. She then proceeded to mess with my head and made out with another guy in front of me, causing me to snap and chew her out, reducing her to tears.

My dad has never been physically abusive toward my family that I’ve seen but he has been abusive toward my dog. It’s not often and the first time I ever saw it I was 12 and so scared and I felt so powerless.

I’m a counseling major and I’m 90% sure my dad has bipolar disorder but he’s afraid of any mental health professionals and refuses to believe in mental health and things it’s all a lie. 

Early in high school I had a legit mental breakdown and my dad told me it was all my in my head. He refuses to take responsibility for anything and anytime he and my mom argue he just tells her it’s her fault, and that she’s a bitch and she needs to stop lying about literally anything. And he just starts yelling and if scares me. Even today as an adult it scares me. Every time he yells I just get so anxious and it’s like I’m 12 again.

I go to college, it’s far from my house and i only come back for break. I have a boyfriend who I can live with for the rest of winter break but I have a little brother and a dog and I am so afraid to leave them.

171,"So growing up I was always the more introverted one, it sounds like i'm bragging but I was a lot smarter and just better at things, I think partially because I would research stuff and iv'e kind of always had an obsession with knowing everything, Ive never really been ambitious in terms of making money and to be honest I would be quite happy with a shitty job the rest of my life as I find happiness in well knowing things. My sister on the other hand was always the loud favourite child that was always put on display and paraded around when she was younger but since she's gotten older she has kind of faded into the background, she has always been the opposite to me in that she craves attention and money, her goals in life always seem to revolve around how she is seen by others rather than what she's doing. I think she would like to be seen as this iconic trail blazer but the problem is she just isn't that sort of person, in all honesty she's incredibly boring and safe and expects people to look up to her when her intention really is to get people to look up to her, all these heroes throughout history are worshipped because they did stuff, not just because they decided they wanted everyone to like them. Anyway I guess this is where the jealousy comes in, so even though I despise attention I do tend to be a magnet to it, Im always getting praise for my work mainly in photography and film making and it drives my sister crazy, she becomes incredibly bitter towards me even though iv'e done nothing to antagonize her and its led to her just being a pain in the ass, whenever i get commended on my work she will try to steal the spotlight by acting all sad or by putting me down.

My solution to the problem was to basically boycott our friendship until I was reimbursed for my shirt. Fast forward, and I haven’t talked to him in roughly 5 months because of the incident.

My main goal right now is to make the basketball team so I don't go to many parties or things like that.

It **is** me and I know that, and what could I do to change it? I'm not shy person, I can talk to people, just with girls I get flabbergasted (yes, flabbergasted).

I’m afraid coming out with my feelings to her would either ruin the awesome friendship we have now or cause distress in her life that she really doesn’t need with her current situation (or both).

Maybe I’m being unreasonable here, but it just scares me. All I know is that if I keep on acting like my feelings for her are completely platonic, there will be stability. But my heart can hardly hold back what I feel. Telling her would be such a relief, but also be filled with uncertainty.

Also I’m fine with just being friends. I want to be there for her in any capacity that is good for her. However, it would just be nice to know if there’s somewhere we could go deeper than that, because that’s something I would like.

194,"im a 23 year old guy

the female concierge of my apartment is probably in her late 60s, her oldest kid is her 32 year old son

there've been a few times where as going towards the door exit, and I turn my head around, she just happens to be looking at me. I continue walking again and then turn my head around, she's still looking... This happens once more, even as I'm outside.  
I didn't wanna experience this awkward moment again, so I just gave up on turning around and looking if she was still looking in my direction, so I stopped turning my head around everytime I exited the building

not sure if this is continuing to happen, but I don't want to know 

She's also ""snuck"" glances at me while I was about to go into the elevator to my suite, and as I turned to look at the front desk, she suddenly turned her head horizontally away.

When I'm sometimes a few feet from the main building doors (which are transparent), she will make long eye contact with me without breaking the stare.   
She unlocks the fob key door for all residents cuz she's talkative and likes chitchatting with many residents, but I was wondering if unlock the door is another way for her to easily disguise her intentions of making eye contact with me, she could easily play it off by saying ""oh, I open the door for everyone!""

Another time I was having a conflict with my parents visiting me at my apartment. Two times, she assumed the position of ""mediator"" and when she was criticizing me or giving me a pep talk, she brought her face right up in front of mine, her face was literally only a few inches away from mine. I could see all the wrinkles on her face. At that moment, she put on a stern face.  
I was trying to avoid eye contact and looking away, because I was uncomfortable, the physical distance was just too close, but she continued to have her face right up in front of mine.

I think she was slightly faking the stern expression part, but she could disguise her ability to get within a few inches of my face by playing it off as if her stern demeanour and presence signaled an ""air of authority"" 

I know when I go see my therapist, my therapist always sits a few feet away from me, and never has her face upclose to mine  
She told me things like any parent would do like ""respect your parents because they're not going to be here with you forever"" in an authoritative kind of way

and once my dad freaked out when he was visiting my apartment and I wasn't in the building, she started to express concern for me, at the end of the mental health prep talk, she told me to ""okay have a good day and please give a call to daddy and tell him I said hi, okay?""  
Why would she just not say ""father"" instead of ""daddy""? sounds infantilizing to me  


anyway, other times, when I didn't give gifts to my mom or dad cuz I don't get along with my parents, she pestered me by insisting that I show my appreciation and by telling me ""it's the one day of the year where you can show appreciation for your mother""  
I sighed and relented and said I could give my mom a thank you card.   
She said ""No, no, no! Give her something big and meaningful, like a bunch of flowers or make her bed in breakfast, or invite her out to dinner!""

recently, I gave her a new year's card that I wrote for her and a medium coffee double cream double sugar

she read the card and questioned whether or not it was my own writing and she told me ""I didn't expect this to be your writing, it looks like your mother's writing!""   
I get that my writing is very neat, a professor and two of my school peers have commented in the past that my writing looks awesome (not to brag about myself, but just to give context),

but to tell me this is to express a lack of trust in my writing and to express ignorance by holding the sexist assumption that women have neater handwriting than men

I don't know what to think of any of this this, and I honestly think her behaviours and thoughts may be out of ignorance than ill will, but the making long eye contact situation going on makes me feel very awkwarded out  
but Idk what do you guys think? Is any of this inappropriate? and if so, in what way?",01Jan2019,1
195,"So I've been going out with *boy* for about a year and I don't know how to tell him when situations make me uncomfortable or when I don't want to stuff. I guess I have some kind of anxiety about that stuff because my previous boyfriend was an abusive dickhole who always forced me to do things I don't like.

It's not big stuff, but just things I don't know how to say no to, such as

-showering together. If I say I'll just shower after him he picks me up and carries me to the shower and blocks me from leaving

-cuddling at night. I'm fine with cuddling but I don't like cuddling when I'm trying to sleep because it just makes me feel awkward and I toss and turn a lot before actually falling asleep. Everytime I move his arm or move away he just keeps cuddling.

-sex. Sometimes when I'm not in the mood but he is, I'll be too awkward to say no so I'll just kind of not reciprocate and go sort of limp. He usually doesn't stop trying until he realises he can't actually, get in because I'm not wet enough.


So, I guess I'd just like advice on how to bring up how stuff like this makes me uncomfortable. I just find it hard because it's stuff that I don't really have a reason to not like so I don't want to sound crazy. ",01Jan2019,1

200,"Hopefully this is the right subreddit to post this and I’m also going to apologize for the long post in advance.

Some background: I think I’ve been depressed since my sophomore year of college (4 years ago) at one of the best schools in the country. My parents realized that something seemed off about my behavior then, even going so far as to visit me out of the blue to make sure that I was alright, even though I went to school 5 hours away. I think they chalked it up to me doing poorly in some tough classes (which had never really been an issue before) and to their credit they followed up with me all the time to make sure that I was okay, but it’s been far more than performing poorly in classes. 

Since then I’m pretty sure I’ve been very depressed, but only truly started to comprehend it recently. I lost all drive and ambition that once my family and friends would consider a trademark of mine throughout my life. I no longer really cared about what I was doing or about my future. I’ve been living with so much self-hatred (from failing my idealized career path, failed advances/relationships, etc.) for so long since then and it’s finally starting to really weigh me down unbearably to the point of suicidal thoughts. I know that I could never do it, but I can’t help but to think that it would be so much easier if I just didn’t exist. And i know the whole shpeal about it being a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but sometimes it seems like the best option. I’ve been walking around with a heavy weight in my chest that only keeps on getting worse.

I’ve taken off work since Christmas and I finally go back on Wednesday but I don’t know if I can go back except that I need to in order to pay my student loans. I’ve been putting off projects that I shouldn’t have, and I’ve lost all sense of motivation. Not to mention I work an hour and a half commute from my house, so most of my day is working and commuting. While I’ve been home I’ve been sleeping in my room most of the day, barely leaving it except to eat and hang out with my close group of friends and their families tonight for New Years Eve.

I also get cluster headaches, which have been acting up like crazy for the past month or so. They’re literally the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced, and I also have to live with the constant anxiety of having one of those while at work, meetings, etc. and being completely out of it for up to 3 hours. This is the one thing I actually feel like I’ve been taking care of (MRI and CT scan recently and a neurologist appointment this week to hopefully get me on maintenance meds) and yet it still might be the worst of what I’m going through.

I also have a history of mental illness in my family (my father has a sister with dementia who now lives at a nursing home, brother with severe depression and suicide attempts, and another sister who is now currently going through the the same dementia process that I had to watch my other aunt go through years ago; all of whom are shells of their former selves) so I’ve always known that I really need to take care of myself mentally, but I can’t bring myself to talk to my parents about how terribly I’ve been feeling. They’ve really worked their hardest to give me a great life, and i just feel it’d be so dramatic and ungrateful to tell them how terribly i’m doing with what they gave me, or that they’d freak out and think I’m going the same way as my aunts and uncle. Honestly I even feel dramatic even writing this post.

I hate my current job, which is in no way related to the field that I want to be in. I also took on too much in student loans, so that even though I’ve been accepted into Masters programs, I’ll never be able to afford to attend and change my career outlook. I still live at home with my parents at 23 and I’d always thought I’d have a great job and be independent right out of college, but I managed to fuck that all up.

On top of everything else, recently I’d been hanging out and going out on weekends with this girl that I was friends with in high school, and I really thought we were hitting it off, we had even hooked up a couple of months ago and have hung out many times since. I decided to man up and ask her out, and got shut down by saying that she appreciated our friendship too much and didn’t want to ruin it. This was the icing on the cake of how shitty I’ve been feeling lately, and I can’t help but feel so stupid and embarrassed of how badly i misread the whole situation. I feel like I can’t even hang out with her anymore and we have a lot of overlapping friends, so I’m dreading all of our friends finding out what an idiot I am.

Overall it’s been a really crappy 2018, but looking back this all definitely started about 5 years ago. I really don’t know how to handle this situation and just really want to be able to get up in morning and not be filled with sadness and self-loathing.

Once again sorry for the long post, I’m a little tipsy and really just needed to finally vent this to somebody, even if it is a bunch of strangers on the internet.

Im really not sure where to begin or what do to, so any advice is certainly more than welcome, especially from people who have dealt with depression before.

TLDR: Been very depressed throughout 2018 although it really started about 5 years ago. Got friend-zoned by a girl that I really like, hate my career, work wayyyyy too far from home, family history of mental illness, and general self-hatred and sadness. Need some advice to improve my mental state and begin loving myself.

203,"I have a friend who I have known since the very beginning of high school. During the entirety of high school the only reason why we even associated with each other was because she desperately wanted to be friends with my friends. But not with me. As high school came to an end, we were both going through a rough time so we would vent to each other during late night car conversations. This was about a year and a half ago. She tells all of our work mates that we have been friends for 6+ years and when I correct her she gets extremely defensive and makes me look like an asshole.

Any time we hung out, I was the instigator. I planned a surprise birthday event for her and she has never once invited me to hang out with her throughout the year and a half where we were friends. We work at the same place and I am fairly new but have made friends quite quickly . I often get invited to eat with my work mates and hang out with them a few times a week. Every time I go out with them, she messages them passive aggressive comments and sad face emoji’s. I have recently found out that she has been discussing how it’s rude of me to leave her out even though it’s just work mates eating out after our shifts. She has also been doing the same things with mutual friends from high school. Trying to guilt us into inviting her to every event despite her never inviting me out. It is not her lack of effort that gives me the shits, but her blatant hypocrisy.

She has become extremely attached and does not respect my boundaries. She hugs me even though she knows I feel uncomfortable with physical affection. She even says “I know you hate when people hug you but I’m going to do it anyway”. To her it is a sign of affection, to me it’s not respecting my boundaries. She also constantly tries to pry into my personal life as she knows I struggle with depression and frequently tries to find out what is going on in my life even though I am a very private person when it comes to my home life and my depressive episodes. She has recently called me out in front of my work mates bringing up her issues with me not wanting to share details about my personal life with her . She has cried to my high school friends saying that she feels we are no longer close with me and that it breaks her heart to lose her best friend. One of my friends in particular she has desperately tried to get in touch with is someone that I am close with. The last time we were out she looked through my phone and my conversations with this person.

The truth is that I never considered us to be best friends. I didn’t invite her to any of the outings because she never invites me out so I assumed she did not like my company (I’m a mellow person and very introverted so I don’t talk much at parties and prefer smaller groups whereas she is loud and extroverted and loves attention). Every time I have invited her out she takes the opportunity to contact MY FRIENDS to join in an attempt to become friends with them. She can never just handle our with me one on one. She is clearly just using me for social gain. I also feel like she is trying to gain attention and paint me as the bad guy. I don’t really give a fuck if we stop talking because we just aren’t compatible as friends but she is clearly taking it harder than anticipated. I am extremely pissed off that she has aired out personal details of my life regarding my medical history to my colleagues, and has discussed my depression with my other friends but has yet to approach me herself with these issues privately. My friends think I am being unreasonable and that she is just hurting. I think she is calling for attention.

Am I being unreasonable?

TLDR; social climbing friend is crying that I have decided to cut ties. Friends think i am being unreasonable. I believe that she is manipulative.

He got SUPER fucking wasted. And kept making off comments like “ask me ANYTHING right now! I wouldn’t be able to tell you no..!” He tried to give me a hug goodnight and it was very uncomfortable as he was overly touchy so I just pushed him off and slipped away. 



Keep in mind one of the reasons our friendship fell apart years ago was because he had had feelings for me and couldn’t get over it. 



We have hung out a few times sense and I thought it would be nice to invite him to our party. 



The issue is, anyone who is staying in the house is fairly drunk, drunk or stupid drunk (creepy friend and borderline my husband) 


My husband passed out on the couch downstairs and I couldn’t really wake him so I gave up. 

I setup creepy friends bed downstairs as far away from my bedroom upstairs as possible and then placed the two others staying here upstairs on the couch and a blow up mattress. 



I have a couple lines of defense here. The semi drunk person and the basically sober friend. I let my basically sober friend know what’s going on and I asked him to keep an eye out if he noticed creepy friend come upstairs to use the upstairs bathroom for some reason.

The truth is I do all the work while she sits around an Snapchats and looks at nudes from her many men. She also started dating a man my age (28) who yells at my siblings all the time and my mom doesn’t say anything about it

My sisters and brothers have admitted to hating him but being too afraid to tell my mom because they’ll get in trouble. As far as I’m concerned my mom is dead to me and my number one goal is to let my stepdad know everything. I’m only concerned for my sibling’s safety. Me and my 18 year old sister are going to let my stepdad know everything my mom is doing this Sunday when we’re all together for three kings day. 

I’ve been crying for hours over the horrible things my mother said about me but I’m glad I know what she thinks about me now. My siblings are on my side but I just hate that my mom turned into this person. ",01Jan2019,1
223,"This happened a while ago...

Okay so there’s a black and white cat that occasionally goes up to our house. Of course our cats always get unnerved by it but that’s just because it’s an animal they don’t know. 
My sister manages to pet it, and it’s purring, acting friendly, etc, but when I try to pet it it got startled and bit me. My family says it’s no big deal, as it didn’t puncture the skin (just red indents where it but me), but I’m worried that it may be something more serious. I mean I literally don’t know if it’s a stray animal or owned by one of the neighbors.

224,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I had a really bad childhood growing up, to the point where it became really hard for me to interact with other people simply because I hadn't grown up due to trust issues, trauma, etc. I was definitely an introvert, but that changed a couple years ago (I won't go into the details), and now I love hanging out with people and stuff. However, sometimes there'll be a group discussion and I'll end up making a sarcastic joke or screw around, which gets me a lot of flak (and honestly it's really deserved).

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I went to a New Years Eve party, and entered into a conversation of ""would you save \_\_\_'s life if you had to drink a bottle of ketchup?"" Reminded of a story I read earlier about a lady dying from consuming soy sauce, for a split second I got hung up on how much sodium that would be and if I'd die from it. I was poor on communicating here (didn't want to say ""let me think"" because that would sound *really* bad), so I asked a couple questions just to be inquisitive. I quickly realized this was the **wrong** thing to have said completely, so I tried to play it off with a few jokes and avoid the awkwardness, which made it worse. For the record, my friends are completely the teasing type (although the one it was about can take things seriously sometimes - again, I wasn't thinking this through), but it became a running hit throughout the night and made me feel super insecure because I felt like I'd let that person down and tarnished my reputation. My friends group is full of completely light-hearted and nice people, so I'm not concerned with me being bullied or anything like that.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be a funny blunder if it wasn't happening *a lot* of the time when I'm hanging out with them, and I feel like crap every time it happens. This has led to the interpretation that I'm really insensitive and childish, which isn't my personality *at all*, and has come back to haunt me in several important scenarios that mean the world to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friends watch *The Office* (American version) and constantly compare me to the character Dwight, whereas I'm definitely more of a Jim/Pam. More broadly, if I take an actual personality test I'll get either ESFJ, ENFJ, or ENFP (depends on my mood since I'm 50/50 on the second and last categories) - basically I'm an extremely supportive and caring person who probably borderline neglects every need of themselves for others. However, my friends have a hard time believing this is me due to my own suppression of feelings (I'm self-conscious and don't want to sound hyper-supportive or anything) and don't believe me when I say that this is who I really am. Later on in the party we were watching *Mamma Mia!* and one of my friends couldn't believe that I listen to *ABBA* or any music in general. That kills me because I'm not a lifeless rock. If it helps, there's a friend I like **a lot** who dealt with an abusive boyfriend who completely copied her interests to make himself seem better (she sort of did the same thing but it was practically forced on her), and I'm always afraid to make that impression. We literally like almost all of the same stuff and I'm terrified to admit it to her because I feel like she'll think I'm lying (which *did* occur in the past due to some misunderstanding/miscommunication by one of our friends) just to make myself seem like a perfect boyfriend-y character. When I'm older (should have probably mentioned I'm 18M earlier), I'd seriously consider marrying this girl and I feel like this has gotten in the way a lot of our potential relationship. She's definitely thought about us being together but has a few concerns, this being the chief one.

&amp;#x200B;

 In truth, I'd take a bullet for any of my friends without a second thought, but the ketchup scenario was so out-of-the-blue and unrealistic that I would assume my brief delay would be excusable. Regardless though, there have been more serious scenarios like this and I **hate** this part of my character. I want to completely get rid of it because it makes me sick. Any help/advice would mean the world to me right now given what's just happened and how regretful I am (I'm completely healthy and won't do anything silly despite my hit to self-esteem, so please don't worry). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much!

225,"My parents have recently been trying to get my sister (24) to break up with her boyfriend. They banned her from seeing him and theyve been arguing about it a lot. My parents keep trying to find out where she is at all times because they're worried she'll go visit him in secret. For example, she went out with her friends and turned off her phone location so they couldn't track where she is and wouldn't call or text them. However, I texted her wishing her a happy new year and she texted me the same. They were worried she went to go visit her bf, so they asked me if I've contacted her at all today. I lied and said I hadn't because I was worried if I told them the truth, they would make me call her and ask where she is and I just can't stand them fighting anymore. I felt guilty lying, so I told them the truth and they're really disappointed in me now. 

What should I have done? I don't want to betray my sister like that, plus I want to protect my sister and besides, I dont think they have the right to interfere with her life like that.

230,"22 F. I was taking citalopram for almost 4 years up until a week ago. I almost forgot what life feels like without them, but I know for a fact they make me numb to pain. I've felt very minor emotions over the past 4 years, mostly when I have my period and get emotional. I began to get fed up with this. I wanted to live a life without these pills, these fake things clouding my vision. Nothing feels real when I take them, sure I'm happy, but it's not really ME that happy, it's this other thing that's making me that way. Am I really living if I'm taking a drug that tricks me into being happy?

I just got tired of it. I stopped taking them. Its now been about a week or 10 days and the medication is out of my system and I already am thinking about suicide. I'm considering breaking up with my boyfriend of almost a year, which is something I NEVER even thought about up until this point. 

Its really awful. Its terrible. I hate how this medication is the only thing keeping me afloat. I want to just be happy on my own, but I'm not. I feel disabled. I feel hopeless. I dont think I could ever actually commit to suicide unless everything else in my life fell apart (I'm in a good university in a good program and have a ""bright"" future ahead of me) but I think about it all the time now and hope to just fall asleep and never wake up. 

I assume many people will suggest therapy, but I've seen many therapist and none of them have done much. My boyfriend knows I take (took) medication for depression but I dont think he knows to what extent.

So you’ve probably heard a thousand of these stories. I’m new here and genuinely want some advice from any kind souls who are bothered reading this. As I am writing this I do admit that I am freaking out a bit and my emotions are definitely showing. Anyway to sum up why I am depressed, here goes: 

\- I spent new year’s and Christmas alone. Everyone online is having the time of their lives, Im constantly bombarded with stories on FB and Instagram and my only close friends I have are overseas. 

\- Going back to the close friends thing. They are my close friends but I’m not theirs. I don’t have any best friends. It’s just I’ve never been able to get close with anyone. I’ve tried but on the rare times I do go out with them, I just feel even more alone.

\- I don’t have a girlfriend. Never had one. 

\- I couldn’t find a job for over a year now. I just recently got one but won’t start until about a week from now.  I feel like I spent the last year of my life doing nothing and losing people while they’ve gone on and lived their lives. 

\- I only have one brother. We aren’t close because well…long story he’s a bit of a dick

\- My parents are divorced and they are both overseas at the moment. I’m especially not close with my dad; I don’t think he really cares about us anymore.

\- I feel like I’ve lost my way. I don’t have any life ambition anymore

\- I’m broke

\- I can’t even drive :D

\- I’m 25

\- I’m a virgin

\- I have anxiety. I can’t sleep at night sometimes and sometimes I feel like I’m hallucinating, like I feel like I’m talking to myself.

\- I’ve never thought of suicide and could never bring myself to I don’t think but dark thoughts always just plague me.

\- I felt the same way last year, I even called a hotline once. Nothing has changed in a year and I feel like I wasted 1 year of my life

\- I get angry at everything, to the point where I get violent. I don’t show this side to people at all and only when I’m alone

\- I always look happy and well with other people but deep inside, its killing me.

I just feel like restarting my life. I hate not having friends I can count on. I hate not having close friends. I hate that even when I’m with my family or friends I feel alone and have the short end of the stick. I just want to leave everything.

I don’t know what to do anymore. People have said to just go on a short vacation. I don’t think that will solve the long term problem. I just feel so sad that I am alone and have no one.

246,"So a backstory: a friend is obsessed with Instagram, she said it herself. Everything in her instagram feed is a sexy photo of hers and her stories are Q&amp;As from several guys asking her out and she always replies using winky face or blatantly say that she would love to. Then in real life she told me that she doesn't want to go out with any of the guys from there, ever.

Then this one guy, who knows her in real life now stalks her because she promised something she can't and doesn't want to fulfill, that is to go out to a date with him. I know this because one day the guy asked her in real life when is the date; she said ""I'll tell you."" but she never did. The guy now follows her 4-5 days a week and because he lives in the same apartment as hers, it's easier to stalk her.

Sure the guy is a creep but isn't there any way to stop it if my friend just changes her approach to social media? Do you guys think I should tell her to stop because I'm genuinely concerned? Or is there any other way to stop this? Should I contact the police? This isn't the first time she's being stalked.

248,"I don't know how to start so I guess I'll try to start from the beginning. 
As long as I can remember I've always had some problems, thinking about suicide and all that, but it only occurred rarely, after big fights with my mom. and since I didn't knew other I thought it was normal. Around 15-16, if I remember correctly, it got a little bit worse but I never really thought much of it, and just Co tinued living through it even though I sometimes found it hard to fight myself. The following years it kinda got worse gradually, but slowly. When I finished high school it went so far that sometimes minor lash backs could trigger suicidal thoughts and more often I grew tired of living. Now I'm almost finished with my first semester at university and I'm a wreck inside. Up until December I had to drive more than 2 hours to university because I didn't find a place to stay relatively close to the uni. So I had to get up every day at 4.45 am and on some days I weren't home until 8.30 pm. As you may can guess I wasn't able to really keep this up without some price to pay. In this time I felt worse and worse. It went so far that ever free minute I didn't have something ""fun"" to entertain me. I fantasized about death not only my own. I didn't want to just kill myself, but I always hoped for some disaster or accident or maybe an illness to just take me away. The situation got worse as I realized that I could not continue one of my two majors at university, the one I always dreamed of as a kid. Not because I didn't like it. I loved it, but because I could not fill one of the requirements. 
Following my worsening of my mental state, I got more and more problems at university, or rather with learning I just couldn't learn how I did at school. I couldn't concentrate, neither in class nor at home. But I thought, well I don't get enough sleep that's why, once I move out and get closer to university it surely will get better. Now I lived for one month close to the university just a 30 min drive with train. But the situation didn't change to better. Even worse the feeling im doing the wrong thing with my life gets stronger and stronger. 
As stated I do not plan on killing myself. But I'm not sure how long I can keep this going. 
Now I don't really have anyone I feel comfortable enough to talk about this. And of course I thought about going to a therapist. But I just can't imagine how a therapist will help me in this situation.

I want to major in Computer Science/Mechanical Engineering but suck REALLY badly at math. I am decent at basic algebra along with geometry, but I had such a terrible foundation in math, I practically feel useless if I ever went to a heavy math based field. My aspiration is to create things that are practical, and to understand robots/machines, how to develop them, and use them as a means of making a name for myself.

I've been out of highschool for a few months now, and since I am saving up money for the whole year for myself since I couldnt go into college due to my financial situation, I'm hoping I can teach myself the basics of robotics, electronics, or python. I know i seem like I'm juggling a bunch of goals and cramming it up to one, but I believe I should try to build a good foundation in math before I begin to go deep into it.

273,"I've recently started working at Burger King for at least a month. I admit the pay isn't good and the hours are even worse, but I'm staying there for the time being due to my spotty work history. I've been in and out of jobs due to transportation and social anxiety. However, Burger King is surprisingly making me a confident person and I'm having an easier time being around people than last time. I'm in the job to at least gain a bit experience so I can get another one.  

Anyways, two days ago my mother was trying to get me into getting ssi for anxiety . She's been doing this for nearly months and I would tell her no everytime. While it maybe beneficial, my anxiety with people is pretty much nonexistent. I can do small talk with people and fake confidence to the point it's believable. Another thing is that my mother will try to take over the ssi process and try to get me to say things I won't believe. When I first sign up for ssi, she made me wrote what she thought what was wrong with me and wouldn't let me put it in my own words. I don't feel like going through that again... So yesterday she told my dad and they started yelling at me.

My dad told me that my job isn't a real job and that I don't want to work. I responded saying that I'm just there for the experience so I can get other jobs much easier. He doesn't understand the concept of experience and thinks I can learn stuff from him in order to get a job. He thinks I'm just being lazy and I should just get another Job or do ssi... I told him that's the plan, I'm just really trying to work there for a bit so I can get experience. He said that doesn't make any sense and said get a better job before 30 days or get out. 

I can't work two jobs, my mom and dad takes me to my job place every morning. It'll take me a long time to get from job to job. Besides that, I have a short job history and the longest one I've ever worked is two months. Realistically no one gonna hire a guy who can't work under two months with an employment gap.

274,"Back story: I work for a company of about 350 people that began small and grew over time. Our department has very little interaction/oversight from corporate or the professionals in the company. However, my boss has worked at the company since it was small, and is close to the VPs and the ""big-wigs"" - and she reminds us of this often. I have only been there since the summer. My boss (Noel) oversees two employees in the office (myself and my coworker) and several people who work on the road. Part of what else strains the situation is that she is in a hush-hush workplace romance with one of the guys on the road(Kyle).  My coworker (Kay-has worked at the company for 12 years in another department) has the same general issues with my boss as I do: basically she is unprofessional, hostile, and insecure. 

The incident at hand: Kyle got  a bag of knock-off designer goods from a friend. He let us all pick through it for a Christmas gift before giving the leftovers back. The day he had the gifts I wasn't in the office, so we met at the bank near both of our houses after he was done with work. We stood outside of the back of my car, I picked up a bag and a hat, we stood and talked about Christmas for about 5 minutes, then parted ways. (My live-in boyfriend who also works at the company knew all of this) The next morning, my boss came into my office and saw the hat. She asked where it came from, when I saw him, what time, where we met. I answered all questions with no problem. From then on out, every time she talked about Kyle it was ""your friend Kyle"" and ""maybe YOU can get Kyle to do this"", and other small but obviously jealous/annoyed comments. All of that came to a head the Friday before Christmas when my boss was upset that Kyle hadn't been submitting the required documentation for his work. I had called and emailed him several times (from company devices) throughout the week and he was just ignoring me. (This is his norm, not a new issue) Noel starts telling me (while yelling and swearing)  that Kyle does what he wants because I let him. That I don't hold him accountable, that I just spend my time flirting with him and let my friendship with him prevent me from standing up to him in the workplace. (The entirety of our friendship is that one time I met him at the bank.) Kay was present for the entire incident, and was on my side of the matter. My boss ended the argument with: ""then copy me on all the emails you send him from now on."" 

After mulling it over all weekend I was really stressed about the situation. I value professionalism and a healthy work environment and while that had never been the case in this job, I felt like this matter was crossing a line. Things like this can really damage a person's credibility, and affect potential within and outside of the company, and snowball into embarrassing and uncomfortable rumors for all involved. I requested a meeting with the head of HR (my boss's close friend) citing a ""matter to discuss.""  She postponed the meeting two weeks and told my boss to meet with me instead. My boss asked me why I wanted to see HR, and I told her ""I want to discuss the incident where you yelled at me for flirting and not holding them accountable."" She told me she didn't mean ""flirting"" in a sexual way, and that I was just overthinking the matter. She said that I should have just told her it bothered me, and that if I didn't think that she would handle it well then I just didn't know her at all. She told me that she was just looking out for me because Kyle is bad news, and that she thinks I'm just worried about my boyfriend finding out (he was completely in the loop). I told her that I didn't feel comfortable having a conversation like that with her alone because the comments were coming from a place of anger. She denied being angry, i said she was yelling, she said she was just stressed. She asked if we could consider the matter closed. I said I wasn't honestly sure. 

After that meeting, I realized I DEFINITELY wanted this to be on record, because obviously the head of HR was trying to avoid that by not having a meeting with me. I emailed her and said I would still like a meeting. During that meeting she told me that she had my boss meet with me because she thought that I had reached out because my boss was on vacation and that it may have been a more urgent matter (but she postponed until after my boss was back -- anyway). I told her the incident and she asked me why I would even feel comfortable meeting Kyle at the bank. I said ""other people go out for drinks or have coworkers over their houses - it was after hours and the bank is close to our homes"" and she said ""oh yeah, that makes sense"". That tactic didn't work. Then she told me that this is a matter of ""he said/she said"" with Noel and I, and I told her that Kay was present for the entire conversation, (including when Noel asked me about the hat). She then said that it was a matter of conflict resolution between Noel and I, and I told her that it was a conversation I didn't feel comfortable having without someone else there. She told me to email Noel and tell her that I didn't mean to go over her head or be disrespectful, and ask for a more thorough discussion, and that if that discussion goes badly then the three of us can meet. She then wrapped up the meeting by pointing out that ""she's just looking out for me"" and pointing out that even though I'm single (I'm not),  Kyle lives with his girlfriend and she wouldn't want to see me falling for someone who has a girlfriend -- and that he flirts with everyone anyway. 

Now for the advice: what the heck do I do?!  I want to play by the rules but I feel like being too complicit, which has been the case thus far, makes me look weak and like I can be bullied out of this. I've drafted this email and it feels like a last-ditch effort to an ex to take me back. Trying to offset the facts with a white flag to keep my workplace from being hostile, but I'm having trouble finding a happy-medium. This situation makes me incredibly uncomfortable already: I'm avoiding conversations with male coworkers in the hallways, I stand across the room in my own office when having meetings with males, keep the door open, and try to look as uninterested as possible so that her accusations and rumors don't snowball. I'm also concerned about her behavior. It's already bad, and now I have a target on my back and I am afraid I earned one for my co-worker too.

I just want her to be comfortable around the house, as she seems very restless and pained. 

I am also concerned about my male cat being around, as I know the female should be separated from any males while experiencing this. They are brother and sister, however I am not sure if they realize it or not. As we got the female a while before her brother was even born (two different litters but same parents), they always had more of a mother-and-son bond. The male is also not fully developed yet, as only one of his testes has dropped and he is not yet ready to be neutered. I want to know if it is okay to have them around each other or if they should be separated for the time being. They have a lot of fun playing together, but I'm worried it might be causing stress to my poor little kitty.

279,"Before I start, just know that I do love my mom, I enjoy talking with her, and she's done a lot for me.  I'm just excluding the good details from this post so I can get some insight on the negatives.  

I currently live on my mom's property in my own space, and pay a small amount of rent, just to help with bills and food cost.  We have a good relationship and we both want to lose weight, enjoy food, and have dreams of hiking a trail such as PCT/Appalachian.  However, I have misophonia (extreme hatred of sound which evokes fight or flight reaction) and she is a huge source of things that trigger me.  We both understand that it's my issue, and we try to work around it but the nature of this disorder makes things impossibly tense sometimes.  In addition, we are both obese.  

However, I've been actively trying to better myself little by little, cutting out sodas, counting calories, and going to the gym once in a blue moon.  Yet she makes no effort to stop smoking, drinking multiple sodas a day, and goes to the gym less than I do.  She has a steady job as a supervisor, is going to school for her master's, plans on finding a new job within a year or two, and added a large car payment just recently.

This would be fine but she likes to plan vacations where we would go hiking/backpacking overnight and spends more time preparing gear and food than she does physically/mentally preparing.  Needless to say every trip starts with a 12 pack of sodas and a carton of cigarettes.  I've tried to talk to her less about my aspirations of thru hiking places because I genuinely don't think she can do them with me.  Actually being on hiking trails at this point in time has me going ahead and reaching the end, turning around and walking with her, and then going to the end to clean up/use the bathroom and then double back to help her finish.  I understand that some people take their time and enjoy the scenery more, but I like to complete what I start and I like to see as much as I can, so the slow pace is pretty killer for me.  When we do meet up/finish the hike she often spends a large amount of time huffing and puffing, chugging her cokes, and if it's cold weather, lots of sniffling is involved.   Now, if you understand the nature of misophonia you'll see the problem with that.  Yet even despite it all, we get to go to some cool places and see some really cool things.

So, I really need some advice on how to handle this situation.  Do I outright tell my mom what my issues are?  Or is it more beneficial to humor her and take it easy?  When do I put my dreams before hers, or should I ever do that?  

If you have any questions about misophonia, just ask me and I'll tell you what I can.  Thank you in advance.

283,"(This most probably heavily biased) So around 6 months ago I got into a fight with my best friend of the years over the fact that we haven't spoken to each other. That's mostly because school ended back in march and also because her college started in April. So whenever I brought that up she always said that she was busy because of her college and stuff and I get that. I even told her that I understood her situation but I too deserve some time with her. After a few times going back and forth with this topic and finally said ""let's not be friends"". And well for obvious reasons I got a tiny bit angry. After that I was on s emotional rollercoaster swinging between emotions from crying myself to sleep to getting unreasonably angry at myself and at her. (I haven't spoken to her since then). Then her birthday rolls around and I told myself it's time to move on and end things on a good note and come to peace with my situation. So I send her the following text explaining why I did and said everything I did. (P.s I also told her I liked her but that didn't go as well as I hoped. So the other thing they pissed me off was the fact that even though I told her I am over her she started all her sentences with the words ""I don't like you, I am seeing someone, I don't want to give you false hope)......

Trying to get ahead of the barage of happy birthday texts here I am and since I am not an ungrateful arse more importantly a bad friend I am here to wish you a happy birthday because I haven’t forgotten about it unlike someone else who just seemed to completely miss the fact 5th December was a week ago can’t really be salty about that since you are literally as “BUSY” as local train heading towards ""not keen of revealing my location"" at 10. We haven’t spoken in a long time so I don’t know what to say to you for the most part I can only say one thing and don’t take this personally I love you (of course with a butt load of terms and conditions because I know you don’t like me ,you have a boyfriend, you are dating someone, you don’t want to give me false hope , aka the love is totally conditional so nothing to worry about) but I hope you fucking die though
-love (of course with a butt load of terms and conditions because I know you don’t like me ,you have a boyfriend, you are dating someone, you don’t want to give me false hope , aka the love is highly conditional so nothing to worry about it)          -Kandi (of course it not my real name)...........
Honestly girl at first I was just going to send you that and call it a day then wait for another 365 days to say the same thing again and point out the only reason we aren’t talking is because you are busy and how all of this is your fault. The more I thought about it the more insensitive and more idiotic that message sounded. I have realized you have totally embraced your new life new friends while I am still clinging onto that school life. I don’t even blame you for moving on you go to one of the most prestigious colleges in the entirety of ""not keen on revealing my location"", you got a man who hopefully makes you happy, probably have a dope ass crew you hangout with and maybe still have connections with the older people from school basically your life’s amazing right now. On the other hand I spend only 3 hours of day having any actual human contact, the girl I like tends to go offline for days sometimes even weeks. Or I can describe my current life as the total opposite of yours. I was just looking for someone to blame my current condition on someone, someone to blame for my mistakes. Apparently, it was you. I know we will never talk like we used to, never be best friends again or for that matter, simple friends and I have accepted that fact. All I hope is you have a wonderful life and hopefully make the right choices in life and one last thing my love for you is and always will be unconditional no matter how far away we drift apart and happy birthday

285,"Basically, I decided to invite some friends over to my house for a get together (not a party) just to drink, listen to music, smoke, and chill. I invited one of my best friends with her sister and her three friends.

They were the first ones to arrive, then some other friends came about an hour later. My boyfriend then told me he noticed them talking through messages on their phones with each other (my best friend and her friends), and they would giggle secretly and whatnot, I didn't notice anything because I'm quite a distracted girl. They then gathered together and seemed to have made the decision to leave. One of my best friends' friend told me that they had to leave because her grandma was telling her to go home and because she wasn't feeling good.

So they left, then with the other people that got there we decided to go to another party. So we did, and we ended up seeing my best friend there with her three other friends. I was dumbfounded. She tried to play it cool and even welcomed us in to the house that wasn't hers, tried to start a convo with me and immediately started giving me explanations, but I knew it was all bullshit and that the truth was that she left because her and her friends were bored.

Extremely awkward after that. I avoided her, didn't want to talk to her and felt pretty bothered by the whole situation.

I only saw a few words. After stalking him on Facebook i saw he worked for landscaping so i was like oh I'm sure they were talking about dirty boots but it bothered me anyways. 

I spoke with her about it, like two days later. I let it stress me out. and she laughed and assured me they were talking about boots. She told me he's not flirty, he's a real stand up guy etc. They're just friends. I told her to stop hiding their chats from me, it's not like I'm trying to look at them but I notice every time I go to sit with her and she closes it quickly. 

Does anyone else get that? Like, wouldn't you notice if your SO was obviously trying to hide a conversation? Wouldn't you want to see? 

30th dec, she ""bussed"" home from work. I watched for her at the bus stop because I really missed her that day. I watched the bus not stop, and then I watched her get out of some guys car. When I told her the bus didn't stop etc she refused to admit she got a ride from this guy. She only admitted it on New Year's Eve when I started grilling her. I told her again she keeps hiding her phone every time I go near her, it makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong or she's doing something wrong. She ended up admitting that he's flirty etc and that he's driven her home a few times. She said she hides their convos cause she doesn't want me getting upset at what they contain. She told me she'd show me some texts after this, and when she did there was a great chunk of texts missing except for one from the guy saying ""I don't want you to say something you're gonna regret"" 


I know she hasn't cheated. I think. I don't know. We've been dating for almost 4 years, I trusted her. She couldn't do that to me. But I am so angry. I was asking about him. I was just asking her to be honest because it seemed like she was hiding something.  


Do I have a right to be upset? Do I still have a right to be anxious about this? She got angry at me for even bringing it up. She got offended that I'd thought she'd cheat, but like... it looks bad doesn't it? How would you fix something like this? 

I don't want her to stop talking to him, I guess... I want her to be able to have someone else to talk to. God knows I don't actually have anyone, I try not to put that on her.

290,"Not even sure where to start here. So I guess I'd say that I've been having more and more trouble talking to girls I'm attracted to over the past 2.5 years, and it's gotten to a point where it feels unbearable. I can talk to anyone else, I even used to do public speaking (haven't really in the past year), but if it's a girl I find attractive I just can't do it.

So first you should know I have really negative self talk. Every day (literally) I talk to myself in my head about how no girls will ever like me and I'm going to live a long, sad, lonely life. It's gotten worse, I think it wouldn't happen to me everyday before, but it's always been something in my mind. It may have been because I didn't get laid in highschool and I'm only a few years out. But since highschool I have slept with a few different girls and stuff (which is all I wanted at first), but can't shake the feeling, and I feel like parties confirm it, even though I don't even try. I had one long term gf my freshman year of college but she cheated on me twice and tried to more than that, turned out.

So why am I making this? Well last night I went to a party. Now this party was by my hometown, which I rarely go back to, live here maybe a total of a month every year. It was actually in the suburbs of my hometown, which I never went to even when I was here. I drank a lot and took a Klonopin so I should've been loose enough, but I just couldn't talk to girls. Girls I wasn't into sure, guys no problem I'll introduce myself, but with a girl I'm attracted to there's automatically this assumption that my presence is unwanted. At one point my friend started talking to two girls and I was able to hop in there and it went well, but they left early. Even after that, I just couldn't will myself to actually walk up to and talk to a girl I thought was pretty. I think of all the tweets and stuff my girl-friends (most of my friends at school are girls in fact) say about guys not into them talking to them, and I just can't physically make myself do it.

What's wrong with me?? What am I afraid of??

291,"I usually enjoy vacations far more than staying at home, not only because you get to experience new things but because everything seems to be within a reasonable reach. I just turned 20 and I live with my mom, which has a lot of benefits, sure, but sometimes I feel like the village we're living in doesn't offer anything of interest for my age group. We have a small ass library, a coffee establishment and a restaurant with bad reputation. Most tennagers go drinking (which is legal in the state I live no worries) but nearly no one of my friends is interested in that because the options are very limited without having to drive for \~1 hour. I mostly feel like I'm stuck without anything interesting to do because I have no idea what my surrounding has to offer. Living in Austria I can't really seem to find anything of interest online and the next bigger city is a hour away. I don't meet new people and everyday seems to be the continuation of the last without any noticeable change.

Usually when we visit places like Amsterdam we have so much interesting museums, shops, restaurants and events near us and we didn't even have to search anything. Even if we had to we could simply use an app and find millions of offers.

Do you have any sites that could potentinally list interesting places to visit? What do you do when you're bored? Should I get in my car and drive away several miles just to potentially meet new people I probably won't see too often since the distance is rather large? Should I collect money and plan to move to a more interesting city? Should I focus on improving myself as best as I can and just let things happen?",01Jan2019,1
292,"I’m a recent graduate with a BA and a license to teach English in the state of NY. I graduated as valedictorian of my university, had 3 years of experience working in special education, and I’ve suddenly realized that I neither enjoy being a teacher or doing anything related to English or the humanities. I’m currently a substitute teacher and struggling to pay rent because I live in a relatively rural area and have only education experience.

I am lost as to what I should do with my life next. I have been self-teaching computer science topics and concepts over the past few years, and the tech and engineering field feels comfortable for me. I would be getting a 3-year MS or a second BS in computer science and engineering.

On the other hand, I have always toyed with the idea of law school. I have no legal experience whatsoever, but the research, skills, and presentation aspects of the field seem to match my skills. 

I guess I’m looking for advice on how I should try to get a better feel for which of these I should choose. I hate having to tie myself down to something for the rest of my life, because I have so many interests.

293,"The last year has been basically insane for me. I'm in my mid twenties and up until last year, I had been living abroad for a few years and then had to leave the country in a bit of a hurry because my ex who I had been living with tried to kill me. At the same time, my mother got cancer and had life changing surgery. It is the one surgery my whole life I was like I really hope no one I know or me ever has to get. It just doesn't seem fair that it happened. People act like if you survive cancer, life goes back to normal and it just doesn't.

I'm living back with my parents now, single with no prospect of dating anyone ( I'm a lesbian in a town with very few lesbians), in a very good job but honestly I don't enjoy any part of my life. I am bored by all of my friends and honestly I dread talking to them. My family doesn't feel the same and the future feels incredibly dark. When I think about the future now, I just think about the various ways people  can get sick or be damaged irreparably. 

Now that these bad things have happened, I feel like my eyes have been opened to how chaotic the world is, how anything can happen at any time and I don't know what to do with that. The world doesn't feel the same anymore, I feel like another version of me is living my 'real' life , where no one got cancer and I'm still living abroad and I wasn't stuck with this haze of pointlessness over everything I do. 

I guess what I'm saying is before all this - I was really youthful and optimistic. Now I feel like some sort of war hardened soldier and I don't want to. I don't want to know all this shit I know.

295,"I’m a 17 yo dude. 

I’m in college. Graduated high school in 2017. 
I’m graduating in 4 months. (college 8 months only) 

I never had friends in middle and high school. I mean I had friends but it always ended up me being left out and me just being the weird, fat, ugly kid. 

In college now, I’ve made like 11-12 friends. They’re generally nice but I just can’t seem to grasp on the idea of friendships. 

Despite being in the group, I just don’t feel valued. They’re always out, they don’t want to hang out after school hours. They’re in their 20’s while me being 17. (they don’t work btw) 

Sometimes they’ll make fun of me being fat but at the same time, tell me how to lose weight and gain muscles, they’ll make fun of me having no love life, never had my first kiss and say no one would date me but say if I change myself, girls would come to me (physically) 

*they all don’t say this, I’m just generalising all of them* 

They often make fun of me potentially being gay etc and I should come out even though I’m not. 

I never understood the idea of friendship and I’m not sure if friends actually make fun of each other but then advice them on stuff, don’t spend time after class. 


They’re all in their 20’s, they drink and smoke cigarettes. I’m 17 and I’m longing to try smoking and drinking but they ALL (whole group of 11-12 people) don’t want me to try them till I’m 18 (legal age) 


The question isn’t about them as people but me. I don’t seem to understand friendships and people in general and I’m just thinking if I’m better off with having no friends. 

College ends in 4 months and I’m just wondering if I should cut all contact. Sometimes I just don’t feel valued by them and don’t feel I fit in because they’re extremely good looking people, they are smart and fit while I’m not good looking, average intelligence, not fit at all.

297,"My neighbor seems to retaliate against anything I do. If I sit in my driveway of my garage to enjoy nature when it’s summertime, they have had friends come and try to intimidate me. I’m a single woman and there are always tons of guys there, two live there and the rest our guests. The time they came by to intimidate was the last time I sat in my driveway because it scared me that bad. The guy who intimidated me, revved his engine up, staring me down with an angry face, revving his engine up 30 seconds. I just looked away. This neighbors friends and the neighbor has called me names, made rude comments to me and for me just living my life they try to do anything to get attention and make me uncomfortable in my home. Recently I bought a truck and now I have 1 car parked on the street. This neighbor is now blocking their driveway when I have never pulled into their driveway ever. The only reason I’m complaining is because it’s very hard to get out of my driveway because of the extra car length, see picture and now their car is so close which makes it so difficult to get out of my own driveway. I think it’s illegal parking what they’re doing. It’s clear they’re doing it because I bought a new truck. The car on the left cannot get out. I think they’re trying to get me to move my other car parked on the street legally so one car can get out. Not going to happen. The same day I bought the truck all the guys were staring and saying bye bye. It’s constant harassment. I ignore them and never talk to them. Recently something was delivered wrong to their house and this neighbor banged on my door ten minutes like they were the police because I wouldn’t answer. I don’t want food left at their house and I already complained to doordash prior to her coming over so it was resolved. After this same neighbor trying to fist fight me in the past when I have never even talked to them I will definitely not answer the door.

299,"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster!

&amp;#x200B;

I (23 F) am a very eager to please person. I'm extremely empathetic, soft spoken and willing to go above and beyond for a friend in need. I have done so and intend to do so with every person I feel like I'm friends with. I lend a bit of cash, offer rides and advice, help people make appointments and learn basic things they might've skipped out on. I think I'm very much an extrovert and the idea of flourishing with like minded people is what gets me out of bed in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past decade or so I've clung to an altruistic outlook that, if I always put my best foot forward with people, my investment should pay off.

I have had very little success with friendships, including my significant other, I'd say I have 2 very close friends.

The majority of my connections have been with people who have gone on to use me. I used to wear my heart on my sleeve and found myself very readily taken advantage of by almost everyone I grew attached to. I've been the victim of excessive bullying, theft and manipulation, sudden abandonment/fair weather friendships, and even sexual assault from people I'd continue to stick up for for far too long. A lot of these experiences where excessive and very traumatizing in nature, and I've been diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder, depression and PTSD as a result. I'm currently in therapy for the worst of it.

&amp;#x200B;

As recently as 2018 this pattern has continued, with some of my most recent friendships continuing to be one sided and exhausting until they finally ended up disappearing altogether. 

This has been a lifelong problem for me, very literally going as far back as I can remember. During grade I school functioned in a bit of a passive sycophant sort of way until I managed to become old enough to recognize that for what it is and cease. Aside from that I generally like to try and stick up for the underdog a lot of times, or reach out to people who seem like they need someone. This, and being incidentally absorbed by someone so to speak are the most common ways I've ended up having friends.

&amp;#x200B;

But I have very seldom actually connected with other interested in maintaining closeness with me. Like I said, I only have 2 people I actually consider my friends at the moment. I love my friends, once you're friends with me I would do anything for you! 

I try with my whole heart to be honest, caring and real to the people in my life, but despite this, I've ended up in abusive and manipulative relationships more times than not.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, or how I happen to attract these sorts of people.

These experiences are cumulatively taking a huge toll on me, with the most recent failures being the most upsetting.

My mental state is pathetic right now. I'm terrified of everyone, I can't hold a job, and I recently dropped out of college due to how extreme my fear of other people has become. I can hardly speak to servers in restaurants now or cashiers and I haven't gone anywhere in public by myself in years.

I don't leave my apartment often and I'm constantly riddled with guilt for not being able to provide an income somehow for my partner, who works full time and supports us both.

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many things I want to do, I have a genuine passion for helping people and I feel like I will never live a satisfying life unless I end up with a career that involves directly serving other humans. I have a lot of personal hobbies and interests I feel could easily fit this role, but I can't even imagine myself going to a trade school or seeking and apprenticeship at this point due to my fear of people. It has impacted my quality of life severely and I've contemplated suicide over this in the past.

I can't even imagine working a job that involves communicating with clientelle without experiencing panic symptoms.

I'm about to start EMDR therapy for some particularly traumatic instances, but in the mean time, I have no idea how to make myself happier as I am. I'm a repressed extrovert essentially and I'm caught between a rock and a hard place here.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know how I would begin. I live on the other side of the country from anyone I know, family or hometown connections. I've been despondent and poor at maintaining communication with anyone who appears to want to be my friend as of right now, even if everything is going great, I am terrified of them and cannot find it in me to put any trust in anyone.

I'm constantly afraid and I feel separate and alienated from my generation, but I desperately crave platonic relationships with peers. How can I start improving this situation for myself?

300,"Sorry if I format anything wrong or anything like that, but this is my first reddit post! ever!! :)
So, as the title sort of explains, I'm trans but in the closet to everyone in my life. My twin is ALSO trans but has come out to everyone around us this year. It went very well (wasn't worried about it though, our family is very chill) and now everyone refers to him with his chosen name and correct pronouns.
I did (semi) come out to my twin when we were very young (maybe 12) but I wasn't very sure. It was more of me reading about being trans online and sort of suggesting the idea that I had thought about it to him. However, we both brushed it off and nothing came of it.
I know this kind of a? personal, hard to give advice issue? But with the new year I really want to try living my life a little truer to myself, and to me that includes no more she's/misses/ma'ams.

301,"I realised quite some time ago that the way I do things (sport and activities in general) is different to the way other people are doing them.  Let's take sports as and example.  There was this one time where I filmed myself playing sports (tennis)  my whole body movement just looked childish, stiff and weird in general.  While I do those things I feel like I'm moving in a ""normal""  way. But if you compare that to someone who doesn't have those problems it looks cool and fluent in a way.  Same with kung Fu,  where you can see yourself in the mirror.  My movement is completely different to other people, even if I try to change. I'm quite ashamed of myself and it gotten to a point where I'm not doing any sports when there are other people around.
  I don't know how to change that or how to get back to normal at least.

308,"I’ve recently become very aware of how my habits are drastically reducing my quality of life. For almost ten years I have either been getting to little sleep or my sleep cycle is fucked up. I am constantly stressed and feel like I’m running late all the time. I’m addicted to my phone and haven’t become aware of how draining that is until now. By the first hour after I wake up my brain has gotten a ton of new impressions and feelings through social media that has nothing to do with my real life. Because I’m constantly distracted either by my phone, Netflix, studies, conversations and daydreams, I don’t realize when I do other bad habits as well, like biting my nails, eating too much bad food etc. I also don’t notice quite essential observations, like what other people are wearing, social norms and such. I’ve become extremely little self-aware. 

As a consequence, my thought process is also not what it used to be. Before when I laid in bed to sleep I would lay there for 30-60 minutes thinking about what I’ve done during the day, what I’m doing tomorrow and who and where I truly wanna be. It’s like I’ve lost this ability, I get bored very easily and cannot stand the boredom, and the constant distractions are preventing me to realize what life I want and preventing me to live it. I get some clear moments and oh my god, there is so much I want to do. I want to improve on so many levels, eat better, fix my sleeping problems, get better routines, meet new people, lose weight, travel etc. But then I get distracted and get into a sort of haze, forget all about it and continue living my life depressed and lazy. 

I’ll soon graduate as a doctor but I never really thought about and realized what I want. I’ve never even understood if I like the field or not. I don’t really know, because I don’t think things through anymore. 

My new year resolution is to get back to who I was ten years ago. Calm, thinking, smart, active, reflected, certain of who I am. My first step is to fix my sleep problems by forcing myself to bed 9 pm every night and set my alarm at 6 am every single day until I have no problem falling asleep or waking up. The second step is to get rid of my addiction to my phone and the constant distractions. However, I have no idea how to do that and how in hell I’ll manage to stick to it. Also, what more can I do? Do I have other bad habits that is making me like a thoughtless robot? We often tell people who wants to improve to eat better, quit smoking, meditate etc, but what are the more less known habits that are reducing our life quality?

311,"So I work night shifts at a small 24 hour petrol station and we have someone who works there who I've never got along with. I aim to be friendly to everyone, try to create a warm environment where I can, just do my job to the best of my ability and go home. I get compliments from the managers regularly about my work. I've had an issue with her in the past because of her condescending and overly serious tone and the way she seems to be constantly looking for your every mistake so she can poitn it out. I was happy with taking advice and suggestions, especially when I first started, but not with how it was delivered. I think it hurts because I try to be friendly and civil with everyone and she just disregards that and is formal, rude, cold, condescending. It feels like there is no warmth there, and no reasoning with her.

I'm gay. She once made a comment on me being good at restocking the flower area (she said it in a camp voice), I laughed it off but afterwards realised it was a bit of a shitty thing to do and said with some viciousness. 

I've been away for a while from this job and been back the past few weeks. My first shift with her was last night, I was dreading seeing her but just tried to be friendly again. She did the same as before. This time it was because we're meant to compare the number of newpapers delivered to a deliveries sheet rather than a returns sheet which has exactly the same numbers on - it has the number ordered then a box by it to record how many are returned the next day. So then it was, I've not been properly trained to do newspaper deliveries, in serious tones, cold glaring, slight enjoyment in her eyes at the power it gives her to use rules not how they're intended. I checked with a manager in the morning and he said it doens't matter which sheet we go from as long as they're counted. He sighed and said ""y'know \[name\] she's been here years and has her way of doing things"". There was a crippling moment where I didn't know what to say to her. I felt exapsperated. It feels like she enjoys the power tripping of using minor rules to control and demean people. She's so cold. If it was done in a kinder way I don't think I'd mind as much but it hurts and I don't know how to deal with it. 

The thing is, from what I feel from her I think if she read this she'd take great pleasure in knowing she'd hurt me.

When I was working there before it got to a point where I asked to talk to a manager with her, I told her how I felt, that I'm happy to take advice or suggestions but it just feels rude and condesending the way she's doing it, I brought up a few situations where she'd done that stuff. All she said was ""have you finished?"" at the end. Nothing. No apology or real response.

So yes this must sound nice just keep playing and possibly go D1 or maybe beyond. 

   Just a little back story about my parents. They’ve invested so much money into this and time. My mom literally quit her job for she could move to wherever it was I playing at the time. So my mom basically will be done with me if I stopped playing. My dad may be okay with it if I was doing something productive. My dad is just tired and this has been going on for a long time. I’ve never really had a good attitude towards playing hockey. I’m a never lazy person but I just don’t have any drive to playing. It’s not even fun for me at all. Sometimes it has its moments it I generally don’t enjoy playing the sport. My mother is very hard to talk to and she only believes her way is the correct way. She’s Very controlling and always talking about the people that went against what she said and ended up failing.

  This past summer I met this girl that sorta changed my life and gave me hope. Yes it sounds cliche but it’s true. I’ve been playing in another state this season since about September until March of 2019 when it’s over. So we’ve been doing the long distance but I come and see her on the breaks. Anyway her mother and very controlling too and she just doesn’t like her. My girlfriend will be going to college, that’s always been her plan since day 1.  She’s very supportive of me and just wants me to do what I want and she’ll stand by it. When I say she’s just genuinely a good person I mean it. She has her problems like everyone but I love her. 

  Now my crossroad. I came up with the plan of moving out with her and just going to college. I mean we’re already saving the money up. Idk if I’m being young and stupid but i want to. We have a plan and it will work but my mom will not support this and neither will hers. The plan was to finish school bc we’re seniors. Save at least 5-6k for and I’m going to get a credit card when I’m 18 for I can start building my credit. When I came back in March we were going to start looking and applying for places in our area for less than 600. Yes ik it won’t be very nice but there’s plenty. I would get a full time job when I get back. There’s just 1 small problem with this plan. My mother said if I don’t have a plan for hockey I can’t live in her house. So idk if I need to just fake a plan or maybe just move out when I come back. I have a place I can stay for 250 a month but that would mess up me saving. I have a car that my dad purchased for me and he said if I wasn’t playing hockey and I was going to college I can keep it if I paid the insurance. So we’d save what we need to just move out by June or July hopefully. The plan is more detailed but that’s the summary. 

  For years I never really wanted to play hockey and I just blackmailed into playing it. I would have quit years ago if it wasn’t for my mom. I hear “I know what’s best for you” all the time but hockey just doesn’t feel what’s best for me. Yes I could make it big in hockey and the money would be nice but I just don’t care for it. My plan with my girlfriend is finally a way out of all of this. I can finally feel like I’m starting my life. I’ve want to be a surgeon my whole life and that’s what I’d do. My girlfriend wants to be nurse and she’s already accepted into this school for it. We always push each other to do great and we bring each other up when we’re down. I know this plan would work but there’s just 1 thing bothering me in the back of my mind.  I don’t believe this would happen but would if I do this and months down the road she leaves me. With all my heart I truly don’t believe that would happen but what if. I’d be left with nothing and my mom probably wouldn’t want anything to do with me. My dad would be saying i told you so. Also even if she doesn’t leave me and I see MY friends on tv doing what I know I could have done if I actually put the work in. Will I regret it? I truly don’t know the answer to that and whatever I choose to do will dictate the rest of my life. She believes I should give it at least 1 more year and actually try but I just don’t want to go through all that. I want to start my life with her and just leave it all behind.   

I need some help and please be honest. For those that believe I should go with my plan please leave some advice or questions. For the people that believe I’m making a major mistake please help me. Thank you if you read up to this point. 🙂❤️

322,"So as the title says... I’m not sure what my major in college should be. From all of the quizzes and tests etc. that ive taken to try and determine it, they tell me Psychology. But all my life ive always been into computers and video games etc. 

At first I was ready to delve into the computer science field and do something like Information Security Analyst (does things with protecting/securing networks on a large business scale and usually works in CyberSecurity Firms). But some friends were taking these quizzes to figure out their major and I figured “what the hell.” I’ll do one too. 

Ive probably taken about 10 or 12 now online and they never differ from answering Psychology. I think 1 time it said Computer Science. But it doesnt reassure me that Im taking the right course of action here. (I have watched and listened to a lot of lectures for psychology already on youtube from a number of different professors and their stuff definitely seems interested and like it would fascinate me. In contrast some of the lectures ive watched for a CS major are kind of meh and very plain. So while the field of CS interests me, the lectures certainly dont seem to)

So without knowing what to think of these quizzes, I come to you, the almighty reddit.  

Do I listen to these major quizzes and go into psychology, or do i stick with what ive been into since i was a little kid? 

Note: i have thought about doing one and then switching if i dont like it. But i dont really have the financial capability to do that. Ill be going to a public 4year college next year so it will cost me a good chunk of cash. (Manageable if everything goes to plan right now) ",01Jan2019,1

Logically there’s no reason for this, I don’t have an eye phobia, and I have never had any issues with my eyes for my brain to react in this way when all I’m doing is lying closely to a wall.

326,"Hi this is my first ever post, but honestly I’m just not sure what to do. This may not seem too trivial compared to most things, but it honestly crushed me. 

I’ve been friends with this guy since we were born, we are a few weeks apart in age and have been friends for ever. Though he was in the grade below me, this lead to our friendship getting weaker around middle school. Yet, as I finished up my last year of high school (last year actually we are both only 18) we got closer again because we shared a few classes. I think that once I graduated he thought that I’d never have time for him and I’d find “new college friends” so he kind of ghosted me, despite the fact I was attending the local university. I tried to contact him to hang, but plans always fell through. 

Flash forward to yesterday, my mom asks if I’ve talked to the guy recently. I say “No, why?” She then goes on to tell me that he’s moving a crossed the country in 1 day. And I had heard NOTHING in this, nothing at all. He hadn’t texted me or called me or anything to tell me that this was happening. At first I was just confused, I contacted him but he just went on saying things like “I didn’t think you wanted to hang” and when I asked him why he only responded with “idk idk”. I then told him that I wished the best for him, and that I was there if he ever needed anything. Then I cried, I cried for a long time because it hurt. It hurt that after all we had been through, we just packs up and leaves without saying anything to me. I don’t know what to do, if I should just let him be, or contact him every once in a while. I’m not sure why I put this here now that I think about it, maybe I just needed to rant.

I think that this impacted me so deeply because nothing like this has ever happened to me before, like I mentioned I’m only 18, so not many of my friends are doing big things like this yet.

330,"I have recently moved out of an apartment with my significant other for two years.  I thought we were perfect for each other because we both had our own individual issues with anxiety.  We helped support and build each other.  The last two months she has had episodes where she would become extremely angry at my silence or lack of answer if i hesitate too long to reply when im in deep thought.  A sense of resentment has built on her part because of my actions which i have continued to try and change for her.  She was extremely critical of everything I did.  I began coping more and more by playing more computer games and then that was continuously used against me in arguments to which i gave short simple answers.  Sometimes i would completely be able to articulate my anxiety in a great manner to why I have difficulty doing things but still get them done.  I have an associates degree in electrical engineering technology and am about one semester away from getting my B.S. in Physics-Engineering (electrical).  I have had the lucky opportunity to intern at NASA as well as a previous workshop at NASA wallops.  I came from a 6 year relationship prior to this 2 year relationship and am now aware and addressing my weakness of being alone.  It is becoming more obvious and easier to self cope.  I have messed up many semesters in the past but keep getting back on track with whatever setbacks in life come up.  For example my first panic attack i was 23 years old and had difficulty bouncing back and truly understanding everything for a solid year.  I apologize for all the text and i will come back and edit the format later for easier reading.  I thought i'd start with just getting these thoughts out of my head onto something because I NEVERRRRRRR write anything down.  I love physics and love just solving problems and being part of a team.  Its what makes me happy.  how do i know that stepping away from this relationship is what is good for me?  i had to take several videos of her not allowing me to leave the apartment and blocking the doorway.  She would insult and berate me and say that she was getting angry because of how I would respond or not respond to her.  Maybe ive begin to see everything from her perspective and am now very critical of myself.  But i had to move out because i started to fear her anger episodes.  hopefully ill feel better just having put this out there for others to see and not all stuck in my mind.  I deleted all social media today ...am i seeing my problems from a bad perspective? I just want to get my life on track for my daughter and I.

332,"My mum has been an alcoholic for as long as I remember. Things got a little better when she got a job she loved a couple of years ago, but she's been out of work for a year now due to health issues and all she does is drink all day long. She wakes up in the morning and the first thing she does is open a can of beer. It's difficult to see, but I've adjusted to it and accepted there's nothing I can do to make her get help when she doesn't want to. We've had countless arguments where I've pleaded with her to go speak to a doctor or a therapist, but she won't, and refuses to admit she even has a problem most of the time.

I sort of got into an argument with her just now because she ordered 6 boxes of 10 cans of beer that arrived on the 29th, and asked me to get her more beer when I went round to the shop because she's already run out. Her defence for this was that my 16 year old brother has been drinking them too and it wasn't just her. Sounds like bullshit yes, but it's true that every time I've seen him over the past week he's been drinking. She sees no problem with this because ""it's christmas"" and ""it's better for him to drink at home than out in the streets"", but I'm really worried about it partly because I've had issues with alcohol in the past that I still struggle with, and while I don't want to blame anyone else, I know it was partially caused by my mum's constant drinking and the environment it created at home (the therapist I saw even said so). I really don't want him to go down the same path I did.

Me and my brother aren't particularly close and don't talk to each other much, so I don't know how I'd bring this up to him or if that'd even be the right thing to do here. He's at school but hasn't been going in recently because he's been staying up late at night and not been able to wake up in the morning. I don't want to do anything that could get my mum in legal trouble, or anything that she'd know I was responsible for. I know it sounds selfish but if she cut me off I'd be homeless. ",01Jan2019,1

I used to get very good grades in middle school, but now in high school they've dropped to just ""okay"".

I've always studied for every exam on the last night, and earlier it used to be enough but now it isn't. I've tried breaking up studying into small pomodoro sessions and trying to be mindful whenever I get an urge to stop (plus a dozen other things suggested by the internet), but it just doesn't work. The problem for me is not really getting started, I can do that, but once I'm 5 minutes in all my anxiety fires up and throws negative thoughts at me in rapid fire. I try to counteract them with positive and rational thoughts and deep breaths, but they're literally too fast and I just can't handle it past a certain point and declare that I'm done for the day. Often I try to fight the feelings but after 4-5 times I just break down and feel like crying.

334,"I'm 20 years old, and work a student job on campus at my university. I have had this job for about a year, and have been well liked by my boss, and felt really happy in my position. Over the past 6ish months, though, I've been struggling with attendance and consistency as an employee due to severe depression and anxiety. There were many days over the last school term that I would leave early, but I genuinely did my absolute best. I recognize that doing this is a problem, so I've been attending therapy over the past few weeks to prepare myself for next term.

Unfortunately, I think my boss is ghosting me. We've always had a very casual relationship, more like friends than coworkers, and I don't think he'd be able to fire me in person. For context, I reached out to him on DEC 27th with my class schedule for the term, and haven't heard back. I should've provided this information earlier, but was having issues with registration holds on my school account. I'm stuck at a point where I'm not sure if he's just taking his time, or if I should actually be concerned. Having the added pressure of my own anxiety is definitely not helping me think logically about the situation, and I can't tell if I actually fucked up, or if I'm worrying over nothing.

Last night ( New Year's ) I (16M) was at a party that lasted all night. It was on the smaller side, about 2 dozen people at peak, and one of my classmates were there. The night went on and nothing happened, I was having fun and unwinding, and then I went to bed in one of the side rooms which was designated as a sleeping room. I head to bed and my classmate, let's call her Sam, came next to me and fell asleep on me. I thought nothing of it at the moment and I went to sleep as best I could, but I ended up tossing and turning for one reason or another for hours.  


It was at this time that I, in my exhausted stupor, must have decided it would be cool to grab Sam's boobs while she was asleep. She woke up and left the room I think, and I continued to sleep as if nothing happened because I thought nothing of what just happened because of my mental state. I wake up in the morning and there is a thick air between us and I recall nothing of the night before with Sam. Within 15 minutes a couple of my other friends had gotten around to asking her what was wrong, and she gave her side of the story.   


I was then informed what I had done and I thought I was going to die. I went upstairs and confronted her about what I had done and how I couldn't express how I felt. To this minute I don't know how I could have expressed how bad I feel.

344,"My girlfriend basically wants me to go to the same college as her, I have a scholarship to play football at a really nice D-II school that’s out of state, and the college also has a program of study that I’m particularly interested in as well. 

My girlfriends plans on enrolling into a pre-med program with the college that she got accepted into. It’s great that she’s happy, but at the same time we’ve talked about how we should stay close because long distance relationships are hard to maintain, just know that this was well before any of us had applied to colleges, it would’ve been back in junior year of high school. 

Anyways, I’ve been recruited pretty heavily by NAIA and D-II schools to play football, which is something that I want to do, and I have a little over a month to go before college football’s signing period. The NAIA school happens to be close to her college, but I’ll still be able to commute when I have free time, but it has no programs that interest me because it’s a Liberal Arts college. 

Then, like I said earlier, the D-II school has everything I want, the facilities are great, it’s everything I ever wanted from a college. I’ve discussed with my girlfriend what being recruited by this school means to me, but she’s basically hinted at how she believes this is asking for a break up. 

She basically slept on the whole situation that were in, and she came to the decision that we either stay close, or we break up. This is what’s been eating at me, if I choose to commit to the out of state college to play football, I have to turnaround and eventually tell my girlfriend that I chose the out of state college. 

With National Signing Day approaching, she’s going to find out one way or another, because the coach that recruited me is going to have me sign my letter of intent in front of the entire student and faculty at my high school.

346,"Hey Reddit, first of all this isn’t about me but my SO. She has a really rough go of it at home, but doesn’t know what to do. I haven’t asked permission to post here so let’s try and not have this reach the front page. Okay, we’re going to call her J and some details will be switched up.


J is a great student! She is about to graduate with at least a 3.96 GPA, she’s been accepted to a few medical schools with a 522 MCAT score, and she volunteers with mental health support groups on campus and dedicates a lot of her time to helping others, myself included. 

Here’s the catch, her parents are part of a very tight knit religious community. Not a cult, one of the big ones, but I’m going to keep it vague. 

She doesn’t really agree with a lot of the value system within that community, and a lot of her actions contradict their views (having sex, dating, teaching others about healthy and safe sex, drinking at). And they somehow know about all of this, and give her a lot of... yelling and ultimatums about it. 

She’s home for winter break right now and they recently got into a huge fight, that is “about” me but is really about the clash in her value system. Now, J is considering ending things with me in order to be more appeasing to her parents, but I’m less worried about that than i am her future. She’s extremely unhappy in their belief system, she’s extremely unhappy in the values they place on her, and they neglect all of the good she does for the few things they see as bad.

She’s “trying to figure stuff out” right now, so reddit, what should she do? I suggested coming back to campus early to show her parents what the future might look like if they continue to push her away, because my parents did the same thing with my sister and regret it and have offered to talk to her parents about it.

In 2019 i want to cut dairy out completely - not go vegan or vegetarian per se just cut out milk and cheese and the like. I don’t drink milk anymore and i haven’t for a few years because i prefer almond milk; but i can’t seem to cut cheese or ice cream or anything else really that has dairy. 

The reason I want to do this is because i noticed that dairy exacerbated my acne, which as a 22 year old is a little embarrassing to have (i used to have perfect skin in high school even though i’d sleep in makeup and shit... thx skin). 

I’ve also read that we don’t need dairy from cows so I thought it wouldn’t hurt to try. Are there any tips that have helped you cut out dairy?

I'm 20 years old, and work a student job on campus at my university. I have had this job for about a year, and have been well liked by my boss, and felt really happy in my position. Over the past 6ish months, though, I've been struggling with attendance and consistency as an employee due to severe depression and anxiety. There were many days over the last school term that I would leave early, but I genuinely did my absolute best. I recognize that doing this was a problem, so I've been attending therapy over the past few weeks to prepare myself for next term.

Unfortunately, I think my boss is ghosting me. We've always had a very casual relationship, more like friends than coworkers, and I don't think he'd be able to fire me in person. For context, I reached out to him on DEC 27th with my class schedule for the term, and haven't heard back. I should've provided this information earlier, but was having issues with registration holds on my school account. I'm stuck at a point where I'm not sure if he's just taking his time, or if I should actually be concerned. He's never mentioned concerns with me as an employee before, and he's been fairly aware of my situation this past term. My own anxiety is definitely not helping me think logically about the situation, and I can't tell if I actually fucked up, or if I'm worrying over nothing.

Should I reach out again, or should I continue waiting? What's the best way to approach this situation?",01Jan2019,1

Then he took me to the cemetery and showed me my aunts grave and he told me how she was pretty much his little sister after he got kicked out by his dad but then he continued to tell me how he made memories with her even while she was dying at a very young age. Then he took me to the place where he found out my mom was pregnant with me and at the time my parents were both 16 and he told me how my whole family thought he and my mom were officially fucked for life.  He continued to drive and he showed me where he would pick up drugs and he told me he stopped after he found out i was coming into his life and then finally he told me about his last memory of his mom and we pulled up to his kindergarten and he told me his last memory was saying bye to her as he walked into kindergarten. All this he exposed me to has had a pretty profound effect on me.

369,"I am basically copy/pasting my post from r/Dreams because that sub is rather quiet, but I'll add details and make it more oriented for this sub.

Last night I had a nightmare. It was a rural ranch type setting where I was part of a large group. I don't recall knowing anyone in the group. There were large structures set up, I don't remember the specifics. It was kind of like a video game in that we all had to travel through certain areas and do puzzles to complete the challenge. We all went in at once but got pretty stumped at the first puzzle. Then someone told us we could only work individually, so we went back to the start and did so. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t finish the challenge, I didn’t know how to finish the puzzles. The number of people who didn't finish dwindled and I recall me sitting around outside being upset and anxious that I couldn't accomplish anything on my own. 

Eventually I was the last person who didn’t finish, and the people “running” the challenge kept verbally attacking me, saying things like “why are you so stupid” or “what’s wrong with you?” It felt like I was being sucked in to a black hole of despair, but it just kept going and going, and I woke up crying and scared. I may not be remembering correctly at this point but I feel like at the end of it I was only half asleep but kept my dream going partially on purpose? What does this dream mean? What a great start to 2019.

For the last several months I've had way more nightmares than I've ever had in my life. The norm for me used to be maybe once every month or two and they were pretty minor. But now I'm having 1-3 nightmares a week, and waking up crying is one of the worst reactions I've had. Another bad reaction to one was I woke up digging my nails into my palms, leaving big marks that almost bled. Usually after nightmares I have a headache all day. I can move on from nightmares pretty fast, for example, I woke up about an hour and a half ago and I really don't feel the nightmare affecting me anymore, it's just annoying at this point.

As for the personal stuff, I had some relationship issues (friends and romantic) for the end of 2017 and most of 2018. Things like betrayal, losing people, being accused of things I didn't do, etc, stuff that really fucked with me for a long time. But in the last few months of 2018 I felt like I fully moved on from those issues and I’ve been a much happier and mentally healthier person since. A big part of that is that I've come to see the benefits of what happened, like that I'm better off without them and more mature now, etc. That’s about when I started having more nightmares, which doesn’t make sense because I don’t really have anything negative about that in my mind anymore and am the happiest I've ever been. So why am I having more nightmares? Why are they getting worse and more frequent? What can I do about it? Is a therapist warranted?

My mom liked it, but then I introduced an idea of adding cooking different foods from my country but then my mom was all like “no you’re not doing that.” One, it’s my Youtube channel, two, I’d clean it up of course. 

Shes always being controlling ever since I was young, especially with my physical looks. Like say I wanted my already short hair to be shorter, my mom wouldn’t let me. She also only let me wear certain clothes which was annoying. Even when I was a teenager and now adult she still does it. I am living under her house but she throws a scene when I mention moving.

Last night I took mucinex, took a cough drop a couple hours later and then some honey. I also took basically one hit from a weed pipe that was my friends so the weed was fine. 

Suddenly, I started feeling very weird. My entire body felt shaky, my face, finger tips and feet starting feeling numb. I also could not look up for a while as my eyes wanted to look like 45 degrees downward and things in my peripheral where blurry. 

It almost felt as if the entire front of my body had pressure on it and all of my muscles were pretty tight. Checked my heart rate and bp and my blood pressure was about 169 over 100 or something in that range and my heart rate was about 140. My voice was trembling and my body shaking was worse. This went on for about 2-3 hours. It was calming down after about an hour and a half. I noticed my brain felt tense and then suddenly it started getting less tense and felt almost like it deflated a bit.

In this period I also drank about 3 full water bottles and my mouth stayed dry. My lips felt numb and my tongue a bit also. 

Felt a bit like I was dying during whatever this was. It was scary.

It is morning now and I still feel a bit weird. I’m not in pain but I just feel weird. I have no history of panic attacks or high blood pressure but I do have pretty bad social anxiety and general anxiety at times along with IBS-D. This is not my first time with weed and I’ve had much more than that and had nothing like this happen.

379,"Hi. There’s a situation that’s been unfolding at my job for several months now, and it’s starting to get to the point where I’m wondering if I should contact the authorities. I’m a hairstylist, so naturally I work at a salon. I first met this woman and her children quite a few months ago. She brought in her older daughter (15) to get a “bang trim”. It turns out this “bang trim” was really an excuse for me to spend almost 2 HOURS detangling a massive dread/knot that encompassed this girls ENTIRE head. Most stylists im sure would’ve said we need to shave this, but the mom gave me a long, dramatic sob story about how the daughter had been deathly ill and that’s how the matted hair had came to be, so I took my time and meticulously picked out the knot. 

After I was done, the mother asked if I had time for a “bang trim” for her younger daughter. Her younger daughter is probably 3-5 and has Down syndrome. It was at the point I noticed her hair was also one huge, giant knot. I told the mother I could, but she’d have to wait in line as there was quite a few people ahead of her. The mother didn’t want to wait, so she paid and left. 

A few weeks later the mother returned with her younger daughter for, get this.... a “bang trim”. Another stylist did the service, and it took her an hour to detanlge this poor baby’s hair. The mom, almost as if she forgot our previous conversation completely, told us the SAME story she had for her older daughter. The younger daughter had been deathly ill for a week, and therefore these knots appeared. I’ve been doing this for a few years now, and I know Matts like that DONT come to be in one week. This is WEEKS and possibly months of neglect in order for the hair to become THAT bad. 

Since then, the mother comes in once a month with her younger daughter (no idea where the older one is) WITH THE SAME STORY/EXCUSE for the tangles, verbatim. I’m truly convinced after we detanlge her hair, the mother doesn’t touch it at ALL for a month. That’s the only way for it to get that bad that quickly in my professional opinion. Also, it’s so strange she keeps using the same story. Does she think we’re dumb and don’t remember? 

She also came in once and a different coworker did the service, and my coworker said the little girl was vigorously itching/scratching her privates during the detangling. The mother apparently kept asking her if her “noni” itches and said it must’ve been because her father forgot to bath her (???). 

The last time she came in, she had a long, in-depth conversation about the woes of having a special needs child with a random customer who seemed uninterested. She almost seemed to enjoy the attention and talking about the struggles. It was weird. Also, her daughter ran amuck during the conversation in our salon and the mother made NO effort to control her. I had to say something to the mother to get her to pay attention. 

I have this family’s info due to the way our system is at work. I’m really stating to get sick when this mother comes in, cause I just feel like something weird has to be going on. It’s a gut feeling. None of my coworkers really seem to think it’s something bad possibly going on, they just get annoyed when they have to spend so much time detangling this girls hair. I also don’t wanna ruin a family that could be perfectly normal by being a nosy person. Idk. What should I do? 

Tl:dr: special needs girl comes into my work monthly for detangling of massive knots. Mother seems to give the same excuse. I’m worried there might be some serious neglect going on. Should I report it? ",01Jan2019,1

We want to move out by June orJuly and we’re saving for it. Any advice on working while I’m college or moving out in general? To make it easier I’ll post the back story below.  Anything I should be prepared for?

.
So I’m 18 years old (we’ll about to be) and I’ve been playing hockey almost all my life. My parents have been the main force behind it. I never really put any major effort into the sport but I’ve managed to make it to a high level and be rather good. Over the years I’ve been pushed to go to tryouts, skates, and just everything. Just going to practice feels like pulling teeth. At the games I don’t feel the excitement of the game I’m just waiting for it to be over. I’ve been playing at a high level but never really a good team so idk if that plays into the way I’m feeling. Many people have told me I have the potential to make it and by “people” I mean the coaches and well respected people in the sport. I’ve always been told it’s up to me and if I want it. So yes this must sound nice just keep playing and possibly go D1 or maybe beyond. 

   Just a little back story about my parents. They’ve invested so much money into this and time. My mom literally quit her job for she could move to wherever it was I playing at the time. So my mom basically will be done with me if I stopped playing. My dad may be okay with it if I was doing something productive. My dad is just tired and this has been going on for a long time. I’ve never really had a good attitude towards playing hockey. I’m a never lazy person but I just don’t have any drive to playing. It’s not even fun for me at all. Sometimes it has its moments it I generally don’t enjoy playing the sport. My mother is very hard to talk to and she only believes her way is the correct way. She’s Very controlling and always talking about the people that went against what she said and ended up failing.

  This past summer I met this girl that sorta changed my life and gave me hope. Yes it sounds cliche but it’s true. I’ve been playing in another state this season since about September until March of 2019 when it’s over. So we’ve been doing the long distance but I come and see her on the breaks. Anyway her mother and very controlling too and she just doesn’t like her. My girlfriend will be going to college, that’s always been her plan since day 1.  She’s very supportive of me and just wants me to do what I want and she’ll stand by it. When I say she’s just genuinely a good person I mean it. She has her problems like everyone but I love her. 

  Now my crossroad. I came up with the plan of moving out with her and just going to college. I mean we’re already saving the money up. Idk if I’m being young and stupid but i want to. We have a plan and it will work but my mom will not support this and neither will hers. The plan was to finish school bc we’re seniors. Save at least 5-6k for and I’m going to get a credit card when I’m 18 for I can start building my credit. When I came back in March we were going to start looking and applying for places in our area for less than 600. Yes ik it won’t be very nice but there’s plenty. I would get a full time job when I get back. There’s just 1 small problem with this plan. My mother said if I don’t have a plan for hockey I can’t live in her house. So idk if I need to just fake a plan or maybe just move out when I come back. I have a place I can stay for 250 a month but that would mess up me saving. I have a car that my dad purchased for me and he said if I wasn’t playing hockey and I was going to college I can keep it if I paid the insurance. So we’d save what we need to just move out by June or July hopefully. The plan is more detailed but that’s the summary. 

  For years I never really wanted to play hockey and I just blackmailed into playing it. I would have quit years ago if it wasn’t for my mom. I hear “I know what’s best for you” all the time but hockey just doesn’t feel what’s best for me. Yes I could make it big in hockey and the money would be nice but I just don’t care for it. My plan with my girlfriend is finally a way out of all of this. I can finally feel like I’m starting my life. I’ve want to be a surgeon my whole life and that’s what I’d do. My girlfriend wants to be nurse and she’s already accepted into this school for it. We always push each other to do great and we bring each other up when we’re down. I know this plan would work but there’s just 1 thing bothering me in the back of my mind.  I don’t believe this would happen but would if I do this and months down the road she leaves me. With all my heart I truly don’t believe that would happen but what if. I’d be left with nothing and my mom probably wouldn’t want anything to do with me. My dad would be saying i told you so. Also even if she doesn’t leave me and I see MY friends on tv doing what I know I could have done if I actually put the work in. Will I regret it? I truly don’t know the answer to that and whatever I choose to do will dictate the rest of my life. She believes I should give it at least 1 more year and actually try but I just don’t want to go through all that. I want to start my life with her and just leave it all behind.   

I need some help and please be honest. For those that believe I should go with my plan please leave some advice or questions. For the people that believe I’m making a major mistake please help me. Thank you if you read up to this point. 🙂❤️

383,"First off, I'm a 28F. Because of the cost of rent here in the UK, I can't afford to live alone so I have to live in shared housing (still isn't cheap!). Recently, I moved to a new city to be closer to my sister, and to take a better job (the old one was making me miserable because I was being bullied and the culture was awful). I'm much happier at the job and in this city, but I took a pay cut as a result.

Because of all that, I had to find housing quite fast and seemingly made a bad decision because where I live is disgusting. The people are rude, everywhere smells, nobody cleans literally ever. Today I found actual shit smeared on the toilet seat. Toenail clippings on the floor, blobs of phlegm in the shower, rotting meat in the overflowing bin in the kitchen etc. etc. My bedroom is fine but it's actually so bad in the communal areas that I have lived here for almost 6 months and have barely ever cooked in the kitchen because it's an ordeal to clean it first. I eat at my sister's house 2 times a week, order in the other 2 days. Generally I spend the weekend elsewhere so I can get away from the house.

I tried to be positive and say that I was just here for 6 months and I can survive it and find somewhere else. Well the 6 months is up at the end of January and I'm finding it hard to find anywhere affordable that won't just be a repeat of this hopeless situation.

I know people have it so much worse. I'm lucky to have a place to live. I should be grateful for that. But I've never felt so miserable in my life. I thought this move was going to change my life but I just can't help but feel like whatever I do to better myself ends up being thrown back in my face. All of my friends have houses of their own, husbands, children, or just lovely places they call home (even if modest). I have nothing to show for my life. I look at the homes on my street as I walk past and I am envious of how cozy and nice they all seem, and then I walk into my cold, damp, miserable disgusting home and I just feel worthless. How did I pull the short straw?

I did everything everyone else did. I went to uni. I'm working hard at my career. I'm kind to people, sociable, creative. I would love a family. I would love a home. I am trying hard to find a way to make that happen but I just can't see it. I am single but dont feel able to bring anyone back to my place. I dont have enoiyh left over at the end of the month to save for anything significsnt. I can put bits asode for things like my car service, a weekend away (I haven't been on holiday since 2009), some new clothes or whatever. But i dont have enough to make big savings, so buying a property isnt on the cards for me yet. Everyone around me just seems to have their shit together and have everything I want. I try to be happy for them and believe my time is coming but most of the time I just cry and cry and feel terribly jealous.

What have I done so wrong to be 28 and barely feel like my life has started whilst everyone else is already well into theirs? How do I get some perspective on this without going crazy?

Practical, kind advice welcome to help me battle through 2019 as I approach 30 feeling pretty down about it all.",01Jan2019,1

386,"My mom's side of the family likes to get together quite often and while I do love them, I dread going to these visits because we always do the same thing: sit and talk in my uncle's living room.  It's the most boring thing ever especially when my cousin who is the only person close to me in age (I'm 18) isn't there.  Even when I'm with my friends, we never just sit around and talk as we all find that extremely boring.  Instead, we do something together while we talk, whether it be video games, a board game or a sport.  

Recently, there was a family gathering during my final exam period and I couldn't go because I was stressed out of my mind.  According to my mom, during the gathering I couldn't attend, my uncle asked ""Does anon even like us?"".  Apparently, he asked this because ""I don't seem to enjoy being with them"".  

So now today, after waking up at 1pm because I'm exhausted from partying late with my friends on New Years, my mom asks if I want to go to my uncle's for a family gathering in an hour.  I'm still exhausted so I said I really don't feel like it.  She then started guilt tripping me saying ""Now your uncle will KNOW that you don't like him"".  My mom knows that isn't true so I have no clue why she's feeding into my uncle's ideas.  This pisses me off to no end and I don't know what to do anymore.",01Jan2019,1
387,"Hello, my father is a habitual liar and most likely has chronic pain (this I'm mostly sure of but I also don't know how to tell the difference between someone who's on disability and has just one doctor prescribing oxycontin for their actual chronic pain from arthritis (also real), a car accident (don't know), and I think something to do with autoimmune disorders (you can't fake this to doctors and he does get medication for this) and someone who does all that but fakes the actual pain). He has been taking opioids for at least 3 years, that I know of (lot's of complicated history here). He hasn't had any spiralling I can see with the opioid use - It really does seem like he takes it for pain management. I am asking about drug prescription not if he is a drug addict but give advice however because I am lost here

&amp;#x200B;

Last January I was looking forward to medical marijuana being legalized in my state because I happen to not want my dad to be in chronic pain and also it should really help the opioid crisis. Before that month he'd expressed excitement, but after I brought it up again he told me he's afraid to apply for the green stuff because if it doesn't work for him he might not be able to get back on opioids. In January I believed him not knowing how much of a liar he was, and although it's been months since medical marijuana has been legalized in my state I just now remembered it and I'm having a big :think emoji: moment here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty sure a) weed would work because it's weed. It's literally medical marijuana meant for pain management due to the opioid crisis. I really find it hard to believe it won't relieve chronic pain and b) if the medical marijuana *doesn't* work then why the everloving hell would your doctor or any other doctor not prescribe other pain medication? Shouldn't you be able to medically get someone to put ""weed doesn't work"" on your file or whatever and congrats, your back on those damn pills?

How do I go about it?
There are so many shitty memories I have because of her, that I've never told her about to protect her. I don't wanna break her heart.

Part of me thinks the only way she will wake up is if I threaten to not talk to her (I really don't wanna do that, she's put me through hell, but she's my mom y'know)

I would legit stay for a few days and then quit because it got so bad. I had a drug issue since I was about 13 which I blame a lot of this for. Killing my motivation and self esteem and whatnot.

She called me yesterday telling me that she slept with one of my buddies, who is 23, from high school. She was all upset because he has now blocked her on Facebook or Snapchat and feels used and like she made a mistake. 

I separated myself from the situation and talked to her about all of the factors like; have you been talking together for a while, did you trust him, where you on the same page, did you use protection and so forth. 
She tells me that she didn’t want anything serious with him, but just felt crap because now he has blocked her and she feels used. I explained to her that unfortunately there are some boys who will sweet talk you until they get what they want then never talk to you again...it isn’t a good thing but it’s a fact. I also explained to her that if she feels ready she should explore with what she wants to do in this world, but she she has to understand the possible repercussions. She understood this.

417,"As the title suggests, I'm just done with university at this point. Four years I've been at it but this last year is really taking its toll on me, I'm struggling with learning anything and will probably fail my exams but I really don't know what the point of it all is. I honestly just can't deal with the anxiety and stress anymore, even looking at my books makes me physically sick after so many years of this.

I'm still trying obviously but there's a large part of me that just wants to stop, like surely a piece of paper can't be worth me losing my early adult years locked away in a room, ripping my hair out over exams. Is this really so important that I become ill at the mere thought of an exam?

I really want to remain hopeful but after years of education has hammered in the idea that you must attend university and you must pass or you'll be a failure I'm facing a few doubts, what I want to know is am I going to end up a failure if I do just give up on University?",01Jan2019,1
418,"So For context, I recently set up as a sole trader and I'm having serious trouble getting my Client to Pay his invoices on time.  


I have been working with this client for a few months, with weekly invoices that we agreed would be paid at most 14 days after the week the product was delivered.( \*not\* invoice delivery)  


 I had a bit of trouble delivering my invoices at first as he refused to take paper invoices to had to set up using an online app (which has been very useful) meaning that invoices would be 1 or two days late while i got the hang of it   
(i.e i agreed to deliver the invoice on Monday to be paid that Friday, but i'd deliver it on a Tuesday or Wednesday but not for the last 2 invoices)   


now he has missed three invoices two of which are consecutive (last two weeks) one of which is a random week which he seems to be ignoring.   


now my main issues with confronting him are as follows:  
1- i have already spoken to him about being two invoices behind several times, he changes the subject when i bring it up and tries to pick an argument with my product (which he still took and sold after all issues had been previously rectified and comped) or gets passive aggressive with me  
2-he is currently my only client so I can't tell him to stuff it.  
3-I am very new to this so I don't know if this is normal behaviour.  
4- I hate conflict, and i'm terrified of coming across as money grabbing, passive aggressive or rude.   


  
does anyone have any advice on how to approach this in such away that i can get my money (which at this point is just short of a grand) but not result in causing a fracture in Client-Supplier rapport

My girlfriend said to me that the reason he hates me is because we couldn’t form a certain bond together, (FYI me and my girlfriend are 1 year together now and counting) when we are at her place and just casually hanging out in the living room together, he would ALWAYS be in another room, this gives me the impression that he is avoiding me for some reason.

I work a good job. Been here for three years. I like my job but the management is horrible. No leadership, no accountability and no communication. We’re a nationwide corporation and ranked in the bottom three in terms of productivity. Lately I have been thrown in the mud whenever things go wrong...it’s a long story but the bosses want to sit down with me tomorrow and I have a feeling they’re going to let me go.

However....

It is widely known, but never discussed, among the employees and supervisors that our HR manager is dating and has been dating an entry level employee for over the last year. It’s treated among the staff as a don’t ask dont tell. Over the course of several months I have been collecting evidence and recording private conversations (it’s legal in my state) with fellow employees and supervisors who know about it and acknowledge it. They have been caught leaving work together at the end of the day, seen in restaurants together, shopping together, taking vacations together, etc. there’s even a rumor now that they’re living together. All of which violates company policy. 

My bosses don’t think I know this. My plan is if they fire me then I will tell them I will rat everyone out to corporate which will for sure fire all of them if they find out especially with all the evidence I have.

436,"This might be a bit of a strange one, especially considering that this isn't necessarily coming from many personal problems, but I have to ask... how could I not feel so pessimistic, angry, etc,. about the world around me?

Believe it or not, my personal life is honestly fine. I'm doing OK in school, I have a decent job, I come from a family that has always tried to make me a happy and good person, and I've even accomplished and discovered some positive things: I have better drawing skills, I've recently found a band that always makes me smile now (The Rippingtons), and I've overall grown very positively throughout my life, especially in the past couple of years.

As I've gotten older and lost my naive nature of the world, though, I've also had this nagging tick inside my mind that's sometimes gets emotionally destructive. No, I am not suicidal, but I would sometimes spend time being sad, cynical or angry, particularly after a news report or even after someone shares their outlooks on life or of the modern world. I know I shouldn't, and I think it's OK for others to express their feelings, but something ticks in me when someone says ""Why should I bother doing this when the US is falling down"" or ""Everything seems to just now fall apart these days"". It doesn't help when the news does this.

Yes, I know negative things in the world are not new, and I can be damn sure that a starving kid would not gain the same media attention in, say, 1989 or 1999 as he/she would in 2019 (I almost typed in 2018. lol). In a way, I almost feel as though modern information overload could be used for good, as the attention could turn to positive action for a brighter future. 

Yet, I almost feel as though it's becoming overwhelming, and that no matter what I do, something's gonna go wrong. I know a perfect world has never existed, and that I can't do every little thing in the world, but still. I hate it when I spend time being hopeless or angry about world politics or social issues. No, I don't do this all the time (I honestly can't think of many days in this past year alone that I had a super shitty day, which has got to say something), but it does still occur, and it feels so damn ugly. Sometimes, I almost get a headache. 

Granted, I've been a lot better throughout the past couple of years. I'm definitely not the edgy and cynical kid I was back in, say, 2013 (when things like the Boston Bombings and talks about the ton of bad movies that year literally had me say, in the last minute of 2013, saying ""This year sucked""), but it still sprites up, and I would like to know what you guys would suggest. I don't want to be a pessimist.


BONUS QUESTION: What good, positive or hopeful movies would you all suggest? I've seen a lot of dark, cynical and negative films lately (Leaving Las Vegas, Brazil, etc,.), the so that's not helping. lol.

this story would take me 20 hours to write in full so ill do it short

I went to visit my girlfriend (she lives in a different country), everything went smooth and well for 4-5 months. After, we got into an argument and she ran away.

problem is: 

1. she is pregnant (and i am the father)
2. her cousin is looking for her to... beat her up (she owes him money, not related to our own problems) and i know this because he called me to say this.

i don't know:

1. where she currently is
2. where her cousin currently is

i only know the city they're currently in.

i need to find her really quick because she is essentially my wife. and to warn her / get the problem with cousin fixed.

she:

1. has a phone but without card/number
2. she is probably staying at a family members home, but i don't know where. (her family won't talk to me because she lied to them.)
3. she has no social media accounts.

she is a good woman but currently has one of those 'big stress' moments.

For years she was everything to me 
When we first got together we was very happy 
I (age 15 at the time) had made a few mistakes during our first year together, im only human and at the time a dumb teenager as well
We got through it though and had a great 2nd year together 
Or so i had told myself
She had became very controlling 
Eventually emotionally abusive
I had lost many friends
Almost my best friend that i had known since i was 3
Gave up so much hopes and dreams 
All to keep her happy 
Though i know she never really noticed that she was treating me the way she was
It got so bad she had put down my dreams that i wanted to try to pursue in life 
She called me stupid a lot of times

And one thing i never told anyone when i have ever tried talking about 
Is that she would get so mad when i wouldnt have phone sex with her
(It was a long distance relationship)
It waa every night too for a very long time

She would even ignore me if i didnt do it


The second halloween we were together we meet for the first time and had a good time together

Then again at christmas
But about a week after christmas she became more distant 

She would text constantly on her phone while we was on the phone and not talk to me

Once i asked politely if we coule talk on the phone without texting and she went off and didnt talk to me all night

Well to shorten the story some a lot of fighting followed shortly after that and she had left me for some guy 
Fast foward about 6-8 months later we get back together 

We had a great and wonderful relationship this time around 
Until.. prom came around
I had bought a suit 
She a dress
We were both so happy and ready 
To see each other but the morning of prom came and i had got very sick
I was throwing up every 3 to 5 minutes sometimes sooner
I had to stay on the toilet all day cause i couldnt hold nothing in
And she got so furious and threatened to leave me but we worked things out
I thought
She got distant again
And for the story i must rewind back about 2 months
I went and visited her and we went to her friends house 
There was one guy and a girl 
The guy liked other guys and the girl i had talked to before over the phone when my girlfriend was with her once or twice

We all had a good time
Eventually we talked about how cheating is bad and all agreed that even if the person said cheater is cheating on with is gay and of the opposite sex its still cheating

Well fast forward 2 weeks after prom
My girlfriend (we were both 18 at the time) had let her gay friend who i had mentioned before
Play with her breast
And i got upset
She knew this was something i would've been upset from
She herself agreed with the same guy that it was considered cheating


Well we fought and then i had forgiven her but the next day she left me for some other person
I told her off and i said ""two to three weeks you will be back begging for me to forgive you and i wont cause i hate you"" 
I didnt but i felt it at the time

Sure enough i was right she came back and i forgave her only to be left again the next day 

That was almost 3 years ago now 
I already held pain inside from events prior to meeting her 
And now the pain is so great inside it has not stopped and only has grown
I lost all friends except one who i dont see or talk to much
I lost the ability to socialize even online 
I cant make friends

I feel so alone
I have hit rock bottom in the past year 
And 2019 is starting off bad too

Sorry this is long i needed to vent
If anyone kept reading till the end 
Thanks for reading 
And if theres anyone who can give me some advice on how to move on 
It would be much appreciated.

457,"I am struggling to deal with the passive aggressive rudeness of someone who had been a friend at my work place. I am trying to just not let it bother me but it's getting to me. 
I haven't spoken to her about it, I feel as though at least knowing what was going on there would help, but I suspect that she will just say it's in my head. There is a lot of drama at work and a lot in the social group we shared. 
I am scared though that trying to talk to her about it will make it worse. At least with just passive aggressive rudeness at work it is easier to ignore it and carry on working, she's is unhelpful, randomly ignores me, glares, pretends not to hear me or is friendly at other times if I speak to her, but won't seem to address  me directly even about  purely work matters if she can help it, holds events with people who had been shared friends and does not invite me, then talks about it in front of me at work but as far as I know she's not actively working against me but it's hurting me. I am not even sure though that I want this person as a friend anymore. I have had warnings against her from people whose opinions I respect and seen some poor behaviour that makes me unsure about her, I appreciate though that she has her own issues she's going through. 
But it's hard to deal with particularly as this person knows some very sensitive information about me that I now wish I had never trusted her with . . . About an assault I went through, that I am trying to deal with. Having a reminder of that everyday at work makes it much harder for me, especially with her behaviour.
I am trying to clear negative influences from my life I think she is likely one but I don't know how to do that when I have to work with her.
I would appreciate advice.",01Jan2019,1

459,"Hello, Reddit. Please help if you can!

Our neighbour is quickly becoming a complete headache. She moved in a few months ago and everything was fine initially. We live in a ground floor flat of a purpose built block with 3 floors and 5 flats on each floor. It’s a really lovely, quiet place to live where everyone is respectful and mindful of the fact they have people living all around them.

She was quiet initially, we didn’t hear a peep out of her until one night when she randomly started screaming at 3am. It woke me up (I’m a light sleeper) and I was like WTF! It wasn’t a scream of terror but more like she was laughing and screaming? I think she had a lad round. It’s just quite quickly gone downhill from there. We REGULARLY hear her in her bedroom (on the other side of our adjoining wall, sadly) shrieking and screaming at all hours. 3am, 11pm, 6:30am - I was like, who the fuck has that much energy so early in the morning?
This obnoxious behaviour has now descended to the point where she is playing rap music for hours and hours straight and its just messing me up. The night before New Year’s Eve she has her music playing until gone 1am. I was absolutely fuming - and upset as it’s really stressing me out. I could hear the people in the flat above her banging on their floor/her ceiling with something to say STFU and she eventually did after about 30 mins of them doing so. It’s really starting to take its toll on me mentally. When I walk through the door to my flat, straight away I’m thinking, is the music playing? If it’s not, I find myself almost on edge like I’m waiting for it to start. When we got home from friends last night, I actually stopped at a pharmacy on the way home and bought some earplugs as I was stressing about the fact it was NYE and she would certainly be making a racket. As it was, we had a good couple of hours until she got in about 1:30am and the music started. It was only for half an hour but it really stressed me out. She has the music at this level which is loud enough for us to hear but the words are intelligible over a constant beat. It’s just constantly there. We’re watching TV/having a chat/trying to read/live our lives and this fucking mind torture is just there with us.

I know people are going to say just go round there but I really don’t want to. What I’ve learnt in my life is obnoxious, entitled people will always be like that and there’s nothing you can do or say that could change things. I had a quick look at r/badneighbors and it looks as though anyone sharing a story of where they have politely confronted the neighbour, it has all ended up 50 times worse and I can’t take that risk. 

 I need to put it out there that I suffer from chronic derealisation disorder. This means I feel detached from reality 24/7. It’s a pretty uncomfortable condition to live with, as I’m sure you can imagine. Somehow, I manage to hold down my relationship, job etc. I nearly totally lost my mind a couple of years ago and was suicidal. I ended up being supported by the local mental health team and learned to cope with it. I have removed anything that tends to exacerbate the issue (alcohol, caffeine etc.).
My condition brings a serious amount of anxiety with it, though. It feels like my mind is continually over working (think hamster in a wheel). I’m very open about it all and my colleagues, partner, friends and family are all very patient and understanding. My condition means I am more sensitive to light and noise so this is just a total nightmare for me. All the extra anxiety from this situation is  making me extra detached. 

I guess all I’m asking for is advice on how to cope with this stressful situation? I wondered if anyone could recommend any techniques to distract my mind from continually thinking about it all and zoning out when it’s all happening?

469,"Hi. Need advice on how to stay strong when dealing with an ex-girlfriend. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Short **recap** of the relationship:

Got to know her in 2014, we liked each other and got into a long-distance relationship (she is from a different country, language, and culture). It was my first relationship and so far the only one. I visited her later that year. The sex was awful because I was bizarrely paranoid of her getting pregnant, regardless of the contraceptives we used. We also had different views about how sex should be. However, we stayed together.

She visited me in 2015. Within a few days she told me of her idea about moving to my city to continue her studies here and to live with me. I objected because I had a lot going on, didn't know how my life would proceed, and could not deal with being responsible for another person too (at least it felt like I'd be responsible for her)! Also my attraction to her had diminished, but I didn't tell her because it would unnecessarily hurt her further. I ended the relationship. She stayed with me for the rest of the month as planned, and we travelled a lot. Since we were living together all the time (and in small quarters), feelings came up again and we sometimes started cuddling and making out. Whenever I came to my senses I aborted those sessions because I regarded them as slip-ups, mistakes to be avoided.

The relationship ended on friendly terms. She's still a dear and special person to me, we helped each other through dark times, and we still keep in touch to this day. In 2017 she visited me again for a few days. I only have one large bed so we shared the same bed. I suggested ""enjoying the time together"" because ""what's the harm?"" (yes, you see, I'm a horny idiot). The subsequent cuddling and sex led to the same issues as before.

I realised that this on-again-off-again behaviour is unhealthy for both of us and only leads to tears. I told her that we shouldn't kiss, make out, or have sex anymore. Luckily, she found a boyfriend later that year (again an LDR) so lots of the tension between us was removed when I visited her for a day.

**The issue:**

Still, I'm afraid of being close to her for an extended period of time because I don't know if I will become nostalgic/romantic/horny again. For example, when we plan a holiday together or when I visit her. (Right now I don't know if she's still together with her boyfriend.) Also, one the one hand I don't find her really attractive anymore, on the other hand it still happens that I fantasise about her when I'm masturbating, which is weird. What can I do to stick to my resolution, especially when things become heated?

TL;DR: I'm afraid of getting close to an ex-girlfriend because I might succumb to nostalgic romantic feelings and horniness.",01Jan2019,1
471,"Specific to my situation, I live in a smaller town so it's not usually random people I don't know or I would just remove them. The people I'm referring to are guys I see on a regular enough basis. There are a couple that message me maybe once a week, usually stuff like ""hey"" or ""you looked nice today"" or whatever over and over. They are friendly enough and I don't want to block them if I'm going to have to see them around. These are also people I'm not interested in talking to simply because I'm not interested, I suppose. Also, they never talk to me in public lol, I'm assuming they are shy. 

Anyways, I'm curious as to how other people deal with this, be it a guy or a girl messaging you. Do you just be honest and tell them you don't want to talk? Delete them anyways? Keep ignoring their messages? Force a conversation you don't want to have? And why? The notifications are starting to annoy me.

474,"Hey everyone, I’m going to start off by saying she’s not my mom, but she did a good deal in raising me and I’m very close to her. Every now and then we’ll reserve an evening and go out to eat and talk all evening. She has her own cleaning business (she’s the only one) and she has many customers. She just picked up a new customer (we will call her Susan) who goes to her church, and she has been behind on her payments. Susan always sucks up to her about how well my mom cleaned her house, and how she loves it when she cleans.  Every time she came to clean the house, she would have money to catch up on her payment but it was never the complete amount. 

The last time, Susan had no money sitting out when she got there and said “I’ll bring the money on Sunday, sorry i never remember to get cash” right as my mom was wrapping up at Susan’s house. She now owes her $420. 

I’ve heard a couple of people complaining about Susan before and how bad she is about paying people, but my mom didn’t know that. My mom isn’t cleaning her house anymore, and isn’t going to if she asks again. She does so much for her family and it kills me thinking that she’s getting taken advantage of by this bitch. While $420 isn’t a whole lot to her, it’s still a good chunk of money that she needs to be paid back. 

If I could, I would handle it myself. She made me promise that I wouldn’t tell anyone, and I told her I would do some research on the best way to handle this situation. She’s afraid that if she’s too aggressive she will scare her away from the church, and that’s not what she wants. She’s too sweet and wants no beef with anyone. The position that she’s in could cause a lot of heat within the church if something were to blow up. 

I need to know the best advice to give her on how to go about doing this. I told her I would be willing to print her out an invoice to mail to her, but that’s the best idea I’ve got.

478,"Well Reddit, I guess this is the best place to find a general consensus on this strange situation I'm finding myself in. 

Flashback about 5 years ago, I had a longtime friend living with me and he met a girl. Within a few months he had moved in with her and he seemed happy. Then came a situation a couple years ago when a mutual friend mentioned that my buddies girl was referring to him as her ""roommate"" when at parties and such together. Now, at this time he and I had drifted apart a little so I didn't have much first hand interaction with him or her in these social settings. It did strike me as odd that she would call him her roommate since I knew she had been going to school at the time and he was footing the Bill's for everything. 

Flash forward to about 8 months ago, my little bro and I were at a bar and ran into the 2 of them together.....it had been a while since he and I got to catch up so we were admittedly a little one sided in our conversation and his girl and my bro were left to chat amongst themselves. After about 45 minutes of catching up my brother and I left the bar, and on the way out my brother says ""man that girl is a bitch"". Confused, I ask him to elaborate....he goes on to tell me that she mentioned my buddy in conversation but referred to him as her roommate.  He then says that he double checked with her to make sure she was talking about the right person, to which she responded ""yeah, he and I are just roommates"". 

This brings me to my current dilemma.  I got a text from my buddy today saying that she had proposed to him on new year's and that he was excited. 

So I guess my question to you all is, do I say something to him? Do I say something to her? Or do i just stay silent and let nature take its course?",01Jan2019,1

480,"Hey everyone, I wasn't really sure where to go and I don't want to involve my other friends in ""drama"" so here I am. Also sorry for formatting since I'm on mobile. 

Basically, last night I (23 F) drank a little too much and ended up getting emotional, over something stupid, which led to a full on breakdown. I isolated myself in the bathroom until a friend texted me and told me our ride was coming and I replied that I would meet them outside. When I did meet them, I was a bit angry because I wanted to be left alone and admittedly was very rude to them. Well, we ended up fighting more when we got to another friend's house (where we had driven to and hung out all together before going out) because I wanted to go home and be alone. They didn't want me to drive (understandable) and when I decided to stay at this house we were at, the friend I fought with wouldn't let me be alone. They were convinced I was going to hurt myself if I was alone and I, trying to remain as calm as I could, said that I wasn't going to do anything of the sort and that I just wanted to get changed, take off my make up, and go to sleep. They followed me around the house and tried to argue with me about it saying I shouldn't be left alone and that I wasn't fine. Eventually, after a lot of arguing and them yelling at me, they left.

Cut to this morning where they're telling me and another friend that I said some horrible things to them and if I want to keep the friendship I need to apologize. I talked with them and apologized but, they claim I brought up their struggles with their mental illness and their past that hurt them immensely and I need to apologize for that more than anything. The thing is, I don't remember saying anything like that (nor was I drunk enough to black out) and I refused because I don't want to give a lie as an apology. We've been arguing back and forth over what happened and they keep telling me things like I don't love them, don't respect our friendship, they wouldn't lie to me about this, they didn't think I was this kind of person, etc. I finished off with saying that I'm sorry they feel the way they do and I had no intentions of hurting them but I really don't recall saying this but, if I truly did then I'm sorry. 

I honestly feel attacked and like I'm being manipulated into apologizing for something that I'm really not sure I did. Plus, I just feel like shit and wondering if maybe I really am as bad as they said I am because I don't know if I want to continue this friendship anymore. I'm drained and tired. 

Sorry that this was so long and if anything doesn't make any sense I can clear things up if needed. I'm just really not sure what else to say or do and I'd like to know if I was in the wrong and if it's worth it to continue this relationship. Also, is it possible to shame someone into apologizing?

483,"My fiancé and I (25) purchased our first semi-detached home in September. The two guys who lived here previously were lovely and got on well with the neighbours so I hear. (Inviting them over for parties etc) 

Well we moved in and our next door neighbours who are maybe 1-2 years older than us, never said hello or looked at us. Fair enough, then don’t need to. But one week after moving in we had 4 friends over to show them round and have a few drinks. The laws where I am is you can make noise until 11pm, and at 10:45 on the Saturday night the neighbour hung her head out the window and shouted for us to keep it down. 

Obviously when someone says keep it down you just apologise and make efforts to be quieter, so we did and shortly after everyone went home. In the last 3 months we’ve had people over another 2 times, all on weekends. 

We have the tv on at a normal volume and I always make conscious efforts to keep it quiet, we walk around normally, our dishwasher gets put on in the day time. Once my fiancé went out to the garage at about 10:45 to put a few clothes in the dryer because that’s where it’s installed. And the only other thing I can think of is our cat was meowing outside the front door at 2am and my fiancé opened the front door to let her in.

I’m saying all this because our neighbours bang on our walls at night, don’t make any effort to speak to us and have told a different neighbour we speak to that we’re really noisy and that there is a problem between us. 

My fiancé went outside and the male neighbour was speaking to the neighbour we are friends with and tried to shake his hand and introduce himself, to which he shook his hand back without making eye contact and just said “yeah hi”

We also went to give them a letter for the previous owners as they sent us a message saying they were meeting up with the neighbour so could we pass them on any mail, so we took it upon ourselves to try and build a bridge and give them our number in case they want to speak to us about anything. They happened to be outside when we went over and the male neighbour just told us to post the letter through his door (without making eye contact) and it looks like when we gave the number he walked off to the bin afterwards and binned it.

I’m getting to a point where we’ve saved for so long to get our house, and thoroughly loved it until this. I just don’t understand what we’ve done because they don’t talk to us and I’m between pushing more to try and speak to them or if that would make me a pushover and I should just ignore them. I would love to get on with my neighbours and live this happy life but it seems we’re being painted out to others to be these noisy nightmare neighbours.

I don’t know if it’s that we’re younger and they’re trying to prove themselves or if they just hate us but what should I do?
If I do try and build another bridge how should I go about it?
Or do I just get on with my life?

488,"Okay so long story short, my parents are saying I don't talk to them and ignore them. I'm 18 and attended school fulltime, undertaking 4 alevels which I am struggling with and get easily stressed out by.
I often sit in my room by myself, revising or playing games what ever. Sometimes on Skype calls with friends it just depends on the day and such. 
I talk to my mum more than my dad, she would ask how school is and how my day was etc. Nothing too deep, as for my dad it is usually just ""goodnight"" when he puts my younger brother to bed. He talks to my brother a lot and they do activities together.
They claim I don't talk to them/ignore - but when I sit with them for dinner no one talks. When I walk in, my mum usually would ask something at times and never my dad. If I'm getting a lift/in the car with them there is minimal/no conversation made. 
It's difficult enough to make conversation, but it has been like that for years so it doesn't really seem weird to me anymore. I do try make conversation but it just ends up quite dry (especially with my dad.) So I tend not to, but neither do they.
After a short explosion of me not talking and ignoring them I just stormed off. This has happened before in my house, and it's driving me absolutely crazy.
When it happens and I state my facts of how they behave they completely ignore it, and it's really frustrating. I don't tend to get angry at them but more upset as it does hurt a lot when it feels like they do not care about me. 
I feel this has made me more distant from them, and more disconnected to the point of me actually not caring if I do or don't speak to them. 
I don't really know what I'm doing or why I'm posting, but was just wanting some advice. ",01Jan2019,1

Everyone was out and about doing shit for Christmas and New Years And I’ve been sitting on my ass at home, celebrating with nobody and not giving much of a shit. I wake up late and go to bed late everyday and I’m overusing the shit out of technology.

The drawing is too close to being done to throw away, but not near enough to being completed for me to quickly finish it.

494,"Hello I'm completely new to Reddit so sorry for typos and what not.  So I been friends with her for over a year, we met via a group chat and then decided to add each other on Instagram and kkt, we text alot and became close friends. I'm 20 and she's 19, she lives in Canada while I live in Az. Anyway on November 15 I let her borrow money because she told me she was short on rent and if she didn't pay on time she would have to leave the apartment. She couldn't borrow from other friends and her parents didn't have enough to help her. She basically blew her entire student loans on attending a concert, buying K-pop albums &amp; merch all $2300 gone in a span of 2 1/2 months. She told me she would pay me back in a week since her check would clear by then and she would be able to pay me back. I was skeptical but I didn't want her to kicked out so I told her I would help out. Her PayPal would need a deposit so she wouldn't get the money asap as she needed, but she told me her roommate suggested I PayPal it to her then she would just withdraw and give it to 'Allie', so I did send the $300 to her roommate. She was happy and relieved, the very next day she began texting me she didn't want to go to work because she wanted to go eat with friends and get ""hammered"". She kept putting work off the following week and then I asked when she would be able to send me the money back and she said ""It cleared already, but I'm gonna have to get you back in January when I get my next round o student loans because I won't be able to afford December's rent if I send you money now 😣😣😣😣"". I told her I would need it no later than January 2nd and she said she would definitely have it by then. We kept texting and everything seemed fine until I realized my dog got sick and is diagnosed with pyometra, I have to pay up to $1,600. I began texting her about it on December 22 but then on the 29th apparently she had been deffered from her university until  Jan 2020. Meaning she won't get any student loans at all and therefore cannot pay me, she texted me ""But because of that, that means I won't be able to pay you back for a long while because I won't be getting student loans 😭"", I told her how I need money asap for my dog and she responded with how she's struggling with coming up for rent on January. She then proceeded to tell me to start a GoFundMe or euthanize my dog. Which is not a option at all, I will not do that whatsoever. I began selling some albums and have gathered around $550, I told her to do the same and she refused to sell any of her albums or other things. She told me she's barely been working and has only put in 4 hours  a week of work in the span of December. I told her about a payment plan but she's been ignoring my messages for the past 2 days. However she's active on Instagram group chat sending posts and ""having fun"" . I feel like she lying about this all because she's been out drinking and buying so much things. I told my other friend and she told me to contact my bank to do a reverse payment (or charge back) telling them she has deleted most forms of contact so I can get the money back, however if I file a dispute it would affect her friend who was just the one getting the money to send to her. I realized if I go through with this me and Allie will probably no longer be friends, but my dog is sick and she is refusing to try and pay me back so I honestly feel used :(. Idk if I should tell her friend to send me the $300 to see if she will and then Allie will have to pay her back, or just contact the bank and hope I can win the dispute? Any advice on what to , or how I can sound appealing to PayPal to win this case and get the money back?? The pyometra disease can be deadly and I'm just so worried idk what to do at this point since I literally just had paid for my college courses so I have to rely on selling things and getting the money back I lent her quickly.",01Jan2019,1

496,"I'll start with some background. I live in a 3 bedroom house, currently one bedroom is unoccupied, and the couple is living in another. When they moved in all of the bedrooms were full and utilities were split 3 ways, but then one guy moved out, so we split it two ways.

His girlfriend does not have her own place, stays at our house seven nights a week, does his laundry and hers, bathes, cooks, the whole shebang. She has a considerable ammount of clothing stored in our community closet and she even gets mail delivered to our house. 

Anytime I bring up having her chip in on the utilities it sparks a huge argument with my roommate. I'm talking like a HUGE argument. He claims ""she doesn't live here"" because here name is not on the lease. I usually explain the earlier facts about how she does live here, she uses our utilities, and thus should help out. Nothing I do or say gets through to him and every time I bring it up it just creates more animosity between us.

Furthermore, our lease states that guests cannot stay in the house for more than 15 days without written consent of the landlord, which I know he does not have. 

How can I convince him that she needs to help out?

But right now, his girlfriend kinda moved in (like she is always home with him). So the weeks when I am home a lot, I kinda have to quickly use the kitchen or other common spaces and close my room to give them privacy or whatever! Right now I feel like I am used to being inside my room than outside or I can't keep the door open.  My girlfriend crashes at my place a few times in a week and when she is around I keep the door closed as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day when I was in the kitchen, his girlfriend was like ""hey, you have this ice cream sitting in the fridge since a long time. Do you want to throw it out?"" I wanted to tell her, your bf has not thrown out trash bags in weeks - maybe you should fix that first? But, instead I took things positively and said. ""Well, we can throw it out - it's probably old"" (Holding my anger to myself). 

&amp;#x200B;

How do the rest of you guys deal with such situations? Keep the door open always? Keep it closed and mind my own business (which I do currently)? I kinda feel it's not normal to keep my door closed all the time, but then again I don't want to be a third wheel all the time! How to avoid that?

499,"I’m a 19 year old college student and I’ve decided I want to get my ears pierced.

506,"Happy 2019 to all. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first post on r/advice, so here goes... I feel like everything in my life is going wrong right now. I feel like I have too many things on my plate right now that I need to write everything down and breathe for a bit. I'm also looking for suggestions, advice, and/or anything else that could help me think clearer and find solutions. 

&amp;#x200B;

First thing, I had a falling out with my roommate. Long story short, she *was* my bff and signed a 1 yr lease with me... however she is now looking to move in with her SO... 5 months into our contract. I'm now frantically searching for a new tenant to take over the lease (or pay a cancellation fee... which I am willing to pay... roommate not much so). Step number one will be to fix this issue and figure out what to do after that. Oh, and cut her off/out of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to another issue... I *want* to move into a 1br apartment, but I also have the option to move back in with my parents. If I move back in with my parents I can save for either a down payment for a home (one of my goals) or make larger payments on my car note (both options are good, but I wont have any freedom at home). The apartment, I really want bc I know that there's a lot of issues at home, and I don't want to deal with those... plus I obviously will have all the freedom I currently have, and will get to finally set my own rules. The BIGGEST issue with the apartment option is that the complexes I've been researching (and able to afford) are way outside the city (30+ mins from work) and just thinking about rush hour traffic (I live in a big city) is dreadful. However, another goal of mine is to find another job that pays higher so, I *may not* be working at the current location in 2019. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling for a while now... my job absolutely sucks... I finally admitted to myself that my best friend has been toxic for the past two years... am single at 26... and I feel like I'm in the same boat I was in a year ago. But, I need to change this in 2019... and I've gotten inspired to create a mood/dream board for this year... I think I am going to start with that. In the meantime I'm applying to every job I feel qualified for, and not giving up on that. 

&amp;#x200B;

507,"My girlfriend is 23 and I’m 24. We’ve been together 4 years now and things have been going pretty good as far as I could tell. Anyways sometime in between Christmas and New Years while visiting my parents out of town, according to my (completely hetero) sister (19), my girlfriend drunkenly expressed her lust for my sister and even tried coming on to her. My sister told me she declined but that they had a heart to heart and told me that they were “good”. This happened at like 4am and my gf was blacked out and doesn’t recall any of that night. My sister told me this on a trip to the grocery store for our New Years party at our parents where we were all staying. We just got home today, and I haven’t had the nerve to bring it up with her. I know that my girlfriend has dated girls when she was younger and has never been ashamed of her bisexuality. But the fact that she has a hard on for my sister just kinda bugs me. I’ve told her in the past that if she ever wants to hook up with other girls so long as I’m involved that’s fine, but she never has. I understand that she wouldn’t tell me about having a crush on my sister, but obviously I could never be involved, so the fact that she went behind my back and tried to potentially hook up with her is kind of a huge red flag; like who else has she not told me about?

Anyways I’m not sure what to do, whether or not I should pretend like my sister never told me anything. Confront my girlfriend about it? I mean I have no real reason to believe she’s ever cheated on my before, I mean I can’t possibly know for sure, but I doubt it. We both seem pretty content with the relationship, and we’re both actually pretty eager about buying a house and maybe getting engaged and starting a family, seeing as now we’re both out college. Not to seem to conceited, but I I feel so blessed to be in such a perfect relationship sometimes it seems too good to be true. And not that this just happened I’m starting to second guess our future.
