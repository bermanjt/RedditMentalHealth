0,"I'm 17F and I think I may be too controlling and uptight. My friend recently ended a year long relationship and almost immediately had a relationship with several other guys. However, she's gotten to know one who is her best friend's ex and is known to be a bad person. She has been keeping their talking a secret from everyone but me. She ignores all the things he's done in the past because he's ""so deep and into music"". I am concerned that she's ruining her relationship with her best friend right before graduation and it's just really dumb. I also feel like I seem really needy and pathetic to her so I'm sure that's clouding my judgment.",12Feb2019,1
1,"About a month ago I had a doctor's appointment where I had ask about my my mental health. I asked for a mental evaluation they agree to scheduling me one but I never received a time and date. My mother told me that I have an appointment for the 11th which is today and that she never received any mail about where it was going to be so I end up not being able to go to a appointment today. I believe any information was immediately hidden by my parents in order to keep me from being able to go and from""being labeled"". I am concerned that I might be depressed and that I might be suffering PTSD from when I was in a home invasion at the age of seven (a home invasion that they weren't present for). When I give them my concerns about my mental health they tell me to essentially find a different solution then the go to a medical professional example then just stop feeling sad. I feel lied to and I don't know what to do about this, My Hope Is that the collective of the internet will be able to help me in some way.

TL:DR I had an appointment to go to a psychiatric evaluation and I believe my parents had purposely keep me from going under the fear I'm going to ""be labeled"" when I feel I'm most likely suffering from depression anxiety and probably PTSD. What can I do to fix this?",12Feb2019,1
2,"Some background. I’m 20, my boyfriend’s 22. We live together, we’ve been dating for a couple years. We’re both in grad school. My boyfriend is graduating this spring. The only job he has currently is as a TA at school, I doubt he makes much doing that. Once he graduates he will have a job that pays very well. Currently, because he’s poorer than a church mouse. I’m paying for everything. I buy groceries, I pay rent, I pay for vacations entirely (even when I don’t get to pick where we go), I pay for activities we do (concerts, shows, etc.), I even end up paying for things like Starbucks runs. I haven’t really minded paying up until now since once he graduates he will end up paying so it will even out. 

Recently I’ve gotten tired of paying for everything. He wastes food, which I have no tolerance for. I don’t care about buying food, but I have a huge problem wasting food and money. I’ve had several discussions with him about that and he always says we will do better but it never gets better. An example of this is with takeout, if we have leftovers he never helps eat them. I always have to finish stuff by myself (which I can’t do before it goes bad, there’s just too much) and then stuff goes in the trash. Another example is when we try a new food and it ends up being gross; I was raised to just finish the nasty food and not buy it again. My boyfriend just throws stuff away. Like one time he bought this jug of almond/coconut milk. He didn’t like it after tasting it and then just left it in the fridge and never drank any more of it. I don’t really drink milk, and he kept saying he would use it so I didn’t have any but then we just ended up throwing it away. I don’t really understand why he is like this. He was poor as a child and is poor now, wouldn’t a person without money not waste food? 

We had an agreement when we moved in together (which was like 7 months ago), which was that he would be in charge of cooking and most of the cleaning (two things I *hate* doing). Nothing gets cleaned unless I do it or people come over (when people come over he helps clean and our place is sparkling!). He also barely cooks, which is why I got these pre-made meals. 

He also seems to have gotten too comfortable with me paying. Yesterday was our anniversary. We went to a fancy hotel and had afternoon tea (I paid for this, which was okay. It was definitely more than he could spend). Then when we came home a few hours after tea he suggested we go to Starbucks, I said okay and guess who ended up paying for that too! I was a little annoyed. 

Anyway, we started a new diet. For this diet, I found a meal delivery service. They deliver cooked, portioned and prepared meals to your house. They run about $11-$15 per meal. I don’t mind the price so much because I *hate* cooking. My boyfriend can cook (and is amazing at it) but just doesn’t cook all that much. 

Basically my problem is that I don’t want to pay for these prepared meals for my boyfriend. I wanted to order one for everyday of the week. I don’t want to have to buy twice as many meals! That would be over $600/month just to eat one meal each per day. I already pay for everything, I feel like I should be able to get these meals for myself only. 

What’s a nice way to tell my boyfriend I don’t want to share these meals with him.",12Feb2019,1

5,So I’m 49. I quit cigarettes and alcohol for ten years. Addiction runs in my family and so does depression but I have never really felt depressed and thought that I had fought off the addiction. One of the last times I drank was when my dad was dying from cancer. I told him I would be back in a week. I drank wine the night before and slept in for two hours. Missed his death by two hours because I was late driving back. So I quit drinking. For years. Then I drank one 4th of July. I was sad because my 7 year old dog died. I’m a bit of a loner but I have had the same girlfriend for a decade. My girlfriend and I argued on the 4th. I raged and broke a window. I never laid a hand on her. The next day my friend who I knew was suffering from depression for a while came looking for me. Girlfriend said I was not there because I got mad and left. He committed suicide off bridge. I tried to start a business that I was sure would be successful because of where we lived . It failed. My body can’t do the construction business I have been in for a decade. Girlfriend started partying with her friends from her bar tending job . Not coming home. Turning off phone. We had bought a fixer upper house by the beach that I refinanced my long time home to purchase and her name is on it too. Now I don’t want to work on beach house because I have work split it with her. I have always been a loner besides my girlfriend and a couple friends. I’m too old to start again. I can fix anything but my skills only offer me $12 an hour jobs. I was close to semi retirement. Everything has failed. I am now taking Xanax and ambien just to get through a day without feeling like my skin is crawling off my body. I have honestly contemplated suicide because I could leave my son a nice chunk of money and primary house. Nothing brings satisfaction anymore. Not the sci fi I always loved. Not books or tv or projects. I find myself begging her to come back. Even though it’s pretty clear she has been cheating. I’m weak and hopeless and disconnected from the world. I feel like I am already a ghost. ,12Feb2019,1

9,"I've had a guy friend for over 12 years. We've been close on and off due to complications and my EX not liking them.

He's been there for me loads since my break up, which was pretty hard but be came to visit me for a weekend a few weeks ago for a catch up and to generally see each other as he lives down south.

Background: He's always fancied me, I don't think I ever have. He also have a fiancee.

Very awkwardly when we were off to bed drunk he admitted he was in love with me and would leave his fiancee for me if I felt the same. I told him I loved him like a brother and I couldn't do that to his woman or take our friendship further. Nothing more of the subject....

Until I wake up to a familiar noise...he was masturbating while I was in the bed...while looking at me. I was in shock so I never made it aware I was awake and about half an hour later I pretended to go to the toilet and never came back until the next morning, sleeping on the sofa. I've still not said anything about me being aware of this and well I don't really know how to proceed with it.

Do I end all ties of the friendship so he can move on and understand how disgusting and awkward this is? Or do I keep quiet and just back away from the friendship for a while.

19,"On mobile, sorry for formatting. Also using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I ***clearly*** will not be replying to DMs.

**Some background**: My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years. He is *very* attentive to my sexual needs, desires, fantasies, etc. We also like to spice things up periodically -- after all, if we want to stay together, gotta keep things interesting! We have sex pretty regularly, only having sex once per week or less if one of us is particularly stressed. Otherwise, we have sex 2-5 times a week. We get us some.

I also tend to masturbate a couple of times a week, as I don't want to overwhelm him with my sexual appetite. I'm a horney deviant, and he's a normal person.

**The Problem**: Recently, he brought my vibrator into play (along with his talented fingers), and gave me the fucking craziest orgasm of my life. Quite easily the best feeling ever. The problem is that since that day last week, I can't get myself off by masturbating!

22,"Hi all thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've recently moved out of my apartment and simply put, me and my previous hoisemate never really got along. Needless to say I've just received the last electricty bill and I've already moved out.

23,"Hi everyone. Sorry for the long wait for the update. I've been waiting until today to write it. My wife moved out today.

I'm going to write a summary of our relationship from the start, and everything that has happened since the first day I posted almost 2 months ago. I want to try to make sure everyone is getting the whole story, and not parts of it.

Before I start, I'd like to say thanks again to everyone that offered me advice, commented, or messaged me on my last post. Y'all really helped me get through the toughest point in my life so far, and I don't know how I would've dealt with it all without you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

My (soon to be ex) wife (S), and I went to high school together. We were in vastly different social circles, and rarely talked, but knew each other. I did a lot of drinking and partying, and she wasn't into any of that at all. She had a boyfriend in high school (J) that dragged her through hell and back emotionally (he'll be important later).

The first time we talked to each other that didn't involve a school project or class work, was shortly after graduation when I was talking the her best friend. We were talking because her best friend blew me off to go party, and idk, we just started texting. We seemed to click, but when her friend found out, she got mad, and we didn't talk again for a long time.

I joined the Military at 17 in March of '13. I finished basic training, and while still in job specific training, we started talking again. We really hit it off, and talked non-stop. We dated for 5-ish months, and I got orders overseas, and we decided to get married so that she could come with me.

Now, before you start telling me how stupid I am for getting married after dating for 5 months, and how stupid I am for getting married at 18, I know. Don't say it, I already know, and honestly I don't regret it in the slightest because if I hadn't, I wouldn't have my daughter, and I couldn't imagine living without her.

We moved overseas, and (even though she was on birth control) S got pregnant within the first year of being there. Neither of us were necessarily ready to be parents, but it has been amazing, and again, I don't regret it at all.

We were happy together, until at some point after a few years, we seemed to start growing apart. She says she felt like I didn't care about her and didn't listen to her, and I can completely understand why she felt like that.

She has a lot of self-deprecation issues, dependency issues, and is overall very negative. During the ~year total of time she worked in the 5 years we were together, she would come home every day from work and be extremely negative about it. She would complain constantly, and when she wasn't working, she'd complain about something at home.

It wasn't that I didn't care about her, or that I didn't want to listen and help with what she had going on, but it was that I couldn't listen to her constantly being so negative when everything I had to say to help she didn't seem to care about. She just wanted to vent to me, but would never ask me how my day was.

Fast forward a year or two of this, and you get to where I posted in December.

Around mid-late December, I found some messages on S's phone, where she had been talking to another guy (C). I posted to reddit to get advice because I was completely devastated. Things hadn't been perfect for a long time, but I still loved her more than I can explain. It destroyed me, and I turned to you all for advice.

Reddit helped me to keep a level head, and we talked about it. At first she was super apologetic, and said she wanted to fix things. She said she'd stop talking to him, and we would go to counseling to try and work on us. We went to one session that week, and within 48 hours she was texting him again.

Now, if I could think clearly when I am around her, I would have been adamant on ending it then and there, but I couldn't. I was still trying to win her back, and trying to make her choose me over him. Probably a stupid thing to do in hindsight, but I still loved her, and couldn't let go.

She decided a few days later, that she wanted to be with me, and I was happy because it was her choice, not me making her do it. Things seemed great for a few days. We were talking more than we had in years. I really thought we were going to be happy. 

Cue her texting him again.

I felt so dragged back and forth through hope and despair by this point, that it made me feel better to talk to her or be around her, and it hurt to talk to her or be around her. Conversely, it hurt to be away from her, but at the same time felt better.

It was at this point we were 100% sure we were getting divorced, and started making plans. My daughter went to stay with her Grandparents (my parents) 6 hours away so that she didn't have to see us going through everything.

A week or two later, we were still talking. We wanted to stay friends for our daughter sake, and secretly I was hoping she'd realize that she did make a mistake, and would want to be with me. At this point, she was definitely going to be moving out, but I held out hope that she would want to start over with me and date while we lived separately.

She started to get tired of C, and felt like he was too needy and smothering her. I had more hope. I couldn't trust her though. She had his too many things, and lied too much. Cue her texting her highschool boyfriend J, whom she had never really gotten over.

That was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I couldn't come back from it.

I no longer have any hope of us being together. If she did come to me now or in the future to try and get back together, I wouldn't. I have grown more in the past month than I have in the past few years.

I'm taking better care of myself and my life. I'm talking to family more. I'm trying to do more with my daughter, and be a better father (I went and spent a weekend at my parent's/with her, and she came home last night). 

She moved out today, and I'm scared to death, because I miss her, and I am terrified to be alone. I've never lived alone in my entire life, and I don't really know how to. I think the worst part is that I don't have anyone to talk to. There's no one there that I can come home to and tell about my day, or tell how I feel. I still love her, even though I hate what she's done. Even though I love her, I could never take her back.

She moved out today, and I'm excited. I'm excited to live this new chapter in my life, where I take care of myself, instead of depending on someone else too. I'm excited to be a better father, son, and brother. I'm excited to work out more, and eat better (she is super picky about food, and won't eat most vegetables, and I love vegetables). I'm happy that I'll be able to come home, and the house will be clean, because I left it clean and no one was there to make a mess again. I'm ready to go out and make new friends, even though I'm not really sure how. I haven't tried to make friends in a long time.

She told me she felt trapped in our relationship, and now that she has moved out, I've realized that I did too. I love her, but I feel like I need to be my own person before I can be part of someone else.

I know this is going to be difficult, but i'm determined to come out of it as the best version of myself. I think it's easier for me to change all the little things I do, because I'm going through so many big changes right now.

S: I'm sure at some point you'll read this, and I'm sorry it had to end like it did. I truly wish we could've been happy together, but if not, I'll hope you will be happy wherever life takes you. Try to become the best version of yourself too. Take care of yourself &lt;3

24,"How do you guys deal with them? CCC cannot go an hour without complaining about something. In the morning, usually how someone cannot drive or the barista messed up her coffee. Then it goes on about how much stuff she has to do and people constantly giving her orders. Or how her husband can't do something without her. Or not doing it the right way. Always something. Sometimes in front or around patients. 

We work in a medical supply store and ALWAYS have orders coming in that the 9 of us girls in the front deal with. Today, after being hung up on by a disgruntled patient, she had outloud called him a Jerkface. With a patient sitting at a coworkers desk. I pointed it out to her and she basically said, ""Don't care. Guy was yelling at me that I don't know my crap and hung up on me before I could transfer him to (manager)."" Then she turned around and said that I had been yelling at her. I was not. At that point, it was time to go so I left. 

And when she gets more than 5 current orders on her desk, she tries to pawn some off on others. 

I would really like to not involve my manager if possible but I really don't know how much I can stand from her anymore. I might really go off on her one of these days. Switching areas is not a possibility also because we are all in a big area.

37,"So a little back story... 

I normally don’t do this, my other jobs I’ve been at I was there at least 1 year. (I’m only 20 y/o). But this is an overnight job as a baker. I have a history with my back (I got into an accident, which is why I left my last job as a waitress). Before I landed this overnight job, i was jobless for about 2 months. I applied to this job and was hired within two days. I’ve been at it for 4 days now, and I’m in more pain than I’ve ever experienced before. I was actually in tears last night and couldn’t move, which has only happened two other times since the accident. The job description didn’t say it would be as labor intensive as it truly is.

While I really just want to quit right now, I have about $300 saved up right now, and I have bills... There is hardly any opportunity in my area for someone with a bad back... Pretty much every job posting is food service related (serving) or stocking shelves. I do bake at home and make a bit of money from that, but that’s not nearly enough to support myself. I just don’t really know what to do. I don’t want to exert myself at work and end up hurting myself, but I don’t want to be homeless. I don’t think I qualify for disability and I’ve heard that disability checks really aren’t much of anything at all. ",12Feb2019,1
38,"Long story short, our neighbors were shot (one was killed) and the shooters tried to get in our home next. My husband and I both thought we were going to die, and I've been dealing with some issues. I am in therapy.

What I'd like advice on is if I expect too much from people. I am an open book and I've told many people at grad school, work, and close friends about what happened to us. While people are understandably shocked at first, no one at school, work, or any of my close friends have followed up with me about how we're doing. 

Am I expecting too much? It makes me feel very alone at work and school, like no one would have really cared if I had died. Because the truth is, I'm not doing good, and it hurts that no one seems to care. 

I will end this by saying we have had a lot of support from our family, and we are very lucky for that. Maybe I'm just being ungrateful. Just let me know.",12Feb2019,1
39,"I have two ideas for a promposal for my girlfriend and I need help picking which one to do. To start, my girlfriend is having her last basketball game of the season tonight and I’m not able to make it. I feel very bad about it so I had an idea.

Their bus drives by my house tonight, so I thought about making a prom sign and holding it up as they drive by. I don’t have a super big paper to write it on so I would just put “prom #30?” And hold it up as they drive by. Of course I’d ask her to look towards my house when they drive by so she can see it 

My second idea was to make the sign with her Valentine’s Day gift. I got her a necklace and I’m not sure if I got the right size she wants so I was going to make a sign saying, “I hope this necklace is the right size but I know 5’10” is the perfect size for you at prom,” since we are both the same height. 

Which one should I go with?? Are these too dorky?? Thank you guys ",12Feb2019,1

41,"I live in an upstairs apartment. I have some neighbors to the right side of me that have the loudest and most obnoxious children I've ever witnessed. Each of us has our own balcony area with a staircase between us, but their children and their friends like to come sit on my balcony furniture because they don't have any. 

They will sit right outside of my bedroom window and fight, scream, wrestle, bounce basketballs, and just generally be loud and rude while tearing up my chairs outside. 

I've honestly put up with it for awhile without caring because I'm a dude in my 20's, but recently it got to the point that they're waking my wife up after her 12 hr shifts at the hospital.

I've reported them to the office probably 10 times, about 3 of those times the apartment manager came down here, saw the kids on my balcony, and then just called the police.

Two times the police have come, and the moment they get here the kids scatter and the police tell me there's nothing they can do because they're minors and they don't know who their parents are. 

A few weeks ago me and my wife were awoken from our after work naps at about 6pm to about 8 kids on my balcony playing wall-ball against my bedroom wall. After about 20 minutes I rolled out of bed pissed off and decided to go tell off the kids on my balcony.

I went out there and asked them what they're doing, they just kind of looked at me. I then said please, play basketball anywhere else in the apartment complex but my balcony, there's literally an empty basketball court 30 ft away across the parking lot.

The kids just looked at my and said ""uhh... we live here too you know."" I said thats fine, but this isn't you're balcony and I know for a fact it's a lease violation to hang out on my balcony and dribble basketballs on the second story walkway, where it shakes everyone's apartment.

One of the kids looks me dead in the eye, and starts throwing the basketball against the wall my wife is on the other side of sleeping.

I told the kids I'm about to call the police if they don't leave, most of them laughed at me, one of them said ""Do it, bitch."" So I stopped talking to them like kids, and I raised my voice and said get the fuck off of my balcony right now.

At this point two of the 13-15 year old boys started trying to fight me, I don't even believe these particular kids lived at the apartment complex. One was saying ""What nigga, what? What you gonna do?"" Threw his basketball to the ground, and started bucking up to me with his arms out. I'm a 6ft tall 25 year old, and I just started laughing and pulled out my phone and started filming the kid acting a fool in front of me.

While trash talking me and calling my wife a fat bitch, the kids began backstepping down the stairs. At this point one of the 14 year old girls in the group calls the police on ME for ""harassing and cursing at children.""

A cop shows up, at this point I already called the apartment manager and told her what was happening. She says shes gonna come down and meet the cops with me.

Cop gets there, me and the apartment manager basically explain to him that this is an ongoing issue and these kids are out here caushing issues everyday, the manager assures the cop I wasn't harrasing anybody, and I show him the video of the kids trying to fight me.

Same shit happens, their parents aren't home and he doesn't know who they are or where they live and they can't do anything about it.

After the cops continued to fail at doing anything, I began catching their father coming up the stairs as he got home from work.

I'd say something like ""Hey man, you know while you were gone the cops showed because of your kids and their friends bothering people out here?"" this man, that I'd describe as a 40 year old Mexican man tells me ""Yeah yeah I know I know. I told my daughters to stop hanging out will all of those n*****s, they are in and out of my apartment all day."" 

I just kind of gave him an uncomfortable look, and was like ""Yeah, well, dude, you're gonna get evicted if your kids keep acting like this, I know you already got 2 lease violations because of them."" 

The guy basically shrugs his shoulders and goes inside. 

Weeks have passed since that day and I only have 4 months left here so I've just been dealing with it, but today me and my wife were awoken again to 10 kids on our balcony fighting and screaming at each other. Followed by the other siblings screaming at them to be quiet, making everything louder. With basketballs bouncing of course. 

So I don't bother calling the cops or confronting them today. I just wait outside for their dad to get home. HE gets home, comes up, I tell him ""Hey Bro, your kids are being loud as hell again today, alot of them were just out here fighting and cussing at eachother right outside my bedroom window and woke my wife up.""

He says ""Yeah im sure"" and I go, you know they only act like this when you aren't home. When you're here they don't make a peep. He's like ""YEAH. I know."" turns his back and goes inside.

So police won't do anything, racist dad doesn't give a fuck, and apartment managers act like the only thing they can personally do is call the police as well. At this point, what the hell can I do?

I thought about going to buy a basketball and bouncing it everynight on the balcony between 12 and 3 am. I've considered having a couple loud and obnoxious balcony parties. I've considered getting my cousins to bring their kids over and let them run wild on the balcony for a few hours. Other than that, I have no idea what to do anymore. I've followed all the typical guidelines on how to handle a nosiey neighbor politely, and it's not working. ",12Feb2019,1

45,"As the title of the post suggests I am currently dealing with such a dilemma. TL;DR at the bottom

For background me and my family recently moved into a new neighborhood along with my little sister. We enrolled my little sister in a local elementary school not too far away from our house. The school itself isn't necessarily the greatest, but decent at the best level. The main classroom teacher has been on a leave of absence after two weeks my sister entered due to maternity leave, and isn't expected to come back till May.  My sister somewhat enjoys most of her classmates and the school environment, and feels confident in dealing with the material taught. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, there is one student named (not real name) Gary that is a major disruption to the entire class. For Gary is quite loud inside the classroom and often makes very snarky remarks. For example, once the class was reading a book about Barack Obama, and he yells out that Michelle Obama ""LOOKS LIKE A MAN!"". When other students get in trouble he yells out in excitement and starts dabbing when they do, and rubs it in their face. He also cusses a lot inside the classroom and uses derogatory remarks towards other students. My sister gave me countless other examples about this but I'm not going too much in detail. 

&amp;#x200B;

BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORST PART. Gary has a tendency to get EXTREMELY violent towards other students and attempts to viciously attack them. Just last week he got into a fist fight with another boy and had to be removed from the classroom, but today was the worst as he attacked a group of students. I'm not sure what exactly provoked him but allegedly he began picking on a group of quiet boys and soon began yelling out curse words towards them. He then began choking a boy and picked up a wooden shank to stab them. What makes it worse was the fact that the substitute teacher in the room wasn't much taller than the students, and unable to pull them apart. Security had to be called to escort Gary out of the room. Before security arrived, Gary continued his tirade and grab objects and began throwing them around. He grabbed my sister's water bottle and book tossed it towards the boys. Once security arrived he initially refused to leave but was eventually escorted out. 

&amp;#x200B;

My little sister was traumatized by the incident and was violently shaking in fear, and had to see the guidance counselor afterwards. What makes this worse is the fact that the Gary's mother actually encourages her son to engage in this behavior. A few weeks ago the mother stormed inside the classroom and exclaimed that she would give permission to her son to attack anyone that hits him first. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I am unsure what to do or what steps I should take. I feel it might be a little too late attempting to transfer my sister out to another class as she only has a few months left. Gary seems to be the main source of disruption in the room. Please let know your thoughts

46,"So this happens often and I usually just brush it off and get on with my day. My boss likes to use me as his scapegoat when he forgets to complete tasks he has agreed to with clients. He had promised a client yesterday that he would send them a quote by close of business, obviously he forgets. Client calls him this morning and he played dumb on it and said he typed it up and that I must have run out of time to send it yesterday. Said he will follow up with me and get me to send it this morning. He didn't even type it up, he just dictated it to me over the phone. 

I wouldn't have minded completing this task for him yesterday if he had asked me to complete it but to be blamed for it and then asked to complete the task for them as a favour seems a bit cheeky. Plus my professinal image to that client is now tainted as they may now see me as unreliable which is something I pride myself on not being.

I can't control the unit or turn it off unless I file a request for a maintenance guy to come do it for me. Fun stuff.

Anyways, because the building is super old and because the residence staff generally do not give a shit about our health, my heater has not been cleaned in forever and has a ton of dust inside. This wasn't a problem until winter rolled around (I'm in Canada) and the unit started pumping out more warm air and more forcefully. 

We are not allowed to open the windows because the pipes might freeze or some shit and they are hard to open for that exact purpose. My room has become so full of stale air it's making me all congested and it's becoming unbearable. My windows also literally freeze from the inside when temperatures drop below -20 (Celsius).

Would a dehumidifier or an air purifier work best in my situation? I tried doing some research of my own but to me it seems like they are both the same thing with the only difference being that one collects water and the other just has a filter.

60,"Recently I recieved a notice stating that my landlord company will be ending the month to month lease I signed with them early due to cleanliness issues. It seemed the email they sent about an upcoming inspection wasnt recieved, and they conducted it while I was on a trip. I had a family member checking in to feed my fish every few days, and I guess they made a complete mess when I was gone. Like bad. 

I went to my landlord and asked them if there was anything I could do to get things down to a warning, or if we could schedule another inspection. It was hard not to start crying. They made no promises and said it was in the lease that it was up to me to ensure the apartment was clean at all times. They told me we would be in touch in a few days. They own almost all rental property where I live, and I am so scared to have a bad rental history that would prevent me from living anywhere else. This is my home, I am so anxious, and I really dont know what to do. 

Over the weekend I wrote the landlords a follow-up email explaining the full situation, telling them how thankful I am for them, and how I understand why this is a problem.

65,"One of my younger sisters has been an absolute menace for almost 10 years now even though she was bought up the same as all me and my other sisters. For context I’m the eldest of 5 children. Our ages are 23, 22, 20, 19 and 5. Big age gap between the last two, I know. The sister this post is about is 20 and will be 21 years old later this year. I’ve moved out but she still lives at home with our parents and the rest of our siblings. 

Even when I lived at home, as soon as she became a teenager she changed for the worse. Maybe she got with the wrong friends but she started stealing. She stole from clothes shop but most of all she stole from me, our other sister and our mother. It started with normal things like makeup but then she started stealing money. She stole all my birthday money when I was about 18. I mean, most siblings “borrow” things from each other but was on another level. It got so bad my dad had to buy a padlock for their bedroom door just to keep her out of it. Everytime one of us would confront her she would deny it even when she was caught red handed. She would start a massive argument and turn it around. Accusing all of us of bullying her and hurting her. 

Even when my parents try to get her to do simple NORMAL things like cleaning up after her self she turns it around. She’s still EXACTLY the same even now when she’s 21 and has been working for the past 3-4 years. She makes food and leaves the stuff she cooked with and any leftovers she has sitting in the kitchen. Sometimes for days on end. She leaves bags of rubbish sitting there and doesn’t get rid of them. My parents used to confront her about this behaviour but they’ve given up. She starts a screaming match with them, she starts crying, she starts accusing them of picking on her. For telling her to clean up her mess. Today my dad moved her bags of rubbish from the kitchen to her bedroom and she’s been ignoring everyone all day. When you say something to her she acts like she doesn’t hear it. One of those rubbish bags had sushi from 3 days ago on top of it. All she had to do was put them in the bin but that’s too hard for her. 

What makes me even more angry is that I’ve seen her like posts online about being abused by parents. She thinks she’s hard done by when my dad was abused physically and sexually for all of his childhood. He left home at 16. The only real love he’s ever know is from my mum and my siblings. She knows this. He has a short temper because of his trauma but he’s still a good man who has tried his hardest to overcome his hardships. But she starts hurling shit at him when he tells her to wash up her saucepan, or to clean the bath after she uses it. 

She doesn’t seem to understand how lucky she is. A lot of parents would have kicked her out years ago at 18 for her disgusting, insulting, disrespectful behaviour. She has a roof over her head. She has heating, electricity and a bed. My parents pay for the house she sleeps in, the plates she eats on and the water she bathes in. She does pay £100 rent a month from her roughly £1000 pay check. But sometimes my mum struggles to get a penny out of her. 

It’s scary because my mum is so lovely but she can’t wait for her to leave. My sister creates a hostile environment for everyone in the house. She’s toxic. She only cares about herself. I don’t know wether she’s a narcissist or a sociopath. I’m not even exaggerating. I’m so glad I don’t have to live with her anymore. We used to share a room and she’d leave her snot tissues and crumbs on my bed. Every time I bought a new cosmetic I’d have to find a new way to hide it from her. The thing is if you saw her you’d have no idea she was like this. She’s pretty and has excellent makeup. She’s popular on Instagram and has lots of friends. But at home she’s the worst person to live with and talking to her is like walking on eggshells. 

What should me and my family do about all this?? At this point she will end up out of our lives. I can’t stand her but at the same time no one in my family wants her to be out of her life. We want her to realise that her behaviour is wrong and fix our relationship as a family with her.",12Feb2019,1
66,"Unfortunately, being sensitive is considered a bad thing. 

But when something upsets me, I literally cannot get over it. It bugs me. It gets under my skin. Big or small and it’s a huge distraction.

If someone says or does something that makes me angry, upset or sad, I cannot get over it until I talk to them. And that’s not always easy because I’m not entitled to that. If something bothers me, arguably it’s my issue. 

But I just don’t know how to ignore stuff or get it out of my head. What do I do? I’ll stay distracted for a while but the thoughts come back. My heart starts beating hard. I get anxious. I feel emotional. And sometimes a thought will bug me for months. Stuff that happened YEARS ago can get me worked up if I think about it too long. It’s so irritating because with all those petty things looming in my head it slows down my life. 


And all the advice people ever give you is “WELL, GET A THICKER SKIN”, like yeah that’s the point but as a sensitive person all it does is....make me react like a sensitive person. I found it actually makes it worse! Then that’s just on the list of stuff that upsets me. I don’t know what to do. I like that I’m sensitive. It helps me be empathic and considerate of others. I like that about myself. 

But I don’t want to feel emotional distress every time someone says something to me that bothers me. It doesn’t help that I also have REALLY good memory so I don’t forget stuff easily.

What do I do? Please be respectful...I’m sensitive.

67,"Hey I’m a high school senior male living in the US. I don’t know how formatting on this subreddit works sorry. My mother drinks extremely heavily nearly every night. She has done so for 4-7 years depending on your definition of “heavy.” My father became terminally ill with cancer 7-8 years ago and passed away 6 years ago. My mother began drinking heavily due to this. Then my mothers best friend died a few years back. Things only got worse. My mother is now 54 years old. 

I am worried for her health. She has put herself at such great heath risks. She has got my twin and I to look after as well as her largely immobile grandmother—who’s moving near us due to health reasons has only made her drinking even worse.

I am off to college out of state next year, as is my twin. She has already received a VERY serious DUI and that was very very bad. She doesn’t drive drunk almost ever now (unless she’s already too drunk and no one is there to stop her once or twice a year). The only reason she’s just okay with her colleagues and the law is because my twin and I keep her safe—except when we do not. It is incredibly difficult to will myself to drive my mother to the store nearby for wine because then I am an enabler. So she will walk drunkenly which is also dangerous. I always feel awful at night and my mom cannot seem to grasp that I am not mad just because she infuriates me when she’s drunk, but because I am so concerned for her physical and mental health. Like I said, my mothers only two children she’s ever had will leave next year and she will an empty nester—most likely more sad and more alone. And she will have no guardians. My grandma is not mobile outside of her apartment. 

What do I do? Besides the DUI a few years ago, she’s been acting good—at least on paper. Next year may not be so different, and I would like my mother to live to see my grandchildren etc etc. She doesn’t day drink besides once or twice a month at 3:00 pm or so, so an intervention doesn’t seem fit. She will not go back to AA no matter, although she insists that she didn’t mind the sessions (she had to serve them after her DUI). Sometimes she’ll drunkenly say she’s addicted sometimes she sees it just as a vice. Some periods she’ll go 2-3 days without one drink. More often she’ll drink 1-2 or even ~3 bottles of wine a night. I apologize for all of this ranting—bottom line: what do I do??",12Feb2019,1
68,"I have been getting an average of about 10-11 hours of sleep and I really need to stop that because it is feeding into depression. Because I often want to sleep as soon as I get home, I decided that I would start making a plan where I wait until about 7 to sleep and wake up at 4:30 so that I only get 9 hours of sleep. It's my first night doing this and maybe I'll even start waking up at about 4 if I'm still getting too much sleep.

69,"Last night after a party my friend needed a place to stay so he slept in my room in a spare bed. He’s pretty drunk, but nothing crazy. At 2am I’m woken up by the sight of him stumbling around in the dark, and he makes his way into my roommate’s closet. Then a few moments later he lumbers out of that closet and across the room, into my closet. I hear the sound of running water. I’m confused and tired. I look in the closet. He’s pissing all over my clothes. He’s pulled his pants down to his knees and his bare ass cheeks are shining in the moonlight so brightly that it takes me several moment to understand what I’m looking at. “Goddammit” I think. I get him to pull up his pants and lead him to the bathroom, where he washes his hands in the sink. “Where did you just go to the bathroom?” He squints and hesitantly asks, “Your roommates closet?” I lead him back to bed and we both lie down. “I’m really sorry” I hear him whisper from his bed across the room. He starts snoring a few minutes later. I don’t sleep at all that night.

I still haven’t told him or anyone else about this. He doesn’t remember. I guess I don’t want to embarrass him. But I feel really weird about the whole thing. 

Should I keep this to myself or can I tell him what happened? I absolutely hate lying but I don’t want to embarrass him. Either way, I feel better after telling this story to internet strangers. Thanks. ",12Feb2019,1
70,"Struggling with boredom and making friends in my first year of college. I'm 19 Y/O girl in the eastern US. I've always been really socially awkward and that's why I've never had many friends. It didn't bother me a lot before because I was with my family but now that I've moved for college I feel like I'm in a huge social rut and struggling to make friends. I've always been really athletic and now I think I just realize that I work out / run in order to escape my boredom. I feel like most girls my age are not really into watching sports or MMA or any of my interests and that I'm seen as a dork and a loser. I talk a bit manly I think and don't dress super girly (jeans and never heels) so that makes it worse I think. I also don't smile a lot or do too well with eye contact so people always think I'm being condescending to them. I've always felt like I don't fit in but I'm getting scared that it's going to be like this my entire life. I have a couple of good guy friends back home but here I am struggling to talk to guys as well because I'm afraid to send the wrong message (not really looking for relationship or hookup as I am super scared to get attached or they get attached and something happens and I ruin my education and future). I feel incredibly alone and the only thing that keeps me positive is that my grades are pretty good and my health is great. My friend from back home suggested that this site is good for listening to others who may be going through the same thing and how they got out of it. I'm not depressed or anxious, just super bored and a bit scared that I'm doomed to have zero social life. Any help would be really welcome. Thanks",12Feb2019,1
71,"I’ve started to notice it more and more lately. But there’s some things that she unnecessarily does which just annoy the hell out of me. I’ve tried talking to her about it, but she always seems to struggle to have a serious conversation. 
Just to note a few things, she’s sometimes unnecessary confusing, like she’ll be talking to me about some guy, a friend or whatever and will say something like “aww *he*makes me smile all the time”. Now I think, cool sounds like a good friend, but then find out she’s talking to me:*about me*and says *he* instead of *you*. She knows this doesn’t make any sense, but does it anyway, which usually makes a whole tangent and confusing mess of a conversation, which usually derails it for a bit.
She also never repeats herself, so if I miss hear her or something then i’ll never find out what she said. Additionally, she seems to just blank out mid conversations quite often at times, which is honestly a bit concerning (not sure if she should go to the doctors about it but she always says she’s fine, not sure if I should urge her to or leave her to it, she’s an adult at the end of the day)

Anyway, I need advice. I can’t seem to talk to her about things like these, since she either won’t have a serious conversations, instead favouring to make countless jokes about it, or she’ll say she’ll try to be more clear, but never changes. I know it’s stupid little things, but it just feels like our conversations have deteriorated, because they have to be really slow, otherwise they could end abruptly due to black outs, confusion, or me not hearing. I know I’m not perfect, I’ve got my flaws too, who doesn’t, but if I did something that often frustrated her, I’d like to think I’d try to resolve it. Anyway, has anyone been in a similar situation, If so any advice? Am I an asshole for getting annoyed by these thing? And also with her little black outs mid conversations, should she/I be concerned?
Many thanks!",12Feb2019,1
72,"I'm in my early 30s and have never held a real job in my life. Until starting law school in my late 20s, I mostly did various freelance pursuits and relied on my parents financially. I worked at a large law firm the summer after my second year of law school and was 1 of 2 out of a total of 50 summer employees who did not get an offer to work full time after graduation. This was well deserved. I spent the entire summer tindering away in NYC and hardly got any work done.   


I have very little interest in practicing law, but it looks like I will have to in order to qualify for my school's loan repayment assistance program. This will essentially require that I spend 10 years in a career I am not passionate about. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have studied a more science-based field in undergrad and would have pursued employment in a related field.   


I desperately want to grow up and become more mature. I realize something is deeply wrong with me in that I am probably the only person graduating from Harvard Law for whom spending eternity in their parents' basement seems like a strong possibility. I've read almost 100 self-development books and listen to a ton of related podcasts, but nothing seems to stick.   


I'm tired of being immature and would love to start adulting, but it's so hard to find motivation.

74,"I know this is the most cliche sounding issue ever and the obvious anwser is to just let go 4head, time heals all wounds etc. But my situation is especially sticky. It's an incredibly long story and I haven't the patience nor the attention span to explain it all in one blow. But the long story short is that, as the title refers, I'm in love with my ex. My ex is also my best friend's sister. We dated on and off for 2 years but finally agreed to just be close friends and learn to grow with eachother through life without the romance. However; we botched that up by trying to be friends with benefits and add sex and cuddling into the mix. Obviously we still had feelings for each other, so it drove us mad when one us started talking to someone else. Inevitably, she finally admitted that she had moved I'm completely and declaired that we are ""just friends"". And oh boy, I can tell you. It doesn't feel like friendship. Not in the slightest. 

So I'm conflicted. I want to be okay with the fact that she is seeing another guy, but I can't truly feel it. I'm lying to her and to everyone and even myself. Deep down, I'm still madly in love with her. But I know in my heart that if I truly do love her, I wouldn't be selfish enough to resent her new man and resent her for not wanting me. I would be able to let her go and allow her to be happy. I understand that if I couldn't make her happy, then she deserves better. Not to mention that I broke up with her because I felt like a cuck at the time. It's the worst when you have to explain that you're just not ready to love. But my desire to be with her is strong. Not in like a stalker creepy kinda way. The only slightly questionable behaviour I'll admit to is texting long drawn out messages to her when we try to talk. I've gotten better with it, but I'm still in a war with myself. 
I want whats best for her but I'm so selfish that I still want what's best for me. I realize that it's selfish. But it's such a searing pain. How can I learn to get over her while still being her best friend? Because she's like the 3rd amigo between her and her brother. We always hung out together and we would talk 24/7. Now it just seems cold..the advice of not dating her that everyone thew at me before had made a comeback in a 20/20 hindsight prophecy. We never learned how to be friends. We jumped straight into love. It wasn't hard..

Like the title says I'm 25 and still live with my mom. That's not the issue. My mom is honestly one of my best friends and I'd rather live with her than 6 roommates in our expensive city. 

I rarely get to hang out with friends do to conflicting jobs and I don't drive but use public transportation since we live in a big city right on the bus line and getting around by car can be expensive and a hassle. I feel lonely about this and feel like I hang out with my mom and that some people judge me on it. I feel like also my mom feels that she's keeping me from spreading my wings (she's not it's just that I can't always see my friends). So most of the time if my mom's doing something like hanging out with her friends I tag along since I'm very social and enjoy the company but my mom and I agree that I need to hang out with more people my age.

I also haven't dated anyone since I was about 14 due to my mental health when I was younger. I'm now way more confident and have gotten help for my mental health and even though I'm a social person I hate talking to people on dating apps and would much rather meet someone at a bar or something but it feels impossible in my city known for its ""freeze"". 

I'm not really sure what to do...

77,"I'm in 3rd year of med school. For our clinical practice, the university divides us into clinical groups and each group is assigned a different ward, for example some are assigned pediatrics and some surgery etc. Every year, the university let's the students make their own groups but this year, they made them by themselves completely randomly. My best friend and I, who couldn't imagine not being in the same group, didn't end up together
The uni then gave us a few days to change groups but people from both groups have to willing to exchange for it to work. Both my friend and I got requests to change with people to a similar group but that later didn't work out as they changed their minds. We didn't get to change and the due date to change ended. We then decided that maybe us not being together is for the best, maybe then we would concentrate more on our work and not be distracted by each other and we would have more stuff to talk about after we're done with wards, more stories to share. So we left it at that. 
Now, we are getting an opportunity to be in the same group again, so I'm considering changing my group, but the problem is that some of my friends in my current group were initially planning to change their groups, but stayed in this group because I decided to stay, so if i Change now they'll get upset, and also the group I'm changing to has some people I'm not very fond of so i don't know what to do.

It was slow and we chatted it up, and initially he seemed like a really nice guy, so I agreed to give him my number. 

WHAT A HUGE REGRET.

Even by the end of the first night, I knew I had made a terrible mistake. He got super drunk later that night, and turned into a complete belligerent asshole. You could tell he has a couple loose screws. I almost had to get security to escort him out....

He texted me to hang out, about ten times consecutively. I got fed up and told him to take a hint. If a women doesn't respond the first 9 times, she's not gonna respond the 10th.

He got mad and started sending me dick pics.

I was so grossed out, I immediately blocked him and deleted the conversation.

Two weeks later, he's persistent in trying to contact me and is now harassing me through what's-app and Snapchat, almost daily. I told him to leave me the fuck alone, but I'm also genuinely scared. He knows where I work and I'm afraid if I anger him, he'll come and do something horrible.

I wish I hadn't been so quick to delete the convos and should've screenshotted the text exchanges/pics so I have proof.

He's also from Italy and is here on visa, so I feel he has nothing to lose if he does something horrible. He's living here temporarily and probably leaving the country in a couple months.

Should I go to the police or is this not a concern for them? I also don't have the dick pics and deleted most of the conversations. What should I do....

I aced it and everything, had a great semester, I even aced AP calc and got tons of community service hours.

Since I don't meet the requirements that will probably fuck my admission decision.

82,"Hello everyone, I am 21 year old male. I recently stopped a third college education. The last one of which I worked 2 years to get accepted in to. It was on a higher level of education so I had to go to high school again for those 2 years. 

 I did this to get more time to figure out what I want and to get more choices and it would also make me be able to get a higher earning job. I started the International Business study last september but I stopped this study as well not too long ago.

 I moved out of my parental house for this study and started life in another city. I had homesickness and I cried because I was leaving my family forever. I contacted my family everyday for a month straight and I visited every chance I had. I thought this was it, this was the start of my new life, a step forward. Sadly a few months in I found that the only 2 classes that motivated me, were not enough to get me through 4 more years of this study. When looking for a study this was the only one that came close to anything I would like. I was going to learn to write business reports and learn a new language ( Spanish) both of which I was really interested in. The rest of the classes turned out to be unbearably boring and way too economical, so I quit. 

I donot know what I want to do. I thought I wanted to do the International Business study with all my heart, so quitting that left me more unsure than I have ever been.

I don't 'like' to do things in life. Everything I do in life that I do for fun is ultimately to forget about 'real' life. I drink/party/watch Netflix/play videogames/hang out with friends all to forget about life. 

I just want to be passionate about something, want to learn about something and master something and talk to other people about something I am truly interested in. I want to be sure about life and have purpose. 

I'm just a canvas, waiting to be filled in by an artist who can't create art.

Well, I’ve been working there for 7 months now and I’m not exactly sure how I feel about it. I was told today by my coworker that I’m doing a horrible job and need more enthusiasm when selling. Then he just went on and on about how all the secret shoppers that came in loved him. 

At that moment I thought, “Jeez maybe this job really isn’t for me.” Although, I do find it pretty funny that right after he told me I was doing horrible, I made a sale haha.

Anyways...

I’m an introvert and I gotta admit, sales is pretty exhausting. I would still love to have a job, just perhaps maybe not this one. 

As I’m typing this, the more and more I think about it, I feel that perhaps the cons kinda do outweigh the pros. I just have to make sure I’m making the right decision. Like I’ve mentioned, I would still love to have a job. I have to pay for insurance on my car and I still need some sort of income. I also don’t want to have to rely on my parents again to pay for my stuff. 

The only thing holding me back is the fact that it’ll cause some sort of stress to the management. We’ve had several changes these past months and I don’t want to add on to that. If I leave, it’s going to mess up a lot of schedules due to the fact that people are going to have to fill in my shifts until they can find someone new. Not only that, the girl who got me the job is one of my absolute best friends. I don’t want it to affect our relationship in any way. 

If I do decide to quit my job, what other job options are there for a 17 year old looking to work part time?  I know it’s a lot, but I don’t think I can work there much longer.

Those are the only ""facts"", besides him having died a few years back. My mom and grandma maintain he died in prison which I know to be false but they continue to hide this from me. 

I don't care about them lieing, I fully understand why (I don't want to get into too much detail here for hopefully obvious reasons) but it makes it hard to know who really knows what. I'm extremely close with my brother, who still claims to be actively trying to find him, and a few of my maternal aunts are (claiming to be) fully unaware of his whereabouts.

86,"Tldr: My husband signed over his parental rights to his only child from a casual fling from before we were together. Now he has a hard time knowing what to say when people ask us: ""how many children do you have?"" in a way that doesn't lead to a long, uncomfortable, oversharing ramble. How should we handle this? 

I'll try to keep the background brief. When my husband and I met, he had a 4 year old son and I had two young boys myself. His relationship with his son was strained from the beginning because the mother was (and still is) just awful. She is a good mother for the most part, but was emotionally and verbally abusive to my husband during every interaction I ever saw them have. In short, he had to fight her tooth and nail for every small thing. After the child was born, he had very limited custody, and was ordered to pay (and did pay) child support, but he did not do so though the state system, but rather in cash. A stupid mistake that he is very regretful over. 

I know he paid her, because every weekend when we picked him up for a visit, I watched him get the cash out of the ATM, and watched him hand it to her. 

Cut to a couple years later, we have married, and would like to take a vacation. We go to get our passports, and his gets denied because the state child support system shows him to be delinquent in his child support to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. Of course, we naively believe that the mother would be reasonable and work with us to get the erroneous arrearage cleared since he was up to date, and we would just start paying through the system from then on. 

We arrange to meet her, and very long story short, she says she will argue in court that the arrears are valid, and that her attorney had advised her to say the money he had been giving her were all ""gifts."" In the alternative, he could sign over his parental rights to her new husband so he could adopt. 

We were appalled, and livid. We talked about it in depth. Plain and simple, being forced to pay her money we didn't actually owe for the fake arrears plus the regular child support would have been economically devastating. Nevertheless, I told my husband that if he wanted to fight her on this, I would stand by him every inch of the way. 

In the end, after much heartache, counseling, and discussion, he decided to sign over his rights. He really felt like it was the best decision for everyone involved. His son will be well cared for, and he won't have to continually subject himself to her verbal attacks for a few hours a week of interaction with his son. 

This was two years ago. We've moved on, and are hopeful that someday my husband will have the opportunity to reconnect with his son so he can have a relationship with him. My husband is an amazing man, and a great step dad to my boys (who love him very much). He treats the boys just like they are his own.

Ever since his son has been gone from our lives though, we face a sad and sometimes uncomfortable dilemma in social settings. When people ask us about our kids, it seems like we have two options: just say we have two boys (mine), or say we have three. If we go with the first option, it feels somehow like we're choosing to not acknowledge my husband's son. This is painful, and feels wrong. But the other option is just as bad (if not worse) because inevitably there are follow up questions, and my husband frequently ends up going into a loooooong explanation with the person about what happened, and why he has a son that he doesn't see anymore. You can actually see the person become slowly more and more uncomfortable. It's hard for my husband too because it's like he knows he should stop, but can't stop himself from doing it. 

I feel terrible about this whole situation. I guess I'm just wondering if there's a way we can do this that doesn't feel wrong to honoring the existence of my husband's son, but also doesn't subject casual acquaintances with a long uncomfortable conversation. Any suggestions would be amazing.

Girlfriend has just moved to the house next to Friend B, and the two have naturally been hanging out a lot. But today, the Friend B walks into after-school practice with a hickey on his neck, something I notice and joke around with him about. He won't tell me who he got it from, and I naturally don't push since I don't want to be a creep. But when Friend A arrives to practice, Friend B puts his hood on over his neck to cover the hickey, and he says to me ""I don't want him seeing that."" Quite frankly, Friend B is the type of person to brag about something like that, and considering all the evidence, I can only see one explanation for why he wouldn't want Friend A to see.

(I know that my explanation might make it sound ambiguous, but trust me, in context it isn't.) Do I let him stay ignorant and by extension happy, or do I tell him what I know? I'm aware that Friend B might figure out my connection if it goes public, but I'm much closer to Friend A than I am him and Girlfriend, and would rather him be happiest, even if Friend B and Girlfriend are angry with me.

93,"This is going to be a total mess because I have no idea how to convey everything here but here goes. A bit of backstory, I'm a really lucky person. I know this will sound like I have a big head or pretentious but basically, I'm naturally smart, I have a fucking awesome family, and I'm super strong at picking up anything new. I get high grades in school, never study for tests, nail presentations etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

4 months ago I met the first actual fail in my life. I failed to place in the top scores for the regional competitions of DECA (a business club) and didn't qualify for provincials. I straight up fucked it up and ended up being the only person (other than one other) in my school who didn't make it cuz I didn't prepare at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, this sent me into probably the worst I've ever been in my short ass life, I felt completely useless, wasn't doing homework, wasn't talking to anyone, and worst of all I felt so angry at myself. I set so many retarded expectations that I wasn't meeting and kept doing it to myself like some insane person. I felt like I was failing my parents because I literally only had one job right now and that's do well in school. I had no confidence, didn't believe in myself, all that crap. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with pneumonia and missed 3 weeks of school where I felt like cutting myself because I ""deserved the pain for being so garbage and being a failure"". I get better, then get sick again and I was on the edge of deciding to cut when my fucking amazing sister asked me how I was doing and I opened up enough that I didn't cut.  

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, my grades were still super fking high despite me not doing any work but I wanted to feel some pride or satisfaction for working hard for something but that never happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later on I opened up to my mother and she told me how much she loved me and that she only wanted me to be happy. I was so afraid of telling my parents because I didn't want them to get mad or whatever and I felt so bad but also a bit relieved for once. Since then I've been trying to change by being more positive, I started practicing the piano again (and composing my very own songs!), doing my homework and trying to manage my time better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I probably should've mentioned that during this whole time my escape was to game and YouTube and that shit. It's bad enough to be borderline addiction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, as for me now, it's been crazy as far as my schedule goes, I rejoined my school band, practicing piano as mentioned before, and I'm gonna start going to the gym. But, almost every day, I have these zones where I feel like I'm back where I started and I respond sometimes by snapping at people who ask me things and I feel really bad about it. I feel as if there's something I'm missing about myself and it's chipping away at me. I think it might be problems with my friends. Should've mentioned this earlier but I'm in the IB program in my school and in TL;DR form I have no good friends from my elementary school in my classes. Being in the clubs and shit that I am I surround myself with really successful and awesome people but I always feel like they're one step closer to each other than I am if that makes sense. I made the mistake of eating lunch with all my old friends and I've been having problems with them and it makes me so angry at times. I feel like my old friends are not being a friend to me as I am to them (feels like they treat me with a double standard) and I really want to leave but I know I shouldn't just abandon them cuz I've known them for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day, I had rehearsal for my school musical. I ran out midway through the rehearsal and had a panic attack in the bathroom. When I came back in, I told one of my friends what happened. She did look concerned, but she didn’t ask if I was ok, she didn’t text me later to check in on me, nothing. A little later, I ran back to the bathroom and cried. (It wasn’t because of that, I was just still upset and I didn’t get to cry earlier). And when I got back, nobody so much as asked me where I had gone for 10 minutes. after rehearsal, it was obvious that I was upset. I was lying on the floor, staring up at the ceiling, just not being myself. Not one of my friends around me so much asked if I was okay. 
And, of course, I was not using a panic attack and acting depressed just for attention. But sometimes it’s just a bit sad how little anyone cared about how I was obviously not being myself.

98,"Alright so I have a friend idk who claims to be bisexual. I have nothing against that (I’m in a similar boat but she handles it a bit differently than I do). She makes a big deal about it quite a bit and I’d say she talks about her bisexuality at least once a week. Last Friday she came to me before class started and said “I’m gay and have crippling depression and those don’t work out so well”. I do try to make it clear that people can talk to me if they are going through something although she never really talks about her depression. She also has self diagnosed herself with bipolar depression (and did the same to me when I said I have a short temper, I know for a fact I don’t have bipolar depression), OCD, major depressive disorder, and ADHD. I am a firm believer in not self diagnosing yourself and instead getting help from a professional. After that she said all of her doctors gave up on her because she couldn’t get happy, which clearly conflicts with self diagnosing yourself. Back to the main story though. I didn’t know how to respond to this so I was like “uh alright” and started talking about her boyfriend. I interrupted her and said “if you’re gay wouldn’t you have a girlfriend?” I wasn’t trying to be rude, I was trying to correct her. “No gay is for men who like men, saying I’m gay means I like men.” That would be like a man saying he’s a lesbian because he likes women. “Gay means homosexual yeah? Homo means the same, sexual obviously means sexual.” “No, homosexual is when you hate gay people! Homophobic is when you like gay people. Do you have a problem with the LGBT community?” Like I said, I have nothing against gay people. “No but you’re wrong. Homophobic would be disliking gay people, arachnophobia is fear of spiders right because arachne is spiders and phobia is fear. Look it up.” At this point I was starting to get annoyed because she was getting up into my face. “As a member of the LGBT community I know more about this than you do.” “Doesn’t mean you’re right.” She gave me the nastiest look and then stomped off. Once again, nothing against gay people but based on the way she acts I believe she says she’s bisexual for attention. She only talks about the boyfriends she’s had (although I don’t consider this rock solid evidence, don’t get me wrong) and never the girlfriends and tells me she doesn’t like girls because they’re always bitchy. note that this happened last Friday and is paraphrased) What should I do? Would it be better if I admitted that I was wrong and moved on or should I let her be angry at me (or some other third option)?

101,"Alright, this has been bottled up for a while so if it comes out a bit ranty then sorry. I'm just frustrated but I don't know what to do

Alright, here's a little background

I'm currently a junior in High School. I know, young as hell. Now, as most know, this is the prime time to consider college and think about what the hell I want to do with my life. Here are the issues. 

My older brother is currently at a pretty high class school studying computer science. This kid's brilliant, he's got an internship at a big tech company I'm not allowed to mention this summer, gonna be making 6 figures as a sophomore in college. He's going places. 

He was president of our robotics team in HS, had straight A's in tons of AP and high honors classes, got scholarships, awards, everything. 

My parents are expecting another him. But I'm not him. I put up with two years of complete hell on the robotics team to satisfy them. I hated every second of it, but they wouldn't let me quit. I'm not in any AP classes this year, barely passing the lower stuff I'm in. 

Long story short, I'm stupid as shit compared to him. I don't want any sort of career in STEM, but that's all my parents think there is. Especially my dad. To my dad, the only thing that matters in life at all is money. One time, he yelled at me for like an hour for buying a drink at a fast food restaurant because ""they make those for two cents so idiots like you buy them for 2 dollars"". 

I'm sorry if I seem aggressive towards my father, but I just have a lot of bottled anger towards him, especially now. I got off on a tangent. Back to the topic at hand: I don't have an interest in math, engineering, cs, none of that. I suck at it and I hate it. Now you may be thinking, ""God, this kid's a mess, what is he gonna do with his life?"". And here's the kicker:

I want to act. 

Yea, crazy. I've been acting in various theatre productions, including my own high school, for three years now. And I love every second of it. I've never in my life had such passion for a hobby or activity, and for once in my life I finally felt happy with what I'm doing. 

So, comes time to start thinking about colleges. I'm getting all those little pamphlets in the mail from colleges saying ""we want you!"" and all that jazz. My dad deliberately goes through them before me and throws out all the art school ones before I even see them. He asks me what I want to do with my life and in college so I tell him. I want to act. What he said just killed me.

""Acting isn't a career.""

You know some of the richest people on the planet are actors, right? Yes, I understand it is a competitive industry and doesn't pay well unless you're famous, but I don't care. I'm happy. Hell, there's a line in the show ""Hello, Dolly"" that perfectly encapsulates this.

""I've lost so many things, my job, my future, everything that people think is important, but I don't care! For even if I have to dig ditches for the rest of my life, I'll be a ditch-digger who once had a wonderful day!"" 

Change wonderful day to someone that's actually happy with their life. 

I don't want to disappoint my parents. They've done so much for me. I truly love and appreciate them and I want them to be happy too. 

But I don't think that love is willing to let me be unhappy for the rest of my life. I'm just so alone here. 

This probably came out super convoluted and there's probably typos (i don't proofread) but that's the jist of it.

104,"After a lot of consideration, I decided that I’m going to enlist in the Navy and pursue a career as a pilot. Obviously, I have a lot to prepare for in that matter. But one of the obvious ones is to get in shape. I think it’s also worth mentioning that I’m not a very active person. In fact, throughout Highschool I did little to no Gym classes and no outdoor activities. Therefore, as I am right now, I’m not very fit at all, with some fat in my waist/gut area.

105,"This is probably going to be a little long. My next step will probably be to see a therapist to try to work through some issues anyway.

I am turning 31 in a few months. From the outside I appear to have my shit together at an above average level. I have a 6 figure job, I have a house and a rental, I am married, I have a vast amount of hobbies and interests which I pursue constantly. 

Aside from my wife’s tuition, I have no debt, no mortgage. I am a cop in a major city and as such have the option to retire in about 15 more years at half salary with full benefits. I am also in a specialized unit of the department, which is good, and I am in line to be promoted to a higher rank in 2 years, which comes with more money and privilege. I spent a considerable amount of energy to get to this point. 

But, I hate my coworkers and I have gotten burned out on this job and no longer wish to do police work. I could coast by if my coworkers were better, but a small handful get under my skin, boss me around, break my chops. Its a situation of being a younger guy in a career that heavily adheres to seniority. I find myself thinking about things over and over again, no matter how little, and then spending much of my time trying to avoid these people. Its been eating away at me for a while.

I would love to leave this job. I’ve been writing down whats been getting me down, and most if not all of it revolves around this job. The overtime is too much, the fact I never can plan even the littlest trip or get together without having selected it a year ahead of time with vacation picks makes me realize i’m more of a prisoner than a cop.

My wife is becoming a nurse next year, so that is good. In the meantime, this job helps pay her tuition and she needs an expensive medication for her joints that the job provides free of charge. These are realistically the only reasons keeping me here. If I wasn’t married, I would quit so fast, and try to make it elsewhere to my own liking. 

This job was the first thing I got out of college. I have a BS in biology from a good school, with a pretty bad gpa, but I have the sheepskin nonetheless.

110,"I’ll try and make this as concise as possible. 

My current friend group consists of roughly 7 people. 2 of those 7 are our dear friends that we’ve known for awhile. I’ve personally known them since I was in elementary school and we had plenty of good times. We’re in our early 20’s now and I find myself avoiding them, however, they’ve gotten used to hanging out with me and our other friends that it’s really difficult to avoid them without being an asshole and saying “No I don’t want to go to X place” or “No I don’t want you to come over”. 
I feel like were on different wavelengths in life. I want to move out and become an independent adult, they want to spend money instead of investing in their future and play video games at their parents’ house. I want to go out for a drink, they want to come over and play video games. 
I find myself constantly dreading whenever I get a phone call from them, and I don’t know how to relay that information without sounding like a complete jerk. So instead me and my other friends just kinda suffer having to hang out with them or coming over and wanting to chill and ruining our plans that we had.
If I’m going to the store for errands, and they tag along, what was supposed to be a quick trip to the store ends up becoming hours of being out because they wanted to go eat at a sit down restaurant or go do something fun with their friends.
Me and my other friends, are, I’m pretty sure, their only friends. So, wanting to cut them off seems extremely harsh in my eyes.

TLDR: Childhood friends have become clingy, and I no longer have anything in common with them. How to remove friend without sounding like an asshole pls?

there’s this guy i have known since high school and now we are in our early twenties. we both liked each other in high school, but nothing happened because i never admitted my feelings. i kept going back to him because there’s something “exciting” about him, but i also see a lot of myself in him... so. ya we have been in touch the past couple of years on and off. he sent me non-platonic texts in october and i was like “hm i wonder what’s happening” and so he said we could talk about it in december. 

in december we decided to meet in a parked car outside of our high school bc i was visiting home and he couldn’t come to my parents place and i couldn’t go to his. i made it clear that we would just talk.

it took a while but we talked and then he’s like “oh can we talk about sex” and i’m like ... bc he didn’t know that i am super inexperienced. so he goes on to tell me about his experiences and i’m like ok and then we decided to talk about other things, but the topic of sex kept coming up.

he then asked if i wanted to cuddle, i said no but then he tried to put his arm around me and i didn’t react (not bc i didn’t feel anything, but bc i am physically avoidant). we then continue to talk and he’s like tell me about ur sex life and i’m like IVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING and talked about all the times i could’ve done something, but didn’t bc i get realllly nervous and idk i am just a noob.

anyways, so then we agree for him to do something to me and i’m ok with it and it’s consensual and everything, but i just felt the SEXUAL TENSION and i’m like i really want this and ya but we just did that. he asked to kiss but i was like “nah fam.” then he asked if we could be fwb and i was resistant bc i want a relationship, but he doesn’t want to date me for reasons i am not entirely certain of, but when i was in the car i felt like he cared a lot and idk it was good and natural and it didn’t seem forced. we ended up sitting there for five hours in my car. 

so two days later we decide to have sex and it’s my first time and he’s experienced and it was bad, like really bad. first red flag was that he kept asking if he could go “raw” and i’m like no i need a condom bc i’m not on any birth control or other protection. he then asks if i can pick one up and i KNOW NOTHING about condoms at all... then it ends up i drive to his house and we drive together to get condoms and he’s dead silent i’m like GREAT bc i am really nervous and not talking makes me more nervous.

so we get the condom, go back to the place. immediately strip and then try to have sex w foreplay and stuff but even then i’m really tight and then my hymen breaks and he’s mad idk i told him they might happen so then he gets the spray n wash out and cleans up the blood and we try it again and i’m still tight and this happens for TWO HOURS.

the thing i didn’t like about it besides being “too tight” was the fact that he threw something back in my face, like he pretended to be supportive of something, but in actuality, told me it was “stupid” and i shouldn’t do it. it didn’t seem to come from a place of caring. he was also SUPER closed off as opposed to the day in the car.

so ya then i leave cuz his dad is going home and it’s like two hours later and i GO OFF on everything he did wrong, which probably wasn’t the best and then asked if he can not tell anyone, which he agreed. that was the last time i have heard from him. the same day we had sex i deleted him from snapchat and ya.

now i’m confused bc he has stopped talking to
me and i don’t think it boils down to “hit it and quit it” bc we know each other and i’m just ANGRY bc i know i did things that would suggest i rejected him, like telling him the sex was terrible, deleting him from
snapchat, going off on him, but the fact is he never responded or gave me any answers or defended himself.

it’s been about a month.

also we both have avoidant attachment, meaning, that he has trouble opening up emotionally and i have trouble opening up physically, so we both engage in behaviors that kind of “sabotage” the relationship so an attachment is not easily formed... kinda like trying to get the other person to end the attachment w us.

so ya it’s been a month, i really wanna add him back on snapchat, but now i feel weird cuz he has ghosted me and all my friends say i shouldn’t talk to him, but at the same time, i feel like he understands me on a level i haven’t reached with anyone else so i’m wondering if i decided to reach out again (despite him not answering), would it come off as crazy? i know he isn’t answering bc he probably feels rejected in some capacity and i reckon there is some shame there.

I deleted the history and tried to formulate a lie and say that I was trying to find some funny fart prank videos, and I was stumbling upon this. However, she never gave me the chance to talk to her.

My sister came home, and she said hello to me, but she was very cold. I asked her, ""Do you want to talk about what you saw on the phone?"" She goes, ""No I don't want to talk about it, that's your business.""

She has been acting very cold towards me. She hasn't been talking to me or anything. I know it's because she was distrubed by what she saw and probably thinks differently of me now.

I've tried to talk to her again about it and she went, ""I don't want to talk about it!"" I tried to tell her, ""Trust me, it's not what you think."" She tells me, ""I know what I saw and I know what I think. I'm not saying I don't want to talk about it never, I just don't want to talk about it right now.""

I hate myself that I forgot to delete the history. 

I know the fetish that I have is very odd, but I can't help it. Now my sister thinks I'm a sick freak.

My fetish is not a reflection on me as a person. I'm a good person who just has an unusual kink.

I love my sister, and now I feel like our relationship is not going to be the same. 

What should I do? What advice do you guys have?

117,"I have this gym teacher in high school school teaching my gym class who is young, (30 I think) and she teaches physical education and English. She is a pretty cool teacher and nice. We will be about to do the swimming unit. When she was describing what stuff you need to bring she mentioned to the boys in the class that the swimming unit is good for her because with the boys not wearing shirts she can see how you really look and how fit you really are. the comment doesn't bother me in the slightest , but if some kid who was around me decides to go cry about it, will she get in trouble? I talked to a friend of mine about it (who wasn't there) and he says it is wrong and she should get in trouble but I don't see why, I talked to another person and they said this was out of line and should be reported If she was actually doing anything then I would agree. I am not going to say anything, she is a really good and nice teacher and I will not get her in trouble. Would you feel uncomfortable by this comment?

I just ignored all the warnings (she had an FWB, she disrespected my friends, made weird comments at my house party, etc)

Anyways, we talked for 30 minutes on the phone 3 days ago and the gist is that we are still very good friends and we aren't just letting go of each other. She wanted to meet the day after the call, but I told her take some time and I will leave it up to her to let me know when we are meeting (provided good notice). 

She just texted me saying we may not be able to meet because of the shitty weather, and I said ""No problem"".

I asked her about herself in order to get to know her better. She was telling me about herself and then all of a sudden she tells me her friend was calling her. I said cool, what did they say? Her response: they said they were horny and wanted to jerk off to my voice. I said are they joking? She said no, so I said: are you leaving the call she told me yes (come to find out she actually didn't and her justification is that she felt uncomfortable and guilty for blocking them after they were jerking off to her). We started to get into an argument because she would just disappear randomly in the middle of our conversation without reasoning (she even fell asleep in the middle of our conversation and when she woke up she only said ""fuck"" then disappeared for another 5 hours). I told her I can't trust her cause she's allowing guys to jerk off to her, &amp; she said she was flirting with them so it gives the impression that I'm just another option to her. Apparently I'm not allowed to be upset with her because she then blocked me and sent her friend to talk to me (which she agreed and said that's not right of her to be doing this when she says she likes me). She unblocked me today and We were talking. All of a sudden things got heated again and she said she did block the guys, I asked for proof and she sent me screen shots.

I then had to ask her again and she told me that someone had asked her out and that she rejected him.

128,"My husband and I are torn on this subject, so we thought we would see what some outsiders would do.

We are both in our thirties. Have four kids (15, 11, 6 and 2 months). I’m a stay at home mom. Before I was pregnant I ran a small business out of our home. Some months I made more than my husband. While pregnant, I had to put it on the back burner and probably won’t be doing it again for a few years while our youngest takes up a lot of my time. 

Two years ago, my parents decided they wanted to move out of state.  (My mother also helped run the business but when she moved she no longer could due to the distance so I was doing it in my own). Their home, which they owned outright, they wanted to keep in the family. It’s on five acres. Knowing how much the house and acreage was worth, no one in the family could afford or was able to get a mortgage on it. My parents offered to us to move into the house, sign a contract that we would make interest free payments to them for ten years on the house, and after ten years, get a loan on the house for the remainder (which made the house affordable at the ten year mark for us). We decided to do it. After all it was my childhood home and a great place for our kids to grow up. We’ve had zero issues with this arrangement. We make a monthly payment to them and then once a year pay the property tax (which is 2x more than what we were told it would be, but we’ve been doing it with zero complaint as it’s still what we wanted).

My parents moved, purchased a new house in the state they reside now. Essentially, our payment to them pays their mortgage on their new house. 

With increasing property taxes, and the arrival of a new baby (very unplanned, wasn’t even supposed to be physically possible for us so it’s been a shock) things are much tighter, but doable. Despite us not saying anything, and my parents being homesick and wanting family closer, they have yet again come to us with another offer. This is where we don’t know whether to take it or stay. 

They have asked us if we’d like to move to where they are. The house here would be sold. The price of this house would pay off their loan AND have enough to buy us a new house of our choosing within the budget (cost of living is much cheaper where they are). We would make payments to them, which would essentially be income for them at that point since their house would be paid off. They would charge us less then we pay now and the property tax would be SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. When my parents pass away, the house would be willed over to us and we would own the house outright. This all sounds wonderful but:

My husbands line of work is scarce in the part of the state they live in. It’s there, but few and far between and until we were living there, it would probably be difficult for him to be hired on anywhere in his line of work and we can’t afford to send him back and forth looking for work. I’m also weary of uprooting our kids, despite the fact I know they want to see their grandparents more often. My husband and I are also weary that we might hate it there. It’s hot, and as my husband says, they have summer and presummer and no other seasons, whereas we live in the northwest and have all seasons and trees and grass lol. This is home. We both have never lived anywhere else. He worries when my parents do pass, which more than likely our kids would all be grown, that we will want to come back “home” and have to start over again and then our kids would see there as “home” and we’d be leaving our kids behind. A scenario we both don’t want. 

I don’t mind the chance we might decide to want to come back when the kids are grown. They can come along too or stay. By then they will all be adults. We also could sell the house and could use it to just buy a house here (clearly not this house). My husband loves this house and thinks it means a lot to me to be here. Honestly, it still doesn’t feel like our house, even after changing things in the house. So that isn’t a big deal.

Ultimately, we both know if he had a job down there making what he does here, we would be in an amazing financial situation. However, there’s the fear he doesn’t find it. We have considered saving enough to live off of for a few months and making the move, and my parents agreed during that time we wouldn’t make a house payment, just utilities, etc because it is such a leap of faith and they really want us closer to be with the grandkids.... but my husband worked so hard to get where he is now that what if he leaves it and things didn’t work out?! 

That’s where we are left. Do we make the leap of faith once we have money set aside, allow the house to be sold, purchase the house down there and move in and within three months him find a job (and hopefully in his field or making what he makes now) or stay here and stick to our original plan? We are both torn and it doesn’t help having my parents trying to push us in their direction. 

Pros:
More financially secure (if he found a job in his line of work)
Cost of living is cheaper
Help with childcare
I could continue my business as I’d have help with it and/or the kids
Nicer weather would help my husband with his seasonal depression 
No mortgage in ten years (well eight years now since we’ve been here two).
Own the house outright after my parents pass away

Cons: 
Might not find work in his field and may cause stress due to lack of a job to support our family
Might hate it there and be stuck because we wouldn’t be able to afford to come back
It’s hot as hell during the summer and mildly warm the other seasons 
Uprooting our kids from where they have grown up

I tend to chat with her on the regular using the company chat platform. Well, I said something that she didn't like, and she told me to never to disrespect her like that ever again, she said I was extremely creepy, and to never communicate with her again. I apologized many times, and have left her alone since then (this was last Friday).

Today, I'm at work, avoiding her, leaving her alone, but constantly thinking that HR or my boss will approach me with this situation. I'm in fear of losing my job, but I have no idea if this girl took this to HR. I'm pretty sure she has told other close friends and her family.

This all started in December although I have been sleeping on people's couches since I got back from college out of state (I was dealing with some mental health issues and had to move back)

I've been having bad luck with my vehicle recently. Issues just kept popping up I was doing odd jobs here and there  to stay sheltered and fed. Cost of living wasn't much and I started to save up a little cash to fix my vehicle I needed front/back breaks and rotors, blinkers, headlights, a battery and I had some engine issues. Also had to get tags.

In December my vehicle got hit while it was parked and it caused some structural damage the other person had insurance and it was covered. I put it in the shop but was unable to get a rental car because I have no insurance. I had just started a job the previous week and called in to tell them I no longer had a way to work because my vehicle was in the shop. I got fired that same day.

Didn't get my vehicle back until New year's and nothing got repaired that wasn't from the hit.

Flash forward this month I am trying to get my life together still sleeping on couches, applying for jobs almost daily, taking trips to the food bank and got accepted for emergency food stamps.

Last week I got a job offer on the day of the interview we got hit with a storm and decided it was best to push back the time I called a little later to just change the day and the owner happened to be dealing with a family death and her husband's heart attack on the same night I gave her my prayers and told her not to even think about me. She told me she wanted to hire me and to call back in a week or two.

That brings us to yesterday I had just dropped my father off (his vehicle is busted) and was taking a turn I made a hundred times my breaks locked up and I slid straight into a ditch effectively totalling my vehicle it did at least 900 dollars worth of damage.

148,"(Sorry if my explaining is bad) My (17M) childhood best friend (17F) lives about an hour away from me and over the weekend we made plans to hangout in a town in between us both. After hanging out and exploring the town and having a good time they invited me to come back to their house for a game night they do every week, which I’ve been to once before, where they invite all their friends over to play different card or board games (wild I know). 

I was absolutely up for it at first and we worked everything out that I’d just stay the night since it was a long drive and I’d end up driving home late at night, which is also what I did the last game night I went to, but after the drive from the town we were in to her house I just felt really not well mentally and I knew meeting more new people and being social for a while night wasn’t going to go over well and there wasn’t anyway if getting through the night without having some sort of panic which I really didn’t want to happen and end up ruining anyone’s night.

My solution to the problem? Have a friend call me pretending to be my dad telling me I was meant to come back home for a family dinner with other relatives. Horrible I know but I was really not in a grand mind set at the time or thinking straight and I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.

As soon as I got home I felt terrible about it and the next night I ended up telling her about it because I felt super guilty about making an excuse to leave a night that was meant to be fun and she said she wasn’t upset and asked if she didn’t anything to make me feel so off and after explaining it had nothing to do with her and I just want feeling well that night that was the last I heard from her.

Normally we talk every day and last night is when I came out and told her what I did and we haven’t said a word today and I don’t know if I should be the one to message her and apologize more or if I should try and move past it or just wait it out and let her be the one to make the decision.

Like 5 weeks ago we were so close. She’d hug me unprompted. We talked all the time in class. She told me secrets, and shit that was going on in her life. She ranted to me, called me a snack, asked to hang out with me.



Then when the semesters changed about 3 weeks ago and we weren’t in the same classes anymore, we haven’t talked since then.



She hasn’t even texted me. She never does, not unless I text her first. I’ve been not texting her to experiment to see how long she’ll go without texting me, and it’s been two fucking months.



I’ve been thinking about texting her, either just to say what’s up and salvage the relationship, or just asking her if we’re really even still friends anymore. Why she doesn’t talk to me. Why she doesn’t really acknowledge me in the halls even though I’m 95% sure she can see me. But I’m too scared to do either. Smh.


Nothing happened, I don’t think. So I don’t really understand this. She used to be my best friend. I fell into deep limerence over her. Now, there are like 3 ppl that are now closer to me than her.

157,I (19F) met a guy (20) on tinder from my school a couple months ago and we’ve been talking every day since. We started hanging out a month ago and get along together and have a ton in common. I think I have feelings for him and want to continue seeing each other. We texted a bit last night and I sent the last message to which he still has not responded almost 24 hours later. I tend to overthink A LOT and this may sound like it’s not a big deal but it is to me. I’m just not sure if I should send another text tonight or if I should leave it and continue to wait for him to (hopefully) text me first. ,12Feb2019,1
158,"Im just gonna cut to the chase here, (Sorry if its wrong)

&amp;#x200B;

I have no will to get up in the morning. I keep telling my mom I need a day off school but she just wont let me. Normally I would just skip school but this is a middle school and they will call her to ask where I am, in which case I will most likely loose my electronics which are currently my main way of coping. One big reason I don't want to get up is our school VP, who we will call ms f. ms f has imposed lots of stupid rules this year including; no going on the snow, no going on the ice, no walking in puddles, and stay off the pavement. That's just annoying, but I can live with it, what really bothers me is that she is forcing kids to walk around with her because they have been late too many times. Guess who got called to walk with her? This gal.

So naturally I skipped and did work inside. She got mad, told a bunch of kids to tell me to go to the office, I ignore them and continue with my day. I feel as though I am literally breaking, all this annoyance at the school is about to come rushing out in a giant wave, and I am doing my best to hold it in. 

I dont know if I can go to school with her there. The anger I feel is scary almost, and I don't want to calm down this time, which is scarring me more. I just want her kicked out and I have no idea how. They never listen to the kids. I have no idea what to do, do I skip school and just refuse to go until she's gone? That wouldnt work unless it was a giant group of kids, and even then parents can always force us to go to school.

I have absolutely no idea what to do, any help would be appreciated",12Feb2019,1

The bad thing is, she has a boyfriend (I only found out after I asked her out) but she’s told me time and time again for the past few months that she doesn’t love him and she wants to leave him, but she’s scared too. I understand why, but I don’t know how much longer I can wait. On top of this, one of her friends told me she may be talking to a 3rd guy, but from what I’ve seen it seems like someone is just flirting w her and she’s not responding back, but I’m not completely sure. I’ve confronted her about breaking up w her boyfriend at least twice before, and she has just said the same thing, she “doesn’t have the balls to do it”, but she told me if I wait for just a little longer it will be worth it. Last night we got into a argument about the rumors I heard about the 3rd guy, and I don’t know who to believe. I’m very much in love with this girl, and I think she is too, but she’s acting distant, especially recently. Reddit, what should I do? Stick it out? Confront her about the other guy?",12Feb2019,1
160," 

B**ack story:** I am 24 and live and work on Long Island my now Ex-GF is 20 year old Junior who goes to College upstate. My now EX GF and I have known each other for many years our families are very close with each other. She and I have been hooking up on and off for the past few years and have always liked each other. We didn’t date at first because she was still in high school and I was in college plus the age difference. I never loved anyone like this girl and couldn’t believe I could like someone so much and be under their spell. Our official relationship began over the summer near the end of July. We rarely fought and had great sex and our families were very happy we were finally together. We’ve talked for many years about getting married and having kids.

However, there were some red flags that I ignored early on because I was in such love with her. She constantly talked about her ex-boyfriends she went to school with and it kinda annoyed me. If even looked at another girls snap or instagram story who was just a friend from high school she would flip out and me. She was made me not use social media around her such as Instagram(unless I posted photos with her) and delete all girls even friends off my Snapchat and phone contacts. She also made me also stop hanging out and talking with one of my best friends who was a girl who was basically my sister. I agreed to all this because I loved her and was under her spell. While I would post her on my social media such as facebook and Instagram. She did not put up a single post of me. Not to brag but She would post up pictures with my fathers nice cars and summer home but none with me ever. I asked her why she didn't post me on social media she's like i'm gonna wait to the school semi-formal to post you and no one has to know my business. She also is going through lots of difficulty with her family. Her father used to be a major lawyer but now is a struggling drug addict in and out of jail. Her mother is struggling to make ends meat to send her and her sister to school and pay her mortgage. I know this a bad situation but she would use it against me to get her way always with things and turn a blind eye to her childish behavior.

When she left for school in late August, I felt everything was fine with our relationship. We shared each other locations so I know where she was. She is president of her sorority and would go to lots of fraternity parties and mixers on weekends. Most nights her location showed she made it back home. Other nights she would sleep downtown were the parties where. I bought up my concern to her once. She said she slept at her roommates cousins Johnny's house. I joked saying did You sleep on the couch and she got mad at me saying she needed space for the rest of the day. I didn’t ask her again when she slept downtown because I didn’t wanna anger her more. Another night she posted a Snapchat story of her kissing a guy on the cheek. This upset me I told her to take it down. She told me she wanted space again and called me controlling. One night I was facetiming her late at night and one of her ex-boyfriends M hits her up to have sex and come over. I tell her to tell him she is dating me and to tell him to get lost. She's like I don't wanna be that girl who tells everyone I have a boyfriend and she told me not to worry she's done with him. Later one that night I check her location because I had my suspicions and she was not at her apartment. I checked she was at a upper class-man and grad student housing complex. I then call her and she didn't answer and she freaked out on me. She made up the excuse she was visiting her little sister who was having an anxiety attack and didn't wanna be at school . But I also had her sisters location on snap maps and she was at her freshman dorm .35 miles away when I calculated the distance on google maps. My girlfriend Told me her ex boyfriend M lived at another student housing complex on the other side of campus and I was acting crazy and didn't trust her. She got her sister to lie and tell me my girlfriend was visiting her at the dorm when she was really with Matt V. She wanted space from me for the next 3 days and didnt start talking to me again until I got her sister from the train on Long Island and took her home.

My girlfriend came home towards the end of September for her sisters boyfriends father party and it was clear going to back to school changed her alot. She felt like she was better and cooler than me in some way and was acting suspicious at the party. she went upstairs at one point and saw her taking selfies in the mirror. I grab her phone and saw that on her snapchat she was frequently sending snaps to this guy who I knew she had a thing with. She made up the excuse that he was gay and she didn't speak to me for the rest of the party. We had sex later on that night and she assured to me we were exclusive and I had nothing to worry about.

Around mid October I haven’t seen her in over almost month and asked if I could visit her. She said no she didn’t want me invading her life up there. Also she gave some B.S excuse that I probably didn't want her to visit me when I was in undergrad. She began throw a huge temper tantrum like a little child saying that I was replaceable and she would break up with me if I surprised her at Albany. I should’ve broke up with her then but didn’t because I loved her for so long and was going to see her on thanksgiving. And she said she was going to let me come up to formal at the end of the semester. (ENDS UP GOING TO FORMAL in DEC WITH ANOTHER GUY IN THE DRESS I BOUGHT HER LOL!!!.) At the beginning of November her sister who goes to the same school. Spoke to me about not liking school there and she didn’t wanna go to date night later. I asked if her sister was going and she said no my GF(her sister) wasn't gonna be there. I was confused because my girlfriend in the weeks leading up to the formal/date night told me it was gonna be cancelled.

Later on that I got a Snapchat from my GF in a dress and make up which she probably didn't mean to send me. I asked her why she was all dressed up and she said to me don’t worry about it. I asked her if she was going to date night and she said it was a first date themed party. I then text her later on that night saying tell me the truth you are at date night with someone and she didn't respond. Her sister even told me she saw her there at the date night party. Them next day she texts me saying he appreciate everything I do for her but wanted to take things slow with me. Her excuse was she need to focus on school work. I asked if we were still exclusive but she said I shouldn’t worry. She gave some B.S excuse that she wants to get back with me and there is no time frame when we get back together.

I lost my mind because I felt like I did and sacrificed so much for her. The next steps I took were excessive but led me to find she was cheating on me. I DMed her ex boyfriend Garry from school on instagram on a whim. I did this because I had my suspicions. He told she didn’t say ever she was dating me and they had sex a few times together during the semester. Aslo during the summer she went over his house every Thursday while she was suppose to be at work.( I didn't know because I worked in the city in the summer during the week) While she was at his house he asked her about me and said I was just her family friend that had I crush on her but she had no feelings at all for me. He said when he dated her she cheated on him a bunch. He was able to prove it with a screenshot recording of her texting him to come over on our anniversary to come over at 3am and have sex. He said he also saw her with other guys walking home some nights. He also said they she has multiple guys in every frat there that she fucks. Aslo that her other ex boyfriend Matt V lived at the housing complex I saw her on her location that night not the other one she told me and he saw her car parked there multiple times. I also can't believe Her little sister was in on the lies too but I found out she was also cheated on her boyfriend from back home too. Aslo when my girlfriend dated G she cheated on him with the guy she told me was gay. When I finally confronted her about it and showed her the texts she sent G with the dates and times showing her number. She went crazy and denied everything saying now there was 0 chance of us getting back together in the future and how dare I reach out to Garry. I also reached out to other people at her school and they all told me she said I wasn't her boyfriend when they asked just a family friend from home and they saw her hooking up with multiple people.

When her mom called me I told her everything about her daughter cheating on me she didn’t believe it. She wanted us to meet over the winter break and talk things out and be friends for now because our families are very close. I’m just very hurt because I never loved anyone like her for so long. I still have some feelings for her because I loved her for many years. Also i'm not gonna lie she is very physically attractive and the sex was amazing(usually it is with the crazy ones lol) I dont think ill ever get and one better than her. But all my friends and close family say she is no good and I must cut her out of my life for good. Part of me wants me to go to her house and start yelling like crazy at her calling her derogatory names asky why she cheated. I'm just so upset because I Loved her for years and how could she do this to me I just want answer why she cheated on me.

**tl;dr: Girlfriend cheated on me while at school and broke up with me I feel so hurt and confused about what happened. I know her and I are done forever even as just family friends but I don't know why but I am still obsessed with her and can't move on I just wanna yell and scream at her feel like I didn't get any closure.**",12Feb2019,1

164,"So I've been working as a solo IT at a small K-8th school since this passed August, and for the most part I'm happy, until recently. I want to preface this by saying I'm not trying to get out of doing work, just stuff I haven't been trained to do. An example, we were doing state testing, and the had me subbing a class, because the previous IT guy did that. Except I've tried explaining that I wasn't comfortable with it and I have zero experience in teaching. They said things like ""you'll be fine"" and since I'm still new, I gave in and said okay. I lasted less than an hour before I asked an actual teacher to help... We have 4 different lunch times based on the grades/amount of students per grade and I was told that I would now be helping with lunch duty, saying they are short staffed in terms of lunch duty and since I am a team player. (The issue in reality is that the people assigned aren't showing up and apparently I'm reliable...) The issue with this specifically is that it's taking a little more than an hour and a half of my day, and it's cutting into my actual work and that they aren't really explaining what I am supposed to do on lunch duty. I've asked for specifics and the general answer is make sure they don't get hurt or hurt each other. I'm trying to figure out the best way to explain to the admin that 1, I am not trained to teach and in general I have no idea what to do around kids as I have none of my own, and 2, I need to focus on my actual job, like the actual IT part.

Me and my current roommate have known each other for about 2.5 years, we weren’t best friends or anything but we were still tight and decided to room together this year. Things were alright the first couple months, he wouldn’t really do much, mostly plays video games, and we got along fine.

I guess the thing that slowly kept nagging at me was that whenever I would try and talk about something he would either not take me seriously and just joke around, or just blatantly ignore me which was always weird.

It really got to the point where I had to consistently repeat myself to even be heard and even then he’d just be dismissive. I finally had enough when one day I walked in after buying some Eggo’s for the first time and I asked him whether he’d had them before and whether they would good to which he replied “how the hell would I know they’re just freaking waffles eat them and shut up”.

At this point I got mad, didn’t talk to him for almost a week. Eventually I wanted to be petty so I made some Eggo’s today, but then in order to taunt him and show him the disrespect I’d been receiving, I sat down with my bare ass on his bed (yes I know REALLY stupid, I was very stupid here), and he flipped shit obviously.

I'm honestly worried, because I tried using a tooth pick, I was able to shove the tooth pick a bit under my permanent retainer which is a metal wire, but it seems like I cannot spot the kernel. I felt it was a bad idea to push the tooth pick under the retainer... I hope it's ok.

 It really feels like something is stuck there, it's just a feeling of intense pressure- like when you first got rubberbands to put on years ago with braces.

I know it's there, it really feels like something, and for something to be so barbaric from POPCORN I cannot believe this. It's right in the middle of my bottom row of teeth, it feels lodged right under the permanent retainer in my mouth in the back. I checked with a flashlight and cannot really see where it is. The pressure being exerted in the back of my bottom row of teeth is quite intense.

I'm afraid this little devilish kernel will start to make my teeth crooked- because it's most reminiscent of first getting braces.

183,"Hello all! 

I'm a Two Spirit student. Tomorrow I will be attending an awards ceremony dinner with a semi-formal dress code. I have attended twice before and I have to say that I would rather not attend, but unfortunately attendance is mandatory as I will be meeting my donor.

I recently came into possession of a very significant and beautiful blanket. Blankets/rectangles of cloth have been a rather standard basic clothing across the world, but especially for Indigenous peoples we have used them to convey certain stories and beliefs, and they have specific significance as they replaced buffalo/fur robes. For this reason, I consider this blanket to be significant both used as a blanket and as clothing. To me, then, it qualifies as semi-formal especially considering our alumni presenter is also Indigenous.

It is made of fine, soft wool. It has a brightly dyed side and dark side, but the bright side is considered the front. It is 2x1.5m long. Overall, it is a ""high class"" blanket. It is my first piece of traditional clothing that isn't shoes. I am very proud of it. One can wear it many ways, from a thick skirt to a cloak which can cover the entire body. I plan to wear it like a ""toga"" dress, though bulkier and less fitted I have a proper pin and cinch belt in order to fasten it. I can probably also secure the sleeve (since one arm will be out while another will keep the dress on my shoulders). Underneath, I will wear more masculine formalwear: a lavender dress shirt, black jeans, black tie, polished leather shoes plus hair and makeup. Overall, it seems unconventional, and indeed the blanket is thicker than expected, but I feel that it is important to do culturally as I will not have a ribbon skirt until next year.

I dress unconventionally. That is simply how I am. Sometimes, I don't fully understand what problems one would have with my clothes. However, my donor is an elderly woman so I thought that I should ask before making a bad decision professionally speaking.

What is your opinion? Should I wear this traditional semi-formal clothing (fine blankets/robes were worn to significant events, if one weren't a performer, especially those being held late into the night). Or should I ""dress down"" a bit?",12Feb2019,1

Issue is, whenever I bring up her beautiful skin or full soft lips, she shys away and/or tries to hide her lips. I sure that this comes from being raised in predominantly white areas and her being in a predominantly white college. Now I'm saying anything negative about white people, but when you're surrounded by things that are very aesthetically different than you, you find it hard to see how beautiful you are too (I'm a black man) She's never been seen as a pinnacle of beauty even remotely within her environment.

Not only this, but I have a twin brother and who’s very athletic and very good at his sports. I don’t even play a sport. I’m on the bowling team (because of course I am) and I’m good at a few instruments. That’s it. 

I feel so fucking worthless. I only have a couple friends, and they don’t really like me that much. What am I doing? ",12Feb2019,1
198,"I'm on a cultural organization's e-board as an educational director. We have weekly meetings, and I'm expected to attend most events and to host some of my own. I like the club, but I feel so lonely and lost. During each e-board meeting, I feel like I'm missing an inside joke and not really having fun in ways that the rest of the members are. They all seem to be friends, and I don't know how to join the circle. I felt a lost as a new member as well (in freshman year), but I hoped that I'd grow closer to people after joining the e-board, since that would include retreats and after parties.

This disconnect has been making it harder and harder for me to put in as much effort into the club, especially with schoolwork and research picking up. Tonight, the presidents (there are two) mentioned that we'd be having an e-board reelection in April. I was flabbergasted, since I was under the assumption that elected officials were guaranteed position for two years, but it turns out that's actually the limit of service instead. I feel like I'm hallucinating. I was so certain of this fact, since I distinctly remember considering this a benefit of applying, but no one else seemed surprised, so it must have been some misunderstanding on my part.

And... it's quite a big one.

I've been operating under the assumption that this would be my year to adjust to leadership, especially since my president hasn't been acting to ""pass down"" educational connections. He was the previous educational director, and he carried most of his responsibilities with him, instead of walking me through them. So I've only been working on assignments that have been directly delegated to me, and quite frankly, I haven't been doing that to the best of my extent either. I've been complacent in my position.

Something else I struggle with is when it's alright and not alright to ""shirk"" work. While everyone in the club gets things done, we often procrastinate on our tasks. No one frowns upon this; if anything, we sometimes had events in which we were scrambling to work things out \~10-15 minutes before the event started. Also, e-board members don't attend all events (or even general body meetings), especially if the event targets a more niche audience. The presidents don't seem particularly upset by this, and our treasurer-- despite having missed quite a few events-- is considered one of the most valuable members in our board. Since we attend a school with a heavy emphasis on academics over extracurriculars, we understand having to miss out on some things due to other obligations... or so I thought.

Last Friday, due to research, I missed a meeting with the broader committee. (I was planning to stay from 4-8 pm; I ended up staying from 4 pm-12 am.) I sent a message to the group chat apologizing for this beforehand, and no one responded. During tonight's meeting, we discussed a time for the second committee meeting. My desired timeslot conflicted with the requested timeslot from two of the directors, and one of the presidents-- upon hearing this--, responded with something along the lines of, ""\[Name\] wasn't there for the set-up anyways, so we should prioritize the other directors.""

I understand the rationale, but it still stung. And I know I shouldn't be taking it personally, but it's unleashed a lot of my disappointments, both in myself and in the club.

When it comes to the club, I don't feel that people care about what I do. I've been tasked with coordinating the newsletter; when I mention this during meetings, the president gives me a nonchalant affirmation and moves on. The e-board doesn't spend a lot of time discussing the educational events I am (and was) responsible for, whereas they spend 75% of the time discussing socials and general body meetings. Lastly, e-board attendance to the last educational event was dismal. I'm getting the impression that the club doesn't think highly of educational events, as their priority is on socials. Hell, we've been talking so much about a mixer with the naval academy, when that's simply an after party and not even a legitimate event.

I've also been assigned a more social event, in which I'm supposed to man a booth (representing our club) for another club's collaboration. It's next week, and it was on the e-board's agenda, but it was passed by so quickly. They asked me about the ingredients list, asked me about what I needed, and while I was asking for supplies, they moved onto the topic of fundraising. I had to interrupt them in the middle to ask them to consider the event again. I guess that's not too surprising since one of the presidents expressed not wanting to collaborate with the club next year, but this sort of general reception makes me feel like my work is...

Not important at all.

And while I know it's no excuse, that's also been reinforcing my bad work ethic. As for myself, I'm disappointed in myself for not having confirmed a speaker yet (for an event that's less than a month away) and not having kickstarted the newsletter for this semester, when it's already been \~3 weeks in. I could have taken further initiative, but I didn't, because I believed that my position was stable and that I'd have further chances to improve.

But I don't.

And I don't know how to handle this. I know the simple, straightforward answer is to, ""Just try your hardest!"", but frankly... I can't afford to be a tryhard for this club alone. My course load is heavy, research takes 10+ hours a week, mentoring takes 6+ hours a week, volunteering takes 4+ hours a week, and there are other events that occur more sporadically. To sacrifice other things to devote *solely* to the cultural organization-- which no one else (aside from the presidents) is doing-- would be impractical and disheartening. I want to find a balance, in which I pursue the tasks given to me, go a little beyond that, and attend as many events as socially acceptable.

I've really enjoyed being a part of this club. Its cooking events are great, I got to attend a wonderful conference in DC two times, and I do genuinely like the people, even if I'm not too close to them. I consider it a high priority extracurricular, and I'd like to continue contributing to the organization.

But the president's casual dismissal and the prospect of reelection has really demoralized me. I don't want to commit myself to educational events only to learn that I'm not being reelected, or even worse, that none of the e-board members give a shit. I'm tired of the club and I'm tired of my pathetic attitude towards it. I understand that I should start working to make up for my faults, but as of now, I feel so sad and lost. I would appreciate some feedback.

(Criticism would be fine as well. I'd like to say I wouldn't take it personally, but I didn't expect to take the president's remark to heart either, and I'm still reeling over it... so I'll instead say that if I do take anything personally, the fault for that would be mine, and that I'd do my best to counter and mitigate any defensiveness.)",12Feb2019,1
199,"Context. I’m halfway through college, I have a 3.8 GPA, and a scholarship. My parents don’t want to co-sign my loans anymore, and I’ve had to start asking other family members. It’s a very fresh issue so I haven’t heard a solid answer back from my uncle yet. 

It’s embarrassing, because my parents are fully capable of co-signing, they just worry that I won’t be able to pay back my loans and suddenly this is all on them, even though we agreed to remove their names from the loan once I graduate. So It’s really hard to convince other family members to co-sign my loans when my own parents won’t do it. I had the dean of my school and the head of my department write me a personal letter to my parents explaining that I’m one of the best students here, and they’re still hesitant. 

Note that I’ve done nothing to show them I’m irresponsible with money, it’s that their own parents were bad with money and this naturally makes them scared, which I understand. I have credit, but my account is only like 2 years old so I doubt I would be able to take a loan out on my own. I’ve been working since I was a freshman in high school too, and I pay my rent and whatnot, so it’s not like I don’t understand money. 

My parents even tell me that this has nothing to do with me as a person and everything to do with them being overly worried about things not working out, like if I break my leg and suddenly can’t work and afford to pay my loans along with living expenses.

202,"TLDR at the end. 

A little backstory about myself: I recently graduated May 2018 with a degree in art education and plans to teach elementary art classes. While in art school I also developed a huge passion for pottery. I’ve since gotten my pottery in our senior art gallery show, got a part time job teaching pottery classes as well as kids summer camp classes, I sell my work on Etsy, I’ll have a booth a craft festival this summer, my watercolor illustrations will be in an art show, and I’m also substitute teaching. All of this while working to pass my last test and earn my teaching certification and apply for full time teaching jobs. 

Now on to my issue. This all came to a head a couple days ago. My boyfriend (of 4 years) took us out to eat and while eating we were just talking about my sub jobs and so on and at one point he goes “you know... a part of me doesn’t want you to get a teaching job” and I felt the biggest RELIEF. He was so worried he’d upset me but I told him that thought had been in the back of my mind for a little while now. I told him there’s a part of me that also feels that way. To keep it short I’ll bypass most of the reasons why. The pottery shop I currently work at is massively expanding (5000sq. To 200,000sq. Factory space etc.) and I got offered my pick of full time positions making $12-$16 an hour. I’m in KY and that’s a lot good amount here. I would love to make pottery my career and I’m honestly more excited about the prospect of that job than a teaching job. 

Fast forward to today and while I’m working in the studio one of the other potters, a lady in her 50s, that I’m good friends with comes in. We have our usual life chats and she goes “You really impress me, and that’s hard to do with this old bat. I know you’re all about the little kiddos but I just feel like there’s more out there for you.” And went on to tell me her personal experience with finding a life path she wanted. Now she wasn’t speaking explicitly about my pottery but just me as person in general. 

All of the talk really has me confused and stressed and I just don’t know what to make of it. Part of me wants to get my steady teaching job and make my life here in KY. The other part of me wants to bust my ass working and me and my bf save up to move to Oregon, Montana, Washington, just somewhere new really, and pursue our passions. Either would fulfill me. 

Honestly, after talking more to my bf about this, I feel like I’ve put myself into a small box and never thought I could amount to anything “great” just normal. Now I’ve got people telling me they see this untapped potential in me and it’s really blowing my mind. I just don’t know how to handle it all... 

TLDR: People close to me are telling me they see greater potential in me than I see in myself. Cannot decide which path to take, stable career or artistic passion. ",12Feb2019,1
203,"Before I begin with my story, thank you so much for reading. I know this might be a little straight forward for my first post, but this is a huge dilemma that I am dealing with.

Well first off, I love my family to death, or at least most of my family. Most of my siblings that I favor are already moved out and working, so they hardly have any time to visit. I am stuck with my younger sisters, but that's not entirely bad. I love my youngest sister to death, even to the point it brings me to tears thinking about leaving her behind.

However, the second-youngest is a different story and here's where the real issue is. basically she's the most loathing, most narcissistic, and most toxic person I have ever met. I may have to apologise for ""not being understanding"" because I am very aware she's a hormonal angry teen beginning her life in middle school, so I can see why she acts the way she does, but I believe it's only a reason, not an excuse. but anyway, she's also spoiled rotten and just plain cruel and selfish. she has a dog that she never takes care of and dumps the responsibility on our own mother, who is constantly in pain due to a back injury. she constantly verbally and emotionally abuses the youngest sister, she'll never listen to anything I have to say because she thinks she's never wrong and is always right and everyone else is wrong (unless we're agreeing with her). she's conspiring with the oldest sister in the family because she's the only person who'll agree with her crap. she's also just as toxic as she is. she was living with us for a while, but that's a different story. But when she was here, all they were doing was talking behind Mom's back, so now she's gone and the second-youngest has been lashing out at us. I have been telling Mom that she needs to put more into disciplining her because she's out of control, but nothing changes. she still runs the show, she still calls the shots and she's still placed on her pedestal. She's queen of the castle and I'm done with it. Whenever I try to put her in her place, Mom basically tells me to back off and I am forced to obey her rules. I am done with my sister being the favorite in the family when she does nothing to deserve such treatment. I am done being undermineded by my irresponsible mother. I am 19 years old for God's sake and my say means less than a middle-schoolers! What kind of logic is that? I have been trying to be understanding, but it is just so damn hard. I'll put time into listening to her problems, but she wouldn't dare meet me half way. Everything is double standard with her. she'll have us listen to what she has to say, but she doesn't give a shred of a shit about anyone else. She has issues upstairs, but she refuses therapy, so she's stuck with these problems and she won't swallow her pride to get help.

so that is the dilemma. My family needs help and they won't even give it a try to resolve the issues that are tearing us apart. I wanna be in there lives, but I insist they get help and nothing will change my mind.",12Feb2019,1

High school (the 2-3 years) was completely terrible for me but luckily now I'm in college so I'm finally away from that but shit still gets brought up. That shit being the Hell that was applying to college with my parents which caused constant fighting. Then there was me getting fired from my job at a gas station which is another thing my parents keep over me (""you got fired from a gas station!""). Now there is how I screwed up my first semester of college and right now (they don't know this but they know I got shit grades first semester) I'm on academic probation. I also just got in trouble at work for some ""stuff"" I said that I don't even remember (something racist, they said they could've fired me but they were nice enough not to). My aunt is one of my boss' bosses (she's VP of Human Resources for a store I won't name) and apparently whatever fucking happened went to her and my parents (she told them probably) and IMMEDIATELY I got a text from my aunt and a call from my dad. My aunt says that we need to discuss what happens so that ""it NEVER happens again"" and my dad drove an hour to get to my college to ""talk"". Now listen, I try to obey my parents, even if I hate it, but I knew it was just going to be more yelling at me with me having nothing to say about anything, so I pretty much snapped. I got in my dad's car and before anything could happen I just got out (he wasn't driving but he was getting mad I didn't close the door, I didn't want to go with him). He then proceeded to grab my shirt but I was able to pull away and grab my laptop before anything else happened. I went straight to my dorm where he couldn't get me (they're locked to anyone who doesn't have a keycard) and went straight to my room where I was pretty much hysterical. I had trouble breathing (don't have asthma but I was just so scared of what was going to happen) and I was non-stop crying. Now listen, I'm a big guy who wants to act tough, I feel like I seem weak if I cry and my parents got mad at me for crying when they get mad at me, but I just couldn't handle everything that was happening. I was able, however, to man up and just text my floor RA (I'm a freshman btw) to just come into my room because I didn't know what else to do. I was able to choke up what had happened and I told her I just didn't feel safe in my dorm and that I didn't know what to do because I knew he was outside. She was nice enough to just walk me over to one of the counselors on campus where I was able to talk to one of them. The lady I talked to said that it was kind of obvious how much stress I was under (grades, work, constant yelling, high school bullying, even told her that twice I contemplated suicide but I left out how my parents were the cause of one) and it helped me a little (I'm going to go see her again next week because I'm not able to do anything because of my work schedule). The advice I'm looking for right now is what should I do right now? I'm away from my family in college but I'll eventually have to face them again. I have to go back to work tomorrow where a good handful of people I work closely with know that I got suspended because I'm apparently a fucking racist, so I don't know how I should deal with that (the problem there is that I feel like they won't really look at me the same). I just don't know what to do. Is all of this my fault? I mean the grades are my fault. I couldn't keep my damn mouth shut so I got in trouble at work. And I just became the outlaw of my family. I really need anything right now, and to be honest, please none of that ""it'll get better"" b.s.",12Feb2019,1

I just went up and said, “Where did you get the mouse rat keychain?” Then she told me that she actually didn’t know because she got it as a gift.

I'm 28 Years old now, I don't drink Alcohol, I don't smoke cigarettes, I don't do any hard drugs, but I have been smoking weed since I was 14 and I love it.

214,"I need some advice on what to do with the sport I play. I play golf and I am on my high school team (Junior, played all 3 years so far). For the past 4 months I have recently found myself unwilling to go out and actually play, I would much rather prefer to do something else like hang out with my friends or what not and there is now only few moments here and there where I actually want to play but it is very rare now. 

I do like the sport, however there are times where I take it too seriously and get angry, these moments actually take a big toll on me for some reason that I cannot explain. It is just I have sort of lost the drive to play. It’s literally like one hour I am on board with playing and the next I’m not. I am very conflicted at the moment. 

There are many factors to my loss of passion. For a while now, I have just not had the urge or the willingness to go play. Also I know currently there are a lot more things to think about (Like College and a Job) other than to play golf. The main one is that I know that when I attend college (In About A Year) all this is gonna be past me and all the money my family spent for me in Golf is gonna go down the drain and that makes me feel very bad about myself.

Anyway, it made me feel really turned on and I've always wanted to hook up with him or at least give him a bj but pretended to be asleep because I was unsure how to react. I kept snuggling into his shoulder to try to passively show I was happy and he put his head on mine.

226,"I've been in a ""stay at home mom group"" for 4 years now and have gotten pretty close with just about every mom in the group. There's about 60 active people. We do things with the kids, mom nights out, scrapbooking meets, a lot. Some people are on a texting basis with me, some aren't. We really don't have drama as we are all a little older and live in nicer areas of town (I assume people are just calmer/content/less stressed/happy). Anyways, some of us now work, some don't. I do not. My husband is our breadwinner and a good one at that. He is a realtor, everyone knows this. A couple people in our group have used him already to buy or sell their home. It's a little bonus of being in a group- referrals. He is a broker, top 150 in Phoenix, lots of 5-star reviews. He is good at his job. Everyone has been happy with his work and I feel great knowing I can leverage some income from true good friends whom I talk to often.

My problem is, we have a newer mom in the group, who actually started her OWN separate mom group with about 50 people in it, as well as joining ours. She is a realtor and she is nice.. cordial..attractive. I see the real reason she joined our group. She isn't there to make friends like everyone else. She is there for marketing. She added everyone in the mom group to a private fb group that she posts videos to nonstop about real estate. She is a momboss, momprenuer, bossbabe, ex- MLM Roden and Fields selling hun. Her posts on fb consist of guilt tripping about time away from her kids, how she is amazing at selling homes, home tours. It's salesy, ruthless, and over the top in your face. She brings marketing material to kid playdates. She has been doing real estate for a little over 2 years.. she is probably mediocre at best. I can't market myself since I am not the ""realtor"" but I miss the benefits of my friends at least seeing if my hubby would work well for them. Since she has been around, moms and their husbands in our group have only used her. It's about 50k in commission over the course of a year. Most of these newer couples had no realtor and we're literally looking for a referral and she inserted herself into their life. My husband has more experience, has a showing agent to take them to homes if it's a last minute showing, great references. Recently.. A close friend of mine was fair and asked my husband for his best deal to work with them. He gave her a great deal but they went to [salesy hun], she competed, lowered her commission more and won, basically. I'm so beyond annoyed at this point. She will befriend the mom through the home buying process and disappear when they close. She actually told one gal she was going to join her church with her, while in escrow, and never did. I just see her as a huge leech and no one else sees it like I do. They think she is just too busy for too many friendships. She runs another mom group for Christ sake. It's all BS.

I'm a 26 year old male living in NYC. Right now I'm living paycheck to paycheck because I have two credit card balances grabbing me by the balls. I'm early into my career.

I'm getting a hefty tax return this year and with it I'm faced with two options:  

1) Spend it on a ticket to Europe to see a woman I've had a brief fling with a year ago. On top of that I get to travel (I haven't travelled in a couple years) and see Europe. I think it'd be great for my mental health as I'm feeling a little burnt out. Would be an awesome reset. My romantic life is nonexistent now and flying to Europe to see her is something I'm romanticizing. I feel like the experience would be worth it.

2) Use a huge chunk of the tax return to cut one of my CC balances in half. My quality of life is so held down by these two CC bills, I feel the effects of it day to day. If I get this ticket and go to Europe, there goes like 80% of my tax return and I'm back to square one. I can make a tangible change to my day to day living (and happiness) by paying off a huge chunk of my CC thus lowering my monthly statement. I would have to tell Euro woman to wait (after repeatedly telling her to wait for me over and over).

231,"I need help deciding where to go forward with my relationship. I have been engaged and dating my partner for seven years. We have mostly had good times, but sometimes bad. Lately, it has not been good. 

In secret, my partner has been looking at and seeking photos/nudes from other people outside of our relationship for several months, as well as talking to exes, random people and my own friends trying to sleep with them, compliment or talk to them sexually. It was very upsetting to hear this, and I confronted my partner about it all. My partner said it's not cheating, but I still felt like it was since my partner was talking to their ex and has done these things in the past. My partner felt like I was overreacting. 

Flash forward a few days, and I go visit a friend out of town to get some space and time away. My partner, I found out, is drinking and sending messages to my friends while I am gone trying to see them naked, get photos or just to hang out. I found out about this, and I am infuriated. My partner's friend asks me if I want to get revenge, and I said yes, and I think about planning to meet up with the friend. My partner, in fact, had talked to the friend's ex trying to gain pictures. We were both upset about my partner's actions because it affected both of us. 

My partner found out about my planned meet up with the friend, and became very angry at me and accused me of cheating. However, I did not act upon that or meet up with the friend at all. I am still ashamed I thought about meeting up with the friend, but it was in reaction to all the things going on with my partner. I understand why my partner is mad, but I also think I have a right to be mad after all my partner's actions.  

Now, I would like to move on with my life and get out of my partner's life. (We live together). My partner wants to work things out.

Then after I calm down I regain some sensibility and wonder what the hell came over me. I don’t know why I think of those things over such small incidences.

237,"Long post, please forgive me. I felt this needed background information. 

——

So when we first moved into our current neighborhood 2 years ago, we noticed two kitties that were frequently strolling around. A fluffy black cat and an orange ginger cat, which we nick-named Cole and Marmalade, after the famous internet kitties. Both would come up to us for scratches occasionally, but they would always run back home to our neighbors across the street. 

After awhile, we noticed that the cats were looking a little worse for wear, (skinnier and a little more ragged) and were appearing at our door a lot more often. I put a post out in our Neighborhood app, asking about the fur babies, it didn’t take long for a neighbor to send me a private message... She requested that I remove my post, that the two cats belonged to a neighbor that had moved. The family had supposedly moved into a temporary apartment that didn’t allow cats, so another neighbor had been leaving food out for them until their owners could come pick them up, and take them to the house they were building. She said it would be 2 months, tops. I didn’t argue, only told her that we would leave some food out for them too. Deleted my post and didn’t think about it again for awhile.

That was October... We realized sometime in January that “Cole” was gone. I was so scared that he’d been hit by a car, or picked up by the coyotes that are nearby. By this time, Marmalade was now practically a fixture on our porch. I reached out to the neighbor again, and was told that the owners had come to pick the cats up, but that Marmalade “cried” and “didn’t want to go”, so he now just belongs to the new owners of the house... 

Here’s the thing. He is always outside, and was super skinny before we started feeding him. When we fill his food dish, he eats like he hasn’t had a meal in days. (Which I suppose isn’t abnormal for cats) His eyes were always running, and his fur was rough and patchy. Since getting regular meals, and having his eyes wiped, he seems to be getting better. This past week, he actually followed my husband into our house! It has been cold recently, so we started making a routine of it. He now spends the night in our home, and we let him out in the morning when we both leave for work. He is always sitting on the porch waiting for us when we get back.

Our other cats are still wary of this new development, but as we speak, he is snoozing on my husband’s feet. We’re at a bit of a loss. If he “belongs” to the new neighbors, are we doing a bad thing here? We have a pack of coyotes in the farmlands behind our neighborhood, and I would be devastated if something happened to him. 

TL;DR: We have been taking care of a neighborhood cat, and he’s halfway moved in. There’s a chance he may still have an owner, but he’s been neglected. What do we do?

Recently, Jill started making fun of Jack. A lot. And it’s not even poking fun at him in a friendly manner or anything, it’s just mean, and she does it in front of us and kind of expects us to go along with it. Originally we kinda did, too, but then it got mean, and we stopped participating. And then I started defending Jack.

But before I get to me defending him, I should say this isn’t the only thing that was happening. She also has kissed girls many times while drunk and hid it from him. She has a second friend group that she doesn’t like Jack seeing. She tells us all of Jack’s worst traits while he isn’t around. And again, it isn’t a rant-about-boyfriend kind of “Oh he never says goodbye when I leave the room” but a straight up “He’s a fat, annoying bitch” kind of thing.

Some other personality things (very religious, trying to convert entire group, among other things) has led a lot of the group to dislike Jill. So I started defending Jack, and now Jill has started insulting me to Jack. Jack told me about this, and we had a heart-to-heart. I told him that I think the relationship isn’t good for either of them, and he said that they both care about each other and that this is just a tough week for her and that’s why she’s been acting out. This was three weeks ago. Nothing has changed. Jack also thinks that none of us like him and only hang out with him because we hang out with Jill.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell him how to run his relationship or seem like the bad guy, but I hate seeing him so sad when Jill just tears him apart. He’d bend over backward for her and she just uses him. I don’t want to just watch this happen, and I especially don’t want them to break up and then have Jack not hang out with us anymore because he thinks we don’t like him, and I’m sure us getting mad at his girlfriend doesn’t make him think we like him either.

Hey there,

So I’ve always liked colorful and mystical designs and illustrations. As a comic book illustrator myself this goes hand in hand. There’s a particular [hoodie](https://zippertheory.com/p/3d-ice-and-fire-wolf-hoodie/) I want to get. Wolves are my favorite animals and I know I sound like a kid writing is. Actually I have still kept my inner child all these years. My wife thinks this hoodie is just way too much and something that ricky from trailer park boys would wear. She also added that no one would take me serious, when wearing childish clothes like this. However I am a freelance illustrator and don’t need or want to be taken seriously and I think this kind of fashion reflects my personality. I am a bit torn between what I really want to wear vs. what people may think of me. What do you think? Yay or nay for an grown man?

I’m a freshman in college rooming with a friend I’ve known for about three years. 

She’s nice, but recently she’s been getting on my nerves recently. 

I come from a pretty well off family and my parents are much older and retired now, and I’m the first kid they’ve sent off to college. Naturally, they spoil me with food and other things I might need (I am aware of how blessed I am and don’t brag about it and often treat my friends alot). I am kinda picky about what I eat so I have specific brands of stuff that I would much rather prefer over others. With no stove, I stock up on things such as mac n cheese, my favorite boxed chicken soup, and my favorite brand of microwave popcorn when the dining hall just doesn’t cut it. 

However, roommate (let’s call her R) had been giving away and using my stuff without asking/telling me. It’s mostly my fault because I try to be nice and win people over by giving/letting them use my stuff since I’m a little weird and awkward and sometimes have a hard time clicking with people. 

A list of things she’s done/taken but who’s counting:
1. Given away a bunch of my command hooks (she knows where in my stuff they are? like wtf) and several boxes of my chicken soup and other food items (soup costs ~$4 a box since its from Trader Joe’s)
2. Used my shaving cream and didn’t bother to tell me until we went to Target the other day and I asked her if she needed more of her bar soap since it melted away (idk if that’s right lol)
3. Always wants to take my car if we go anywhere when she has her own and my car takes more expensive gas than hers
4. Takes my school supplies and may or may not return them. She took a notebook that I was writing history outlines in and spent alot of time on without my permission cause my outlines were good :/ 
5. Uses my laundry detergent on the reg even thou she has a full bottle in the laundry room as well?
6. My parents got me about 12 boxes of my favorite microwave popcorn which is from an organic store so it’s kinda expensive. She has her own popcorn and yet she prefers mine since it’s more healthy. I’ve since hidden my extra soup and popcorn so she (hopefully) can’t find it and if she does I know she’s going through my stuff
7. She brought a big color printer from home which is nice but I’ve had to buy the ink for it the past three times (and it is NOT cheap)

Besides all that, she makes fun of me for things I’ve done/do like buying ice cream and not eating it (when I had a really bad depressive episode for most of last semester and didn’t eat/slept alot), getting back together with my boyfriend, sleeping when I was depressed, and more. I’m sure she can tell our relationship had changed this semester but I don’t know how to tell her I’m not cool with her recent behavior and I hate confrontation. 

Oh, and when I told her I might take next year off for mental and spiritual reasons, the first thing she said was her complaining about having to find a new roommate. :)",12Feb2019,1

249,"This is a repost of my post from yesterday because I forgot to read the rules and posted without looking (sorry mods!)

The reason why I am asking this is because I just some need advice if there's any option left that I can try. This is a throwaway account just to be safe. Sure it sounds like a lost cause but recently, I've been asking myself what I did wrong or what I should've done and what can be done (if there is any option left).

So I'm in a psych class and there's this girl that catches my eye but I don't sit near her til towards the end of the semester because my professor one days wants me to move closer to the class so I decide to sit next to her. Weeks go by and I talk to her about whatever we talked about in class because we always have discussions with the person we sit next to. Things go well. I decide one day I should ask her if she wants to study for our upcoming and last  exam before our final. She enthusiastically agrees and she types her number into my phone and such. We make plans. Things go well. We study again for our final but this time, she asked me if I wanted to study at her house.  I study at her house, and things looked promising so given my past history with girls, I felt I was doing things right. I wasn't coming off too strong or rushing things, so I take things somewhat slow. Given my insecurities, after that I didn't text her for five days thinking I would annoy her and didn't want to keep texting her about school. Of course she told me more about herself and that same day  I studied with her at her house, she drove me home because I didn't have my car at the time and got to know more about her personality and such. Things looked even more promising since we had some similar interests, hobbies and such. We talked about going to a bar sometime, going to a concert, etc and trying out new things. Before I got out of her car when she pulled up in front of my house, I asked her if she was down to hanging out during winter break and she was down for it.

&amp;#x200B;

So after that semester ended, I didn't text her since we last texted was that same day I studied at her place. 5 days pass by and I finally text her asking how she did on the final and how she did overall in class. She doesn't respond til an hour later and when she responded conversation was shorter than usual. So I assumed she was busy and couldn't respond that much or ended it because of whatever she was doing. Didn't think much of it. I continue to not text her until a week or two later the day of this event I went to, which was some 2 day rave/concert for new years eve. I texted her while we waited in line and asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime next week. No response. Nothing. So I felt like crap for a bit but since I was at this concert/rave, that took my mind off of it. I didn't do anything after that or message her because that's when I initially thought I shouldn't do anything anymore but figure I got ghosted and this caught me off guard because things were going well. I don't know if I played it too safe by not being consistent enough or whatever. But since I started school again this semester, I try texting her again saying it's been awhile and how her semester is going. Of course, no response.

&amp;#x200B;

To finish what my original question was, do girls suddenly lose interest for no reason or is there a reason that they do? I asked some of my friends if girls just lose interest for no reason, but I feel like there could be some reason as to why they do. Whether it was me being inconsistent, not putting enough effort after the semester was over to pursue her and keep her interested in me or just lost interest because of some other reason, is there any option left that I can exert before completely giving up? Of course, I also am aware there might not be anything left to do, but was curious to ask Reddit on the advice sub unbiased people's opinions. I guess I had to add in some background info on this situation as to why I asked if girls just lose interest for no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

Got a girls number in my class. Things went well. Studied with her twice, got to know more of her, find out have some similar hobbies, interests, etc. Didn't text her for 5 days. Seemed like she lost interest and hasn't responded to my texts ever since. Do girls just lose interest for no reason?",12Feb2019,1
250,"Hello! My question is pretty general but I'd love some help, as recently I've taken to trying to improve my well-being and I believe finally working out is the right step.

I have absolutely no experience working out and haven't done so my whole life, and although I'm comfortable in my body personally, I have issues worrying about being judged at the gym (I am a thicc lad). 

I love the idea of going with a friend, but I find my current health embarrassing and it's almost inconceivable to put myself is such an embarassing scenario.

I would love to work out from home, but my current setup doesn't allow that.

I wish there were gyms with 100% isolation, but that just doesn't exist- how do I cope with my fears or overcome them? What etiquette do I need to know? How does one function lol

On a related note, I am TERRIFIED of locker rooms- the thought of them doesn't bother me (actually for whatever reason being naked in front of other people doesn't cause me worry lol), but I don't know the etiquette, what they're like, etc. and the fear of doing something odd in such a sensitive place is no bueno. What do you do in a locker room- do you strip down completely? Are there showers? Are they private?? Lockers? Where do you put your clothes? Do you pay for a locker? What if someone is at the locker adjacent to yours??

I know it's irrational but I can't really help my anxiety-  one day I'll take the leap but I'd love some advice right now to soothe my concerns before taking the leap!",12Feb2019,1

I had a IT background for 2 years till I was hired at a medical research company doing Sencha Ext Js. I did hat for 8 months before I was laid off. Then I spent the next year applying for jobs trying to get hired. I switch my aspect from front end development to back end and stated learning C#. 

After doing all the tutorial I could find I needed more help mastering stuff so I applied for revature and was told I had to make an app out of c# and other stuff to show them I could have it. So I made an app using a lot of different stuff and really enjoyed it. I was accepted and brought to Tampa. I thought it was fantastic go well but then I got fucked after I signed the contract, we were switch to Pega because the client wanted it. So we were poorly taught this and then spent the next 3 months struggling to get by. After I got my certs for this niche language, I waited for 7 months at home to be assigned a job. About a few weeks ago I was assigned a job at a nice company but it is for Pega.

I am not sure how to properly study programming for my dream job while trying to be competent at this job so I don't lose it.

253,"Hi all. 

I have a lot of anxiety and guilt when I eat and when I actually buy groceries. I’m 20, and I’ve been living on my own since 18, and things haven’t been great. I have been diagnosed with general&amp;social anxiety and depression and have had some traumatizing experiences. Most of the mental health issues I deal with have been present for 7+ years so I have kind of already figured out what has stemmed from what and the cause and effect system surrounding my past and why I am the way I am (as much that is relevant and helpful) 

However, I just cannot get into a normal headspace surrounding eating. I have had a very very poor appetite since middle school (I was too anxious to eat around others so I usually skipped lunch completely) and things have gotten worse since I moved out. 

I don’t know how to cook, i experience executive dysfunction and have trouble keeping the house and kitchen clean. Even if it’s a healthy and tasty meal I still feel really guilty that I ate it, and I think about how I probably should have eaten something else or just not at all. 

Pretty regularly I go a couple of days without food, and then eat an entire pot of pasta. 

I am really fed up (no pun intended) with feeling sick all the time and looking unhealthy. Today I went to the grocery store and bought $100 of groceries, NO junk food whatsoever and half of it was vegetables and fruit. I am on the brink of real recovery from shitty life things and am trying in all departments to improve on who I am and what I do. But I’m so anxious and worried- spending money gives me anxiety so watching $100 leave my hands for something that will be gone in a month makes me so nervous. 

Does anyone else experience this? A friend of mine with an eating disorder told me once that how I react around food really reminds her of her own issues with eating.. I don’t know if this guilt and unease about food and eating is something like that, but any advice would be very much appreciated. How should I deal with this and somehow avoid the anxiety that follows mealtime? I just want to be healthy and it’s really hard for me for some reason. ",12Feb2019,1

269,"So, my friend is already a strange person, but over time she really has me worried for her. We've been friends for about ten or so years (Since we were kids). When she was a kid, she was pretty normal. She was willing to try things, joked like the other kids ,yet quiet at times. Normal stuff really. We spent a lot of tine together between the ages of 10-14 or so. In the beginning she was just as she was, up until she was around 13-14 or so, then she became more stubborn and arguementive. I do not think she was that way on purpose, but she grew very monotone. Some day she'd talk fine and normal, then the next day she would stutter quite a lot. Ever since she was 12 or so she has slowly but surely developed a weird dialect. She talks like one of those old movie stars, but pronounces things a bit more weirder. She'll say something like ""Get that over there"" and it'll come out as ""get thyat over eh' theh"". I don't know if that is something that she developed or what. Her mannerisms are weird, too. She'll walk on her tip toes, and walk a round with a blanket. She grew very lazy, and didnt want to practice dancing or anything, the only big thing she'd do is clean the house at exactly 12:00pm. lastly she was always a bit chubby and tan. Now, since then, we've lost touch for almost a year. her sister (twin) (she's also my friend too) asked if I could come over for the week to hang out and study. I also forgot to add in the detail, but Bennet is homeschooled, and her sister Betty Goes to public school in some of the same classes as I do. Any-who, Bennet doesn't get any social interaction, and lives her life as a bit of a recluse. I'm writing this as she is sleeping as fas t as I can, so sorry big it seems like bad write and is all jumbled, but she only sleeps for 30 minutes at a time per hour all night or so, for whatever reason. Any-how, here is my concerned serious bit. I'm crying while typing this, because I have no clue what is wrong with her. When I first walked into the door around 4:30pm, she was alone in her room sleeping. We woke her up, and she pulled sheets off of herself, she must've drooped 50+ pounds, and was very thin and pale. Throughout the day hanging around, she was jittery. She has chills frequently. She still was monotone, but she talks more panicked than what I remember. She didn't talk and awful lot, but when she did it was her saying something simple, but having a hardbtime getting bro the point or over explaining it. She was trying to tell her Grandma that she had put the blankets in the wash, but she ended up saying something like""y'kniw I went and I got the blankets if the couch, but some dirt from the dogs paws were on it so I shook it out"" blah blah blah, she was just taking a bit to get to her point. Her family is verybloving a sweet, and they just assume that that's Bennet being Bennet. She'll do a lot more now, but she is jittery and going from a to b. One minute shell being sewing and listening to her records, the next she'll be moving the furniture around and cleaning everything. She will go up to two weeks without showering or changing clothes even. when talking she still sounds the same, but she laughs to herself, and she wheezes often to. she is hesitant on going out and doing much outside of her house, and is the most on edge when put in that situation. don't get me wrong, despite her paranoid, jittery behavior, you could keep a conversation with her, but not normal as you would with Betty. I just don't understand how or why someone would change This much. Just by looking at her, you could tell her heart is beating just about anxiety like. But with anxiety you have at least a normal ground, with bennet, it's like she's hiding anxiety, but she's also hiding something else. She was telling Betty about this cat she saw, but then she stopped herself and laughed and said that it turns our she was inside and that was her cat minchie. She seems like she can't even tell TV from reality . she is very smart, she is a history buff and will rant about JFK not eating his ideal breakfast on the day of his death, and talks about bit like it happened close to her.

273,"I’m 14 and was diagnosed 3 days after I turned 12. I just want to get my story laid out first. So before I was diagnosed, for 2 months I constantly peed ever 2 hours and I drank 6-7 water bottles a day (which was a lot to me), and I lost around 30 punds. 

A week before my diagnosis I threw up and I felt so weak, stumbling around the house, always tired. 

My parents took me the doctors, I peed in a cup, the nurse came in and said “You have Type 1 Diabetes”. I didn’t think much of it at first, I didn’t know much about it, I thought it was just temporary. I was immediately rushed to the hospital and they didn’t let me eat for 2 days. 

In the hospital, my family visited and a lot of them cried and felt bad for me, but all I thought about was eating, then a doctor came in and kinda explained everything to me, but even after telling me this would change my life, I still wasn’t phased or anything.

After that, occasionally I’d get so mad if someone said I couldn’t eat something and actually prevent me from eating it because they don’t understand that I have to eat something, I just have to take a shot accordingly. And I know they’re just looking out for me, but it still sucks to hear from them.

Now my parents always try to remind me to take a shot or that my blood sugar’s too high and I hate it because they also say that “I’m different” and it makes me feel so pathetic. 

NOW reasons I want to die: 
-I think diabetes is too expensive, my parents have to pay for insulin, glucose monitors, needles, etc. and I feel like its just a waste of their money.
-I used to steal money from my parents too, I was so greedy and wanted things like a pc and stuff so I stole from them without thinking much about it, but now I think about it and I hate myself and think maybe if I die now, then they can save money.
-I don’t think I’ll live that long either, I always hear about diabetics getting other diseases like gangrene (which probably won’t kill me) and then kidney failure or something like that which would make me go through dialysis which sucks and I don’t want to live through that.
-I have a girlfriend, but I don’t want to ruin her life with this so I thought if I died, she’d be sad for a little while but she’d find someone else. I would break up with her, but I could never be able to bring myself to do it.

I could probably think of a lot more reasons why I feel like I should die, but these are the main points. 

I know I’ve been saying “die” but I more just want to not exist because then everyone could forget about me and it wouldn’t care any issues. If I died then I’d have a funeral and people would be sad.

I need help dealing with all this before I actually do something to myself.

277,"Like literally, I can never go a day without worrying about “what if I become a failure in life, I’m gonna fail my parents.” I’m 16, and I’m a junior right now in High School. And I just don’t want to be a disappointment. Especially when the counselors came in a couple weeks ago and told us to pick our classes for senior year. And one teacher came in earlier to introduce us to his AP Economics class, and gave this huge speech about how the classes we pick next year will decide our destiny. After that I was just nervous. To top it all off my grades are just average, right now I have A’s in French, US History, Sports Medicine, and Art, and a B and a C in Math and English. However Math and English happen to be my worst subjects, in fact Sophmore year 2nd semester I got D’s on both of them, and dropped my GPA to 2.6 or 2.5. After that I said to myself “I’ll never be successful” and I got super discouraged, even though I plan to go to summer school to retake those two. How can I be less stressed about the future? Considering my extreme anxiety over the years. ",12Feb2019,1

I used to have a nose piercing on my right nostril (left side of the picture) but I had an injury and had to take it out. 

The injury also left me with a crooked nose. 

I want to get my nose pierced again but don't know which side to get it on. 

Would getting it on a specific side help balance out the look of the deviation a little?

279,"I’m naturally a sensitive person but lately I’ve become very upset at the slightest things. I’ll make a small mistake and then I’ll somehow start calling myself an idiot and worthless and a bunch of other mean things and it feels like it escalates so quickly that I forget what made me upset in the first place. It’s not that I just call myself dumb and than move on. I’ll cry for like an hour about how no one needs me and that I’m good for nothing. Then after I calm down I regain some sensibility and wonder what the hell came over me. I don’t know why I think of those things over such small incidences. Another thing that’s been happening is that I have no motivation to do anything. I mean I do the bare minimum to pass my classes and I feel like I don’t really enjoy reading or making playlists, which are hobbies that I use to like a lot. These days I just want to lay in bed all day and watch Netflix. This behavior only fuels the self loathing I feel when I get upset too. It’s just a repetitive cycle of feeling bad about myself and being lazy. I dunno, I need to get my act together. Does anyone else feel this way? If so, what do you do to help fix the behaviors? I’d appreciate any input, thanks. ",12Feb2019,1

282,"Title says it all. I've had these friends for years but I realized they just don't care about me anymore. They are never free to hang out, never talk to me unless I initiate. And today I found out none of them can come to the big concert we've all been planning to go to for months. I'm so sick, so fed up, just exhausted with it all, I feel like less of a person because of it. I don't know what to do. I feel like if I leave I'll feel worse cause I have zero friends outside of this group. And we're in a very small school (less than fifty people) so I'd always have to see them.

283,"Hey guys, I created a reddit just to post this and I thought it would be interesting to see how my first experience of reddit will go.
Anyways here we go

Me and this girl named Hailey have been talking for a couple months ago and I really like her, we’d talk on the phone every day for hours on end however, she lives in California and I live in Minnesota so seeing each other physically was hard so we’d FaceTime here and there.
So I recently noticed that on her Instagram she removed me from her page / bio and all and I was curious and she said it was a bug.. I then noticed there was a guy that was liking her posts as fast as I would. So today I decided to Dm the guy and turns out she’s been talking to him the last few weeks and talks to him and calls him right before she calls me so i asked her who he was and she completely ignored it until I had him ask her and apparently I’m worthless and nothing and she never loved me. I’m looking to see if anyone could give me some relative advice on how to avoid this in the future. I’m not gonna give any @‘s but I’m just looking to see what everyone thinks as I don’t have any friends to bring this up to, 
Thank you.",12Feb2019,1
284,"Sorry my english isn't good. I have small business &amp; working with artisans from small villages in Indonesia to make handmade bags &amp; crafts. Most of the time i sell my products overseas and deliver it worldwide using local shipping company or premium shipping company depends on what customers want. So earlier last year i got order of total 130 pieces of bags made from bamboo &amp; rattan,this order came from a woman in Brazil that used to buy my products before &amp; that is why i trust her. We made agreement about payment &amp; she wants all bags to be branded using her own brand using laser,we did it. So they agreement is she paid 50% up front for the bags,full shipping cost when all bags are done and 50% when it is ready to ship. 

During the process,i sent her couple of updates and she was happy about it. She chose *HL for shipping company as it is fast and reliable,i have told here that it will be expensive because the bags that she want are big on volumetric. I offered some options using cheaper shipping company but she sticks on her choice. I made estimated calculations about volumetric and she sent the money.  So at this point i already got 50% of down payment + full payment for shipping (estimated).

FYI,this company is limit each package to be maximum of 70kg (volumetric &amp; non-volumetric) and 1 box of her packages already way more than that so to avoid extra charge for jumbo package they said better to send it in different waybill,so i did and of course i let her know about that. She was okay with that. 

1 day after the 1st package sent she contacted me in panic asking me to stop the package that already on its way because she just got call from shipping company that tax is so expensive  (she knew that tax is on her and how many % she must pay to custom in her country). She texted me non stop asked me to call the customer service because i sent it using my account. I did call the customer service and they said it is impossible to stop it because it is already on the plane. I explained about the tax situation and they said all tax must be paid as soon as the package arrived,doesn't matter she take it or not. I texted her explaining the answer from customers service and she said she talked with another customer services in Brazil that she doesn't need to pay any tax. I sent her emails and even recorded the calls with cs,she finally understand....NOT.

Few days later i got call from the company asking if it is okay if i  am the one who pay all the tax for the package because the receiver doesn't want to pay. I said NO,because it is not my responsibility and they must ask her again. Cs was helpful and they understand my situation as a seller after i explained everything. I texted my customer and she said the tax is super expensive and she has more packages coming so she asked them to send it back to Indonesia. She said i dont have to worry because no tax will be charged since she declined the package. I tried to explain it again to her that that was not how they told me. She didn't wanna listen..

Weeks later i got package coming back and i called the cs again,she checked it and yup i got an invoice worth $1400 for return package and tax. They sent me another email from brazil that also says that the invoice is for the tax that my customer declined. Found out she asked them to return the package and all cost is charged into my account. I wasn't happy about that and i contacted her,she then finally promise to pay the return package.  Few days after that she asked me if it is possible to re-send again ALL of the package using the same company since she already paid full for the shipment. I sent her how much it charged for shipping from Indonesia-Brazil-Indonesia for the package she declined and it is already hit her shipping deposit. She then asked me to help find reliable cargo company,i did all she asked and she said she will send someone to help for all shipment. She asked me not to use any money left from her deposit eventho she knew that it is not enough to cover all. I didn't touch her money but somehow she keep postponing the pick up schedule for the package for months and artisans asked me when they can get 50% of the rest of the payment. I told her my situation that artisans can't wait any longer so i must pay them using her deposit or my own pocket. She then agreed that i used her deposit to pay all artisans.So it left her with no deposit and return invoice. 

It's been almost 8months. Everyday i get call from the company asking when i will pay the overdue invoice and it is getting more intimidating everyday since i missed all the deadlines they gave because my customer keep giving me empty promises. I lost sales because the shipping company finally closed my account and my other customers got their packages late than the agreement. I must cover all the loses by myself,i took loan,used half of my kid's savings just to survive from all the domino reaction. It might sounds not so much from some of you but $1400 + all the lost i got is enough money to me to pay 1 year rent. I told her every single days about it and asking when will i get the payment. She always say ""i am working on it,it all sort out,i am overseas now"". I was upset when i saw her instagram how she spent most of her time in fancy restaurants,doing vacation and bought expensive stuffs. I was so upset when she posted her daughter with #firstcar which is porcshe,she is probably 6 months old. I was upset because i am her struggling with all the domino reactions and she didn't reply to my chat anymore. It takes at least 1 week to reply and all i got is ""I DONT HAVE THE MONEY!!!!!"". She said her personal life is different with her business life. Unfortunately to me my business life affecting my personal life and it is so messed up. She also don't want me to get rid of her bags so it sits there in my house and i can't do anything about it since it's all have her brand. 

What should i do?
 I have a lot of screenshots of our chats if anyone wanna see it. Up until now i still asking politely. Many people said that i must put her name on artisans group &amp; social media but i don't know..
Any advices?

Can i now think her promise to pay the invoice is safely be taken as complete BS?
I've messaged her a few time but she haven't bothered to give the date of when she'll pay. I thought there might be miniscule hope &amp;  some kind of truth in her promise. The fact that she can't show respect to respond to my messages has now shown that she is full of shit.",12Feb2019,1
285,"Hey reddit! So, I'll begin by mentioning that both my boyfriend (26M) and I (25F) are students at a local university. We have known each other 11+ years, and actually dated for an extremely short period of time back when I was 14 and he was 15. We broke up and I moved away to a different town a few years later. After graduating from the community college in this different town, I decided to pursue a bachelor's degree at the university in the town we went to middle school/high school in, and moved back in September 2018. He had moved to another country a couple years ago, and had also moved back to finish up his bachelor's degree at the same university. We ran into each other the second day of the quarter in September 2018, and dated for a couple months before officially becoming a couple (again) in November 2018.

Things honestly couldn't be better between the two of us. We are incredibly compatible and already spend quite a bit of time together as it is. We spent a week together in Canada over our winter break and had an absolutely amazing time, and have been backpacking together which also went incredibly well. We attend the gym regularly together, have ""study dates"" where we make dinner together and do homework at least twice a week, and almost every weekend he comes to stay with me and will usually stay from Friday after class until Sunday afternoon sometime. He currently lives with his parents out of convenience and to save money, but they will be moving to another state which will leave him with looking for a place to live in the next few months.

I am currently living with a roommate, but we have been having some serious issues and decided earlier today that it would be best if she found someone to take over my portion of the lease. I am looking for a one bedroom apartment without roommates and hope to be moved out by next month. My boyfriend's parents are probably not looking at leaving until summer, but if they are able to find jobs and a house it could definitely be sooner. 

Today, the boyfriend and I were talking about our living situations and he asked me if I would be able to afford moving into a place by myself, and then asked if I would be okay living by myself because he knows it can get lonely. He then commented that he would be over all the time anyway, so I probably wouldn't get lonely. He then went on to talk about how he was going to need to find a place. I got the feeling that he was almost hoping that I would suggest that we move in together, although I could be misreading his curiosity. I was incredibly tempted to mention it, but was worried that he would have a negative reaction since we haven't really been together all that long.

So, my question: Is it too soon to suggest that he move in with me? As mentioned, it probably wouldn't be for another couple months anyway, which also makes me wonder if I should wait until it gets closer to that time, or if it would be better to suggest it now so we can start planning if he says yes? 

TLDR; I'm moving out of a roommate situation into my own apartment and my boyfriend's parents are moving out of the state so he will be looking for somewhere to live in the next few months. We have only been officially together 3 months but dated for 2 months prior to that and have known each other 11+ years (and previously dated when we were much younger). We are extremely compatible and have traveled together quite a bit already so we know we get along well when spending lots of time together, and he already stays with me every weekend. Is it too soon to suggest that he move into my place when he needs to find somewhere to live?",12Feb2019,1

We had 2 options, either go to another campaign within the company or find a new job. I applied for another campaign within the company and so did he. The last day I come to find out none of them viewed my application and told me it was to late. Of course all they had to say was ""sorry!"". But my fiance kept working as he was able to get to another campaign. During the course of our time there, we had finally got FMLA as we both have anxiety disorders. Of course once we got it we were basically fired. When he switched, the company was bought out by another which meant he lost the FMLA he just got and would have to wait a whole year AGAIN to qualify for FMLA that we had just gotten! He quit, and dont blame him. We have been living off my unemployment for the past 6 months. He has found a job since then technically. He is to work for a insurance company and has been working towards getting the licences he needs to do so and finally has, but they are now asking for 10,000 in his name, just proof. My unemployment is up, we are flat broke, I cant even afford Netflix which is all we have, our tired just popped and I feel that I can't ask my parents as they are struggling and so are his parents. I have applied to so many different jobs and have not gotten a call back on any of them. I am starting to worry and panic as I am now unable to pay my credit card bills, my phone, existing really. I don't know how we are supposed to get the $10,000 so he could even start his job! All I can do is apply to jobs and hope anyone calls me back, hires me.

291,"So I just received news that I'm currently already in the hole for vacation time for this year when I should be getting three weeks.  It appears that my previous manager wasn't submitting my vacation forms and I was getting paid my regular salary for those vacation days.  This wouldn't have been too much of an issue except that during the last quarter of the year, we were told that we had to use up all remaining vacation time before the end of the year.  I have worked for the company for almost 5 years and over the course of the previous 3 managers, had never gotten a reply when asking how much vacation time I had left, so I really didn't have any idea when it came time to use up my time during this last quarter.  I sent two emails over the course of the last year asking how much I had left and those were finally answered, the first one said 11 days in October, the second said 4 days left(around the end of November).  I had no plans for vacation, so I just took a day off per week to use up the days I had left.  I only took those days because payroll had told me that I had them and had to use them.  So now that they figured out that my previous manager didn't submit the forms properly, they've wiped out my vacation for not only this entire year, but about a third of my vacation next year too.  

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I should also be responsible for keeping track of my vacation time, but I didn't really think about it too much over the course of the first few years and never got an answer on how much I actually had until recently.  Any suggestions at all of what recourse I might have, if any?  This is in Canada by the way.  I have submitted an email with the screenshots of the other emails where I asked about my remaining vacation, but I don't have high hopes that this will accomplish much.",12Feb2019,1

293,"(Sorry for mobile formatting) 

I (F22) recently moved out of home for the first time and moved to the city for university. 
I’ve moved into a flat with 3 people I don’t know and I’m in a city I don’t know. 
My problem is that my flatmates stay in their rooms most of the day and since uni starts in a week, I’m no longer working. I have no one to talk to, nothing to do and I feel like I’m living alone. 
I miss my family more than words can express and I’m so used to being around noise and other people 24/7 and now it’s the complete opposite.
I’ve always wanted to live alone but now that I essentially do, I absolutely hate it. I can’t drive, I’m a broke student, my few friends in the city are at work during the day, I’m bored out of my mind.
How can I make this place feel more like home and get over my homesickness? What’s something I can do in this house so I’m not pulling my hair out from boredom? 
I hope I’ll be fine when classes start because then I can make some friends but until then, I feel like I’m in prison and desperately want to pull out of uni and move back home. Please help.",12Feb2019,1

297,"I think it might be possible my literature teacher/year coordinator might me targeting me.

I’m autistic, along with having a long list of mental illnesses that I don’t really want to get into right now. I’ve been mute for close to four years now as well. I dropped out of high school previously due to bullying from students and teachers, but returned this year in order to eventually go to uni. My literature teacher is also my year coordinator.

As I was enrolling, I disclosed being autistic and mentally ill and it went fine. Then the first day came around and I realised that she hadn’t told any of my teachers that I’m mute. I’m pretty sure that when a student with a disability will have some issues in a learning environment, the year coordinator would make sure that they were aware of this but none of my teachers except her knew about it.

I thought maybe it was just an oversight, but then we got to today’s class.

So in Victoria at least the curriculum is set by the teachers themselves so long as it falls within the VCAA guidelines for that particular subject. We started reading short stories from Cate Kennedy’s Dark Roots, one of which is called Cold Snap.

It’s maybe about environmental destruction and human greed? But the surface level story is very… Vile, I guess. It’s about an autistic rural boy who kills rabbits to sell in order to save up money to buy a bike, that ends with him murdering a woman.

I am not the only autistic person in my class, and she previously taught one of the others. I honestly can’t imagine someone reading this story and not thinking ‘huh, maybe making a story about an animal murdering autistic child murdering a woman might not only upset my autistic students, but also might reinforce some really bad stereotypes about mentally ill people’.

The teacher was reading out the story, so I couldn’t just stop reading. I decided to pack my things up and leave as soon as I realised where the story was going. But I only managed to get out of my seat when we were supposed to be analysing the text as a class. One guy called the kid a psycho as I was walking to the door, and the teacher decided in that moment to call out and apologise. “Sorry for upsetting you”.

You do not fucking call out to a student in that situation, it does nothing but puts a target on their back.

Thinking back, the way she spoke to me in general felt… Patronising? Like she was always talking to a five year old instead of an adult. I didn’t really pick up on it because that’s just how my brain works.

I’m home now, but I feel really sick. It might be my paranoia talking, but it all feels like it’s purposeful harassment. The whole experience put me in a very bad place emotionally and I’m contemplating going to the hospital. I spent the entire commute home imagining ways to end it all. I’m just so fucking tired of teachers pulling this shit, and that I’ll never really be able to function is a school environment without this happening.

Is this possibly targeted harassment or just a teacher being really tone deaf?

I’m close friends with about half of the people in the group, but the guy (M 26) who agreed to hold all the money is just an acquaintance of mine. When I told him I won he originally told me he couldn’t get me the money right away because someone stole it from him, then that someone scammed his debit card through air b&amp;b. He told me he’d have it to me in a week. This was five weeks ago. 

I’ve texted him every week for the last 6 weeks just saying stuff like “hey man what’s the story this time?” And he keeps coming up with excuses like he “lost his job” or he was “sick” and couldn’t go to work (at his new job apparently?) or he was waiting for a check that his boss couldn’t get to him. Then he keeps leading me on saying “sometime this week” or “I’m a stand up guy, I’ll get you the money soon”.  

I’ve been pretty aggressive with him telling him I’m tired of dealing with his bullshit and to get me my fucking money but that hasn't gotten me anywhere.  I've even told him that if he can't handle it right now just let me know *when* he can give me the money instead of just stringing me along.  He just keeps saying ""this week"" or ""by the end of the week"".

I know he spent the money and that his excuses are a bunch of bullshit, which irritates me even more because he virtually stole $50 from everyone who bought in. 

How do I go about this? Do I just continuously bother him until he pays up? He hasn’t responded to my last text and phone call. One of my friends must know where he works or where I can find him. Would it be weird for me to show up and confront him face to face?  I feel helpless and so frustrated. I’m a college student and $500 bucks was *supposed* to pay for my text books at the beginning of the semester.. obviously I didn’t have it then but I could definitely use it now.",12Feb2019,1
299,"If these looks messy it's because I'm on the app and English isn't my first language, so sorry in advance for any mistake. Also, long post, so bare with me. 

In the last couple of months I've gone to three dates with these guy, in the last one we ate together and basically spended the whole afternoon with each other until he had to go home at 12 PM. We also did a lot of talking. 

Things seemed to be going right but just the day after of our last encounter he's been talking less and less to me. All the time it's me who carries the weight of the conversation, he barely says a thing. And he hasn't responded me since yesterday (more or less 14 hours ago).

Now, he told me he wasn't sure if he wanted a relationship right now, and told me a couple of times that if I wanted to talk to other guys or see them he would understand. I see nothing wrong with that but it isn't my cup of tea, if I'm seeing someone (even if it's not that serious) I'm not comfortable going out with someone else.  When I explained he said he felt the same way, but just wanted to make sure that if I wanted to do it, it was okey with him.

Since his last relationship wasn't good I didn't want him to feel pressured so I tried to give him some space. I really like the guy and I really wanted to see where things were headed... now I'm unsure.

I see him as an actual great guy, he's always there for his friends and I've told him things I don't usually tell until I feel comfortable with the person I'm talking with. He also told me certain things of his childhood and teenage years that are pretty personal. This made me view him as a very mature person and someone to trust, despite everything bad that happened to him he still cares about the others.

He even tries to help his ex (the one of the bad relationship), something bad happened to her. She is also trying to win him back, but he assured me that he doesn't want anything with her... but in the last photo he uploaded to Instagram she commented ""You make me fall in love"", he didn't answered but liked the comment. I honestly don't know what to think anymore.

A fourth date almost took place but I asked him last minute so in the end he couldn't ditch the plans he already made, he said he was sad not to be able to see me. But that was it. Since that day he only mentioned one thing about going out, we where talking about a game and said ""when we see each other again I'll explain it to you"". I even gathered the courage (I'm very self conscious about this things and like I said I was trying not to be pushy) to tell him I really wanted to see him again, his only response to that was a sad emoji face.

During this time I've tried to see if anything was wrong in subtle ways, and also ended up asking him directly. I told him that he seemed really quiet lately and asked if everything was okay, he said he was only feeling tired from work and also doing an on line event in a video-game with his friends. I responded that I was glad and ""sorry if I'm bothering you"", he said I would never.

Sometimes it seems he really enjoys talking to me and cares, others he just leaves my messages on read.

I've told him about my abusive ex, about the ex that treated me like I was unable to do things on my own, about a guy that I went to three dates with and then stopped talking to me... just like he is doing now. Maybe I'm cursed, maybe the problem is me and I fail to see what I do wrong.

Right now I'm feeling hurt, pathetic and disappointed. I thought that he ever decided not to go out with me again he would be honest.

Maybe he is waiting to the right moment to tell me, or maybe I'm seeing things out of proportion. A part of me wants to confront him, other part doesn't want go fuck things up more. I feel lost, what should I do? ",12Feb2019,1

302,"

I met up with a group of school friends I hadn't seen for a year for one of their Birthdays and we went for a nice dinner and went bar hopping. Afterwards we stayed at a friends place and because there was no more space on the floor three of us sat on the lounge chatting and eventually got too tired and fell asleep. One of my closest friends in the group, who's gay, rested his head on my shoulder and I sat between him and another male friend who I get on with but don't know as well.


A little while after, he moved over closer to me until my head was almost on his shoulder. I was so tired I didn't really think anything of it and went to sleep. When I woke up a few hours later I noticed he had his head rested on mine and his feet against mine. He also kept putting his hand on my knee, put it against my hand and dragged it off and moved up closer on the top of my thigh, rubbing his thumb against it or grazing it with his fingertips (never had someone do that). He kept periodically doing it, putting his hand there and onto his lap or against my arm then back again. But stopped when friends walked through.


He also, which surprised me, stroked my hair three times on two seperate occasions and moved some hair off of my face. As I've never had anyone do it to me before and since he isn't close to me it felt a bit weird and took me by surprise. I dont know whether he thought I was awake or not, at one point he mumbled something and then asked if I was alright.

I was a bit in shock as this guy hasn't really showed any interest in me in the past except invited me out to go swimming at a national park, helping me over rocks and buying my lunch, and to a friend's place. He didn't really show much interest in me on the night and we didn't really talk except when we got back and were sitting on the lounge. When I met him at the train station he asked me a few things but it felt awkward from my point and like he was just biding time with me to wait until the others arrived. Although that could be my anxiety making me think that.


I didn't stop him as I sort of like him too as he is nice, polite (always offering to help do things and thanking people) and good looking but thought he wasn't too fussed on me as a person or sick of me. I would've loved to have hooked up with him that night, so maybe it is mostly physical on my part? I was taken aback to see him touch me in that way as he's never seemed the type to do that kind of thing.


This was about 5-6 hours after our last drink so idk about alcohol...


Anyway, do you think he likes me/has feelings for me or was just bored, trapped under me and does this give me grounds to pursue him? Does it sound like he is interested?


TL;DR: guy friend who hasn't indicated a lot of interest in the past started touching me while sleeping on his shoulder after a night out",12Feb2019,1
303,"Hello there,

this is my first time using advice and reddit. I have to give u a lot of background infos, sorry for the huge text.

Me \[M,25\] and my GF \[F,22\] are in a relationship for about 6 months now. The relationship is perfect, we are seeing eachother everyday, we almost live together (she moved to my flat by 70%, she was living in a shared appartment before). The relationship is truly wonderful. I am almost done with my masters degree in engineering.

She wants to start training in midwifery so she applied in various citys all over the country because its not so easy to get an place. We agreed that we will find a city where gets a training place, where I can find a job and where we both are happy. we planned to find a nice flat together, get two kittens and stuff... you get the point.

Right now my problem is that I am scared to leave all my live, my family, my friends, my job (I am working full time and studying the masters degree on the weekends) behind to follow her into a new city. I wanted to move regardless of her to another city after my masters but now since I met her its totally clear for me to move with her. But what if she only gets to pick a city which I really dont want to go?

  
I am really really good with her parents and her parents really really like me, they're truly happy that I want to move with her since I am a little bit older, earing a lot of money and yea.. she isnt alone then.

&amp;#x200B;

The relationship is totally worth it but I am a little bit scared to lose my independency as a man and become unattractive to her by leaving my whole life behind me. But there is no other way to keep this relationship, living in two different citys wouldnt workout for us since we really need to see each other every 1 or 2 days.

Maybe some of you can give me advice,

thanks fam xx",12Feb2019,1
304,"Exactly how it sounds. My dad told me that he is planning on leaving his family (without their knowledge) in April. My step mom is currently planning his two week “vacation” to S.A. He said that if he likes it there, he will not come back home, but if he doesn’t he’ll come back and no one will ever know. Except I know. Every single day I get more and more depressed and anxious.

316,"So three days ago, I was browsing though pornhub and stumbled upon a video in which the girl looked shockingly similar to a student of mine. (Just for reference, I am a senior in undergrad and a TA for the lab that she is in). I thought nothing of it at first but decided to make sure by looking up her profile on Facebook. Long story short, she had the exact same necklace in her profile picture as the one she was wearing in the video and lived in the exact state and city that pornhub user was from. So now for the advice part: how do I let her know that she is in a porno without getting in trouble? 

There is a possibility that she purposely posted it or asked her boyfriend to do so (for the money perhaps?) but considering her career aspirations and how intelligent she is, I can’t imagine she would do something so dumb and jeopardize her future for a thousand dollars or two. I thought about just letting it go but I literally cannot stop thinking about how her life can be ruined if someone else recognized her and did not think too kindly of her. Another thing is stopping me from letting it go is that she has a boyfriend (which, most likely, is the guy in the video) and it is killing me that he posted that video, most likely without her knowledge, and is so cool with ruining her life (since her face is clearly in the video) while he gets away with never revealing his identity (like how fucked up do you have to be to do that to someone) 

Although that’s the case, actions have consequences and I feel that if I do tell her, I’ll be ruining a relationship and maybe her trust and self-confidence as well. Perhaps, in this case, ignorance is bliss and the video might never come back to haunt her. At the end of the day I just want to do right by this girl and at least have her be aware that this video is out there with her face clearly in it, while at the same time not risking my job by meddling in her personal affairs.

322,"I’m sorry if this is way too long. You don’t have to read it all but I REALLY needed to do this and get it all of my chest somehow.

A day and a half ago my girlfriend and I were driving home from visiting her parents. We had her 2 little dogs in the car with us. The weather had apparently gotten pretty bad but ended up clearing up. We were driving on the interstate when we hit a patch of black ice. We spun around and crossed the median into oncoming traffic. We struck another car head on sending it into the ditch. Everyone including the dogs miraculously made it out alive with minor injuries. It was by far the scariest thing to ever happen to me.
I was asleep in the passenger seat when we started spinning out and I’ve never woken up to a scarier sight. As we were sliding all I remember was hearing the panic in my girlfriend’s voice. I grabbed on to whatever I could and hoped for the best. Next thing I see is another car right in front of our face. I remember hearing a HUGE bang of course from our cars impacting, I hear one of the dogs screaming and my girlfriend is crying because she’s terrified. First thing that came to mind was I needed to get out of the car so I opened the door and one of the other dogs sprints down the interstate because she’s so scared. In hindsight this was stupid but all I could think about was getting that poor dog back. I ended up getting her back after what seemed like forever.
I got back to the accident and we all got transported to the hospital to get evaluated.

Finally after hours of testing at the hospital we’re home. For some reason I thought I’d just be able to put this behind me and move on, be happy I’m alive. Well, I can’t. I sit here and think about all the things I saw and heard and it makes me tear up and I get anxious thinking about it. Waking up to my girlfriend in a panic as were spinning around on the interstate, impacting the other car and how loud it was, I remember the smell of getting out and seeing the front of the car completely destroyed, the horrible yelling of her little dog, seeing her other dog running down an active interstate, knowing how bad my girlfriend feels now. It’s all a lot to take in. I feel like this is fairly normal after such a tragic accident so I don’t know if I should go talk to a therapist about it yet or not. It’s causing me to lose sleep because I lay in bed and start thinking about it so I get on reddit or turn the tv on to distract myself. I can’t help but think I shouldn’t be alive. I keep thinking about all the “what ifs”, you know, what if it had been a bigger truck or even a semi we went head-on with, what if we had flipped over and onto the other side and then got struck by another vehicle,  what if someone had gotten seriously hurt or if the dogs got flung out the windows.

323,"Here’s the situation: I’m 16 in a country I’m still not too familiar with (my parents are expats and I’m schooling here until grade 12) and I just argued with my mom over something really stupid. I packed my stuff and left the house (my dad’s place — I have my own place which is like an hour’s drive away), and I’m at the ground floor of my apartment building to wait the rain out.

It’s 6:12pm and my dad is gonna come home from work soon. The original plan for today was for me to wake up in the morning and leave with my mom by car for my house, then for my mom to drive back in time to fetch my dad from work and go back to my dad’s. But the thing is, my dumb ass woke up at 3pm because I stayed up really, really late last night drawing and doing other hugely unnecessary things. So I was feeling extremely guilty for wasting this entire day and I guess I lashed out at my mom because of this issue and that. I left on my own to protect my pride and wallow in my own assholery.

325,"My Grandmother came extremely close to killing me on two separate occasions when I was 3. I’m not really sure how I’m alive but that is aside from what I’m trying to ask here. First some context:

Some of my relatives and I consider her to have suffered from FDIA, which is formerly and better known as *Munchausen syndrome by proxy.* It is when a caregiver makes a vulnerable person appear to be sick for some kind of personal gain. 

She often told my parents and other people that I was diabetic and that I needed to see a doctor. She would prick my finger (she was Type 2 Diabetic) and tell me I was “low”. Then she would make me eat her sugar pills and prick me again. Then she would flip out about how high my sugar was and tell my mom that I had diabetes. Fortunately my mother is a RN and never believed her. Anyway, on to the actual basis for the question. 

When I was 3 years old, I had the chicken pox and I was left in her care (which I am beyond pissed about). 

She gave me baby aspirin and put me to sleep. 

I could have developed Reye’s syndrome, I could have severe brain damage, or I could be dead. 

She knew I could have died, because of a little girl that lived next door to them who was in kindergarten with my father. She died of Reye’s syndrome when she was given baby aspirin for the chicken pox. She was 5. 

My mother asserts that my grandmother was too stupid to know what she was doing. I cannot help but feel like I am being gaslit by her. 

**Did she try to kill me?** 

I am too brainwashed to know. 

On a second occasion, I somewhat remember what happened due to my incredible memory. 

Once again when I was 3, I was left in her care when I was sick. I was supposed to take cough syrup, which you all know for a 3 year old is a very small amount. My grandmother had 4 children and she should have known what she was doing. She was supposed to give me around 2 teaspoonfuls of cough syrup. She gave me 2 cups. 

**Two. Fucking. Cups.**

She handed it to me in a measuring cup and told me to drink it up. I remember her saying, “that’s a good girl” and “drink it up” repeatedly as I drank it. I began to feel light headed and dizzy. I finished the first cup and she gave me the second. 

I took a few sips and I said, “Gramma, I feel woozy.” I couldn’t finish it. She didn’t make me drink the rest. I remember feeling so far gone and passing out on the couch. 

Obviously my parents freaked out both times she almost killed me, but they continued to put me in her care. I was not told about any of this until I was 20, by my aunt who was also harmed by her. I am a sufferer of a litany of mental illnesses, and a survivor of plenty of abuse and trauma, mainly at the hands of my father (feel free to peep my other posts for additional context). My mother was complicit in all of it. 

My main question is this: 

**What did she do to me? Was it neglect or abuse? Or something more sinister, like attempted manslaughter? Or am I way off, and it is something completely different?** 

I am up at 3 a.m. trying to make sense of this. I am sorry if this is a dumb question, but I have been gaslit too much to really know what is going on. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

TL;DR: If a grandmother comes close to fatally overdosing and killing her 3 year old granddaughter twice, what is that called?

335,"I actually think I am cursed and even writing this it sounds stupid, if anyone else were to claim the same thing I would immediately assume they're exaggerating or lying or something, I guess just like seeing a ghost, you don't really believe it till its happened to you (not that I have seen a ghost)
So here goes...... 

Everything I buy breaks (pretty much) lights will blow bedsheets will be ripped before being removed from packages, even salsa dip will be moldy as soon as I open it, shoes fall appart day 1, you name it It has broken on me within the first week. 

But it's not just that. People get mad at me for no reason or friends who I have known and see multiple times a week will forget I exist and when I call them they say my number wasn't in their phone (this part could simply be explained that I'm an asshole) but they seem genuinely sorry and sometimes will contact my girlfriend in order to get my number, which normally wouldn't be too strange but it's happened multiple times with various friends who don't even know each other... I can't find any correlation. 


Another issue could be explained as just unlucky and I'm not sure if it's related but I'll put it in here anyway. My levels on unluck are unrivaled and people constantly comment on it. I will be shat on at least 3 times a month by birds (you my not think that's a big deal. But I am a gamer / software engineer, I never leave the house unless it's to walk the 10 steps to the car, which is nowhere near trees or to get the mail) I also never win anything, except one time, when I was telling a friend ""I'm just unlucky"" after a game of poker he said he would give me the winnings if I could roll &gt; 25 in 6 dice rolls (with no risk to me I accepted but I told him"" there is no way I would win and I'll likely roll a 6 total "") however I rolled 36, which is the best possible outcome. This actually was amazing for me, not because I won $30 in a home poker game but because I found a way I may be able to exploit this ""curse"",the trick is, to doubt any luck will come my way to assume everything I buy will come broken and everyone will hate me and forget me, 

It's a shit way to live, but I've lived it this way for 8 years, hanging my head and being a totally negative as possible. Sometimes I will forget and become happy or sometimes start having a really good time, but the consequences are more than I can bear, last really good day I had my fish died, people don't care for fish but he has been with me since not long after I adopted the new lifestyle so he was about 7 and we were both trapped, but trapped together, he is free now and hopefully in a better place than a 400 liter prison in my house. 

I don't know if there is anyone who has heard of this kind of ""curse"" or maybe I am crazy but I don't know who else I can tell, certainly not friends and family. Any help of appreciated 

There is so much more I could write about this and I'm just scraping the tip of the iceberg but I think the gist is enough for now.

341,"I am a 19 year old boy from Spain and I truly despise my birth name, I can't even stand hearing it. And I am looking to get everyone to call me by my new name.

I will explain why in a Great Wall of China-like text. Behold for it is a long ride.

I was relentlessly bullied for almost all of my school years (from age 5 to 14) and I developed severe depression and anxiety problems. I first tried to get help from adults to stop the bullying, but since it was mainly psychological bullying nobody did anything. In fact, I was ridiculed and told to ""man up"". Psychological bullying, despite being extremly harmful to a child's developing brain, is usually ignored. 

But even worse, that made me distrust adults and it made me suffer in silence. From then on, I didn't ask anyone for advice.

My self esteem was obliterated and I was reduced to a empty husk of a person incapable of doing anything but hope for better times to come. Better times did not come and I became increasingly suicidal. 

When I was 14 I decided to take matters into my own hands and used violence to stop the bullying.  I was suspended from the school but it was worth it.

When I started rebuilding myself I found out that there was nothing left. I was just a bunch of ruins. I truly despised every inch of myself, both psychologically and physically. It was easy to guess why did I have no friends. I hated myself and everyone hated me. 

But then, I crashed down. One spring day of 2014, at 4:30 in the morning, after a night of anxiety-induced insomia, I abandoned my old identity and became someone else as a fresh start. I felt like another soul, with another name entered me. I wasn't religious at all, but since then I believe in something higher, and that entity sent Max to save me, to give me a second opportunity at life.

It just came to me, like a revelation. I didn't even pick his name, it just was named like that. He is Max. I hated my old identity so much that becoming as different as possible was a way of ""killing myself"" (the old identity). These strange mental gymnastics brought me from the edge of the bridge to a self-improvement mindset. I just wanted to become Max. I wasn't easy, I still had severe self-esteem troubles and developed anorexia nervosa. 
Since these symptoms are easily visible this got my parents attention and sent me to a psychologist.

From there on I started building an identity of who I wanted to be. I was given a blueprint; Max. I got back on track, seeked psychiatric help and improved myself.

For example; Whenever I was scared to make friends, I told myself: It's the old one who is telling that. Max wants to make friends. And I made friends. I remember monitoring my heartbeat in the subway with my phone before my first encounter with my new friends. 135 BPM. But I succeeded. 

Now 5 years have passed. I am in university and studying Chemical Engineering. I am still slightly afraid of people but now I have friends and I am happy. I love my sister and my cat. I have learned to appreciate the beauty in all the little things in our world. 

I have forgotten how my bullies faces look. I only know that their lives are bad and getting worse and I am happy to know that. I prevailed. 

Finally, I became Max. I changed so much psychologically and physically to the point of being barely unrecognisable from that broken boy.

However, only one thing has not changed: my name. Every time I am called or I hear it, I am transported back to these times. I become that empty hull for a little while and triggers many negative thoughts. Just hearing it makes my brain remember my bullies words and somehow ties them back to me, even if they were told to someone else (my old self)... 
This has become bad enough that I subsconciously plug my ears when I know my name is going to be called.

Now I am sure of who I am. I am Max. When I think who I am, Max comes up. 

I haven't told anyone to call me by that. This is because I was very afraid of rejection from the few friends I had. I thought that they could use that to bully me. Now I am sure I won't be  rejected for that. However, I am still a bit socially anxious and it's gonna be hard for me.

So please, I need your help. Knowing my situation, how should I tell everyone to call me by my new name? I have few social media, only an Instagram account with no content (although some of my friends follow me so we can share memes and cat pictures) so publishing it there might not be enought to get everyone to call me Max.

Please keep in mind I am still a bit shy so overly expressive methods are off limits.

And where I live (Spain) the only requirements for a legal name change is that you have to send proof that people call you by your new name, so problems are gone once I get them to call me as I want.

I also want to know what to tell them when I was why I want to change my name. I don't know how to tell them my story so they don't get overwhelmed.

TL;DR: Was relentlessly bullied and my ego broke down. I started fresh with a new identity. I have become a better person but whenever my birth name is said it triggers extremely negative thoughts from my old self. How should I get everyone to call me by my new name knowing I am still a bit socially anxious? 
And what should I tell them when they ask me why do I want to be called by a new name?

I am very grateful for any support you can give me.
With extreme sincerity, Max.

I don't really know how to phrase it, but how did you guys 'grow up' in life, and did life force you to?

Like, transitioning from a life of doing homework, playing video games to doing more serious university work for example, and studying something that will then be critical to a future job, and so on. 

I know that I need to 'grow up' , yet I don't know how it works. For example, I  love playing video games and I find that I have less and less time now to do it, yet I can't let go of it. 

Its scary thinking that your future life will for sure be nothing like the current life you live, but how do you get to that future. I don't see a clear path.

348,"OK this will seem pretty trivial compared to other stuff in this subreddit so I hope I am posting at the right place !

My roommates and I live in an appartment and we have bikes we use often, almost daily. But the locked bicycle storage room in the hallway is encumbered by unused bikes, with litteral dust on it ! and it's becoming more and more difficult to put our bikes. The elevator is pretty small and we live at the 4th.

So how would you do it ? Without doing something that could strike back to us.  
Our current strategy : my girlfriend put some nice (but slighty too passive agressive imo) notes in the hallway about the issue, we let our phone numbers in case people need help moving their bike on the balcony or on their basement (each appartment has a small basement storage). If nothing changes within 10 days, we will move the unused bikes ourselves in the common area of the basement. Not big so it will encumber this place instead. Of course we'll let the locks on these unused bikes (even if it will be tough to move these bikes with the locks still on !). I think it's a good strategy but I don't want it to backfire.

One other option would be to go door to door in the whole building (40ish appartments) but it will take so much time.

By the way the agency running the building's affairs is shitty so we could ask them to do something but best scenario : it would take 2 months. Worst scenario : they dont give a shit

In reality I'm a painfully below average person. I'm chronically depressed and paranoid and anxious and therapy has been unavailable or useless. I've even been on medication and it didn't work. Because of my mental health issues I can't seem to feel much joy and so I have no idea what I would like to do or what career I would want. I'm studying to become an English teacher, not because I love the subject or because I love to teach, but because it was the least worst option out of everything available for me and I'd be able to start my 'career' in fewer years than if I chose something else. In 6th form I made the mistake of choosing Sociology, I didn't learn from my mistake and then chose Communication Studies in university. I excelled at both and loved them, but they're not going to get me anywhere iin life and I didn't learn anything from them. They were the equivelant of an ethics class in high school where it's for dumb people who don't know anything about the world. And in reality, I loved the subjects and I loved studying and talking about society and morality and stuff, but then I realised that I do that on the internet every day, and that  I chose those subjects as an attempt to converse with others about said topics, because I was friendless. I am still friendless.

&amp;#x200B;

As for university organisations, it's almost a dead end with me. Yeah I'm making a half-hearted attempt to get above average marks to maybe qualify to study abroad, but that's about it. I don't see myself fitting into any groups, I'm not into sports, loads of the groups are very academic minded, because of complicated rules I can't take a beginner's foreign language course, and the rest are nothing spectacular. I sent an email to an environmental group just to have something, and they never replied.

&amp;#x200B;

My one friend used to be in the same situation as me, but she got proper and great therapy, and despite her anxiety she went on to attend a drama course and kept going even though she had 2 panic attacks, and has actually lived and has several exes. Meanwhile I haven't made a single friend in 6th form or university and have never dated, either because I don't feel the need to, or I'm too chicken, or both. My life is literally just lectures, going home to study in a house where my parents and brother fight all the time,  waiting to go out with the few friends I have and who probably don't care for me, and hoping my crush doesn't ghost me.

Please someone tell me what to do. I need someone to tell me who I should become because I don't know what I want to do and I can't even envision myself living till the next week. Even though my childhood was awful I miss the clear goals people had for me. I would pass primary school, then secondary school, then college, because that's what was normal and what was needed. And let's say I graduate as an English teacher, which will probably happen,, I'm still going to be friendless and unambitious. I don't think I could live myself if I stayed below average. I would like to do something with my life, help those who are disadvantaged, travel, write, but most days I just don't have the energy or the bravery and I'm only interested in graduating so I can keep making money so my life doesn't end up worse.

Firstly I’m 14 Female and am 5’8”-5’9” and I weigh 7 stone (sometimes 7 and a half) I don’t feel as if I can eat normally as I did before, I’ve felt like this for awhile  it’s like every food I see I HAVE to know the calories, if it’s too much calories then I refuse to eat it, if I don’t know the calories Ill eat nothing &amp; I can’t let anyone else cook for me as I fear they’re doing something to make me gain weight purposely.. it sucks because I walk round the shops and just look at all the food I could eat but it’s like voices are telling me “if you eat that you’re going to be fat”..  I used to go awhile in a day without eating and would feel so hungry I’d binge eat on whatever I could find.. which then lead to the next day I’d barely eat anything because I felt fat and it went on a cycle going over and over again.. I’ve stopped doing that I tend to force myself to sleep to prevent me from eating &amp; I’ve started drinking a lot of drinks to keep me fuller for longer (the drinks have 0-1 calories).

I feel as if I can’t tell my family for these reasons
1. My parents recently got divorced and, I know that my dad will blame it all on my mum saying things like “The reason she’s so skinny is because she’s depressed from doing homeschool!” When in reality if I was in a actual school I’d eat nothing at all because of pressure from others &amp; I know my dad would try to get me back into public school without my consent...
2. People would recommend therapy.. problem is my mum is a therapist but her therapy would bore me to death because it’s not like your typical therapy... (we also can’t afford for me to see a therapist)
3. I wouldn’t want to go to hospital I’ve never been able to stay in one for long amounts of time because they make me feel ill.
4. Id be judged by my whole family, it’d start a huge argument over who’s right and wrong and whatnot
5. I feel I cannot go back to how I used to eat because it scares me the thought of being fat (my mum is overweight and she constantly goes on and on about wanting to loose weight and it stresses me out knowing what if one day I ended up like her and not being able to loose weight because I’d be too lazy)

The bigger shock came to us when the teacher we took with outside of school said he knew our teacher and that they both attended a seminar where the new curriculum was explained to the teachers. After all he knew about it but decided to not tell us for some reason.

We tried confronting him about it but when we told him, he said he was going to tell us later. He apparently was too lazy to write some exams similar to the one showcased of the new curriculum. Our other teacher wasn't that lazy and printed us five books.

We finally decided to tell him that we think he is subpar and we think he should maybe print a book to help us a bit, then he said that there is only one exam model and there is now way to get other exam models. By then we new that he just didn't want to write other exams. 

So write now I am taking a class outside but I don't know if I should attend his class anymore. I got approval from the school to leave early and not get in trouble, my parents need some persuasion but I think I can, now my question is should I attend his class or is it a waste of time?",12Feb2019,1

367,"Hello, /r/Advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into too much detail, I'm a Central-European Citizen with a girlfriend from a neighboring country of mine. We found each other a couple years ago on tinder and we moved together into an apartment about 6 months ago. She's a wonderful girlfriend, but the problem is, she barley speaks the language of my country. However she is C2-Level fluent in English and her native language and I thought that would be enough in addition to her technical background with studying and freelancing web-design and programming. However, as it turns out, finding a job is not quite as straight forward as I had originally though. I myself make enough money to sustain us both, fairly easily, though it's not exactly a lavish lifestyle. However she is getting increasingly depressed about her lack of success with finding any work in her respective vocation. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is increasingly outing itself in periods where she is fairly unemotional or emotionally negatively inclined. Bad sleep, anxiety attacks and right out zoning out and ""not wanting to do anything"" for my lack of better understanding among other things happen fairly regularly. I am really worried about her psyche in general and how her self-esteem seems to deteriorate further with any rejection or unanswered resume sent out.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the psychological effects, because she only moved here, but never has had a job here and nor is she married (to me) she currently has no valid health insurance, which is a huge no-go for me that I want to solve ASAP. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure how to approach the problem. I am trying to push her into focusing on learning the language, so far as to paying for courses, but at the same time I don't want to force her to anything and she has previously shown some resistance towards fully committing to learning the language. To her defense that is mostly due to the fact that courses are expensive and she feels like she is taking advantage of me in that regard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if I am fairly vague here, but she is also a redditor and therefore I don't want to rouse too much suspicion.

And if you finds this, I'm very sorry, love, but I really want to help you and I hope you can forgive me...

&amp;#x200B;

What could or generally should do or focus on, to help her? I keep asking her if there is anything I can do, but her usual response is that there is nothing I can really do.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

369,"So basically I am frequently on Twitch, the platform where you can watch others play video games. There is this streamer that i really like and watch consistently. We've played games before in the past and I thought i was on good terms with them. However, I noticed all of a sudden that they unfriended me on a game. The problem is I don't know why exactly or what I did to cause this. It bothers me more than I would like to admit since I feel I'm part of the community and spend a good deal of time in the chat. I've thought to try and reach out to them and talk to them first hand about it. I know it seems petty but I just really want to know maybe so I don't do something that offends them in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the chat quite often so I feel I might need to get a life and occupy my time in another way for lack of a better way of saying it. I've also always felt this weird awkward dissonance between each other because my online persona doesnt necessarily match how I interact when I must talk to them real time and I feel I havent conveyed my true personality and I think this mismatch has caused anxiety for them in the past and thats why they would rather not have me pop up in their friends list. It's almost as if we can talk via chat but through speech theres always this dissonance.

Although I was born in Malaysia, my parents had thought how to speak English growing up more than Malay which can be really hard to understand. This has caused me to be confused during classes which doesn't give me the confidence to put in effort. Thus, my parents pulled me in for a talk. They discussed about my problems at school and what they're suggesting. They're offering me a spot in an IGCSE focused school which offers topics taught in English. The problem is they NEED me perform well because if I were to leave my public school and all this doesn't turn out well they simply wouldn't let me back in. Not only that, I would be exposed to a whole new environment and surroundings and people which I don't know what to expect. I could turn out where I either have lots of friends or none. This could cause me to obviously become down which could disrupt my studying. But on the bright side, the method they would teach me could significantly increase my understanding giving me the confidence to do better. I could get straight As, great friends, better social skills, one helluva education which can land me a great job. But the most important thing is if whether I put in my effort or not. That's all that matters after all. My family aren't the richest so it would be a huge waste of money if I don't do good and simply don't understand. So what do you have to suggest?

I let my manager know I was struggling and her response was “it’s still early in the semester, things will even out.” I don’t think she meant it rudely, I genuinely think she was being supportive. But now I feel like I can’t cut my hours since I am the only one working full time atm and she made me feel like I almost have to work full time based off of what she said. I like my job but I don’t think I have been this stressed out in my life and I only have it to have spending money to go out on weekends. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask: how do I leave my job without sounding like a dick? I hate letting people down and I feel like they rely on me quite a bit, I just can’t work and be in school at the same time right now. What is a professional way to write my resignation?",12Feb2019,1
407,"Hey guys, I’m in a dilemma. I’m at 25 year old female who is looking into purchasing a condo in the Chicagoland areas. I always joked around with my parents that I should go for it because my money would be going towards something I owe and not to someone for renting.

Anyways, my mom started sending me links to places I can purchase. She said that she will take out a second mortgage on the house for me to purchase a condo. But I don’t know how I feel about that. As helpful as that probably would be. I feel uncomfortable putting my mom through that. I told her that but she doesn’t care about that and wants to go through with it. 

Has anyone experienced this with their parents? How should I move forward?

Thanks. ",12Feb2019,1
408,"I'm watching a video of Marco Pierre White who I think is an admirable person, talented and undoubtedly successful in more than one aspect of life.  At the beginning of it he says this: 

&gt;My father told me how to work hard, he taught me how to be disciplined, he taught me how to be punctual, he taught me how to never throw in the towel, and if I threw in the towel he told me to pick it up.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately I possess none of these traits but it's clear where they'll get you if you do.

This is probably a shit question due to the fact the range of possible responses is so broad and I'm not asking a very particular question, but how do I become that kind of person?  Is it even possible to develop them at 19 after having lived so many years as lazy, unwilling and unmotivated?

409,"My University is almost an hour drive away from my house. Since 90% attendance is mandatory, i have to drive or take the bus there almost everyday which becomes really exhausting. After i come back home, i don't have energy to do anything, can't go to the gym, no motivation to study and because of this I've really fallen behind on my studies. The university does have dorms so if i shift there, i save a lot of time of traveling so much everyday and will actually have energy to do other stuff. But I'm really nervous about shifting because I've never lived by myself, always lived with my family. I don't know if I'll be able to handle it. I've also heard that the dorm washrooms are not really clean and the food we get is not that great which are a little bit of concern to me. So i don't know what to do, should i just shift to the dorms or should i make myself study somehow after coming home",12Feb2019,1
410,"TLDR; I am not sure how to keep meaningful conversations, how to react to other people, what personality I am, I can be quiet but I always think a lot, I don't really have long text/whatsapp conversations (or how to keep them going), and most of the time I have to initiate conversation or walk towards people instead of them to me. 

Last weekend I had a really fun event with a lot of new people. But I don't feel like I can socially connect with some people, especially girls. It started of good, and I talked to people but in the long term I'm having a lot of trouble with conversations. I know the trick of asking people more about themselves and I don't even do it in an obvious way usually but that also eventually stops.    

Whenever somebody tells me anything, I am not sure how I should react and it often results in a sort of half laugh because I mostly don't really care. I know I'm an introvert but I see other guys making girls laugh so easily and having that attraction which I don't have.   

A lot of people have a certain way they are in terms of personality. Like they react in certain ways, talk in certain ways and take actions in certain ways. Personally, I feel like I am just a mix of all sorts of personalities and I haven't figured out what I am myself yet and I don't know if or how I will. It feels like I'm kind of faking everything even though I'm not the kind of person that would do that.   

I also know people have these long Whatsapp conversations but I basically never really have them, with anyone, except for like a real close friend that I have known for a really long time and I know he doesn't have too many friends, and these are usually philosophical conversations.   

Another thing is that someone once said that I'm quiet (don't worry about the context), and I felt kinda offended because I didn't really feel like I was quiet at all. When I thought more about it, I realized that I actually can be pretty quiet but that I'm usually thinking a lot so it doesn't feel like I am quiet. 

Lastly, for example within my group of friends, people always seem to come to eachother to talk about things that happened but people don't really come to me. I most of the time have to initiate the conversation. I heard from two friends that I girls thought I was cute but I am a bit awkard, I always end up in situations where I am not sure what to do, for example greeting people that I kind of know but not really.",12Feb2019,1

414,"Last year I fell out with my cousin. We were like best friends for the past few years and lived together for a while. We ran into some complications when he decided to move out of our rental before the lease was up, leaving us both having to pay rent until the place was re-leased.   
After moving out, I messaged him initially to let him know how much money he owed me for cleaning etc. (which I did by myself), to which I never got a response. Then I found out his sister was pregnant, so I messaged him to say congrats on becoming an uncle... No response. I messaged him to ask if we could meet up for a chat because there had obviously been some kind of misunderstanding... No response. I also got engaged a few months ago and never heard anything from him.   
By this point I thought ""well I've done as much as I can do, time to cut ties"". Then the other day I got a Facebook invitation from him to a party at his place.   
A part of me thinks he already had his chance and the ties are cut, but another part of me wonders whether this is his feeble attempt to extend an olive branch and should I just swallow my pride and go to the party? It could be an opportunity to repair the damage, or it could just be a situation which will make me feel more shit about the situation than I already do. Thoughts?  


TLDR: I fell out with my cousin and despite repeated attempts to reconnect, he ignored my messages. The other day he sent me a party invite. Should I go to the party as a final attempt to reconnect, or is it too little too late?",12Feb2019,1
415,"In 2015, I ended a 5-year relationship with an emotionally abusive man. My ex's friend provided a lot of support after the breakup and we ended up falling in love. My ex started spreading rumors that the friend had encouraged me to leave him so he could have me for himself and also that I had been cheating on him while we were together. (This is funny because he cheated on me consistently for the five years, but I never did). 

My ex went on a rampage, spreading vicious and nasty rumors about the friend and has really damaged his reputation. We live in a fairly small town so you know how that can be. 

The problem is that the friend feels like he can never be with me because to do so would be proving my ex right and publicly saying that the rumors were right all along. He says he can't bring himself to allow that to happen to his reputation. He is slowly repairing friendships and building back business and professional relationships. 

I have never been able to move on. It hurts so much to know that he has feelings for me and that he knows that we would be great together, but he just can't get over his hangups. I am perfect for him, but it's still not enough. I have no interest in dating because I don't think anyone would ever compare to him. I find myself holding out waiting for him to change his mind even though I know how stupid that is. I've tried dating, I've tried casual sex, I've spent a lot of time alone. I've been to therapy. I've focused on personal development - learning new skills, exercising, journaling, meditating, eating well, taking care of myself. I've made new platonic friends and strengthened existing friendships. I got a dog. I have a successful career. I really have a lot going for me but I just feel so trapped by my love for this man. I have gone no contact with him for months at a time. Sometimes he breaks it, sometimes I do. Most times I'm the one that breaks it because he respects my decision to be away from him and doesn't try to reach out, even though he may want to. 

I genuinely feel like he is ""the one"" and I will never be able to find anyone who is more suitable for me. He has tried dating and seeing other people too but nothing has worked out for him either. I desperately wish that we could just be together. 

How can I move past this? If it matters, I am 25F and he is 32M.",12Feb2019,1

I don't know if this is caused by my (I guess a bit abusibe) ex bf who would always tell me that I have no interests, no ambition in life and etc.

417,"Hey ! So I saw posts about helping people out and giving them advice and I’d like to shoot my shot in that context. So, there’s this guy that I like, I’ve known him for two years and he study’s abroad. 4 months ago he hit me up while he was drunk af. He texted me on snap and was like, “hey missy I haven’t talked to u in so long. Wanna chat on FaceTime?” So I said sure why not. He called and we chat for like 7 hrs that night. And tbh after that I honestly thought we stop talking and go back to how it was. But nope that’s not what happened. From there on out he would call me everyday for almost a month, he never missed a day. After that month, he would call me every other day and our calls ranged from 4 hrs to 6 hrs. We would talk about really personal stuff and all that spazz. We got to know each other more and more and one time he said “I like talking to u because you’re not dramatic like most individuals” so I was like “is that a backhanded compliment” and he was like “no you’re just really chill” and oof that made me happy af. Things were going great not gonna lie but then 3 weeks ago he started to distance himself from me. Mind u I told him that I had a little crush on him a little over 2 weeks a half and he said “that’s okay. Let’s talk tonight. xx” we never talked that night and when we eventually did talk he never brought it up and when I thought about bringing it up my friends told me not to because it’ll make it seem like I’m desperate. But anyways back to what I was saying, 3 weeks ago he started acting weird and indifferent. He would be like “we need to talk soon, we haven’t talked in so long” and I’m like yeah we def need to. But he would always say soon, never an exact day not until I posted a pic of me on insta and he liked it and commented, “someone’s looking fly 👀😅” and I replied “learnt it from the best,” this then prompted him to DM me on insta and said “I was originally gonna say this but I thought it would be too cheesy” so I was like nah that sounds more like a complicated compliment. So then blah blah blah he says let’s have a chat tonight when u come back from school and to let him know when I’m home. So as soon as I was out of school, I let him know and guess what, he didn’t reply until like 7 hrs later. He apologized and said “ sorry was at a friends house, music was loud and we were eating” so I said it’s okay no worries and left me on read. So I was like ouch. So then two days pass and we don’t talk and oof u have no idea, how much I missed him. So I swallowed my pride and hit him up, I said “hey u down for a quick call” and he said “later on in the night” and I was like okay but to lemme know and he never did all he did was leave me on read. He’s not a fuck boy tbh, and I can see that but he did tell me when he used to go to clubs he would make out and shit but he would never take the girl home. So I asked him if he was a virgin he said yes because he’s saving himself for someone he actually wants to settle down. He doesn’t like meaningless sex, fun yeah, but not sex that doesn’t involve someone he loves. What should I do? Should I leave him be and wait and see what happens... or idk. What do U think is the best course of action here?",12Feb2019,1

420,"I'm a 33 year old woman. I've been working the same retail job for 11 years and as a generally depressed introvert, it's becoming harder to do my job every day. It's like I haven't rested in years, and the hours and days off of work aren't even enough to recharge me. I hate going to work and once I'm there I spend all my downtime desperately applying to other jobs. I paid for someone to rewrite my cringey resume because I was certain I looked like a moron throwing the one I'd written at them.

The problem is that I have no higher education, and I only have retain experience. Circumstance forced me to focus on work before I even started this job and I'm only just now in a place where I could maybe go back to school. Also, I can't just take any job. Right now, I'm living with my boyfriend but I can't take a lesser paying job on the off chance that we might break up then I won't be able to afford to live on my own. (I know, I know. I just can't stand not being prepared, even if I don't think we'll break up) But literally everything is less than what I make now. After 11 years with this company, I make $17.50 an hour as a sales specialist (FYI I'm non-materialistic introvert. I suck at sales. If you don't want it I'm not gonna convince you to buy it. I don't care. It's just stuff).

I've been looking into taking administrative assistant courses or maybe go into medical coding/billing, and have found some online courses that I could complete quickly so I can make a change as fast as possible. 

You might think that I have things figured out, like, yay! Okay! She's gonna go off and get educated and find a job that doesn't make her wanna die! It's all finished! But it isn't. I'm so cautious that I can't make myself bite the fucking bullet. I haven't done anything with my brain in years. What if I'm too stupid for college courses?

Fuck. I don't even know what advice I'm asking for. I just feel trapped and lonely and my boyfriend is sick of hearing about how much I hate work. I don't want to be in school forever, right now 2-4 years sounds way too long, I can't -be- in this stupid store for another 2 years, I'll snap. 

So. Give me college tips? I guess? Or ideas for fields to go into that won't take forever, but also aren't sales or retail oriented.

421,"Whenever that i am unable to get the girl who i love, i start feeling like a Fascist or Communist. I would try to justify my hate, anger, desperation and revenge fantasies using these ideologies. For example i have had crushes on some celebrity girls and currently i am really obsessed with Miley Cyrus. I think about her every moment of every day and i keep commenting on her social media and i'm trying to get her phone number to talk to her. I have promised myself that i would do whatever it takes to get to her. I would use any tool and method available to get her. Even if it means that i have to go right where she is and say all of these to her face to face and then ask her for hanging out with me and hug and kiss her as i wish. I would do anything to turn my dreams to reality. These thoughts are in my mind and i try to attach them to theoretical and practical aspects of far right and far left ideologies. Whenever i look at Miley or listen to her music, i feel so sad for myself. I feel even more sad when i see her hugging and flirting with other guys. It makes me so jealous and hateful at some points. I feel that i am being deprived of my rights and being humiliated. In this situation the only thing that calms me down is some revolutionary music or speechs and quotes  by great dictator. I play the Soviet anthem and marches and i look at pictures of great leaders such as Lenin and Stalin and i feel so much energy and hope inside of me. Nothing motivates me more than these. Sometimes i feel that i like other dictators such as Hitler and some other far right and mitaristic tyrants. But since they were counter revolutionaries, it only happens when i am feeling extremely hateful and selfish. Communism means justice and equality for everyone. It's mostly love and not hate. It means fighting for my rights and the whole mankind's as well.  But Fascism is all about hate, death and destruction. Being a Fascist means wanting everything for your own nation even if you have to kill every foreigner. For me, my mind and body is my nation. Fascism means narcissism for me. It means madness, gun, bullets, death and zero mercy. Sometimes i change phases between right and left. But i try to maintain my sanity and stay on the left. But anything may happen.",12Feb2019,1

433,"Hey,

I'm a 25 y/o adult living on my own with a full time job. I've lived away from home for many years now but I still live near the same city as my parents. Recently I  was injured and my family has been very generous with their time and helping me when I've needed it, but I'm an independent person and get frustrated when I can't do things on my own so it's been a difficult time for me emotionally.

Because of my injury I had a machine from the hospital to help with recovery.  I couldn't move bc of my injury so my parents delivered it and set it up a few weeks ago. It went back last night but today I woke up to multiple calls and messages from my dad asking for some shipping paper the machine apparently had with it, a paper I'd never seen or even knew about until today. I told him I didn't know what it was or where it was and searched my whole place for it (my place is pretty small but it's still difficult for me to move around to look for things) and it isn't here. I called back and he said it MUST be there and that he would come find it himself, apparently he called my mom a bunch of times frustrated about where this paper is. 

No one believes me about this piece of paper and as dumb as the whole situation is, it's really upsetting me. My parents are implying that I'm irresponsible because this piece of paper that I never knew existed until today isn't in my possession, they don't believe that my searching is sufficient either. I have had issues like this with my dad before where he just won't listen to me or respect what I'm saying and if I ever express any frustration about that I'm accused of being manipulative. I think I'm having such a strong reaction to this bc things happened in my past when I was a kid that I haven't really told anyone about bc of how my parents react to things like this. Super small things turn into huge issues because my dad won't listen to me and my mom wants to stay neutral. I'm also frustrated because I'm 99% sure one of my parents will barge into my place and tear it apart trying to find something I'm pretty confident was never here to begin with. How can I stop being upset by this situation and how can I stop letting future conflicts like this upset me?

440,"Howdy everyone, got a bit of an oddball question that I'm not sure on the answer to or if there really is one. 

I've been a user of LSD and Weed for a while now, going on 3 years, and I've never really had any issues or let it effect my life too much. I'm in an Engineering program in my college and while I've struggled, I think everyone in the program has at some point. I've had many good experiences, never the party/rave stuff you hear with other people; hikes with friends, movie days with the girlfriend, etc. I feel more connected with friends and family and all around actually think things have been a major positive impact in my life.

All that being said, an opportunity has come up for a job that could be super beneficial for me but it would require I stop basically everything of an illegal nature entirely. This gets complicated since, due to my life the past couple years, most of my friends do things of that nature and it would require that I basically cant go to parties or hang out with them when they're doing that kind of stuff.

I guess my question boils down: to is it better to make these memories and experiences while I'm young or should I be looking towards my future and (growing up) as most people would say?

I've been clean about a month or so now just to prove and see if it effected my thoughts but I still keep finding myself second guessing whether I'll regret my decision one way or the other. 

Obviously a throwaway account so not sure how much I can respond but all help is appreciated!",12Feb2019,1
441,"I work in IT and was hired on because I had 10 plus years of customer service / retail management experience. (Zero IT experence) I love my job quite a bit because I'm helping people everyday and work with a bunch of people who seem to understand my quirks. And I've learned a lot from my co-workers. 

The man who hired me stepped down and another one was promoted up and he seemed to come at me pretty hard yesterday regarding the mishandling of a ticket and I though he was reprimanding me in the General Chat Lobby of our office communicator software. 

I sent him a private message accepting responsibility for the mistake/issue and added ""Could you please do me a courtesy and not reprimand me in a general chat lobby.""

He said ""its all good and it's not even a reprimand."" and that he was trying to get clarity on what caused the issue. My senior Co-worker/Mentor was spitting pissed. So I wasn't the only one who took it that way. 

At 6PM yesterday we all got a meeting request for Friday at the end of the day. I've asked for this day off 4 weeks prior because all of my friends and I are getting together to play Anthem together all day. 

I'm worried that if I bring this up it will look like a power play and cause further tension between me and my new manager which I don't want, he's a nice guy who's new to management. I'm not skilled labor in this position and I don't have any weight to throw around in the professional sense nor would I want to. 

Do I bring up I had the time schedule off already? 

Do I just ignore the meeting because he's suppose to have consulted the calendar before scheduling such a meeting? (Mentor's suggestion) Skip out on my friends for work?

455,"I'm at my breaking point right  now or so it feels. My boyfriend is across the country and while we've been doing LDR for a year and I love him I fucking hate the distance. I feel empty inside most days or that I just want to die walk infront of of a car or jump from a high place. I am struggling so hard in school over the beginning of this school year.  I used to be a 4.0 student in college and since this year (my junior year at a new school) I have been greatly struggling. I can't seem to focus and often find myself depressed. To make matter worse, I spend most of my time studying and trying to understand the material we are going over I have exhausted what seems to be all my resources (talking to the teacher and tutoring, studying, etc.,) to no avail. While last term I had an A in all my classes with an exception of a B in my accounting class (my major). In the accounting class honestly the only reason I passed was because she gave us extra credit because a majority of the class had failed the midterm. I am just at a loss I feel partially it is the accounting class (with the  same teacher and such for all of them because it's a small stupid ass school :/) but I actually can't switch to another teacher cause there isn't one. This term the teacher has made changes (the class is in sequence for all three terms) which have been really helpful for the most part, but I still barley got a D on this midterm. I was feeling confident going in, only to have questions slightly different than the ones we went over on the homework and in class, that some how we were supposed to have understood how to do. I have EXTENSIVELY read the book which provides NO examples that are helpful whatsoever. I feel like I am likely to fail this term since I have done so badly on the test thus far and things aren't going to get any easier. This was my major, this is what I wanted to do with my life and now I just feel like it was all for not and I don't even want to be an accountant anymore. I feel so stressed and alone and I have effectivley been spending all my time studying and preparing for my classes TRYING to understand the material to what no avail. I know it's only going to get harder so this is the impass I'm at.

 *Should I quit school?* I can't change my major I already have too many classes for my Business degree and it would cost me much more to change it. I honestly can barley get out of bed each day with the combination of depression and anxiety and lack of fun in my life not to mention feeling of loneliness since my boyfriend is so far away. Most days I just want to end it to be free of this world. I realize if I quit school it won't be easy and I'll get any job I can take to get experience and go from there. My parents and boyfriend have all encouraged me not to quit since ""I am so close"" and because they quit or didn't go to college. I don't want to disappoint them but I feel like I am DONE running my never ending marathon that is school.

*TDLR;*
Struggling in school and dealing with depression because of it while going for a major Im not even interested in anymore. Should I quit school even though everyone says not to?

456,"Hi! I don't usually use Reddit and especially for stuff like this, but to get straight to the point:

At the beginning of January I had my blood pressure taken. As always, the machine tightened around my arm, but it felt a LOT tighter than usual. A few hours after coming back from the Drs. I noticed that my left arm began to feel heavy and I soon went to sleep. After putting up with a weird discomfort and heaviness in my arm for about a week, I decided to go back to the Drs. to try and see what was up. The Doctor that I saw pretty much instantly assumed that it was as a result of the blood pressure being too tight, and told me to come back in about 2-3 weeks to see if it persisted, since it might be something more serious.

Just yesterday, I visited the Drs. to try and see if it WAS something serious, and they told me that it was just anxiety giving me pain? It definitely doesn't seem like that and apparently there was nothing wrong with me physically, so I'm just stuck. It very rarely goes away and I'm still worried.",12Feb2019,1

I want to know what sex is like when it’s not all about sharing love and it’s just something dirty and animalistic. I also want to lower the value of what she’s done in my head because recently I’ve been getting feelings for her again. They’re unreciprocated though and I know that she’s going to sleep with other people before we ever get back together again. Not that I’m confident we will. I also want to do it just in case we do get back together, I want to have slept with someone else. Even though if we were madly in love again, I think it would bother me that since losing our virginity together, she has had other experiences and I haven’t. I also think it would make me trust her less when she was going out. I know she didn’t cheat on me but it would seem more likely that she would, just because that’s something she’s done and I haven’t.
I don’t think sleeping with a few other will stop me from feeling all sadness but I do think sleeping with someone else will give me a different perspective and help me move on. I know that sex with other people will be fun. It’s not like I’ve never wanted it I just generally don’t go out of my way to find girls. Partly because of a lack of confidence.

I was telling her about the measles outbreak in the US, and about anti-vaxxers, when she told me the real reason she stopped taking me for vaccinations- one of my neighbors' kids is autistic.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I made a post that blew up on Imgur about my lack of dating life. It was a dumb meme made because I was bummed out. People really related to it and I got a lot of messages and friend requests and 99.9% were fine, we would play some QP rounds in OW or run raid in FFXIV, sometimes send memes but no one took anything seriously and it was just some casual communication that mostly dropped off. Except for ONE guy who was sadly invited to a discord group I was in.

Within a week of adding him he was asking to 'date' me. Keep in mind I have no real idea who this person is, and he dosn't know me. He knows I'm a girl but that's about it. I explain I don't want a long distance relationship right now and ask that he not bring it up again which he seems to agree and understand saying he was sorry he just really enjoyed talking to me. I understood that and moved on. After finding out I was collecting OW pops he said he had one he just wanted to get rid of and he would send it to me. I told him no a few times but he insisted it was junk he was going to toss and trying to sell it wasn't worth the hassle, so I somewhat reluctantly agreed....which was a mistake as I got a letter in the box saying he hoped he could 'hold me' in person next year. 

Another full sit down conversation of me NOT wanting to date HIM at all and again 'okay I understand'...that moved into obsessive daily messages. The second I would log onto discord in the morning after waking up he would message me, as if he was waiting at his computer since 5am to do so. It was constant, which made me thing he knew my work hours by day. He would spam invites at me if I ghosted on Discord, having added me on most of my games early on to play with me. I mean the SECOND I got into OW he was jump on and go 'Can I join?!' and if he was told no he would message me again 30 mins later, then switch games to what I was playing and start the process over. I had to appear offline on every platform if I wanted any time to myself. 

I sat him down at least three times and plainly talked it over with him and each time he would say he was sorry, explain his aspergers and claim he would work on it...but it only got worse. The messages would die down to three times a day and the invites weren't as constant but suddenly he wanted to go to schools in my city and was hoping we could take a vacation together when he came down to tour them...of course I told him no and we had ANOTHER talk and for two days it seemed to work he left me alone and only sent me one message.....but then sent a long paragraph of 'I really want weekly one on on time with you, you're so important to me you make me so happy'.....

I spoke to a few people in this discord and sent some messages to see if maybe I messed up, did I lead him on or make him think there was some kind of chance? Was I being mean and should I just put up with it giving his social issues? Everyone said NO. I was clear, kind and honest and he was full blown creepy, I come to find out he was messaging other people in the discord to try and get information on me. Who my friends were IRL, what I was like and things...it put MANY of my friends off who then admitted they felt uncomfortable around him. 

At last it got to the point were the leader kicked and blocked him, I blocked him on all platforms and he quickly started messaging other people in the discord looking to be re invited and found my business e-mail to try and explain himself but also pin his sudden depression and panic attacks on me. Telling me what I was doing to him was cruel and unnessessary, he just wanted to make me happy and he cared so much about me. 

I sent him two messages back at this point pissed off and almost yelling. It was the only thing that got across to him. 

While I know his behavior was unacceptable I'm honestly afraid he's going to hurt himself as he went off about suicide for a bit and about how he was unstable and depressed now. I don't want him to hurt himself but I can't keep living around him like I was. I'm conflicted about opening that door up again just to keep him safe as a person, not a friend.

But my junior year my mother who had cancer passed away in front of me in the most awful way a person could watch someone they love die. That messed me up to say the least. I decided instead of trying to stay in school after I realized I just could not keep my grades up that it would be best to take off a semester and just try and... move on with life I suppose.

So many things happened, my dad lost so much weight, broke down basically. I'm living too far away to be able to help or keep in touch with him and my siblings past daily messaging and facetimes. My mother has said so many ugly things... honestly if I typed up all the drama we'd have a novel. 

For example when my dad went on a date with another woman, who was black, he recorded a fight they had the next day where my mum devolved into spewing lines such as:
""I'd never want a nigger fucker near my kids,"" and ""I'd never want a man that would fuck niggers"". So yeah, really ugly shit that makes me sick to my stomach to listen to. 

But as the months went by she'd lead him on, tell him she just needed time alone to ""figure out if I still want to be a mother, or with you."" Basically saying over and over that she'd eventually come back. Even though more was coming out, that shes cheated on my dad at least 4 times in the past 5 years.

She convinced my youngest sister to leave with her, pretty sure it was just so she could get a council house faster. Meanwhile she ignores and has basically disowned me and my 3 other siblings, who are all over 18- me and my brother are on our own, my other two sisters who have learning difficulties are with my dad- one of them even using all of her pay check to help pay for the mortgage that my mother now refuses to pay.

Christmas was hell... not only was it tense and stressful doing the whole presents thing and Christmas dinner without my mom, my birthday was on the 27th, and my dad took pictures of all of it just to shove it in my mom's face. I even begged him not to when it came to my birthday but he took videos and pictures when I wasn't looking, posting them to Facebook with captions that are clearly about my mom. He even did it a week ago when it was my other sisters birthday.

The woman he's been dating has no idea he's been trying to get my mom back, sleeping with her even though she's suffered through being cheated on before. I've called him out on the toxic behaviour but end up feeling like a bully... he's a victim but being a tool against my mom feels so shitty.

Basically I don't know what to do... I've distanced myself from both of them but I don't want my sister's to suffer, and it hurts me to watch my family fall apart. Everything's falling apart. ",12Feb2019,1
472,"So my friend talks about killing him self a lot. And I try to help him and talk to him, but anytime I say anything to him he will start mocking me and being super condescending about what I say. 

I will say stuff like I want you here and I care about you, and he will reply with, “I don’t care you want me here. You’re being selfish, because I’m miserable and I don’t want to be here” 

Or I’ll try and say motivational stuff, and I know it’s cheesy and I say I know you don’t want to hear this kind of stuff right now and I know none of it feels like it’ll even help you right now. But he will continue to mock me and say “lol” or “yea let me go motivate myself into getting a raise and getting my degree”  and he says “conversations like this are always funny to me they just piss me off and then make me realize why I want to kill myself.” 

His family members know and try to help him like I do but he responds to them the same. 
He sees a doctor but never takes his meds, and he blows off his appointments to see his psychiatrist all the time.

477,"[M, 18] Need advice kinda quickly. So I have an acquaintance that we will call John [M, 17/18]. So John has been trying to be friends with me for the past year and a half. I don’t want to be friends with John. He’s nice, but he is not my friend type. I take awhile to respond to his texts. I’ve only hung out with him once. I don’t feel great about this already. So two months ago he invited me to this concert that is tonight , and I was originally like “okay, it’s one night, I’ll just go” and I bought a ticket. So I have finals tomorrow in a class that I would study for. I could do the studying with some intense time management, and I have time tomorrow to study because the we have a study hall before all finals. Some other semi-important info: I would not be getting home from the concert until midnight/12:30. The thing is, I would probably stay up later than 12:30 anyways. Also, I would be driving 2 hours alone to the concert, and my parents would not let me go if they knew this. But...I could just lie to my parents and say that I was picking up a friend of John’s and riding with him. I would most likely lie if I liked the concert I was going to or if I liked the person I was going with. So this is kind of asking for advice and also kind of asking “Am I the asshole for using these excuses, and not going to the concert? Or should I just take all these annoyances and go?” Using the excuses would weigh on my conscious, but it is so tempting and really would be nice to be able to be lazy with time management like usual.",12Feb2019,1

There is quite a long story behind it.

480,"My brother is a former security officer. He quit his job without notice one day almost two years ago. He tells everyone he was diagnosed with PTSD and can no longer work, but the truth is he would sleep through shifts and was in a ""quit or you're fired"" situation.

He got no disability payments, and hasn't worked since. He has been living in a small, studio apartment attached to the back of a laundromat.

Recently, my family learned his grandmother has been paying his bills and giving him over $1000 a month to live. Basically he's getting paid to live for free, while his 67yo grandmother is working on a pig farm 6 days a week to pay for it all for over a year.

My parents found out about this, and confronted his grandmother. She stated she didn't see the problem with it as it was ""her decision what she did with her time and money""

Eventually, she broke and admitted she couldn't afford it and only did it because he has told her he wanted to kill himself if he had to go back to work.

His grandmother agreed to stop paying his way, and my dad and I drove over to confront him.

We walked in and the place was filthy. It was like something off the TV show ""Hoarders"". Trash, clothes and animal feces was scattered all over. There was at least 3 cats and he had snakes and ferrets in cages.

My dad and I began to call him out on all his bullshit, how he was being useless and sick for using his grandmother so he didn't have to work. He told us to leave and we did. 

Apparently, he called his grandmother to complain and she informed him he was being cut off financially and he needed help. 

He then called his mother and told us we're all unsupportive, and how he was going to never talk to us again and then 'probably kill myself'

I called the cops. They went over, talked to him and left. I have since filed 2 welfare checks when we haven't heard from him to make sure he's safe. They haven't followed up with me once.

He doesn't answer the phone, and he doesn't answer the door anymore. He refuses help or contact with any family.

We live in a primarily college student neighborhood, in a midsize city, that is located within walking distance to campus, rent prices exploit that. We’ve been in our current house since August and it has been an okay experience, the house has it’s issues but this is college and we don’t expect luxury living. There are less properties than students who demand houses so we’ve secured the lease for the house in question in November of 2017. 
My landlord texted us 3 days ago saying that when the lease renews in August there is a price increase from 1750/month total to 1875/month. We also pay the utilities. There is a very low possibility that we can find another 3 bedroom place this late in the game. My landlord is a nice woman, who has been pleasant to work with in the past, I’ve negotiated with her to do landscaping on all of her properties for rent or a portion of it. 
Now for issues with the house: the insulation in the attic, a storage space, has fallen apart and is on the floor, our bathroom leaks into the basement, garage door does not always work, and we make a trip to the breaker box weekly.
I’m posting for advice on how to negotiate with her that an increase is unwarranted/ the notice of the increase is untimely. If not that then an argument to get her to make repairs before increasing rent.

489,"Cross posting for some exposure, don't really use reddit that much.

This is a bit of a weird situation, and one that is stupid but kind of hurts a little.

Backstory.

I was pretty ugly growing up. Not your ""oh, you just lack confidence"" sort of situation, but like, actually a pretty shit draw in the genetic lottery. I have kids who blurt out ""mom what's wrong with his face"" to me these days still. I don't let it get to me since it doesn't matter.

That said, it didn't really affect me growing up that much. I knew it early on, and instead I played the class clown, and was really outgoing.

Throughout high school I started lifting, and I'm actually quite built. It's just, the face is a huge turn off.

As for dating, I never really had much luck. I was always ""that guy friend"", that all the girls wanted. I listen, I'm compassionate I think.

Anyways, I have a girlfriend now. She loves me for who I am and I honestly could see a future with her.

She got her wisdom teeth removed last weekend. I was there with her, and she was talking with the nurse about her life goals and whatnot. She was pretty sedated and it was quite funny to be there. The nurse beckoned me over for something, and she mentioned to my gf that ""you have a handsome boyfriend"".

I knew she was being kind, but then my gf responded with something like this:

GF: ""Oh stop, you know he's not a looker at all but he's the kindest most caring person in the world"".

Nurse: ""that's not true, he seems like both!""

GF: ""he is ugggggly, wait until you see him"".

I've never let it affect me until then. I tuned out after hearing that. It really fucking stings.

Should I just forget about this, or do I talk about this with her? Is this a stupid thing to get hung up over or what? Like I get it. I know I'm not the best looking person in the world up in the face area but still.

498,"So I recently (as of this weekend) decided I want to move to LA in the summer when my lease is up. I currently live in PA &amp; I am 27 years old. 

  
I work in corporate retail here. However, my passion is wardrobe styling. There isn't a market here for that. I've sent my portfolio to several established stylists (mostly based in LA) to intern with them who tell me my work is great but I need to move to LA. For a while, I was so against this as I know it is super expensive &amp; just so far away. I wanted to be based in PA &amp; just travel.  I also know that corporate retail is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I recently applied for a lateral move at my current job &amp; they went with another external candidate due to my ""communication development"" meaning a cross-functional partner said I can come across harsh through email. Heard through the grapevine they could pay the other candidate less since I've already been working here. This put a bad taste in my mouth of course. However, to be honest I was settling for that role as I truly don't have a true desire to do anything in corporate retail. Except for maybe styling. I've applied to other places to do styling for e-commerce (style all the clothing on models that go on their website) &amp; was turned down due to lack of ""corporate retail styling experience.""  However, I looked at it as a sign. Maybe the job at my current place &amp; the others didn't work out bc I would be settling &amp; it would've been a distraction for what I'm supposed to do &amp; where I'm supposed to be. 

  
Now I am nervous if I am just acting on emotion. My mom (who is against me moving - will never admit it - but she is very codependent &amp; honestly vice versa) keeps drilling into my brain that I need to pray about this (I agree)  &amp; make sure I am not doing this based on emotion. She also was the one who drilled into my brain I don't need to move there I can figure out a way to stay here &amp; travel. At first, I'm like what emotion? Then I started thinking of what just recently transpired (with my job). However, on the other hand, I hate PA due to the weather, I don't feel super connected or related to anyone here (I want to meet people who aspire to work on a tv show, awards shoes, etc - not move up to be the head of marketing or the head merchant).  Also, there truly isn't a market for entertainment styling here which is what I want to do. I want to say I styled someone for the Grammys. I want to see my work on a tv show. Something more! 

  
So I'm a little confused I guess &amp; to be frank scared out of my mind. LA is across the country. I will be starting over completely financially. It is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done. It will be hard to find a job (only going if I secure one before)  I have an auto-immune disease that flares up every now &amp; again (however any time I needed to go to the doctor or ER I never could rely on my family who is only an hour away).  I tear up at the thought of leaving my mom so far away - even though I know I can't live my life that way. I can't decide if these are reservations, signs not to do it, or just straight up nerves about making such a leap. Again I have my mom in my head telling me all the cons which is not helping. 

However, it would really teach me how to really make it on my own. How to be responsible for money-wise &amp; a real growing experience as a woman. Most of all I would have so much opportunity!

501,"So I moved in with an acquaintance that I had known for about a year from school and we signed a year long lease for an apartment. We’re only about 6 months in but it has been clear to me for some time now that I don’t want to live with her again next year, and I decided to room again with my old roommate who was just great and I was really happy living with her. So I found the apartment that we’re in, I contacted the landlord and set up a showing and got us a lease. I do all the housework and upkeep such as cleaning and gardening and fixing things around the house and my roommate does absolutely nothing. I always have to wash her dishes and clean her hair out of the bathroom and basically be her mother, she has no idea how to be an adult basically. She didn’t even know that you had to clean the lint trap in the dryer for about 2 months until I told her so she could have potentially started a fire. She has also stained the bathtub with hair dye, and basically ruined the counter top of my kitchen island that I bought. The couch is also mine and I have asked her countless times not to have sex with her boyfriend on it yet she still does. Another big thing is I told her that I have a dog and a cat and asked if she was okay with that before we moved in, and then when we did she told me she hates cats and to get rid of it so I had to give my cat to my parents, and when I asked if she could feed my dog for one night and take care of him while I was gone she said yes. I found out (due to her Snapchat story) that she left my dog along for hours, so I came home early to check on him and he was crying and whimpering with no food or water, and he had an accident on the floor due to not being let outside for hours. Basically she’s just kind of a shitty roommate and I don’t like living with her. So I suggested to her that maybe she could move out so me and my old roommate could live here, and she got really angry and defensive. She said that I should move out since she doesn’t have another roommate and it would be “inconvenient” for her to find a new place AND a new roommate. Not my problem. So I told the landlord that we both wanted the place but neither of us wanted to move out and we couldn’t come to an agreement, so the landlord was going to pick who he leased with next year. As expected he chose me (I’m a way better tenant and I already have a roommate for next year), and so me and my new roommate signed a lease so the place is ours next year. She did not contact the landlord or do anything at all to try to stay here. So basically now I have to tell her that she has to move out next year and I don’t know how. I don’t want to fight, I want to spare her feelings, and like I said we still have to live together for 6 months. So how can I word it to her that she has to leave being as nice as possible?

So I have been applying to every type of job I can - fast food, cashier, etc. as well as stuff like helpdesk, technician jobs, Ubreakifix etc. I can't move (because of my wife's job) but I'm applying to everywhere in a pretty wide radius - since I'm already driving 75% of the day anyway, driving \~90 minutes to work would be better. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I can't get anything. Maybe it's because I'm 33, have no degree and don't really have any past jobs they can verify I was decent at? I previously did tech support at Time Warner Cable but they're gone now. I worked at McDonalds when I was 14 - 16 but none of the same people are there now. Other than that I have just done various temporary and gig jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are places that will pay for or help out with college (Starbucks, Walmart etc.), and I've been applying to/going to interviews with them, but they just won't hire me.

512,"I’m 21, currently attending barber school, and I’m two months away from graduating. 
I’m having problems reading my own emotions about whether or not I chose the wrong path.


I don’t have anything I’m passionate about other than making money, being my own boss, and making my own work environment.


I chose the barber route because it seemed to fit that. However, I’m inching very close to the point where my 12 months of schooling needs to show for itself, in a real barbershop. My skill level is most certainly not on par with what a professional barber is expected to have. I don’t believe I’ll be able to survive the real world. I also don’t know how long I’ll have to eat shit until I gain a more respectable skill level. I’m not very hopeful it will come soon enough, as I’ve already been cutting hair for about 1 year.


I’m currently strongly interested in making jewelry. I don’t have any experience with this sort of thing, but my attention has mostly gravitated towards this craft over the past few months. I’ve considered emerging myself entirely into the jewelry world, and pursuing this instead of barbering. I’ve already skipped an entire month of schooling, because I was so disinterested and scared of the outcome. I used the month to look into making jewelry. 


I’m into a few other business endeavors that will make me money, but those require less focus and can presumably be done on the side.



I’m really all over the place. I know I’m young, but is it okay to explore different things? Am I just running away from cutting hair because I’m scared? I do not know how to read these emotions and find answers to them. What would you suggest me to do as far as finding my answers?

513,"Hello reddit. So I needed a place a to tell my story and receive advice because I cannot discuss this with anyone in real life as you will soon find out. Basically I am falling in love with a girl who has been one of my best friends over the last 6 years or so. 

Quick background. I’m a 25 year old male. She is also 25. We have a stupid close group of friends from college and we all still live close together and hang out all the time. We became good friends because when we all first started college and hanging out, I was together with her roommate and she was with mine so we just all became close, things didn’t work out between all that but we all stayed friends and it was cool. Over the years we’ve both dated other people and she was just like a little sister to me. Really never saw her any differently, even though other people always thought we were dating. We always gravitate towards each other when we’re together. I’ve been on vacation with her family, my family loves her etc etc. We’re very close, you get the point.

Skip to last Year and two of our best friends got married and we were both in the wedding parties. The groom was drunk and told me how awesome it would be if me and my friend got together and was planting ideas in my head. No big deal though I’ve been hearing this for years. 
Basically it worked and since then I’ve been slowly falling in love with her and realize that I think I always have been, but have just been waiting for our clocks to match up. And I think the time is now before someone else snatches her up, (she has been single for about a year now).

This is my unique situation which is why I had to create a throwaway, please bare with me. I have been with my fair share of women and talking with her, I know she loves sex and she’s a very pretty girl and has a good amount of it. I have been with my fair share of women, but have not been able to maintain a relationship because, well....I don’t have the biggest penis. It is below average and I know girls don’t like it. This isn’t a pity party, I’ve gone through a lot of self acceptance and it’s fine, it is what it is, nothing I can do about it, but what I’m afraid of is that she actually feels the same way towards me and when we finally go to have sex, she will be disappointed, not want to date someone with a small penis no matter how close we are and our friendship will be ruined. I’m also afraid that if I don’t do anything I will miss out on the one girl who will actually accept and love me for who I am and my little problem. I really can’t talk to anyone about this which is why I’m turning to you beautiful strangers for advice. If it’s true love will it not matter? Is it worth risking our friendship? For all I know she doesn’t even feel the same way and I’ll make a fool of myself before even getting in bed with her. 

I’m thinking about sending her flowers for Valentine’s Day and maybe asking her out on a date as a friend thing but I don’t know, I’m at a loss. I haven’t felt like this before haha. Ughhh please help me. ",12Feb2019,1

B: Even before we dated, a lot of people thought so. We hung out like all the time, and I’m generally quite a physical person,  so we touched a lot. 

C: My bf doesn’t have to think I’m ashamed of being gay or something like that.

But on the other hand:

A: We both go to secondary school (middle school) so the guys there are often very casually homophobic. Like, almost every day I hear a joke about someone being gay. Even the people that wouldn’t make fun of me would assume that I’m sexually attracted to ALL guys or I’m super feminine etc. I’m worried about destroying relationships with my male friends 

B: word would eventually get around to my parents, and while they wouldn’t be upset or anything, fear my dad would be disappointed, as  I always fear he somewhat is.

C: out of school I’m in a theatre show, and the production has me accidentally kiss a guy when we both lean in to kiss the same girl, so coming out would make that whole scene real awkward.

517,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years. He’s changed me for the better but he hasn’t changed himself. (Were both 22 years old)

He doesn’t have a job, has no responsibility, takes drugs, doesn’t make any goals and disrespects me. He makes it seem like “he’s just living life” and his family supports it. (Hippies)

Over the 4 years he has disrespected me in so many ways that I look back and I made over 20+ posts throughout the years on yahoo and reddit about him.

I’m Puerto Rican, Greek and Italian. Mostly Italian personality since I grew up with that side.

He has said the following things I can remember plus similar things I can’t remember:

“I’m worried our kid would be to dark”
“You have nigger hair” (which I don’t it’s just curly)

We were walking one day through a state park and I told him how my aunt never got any stretch marks after 4 kids because she walked all the time, his response: “black people don’t wrinkle”

*me working hard for my job making tons of money for the last 4 years* Him: are you fucking your boss? (Always accusing me for fucking my boss when I was working my ass off)

Celebrating same birthdays with my girlfriend and her brother shook my boyfriends hand and winked at him and my boyfriend turns to me and says in front of everyone “are you fucking one of those guys?” 

*didnt want to have sex* he screams “WHITE POWER”

I want to go to a music festival and he says “no you’ll probably end up getting lost and fucking someone you don’t know.”

PLUS TONS OF SIMILAR THINGS I DONT REMEMBER HE SAID.

What topped it off was:

His moms friends/family threw a kick ass party and we got pretty drunk. Before the party I went to see if I could get a new car and learned that my insurance was going to be too high because of my age + I learned that getting a DUI could spike it to 900 so that day I didn’t want to risk driving home drunk by a police station from a big ass banger. 

I told him I wanted to take an Uber back home. He threw a temper tantrum like a child.. he even introduced himself to someone like “hey my name is B and I’m apparently to drunk to drive my own car home.”

Then for 10 minutes he was cursing at me, yelling and just pissed tf off and I wasn’t responding to it so he got up to go find his “mommy” and complained to her... she told me to take some mints, eat a lemon and drive home.

I couldn’t believe I got put in that position from my own boyfriend and his mother, like wtf I’m a grown ass woman.

So that was my deal breaker. I’m in the middle of breaking up with him today, we lived together as well.

I’m just scared because I’m alone. I have no friends to travel with, do yoga with, go to concerts with and live life with, so when I leave him I’ll have no one to do things with. I’ll end up living back home with my toxic bipolar mother, I’ll be alone with no good friends to do things with and I’m afraid that I’ll desperately go down the wrong road again because before my boyfriend I would hangout with anyone to get away from my mother. I’m scared and I know that he will be able to do all those things without me which angers me so much, his family is his friends at least and I don’t even have that.

Please someone give me advice.",12Feb2019,1
518,"Throwaway account. 

  When I met my husband I was a single mom, working and going to school. I obviously fell in love with my husband, and proceeded to marry him with the idea that I would be happy being a stay at home mom, after years of struggling. I absolutely did not marry my husband for his money, but he does have a very good income of approx. $160,000 yr. 

  Long story short, I have one year left of school, My life has become a never ending cycle of dropping off and picking up kids, cleaning the house, and grocery shopping. My husband works 7 days a week, and when he is not working, he is outside working on our property, in his shop etc, because he is the type of person who can’t relax and be inside. 

I understand that I chose this lifestyle, but I feel that I used to have dreams and goals and I no longer have that. I am in a position where I can divorce my husband and qualify for financial aid etc, or I can stay married to a man who is so concerned with paying off our house and property(which is very admirable) that it leaves nothing extra left every year other than what we need to live off of. I am 100 percent willing to go back to working, but the point of this is that I want to have a career, not work at a minimum wage job forever. 

I understand that there are underlying issues with my marriage etc, but I am just looking for advice on if there is any way around this, so that I can do something more with my life.  My husband was raised very differently than I was, and in his mind, you do everything by the book, and everyone should work their ass off for anything they want. I completely agree with that, but obviously, I can’t go back in time and change things, so there just never seems to be a resolution when we discuss it.

Things are going pretty good for me. I have a job I have been working at for 6 years that has afforded me the option to change positions and gain tenure and importance. I don't have to put in crazy hours - it's just 40 hours a week. The work culture is good, and the company is pretty reasonable.  


I am married and my wife has a good job as well. No kids (and unlikely to change), and we have a mortgage on our home. We have a budget and stick to it, and aren't financially stressed. I have a good group of friends and my family live nearby. I volunteer for some charities and do some extra-curricular activities. I am generally content.  


And yet, especially in the past year, I have felt more and more.. restless. I have been considering making a big change in my life. My job is good but it involves a lot of travel, which I really don't like, and neither does my wife. I have been considering quitting and starting my own business, and I have saved enough to live without a paycheque for upwards of a year. It would mean working a lot more hours, and potential failure, but I wouldn't be travelling anymore. I could always get another job if it doesn't pan out, or even go back to my current company.  


But everytime I envision doing it, I just feel my stomach drop, and I lose all confidence that I could actually succeed. I've put together a business plan, and I think the idea is sound. I'm still young and I have plenty of time to take a risk like this, but it's like I have some sort of mental block.   


Beyond that, there are so many things I would love to be doing or devoting my time to. Learning new skills or various types of art. I think that if I wasn't working I could focus on those things - but then I just think I am being lazy, I only work 40 hours a week, that I just need to make use of my spare time better, and spend less of it watching TV or browsing the internet.

530,"Hi everyone,

I am a university student and I am having a problem in one of my classes. There is another student who has always been quite unique in personality compared to other students here. He always talks to everyone and wedges his way into their conversations, but he was always nice so most of the time everyone would just let it go and let him join in. I myself would almost always talk to him and try to give him positive feedback on his presentations (it's a communications class). Over the last two class periods his attitude has changed to one that is getting more aggressive as time goes on. The last class period was the worst as he kept muttering to himself that he wanted to fight everyone and that everyone was ""disrespecting"" him (even though nobody had done or said anything remotely offensive to him). Eventually another student asked him to stop and the guy in question began turning on him and asking him if he wanted to take it outside. This is a new attitude for this individual and it made going to class incredibly uncomfortable for me, and has only gotten worse. I have opted to skip class today as I am too nervous to be around this individual and too non-confrontational to ask him if everything is okay. Should I take it to the professor? File an anonymous report about it (which is something we can do that goes through Student Affairs)? Or am I way overthinking this?

I will give you few examples about my sister did to me

Examples 1: When we going to move into new house, she told the wifi hasnt installed yet, but her husband said its already installed. Her husband tell the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples 2: She made a rule that im only allowed to play game on weekend and holiday and to put the plate on dishwasher after done eating. I did but they always make a  stack of plates on sink.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples 3: Whenever i made a small mistake like forget to put plates in dishwasher, she and her daughter just mock me or called me stupid in norwegian language.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples 4: Open door carefully, sometime i opened the door to my room pretty loud, when she tell that, i always open it quietly. one time, she just stormed through my room without knocking while i was browsing internet, she just said she want to make sure i was studying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Examples 5 : As a skinny boy, i tried to gain some weight and eat alot. I feel so inspired that day until i tell her husband about my other international students friend that they are already in the ""level 2"" norwegian language class while im still in ""level 1"". He decided to tell that to her. The first thing she asked is ""what class A and B in?"" and i tell that they are in next level class, she then basically told me that i must study harder and compare me to them and my successful nephew while im going to be a useless person, and told me how fucked up my family are. Since that i didnt lift anymore.

My dog is nearly 8 years old, I'm not sure how long German Shepherds live and I don't really want to know 
I know my mom takes anti depressants and while it's rare, she occasionally will mention wanting to die. I feel like she'll be ok for quite a few more years but she always seems to be getting more and more unstable and angry and I never know what to do with her and she's the biggest comfort in my life but recently she yells at me more and more and I don't want her to die until I can apologize for everything 
Not only people will die, my hopes for the future get crushed everyday and I don't know what to do with myself 
And I'm just getting more distraught writing this
I should stop and go take a shower to cool off like my mom suggested 
I don't think I've cried this much in months. All of this could've been avoided if my mom just didn't have another child. I can barely cope with giving a presentation at school how am I supposed to cope with all this while having to make choices that will ripple through my entire future and all the expectations are on me and I don't know what to do, mental illness just means there's absolutely no escape and I feel so infinitely trapped by everything. I don't know what to do  ",12Feb2019,1
533,"A little backstory, I asked my Ortho to remove my braces a week early and he said it'd be 99% but not perfect so I didn't see an issue.

I have to get my retainer tomorrow and I'm scared about bringing it up as he'll say ""Its your fault for getting it off early"", but I didn't see the gap with my braces on at all...

537,"My mother has always been a very functional parent. She has always been capable of performing motherly duties (she was a housewife with 5 kids)  such as the cooking, cleaning, dropping us to where we need to go. However she has alway been emotionally unstable, quick to anger and delusional. We took this as normal when we were kids but now we are adults we can see how insane out childhood was. My father is the most balanced person you are ever likely to meet and has spent his life putting out her fires and controlling her environment to remove triggers, all the while being the subject of what I can only describe as mental abuse. My parents are now in their 60's and in the last few years my fathers health has declined. He is no longer able to put out the fires, placate her when she angry or soak up the abuse. This has led to the separation of my parents.

She has undiagnosed mental problems. It's hard to explain. She imagines things have happened or how people feel about her and from there she handles things appropriately. Should you hear her talk about the reasons she had for blowing up in a particular instance it would all seem very logical. However, if you were present during the instance you would realise that her version is entirely fictional. She is a very lovely woman to everybody outside our family so friends and extended family don't understand. I'm worried she will not be able to cope on her own without my father and she point blank refuses to accept the possibility that she has a problem. She sees a psychiatrist, however she maintains the psychiatrist tells her, her problems come from the stress caused by the people in her life. I can't believe this is true. I have tried to contact the psychiatrist but have been informed (not unreasonably) that I cannot talk to her without my mothers permission. Given that my mother is convinced she has no problems aside from stress she won't grant permission. I've run out of road and have no idea what to do next. If I even mention calmly to my mother about the problem she goes into a rage which can last days, week and sometimes months. Sorry if this is long winded and poorly worded but I would appreciate all and any advice.",12Feb2019,1
538,"So, for as long as I can remember my sister (middle child, I'm the oldest) has hated me. When we were kids she was favoured by my mum and step dad (who raised me from a baby), I always felt a little like the black sheep as I have a different father to my sisters and my mum didn't actually tell me that my step-dad wasn't my real dad until I was 14. For as long as I can remember she's harboured a resentment towards me, we had a few childish arguments when we were kids like most siblings do, but as we've got older I've tried consistently to try and improve our relationship and get closer to her. She isn't interested. She'll gladly play nice when she needs to borrow money or needs a favour, but other time's she's always looking for an argument. I'll list some examples below.

&amp;#x200B;

\- So when I was 17 I moved in with my step dad (my mum and step-dad had been divorced for a good few years before this) because my mum made me homeless. We got along at first, but then I had a cousin (from my bio dad's side) get in contact with me - bearing in mind I had never met/spoken to my real dad prior to this. We arranged a meet and eventually I was introduced to my bio dad and step mum, this greatly affected my step dad. Tensions arose and eventually we ended up arguing a lot if not completely avoiding one another. I felt like he was pushing me away, like he felt like he could finally wash his hands of me now my bio dad was on the scene. Anyway, I ended up moving back in with my mum and me and my step-dad didn't speak for around 4/5 years. 

In this time my sister (let's call her R) moved in with my step-dad and became the golden girl. She played off my mum and step-dad against one another and spouted off so many lies to his side of the family (mostly vicious thing's I'd allegedly said about them, none of which were true) that she was pretty much the only daughter in contact with them. She's always been privileged, never had to work for anything and when she did she was instantly given a job working for my step-dad's company, yet she will tell you she'd had it the hardest out of all of us. 

So eventually I get back in contact with my step-dad, we have a heart to heart and clear the air, ending up with a much better understanding of why our relationship broke down. We're now very close. R is extremely angry about this. When we weren't in contact she was like an only child (my youngest sister lives with my mother and only see's my father bi weekly, if that), and now she's acting like we're in competition. I've assured her so many times that I'm not trying to steal her (our) father from her, but she still feels the need to bitch about me to my dad. When there are family events, they'll ask her to invite me, she then tells them she has when in actual fact she's purposely not invited me because she doesn't want me there.

\- She is resentful of the fact that I am able to afford to live independently (even after suffering a vicious sexual assault when I was 19), am not codependent and am quite happy being single, and keep a beautiful, clean home.

\- She doesn't invite me to her birthday gatherings, her recent baby shower, family meals or events even though I am always sure to include her.

\- She gets angry when I put effort into my appearance and becomes extremely protective and jealous if I am conversing with her partners (I am civil with her current fiancé, even though he's a man child who I massively dislike). 

\- When discussing baby names for her future little girl with the entire family, she was happy with everyone's suggestions, laughing and positive. When I suggested a name that I liked, she gave me a filthy look and spat ""Not your baby though is it?""

\- At Christmas whilst preparing a drinking game, she wanted to spike the shots with vinegar, I told her it was a bad idea as my aunt suffers from GERD and it would cause her immense pain. My father and cousin agreed with me. Instead of laughing it off and moving on, she turned to me and shouted ""What the fuck is wrong with you? You treat everyone like shit!"". Even my father was gobsmacked, this isn't the first time she's snapped at me for no reason. 

\- After a suicide attempt when I was 20, I was confiding in her about how certain phrases trigger me. ""What the fuck is wrong with you?"" being one of them. If we argue she smiles and says this to me, without fail, every time. 

\- When she found out she was pregnant, she told everyone but me. At a family gathering she was discussing the pregnancy loudly with my family, knowing full well I was within ear shot. Later that night she was talking about how tired she was, my aunt said ""You're probably just tired from being up so early this morning"" and I chimed in ""and you're pregnant!"", smiling proudly and trying to reassure her. She turned to me fuming, again said ""What the fuck is wrong with you?"" and stormed out. Crying her eyes out like she was the victim.

\- She steals from me.

\- She borrows items and then loses them, never even apologising or asking to replace them.

\- She throws gifts I get her away or trashes them.

\- I try to plan things with her all the time eg. Girls nights in, going out for a coffee, lunch. She never makes time.

\- She constantly belittles me and talks about me behind my back to my family, always negative.

\- She seeks out arguments constantly, for seemingly no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl today and as happy as I am for her I feel a little bit pushed out. I have this awful feeling she'll use her niece as a weapon when it comes to me and would absolutely despise it if me and my niece were to become close in the future. She's invited everyone to see the baby but me, sent pictures and messages to everyone but me. I don't understand what I've done to her. I don't understand why she's competing with me when I'm happy and supportive of all her decisions. I try so hard to be close with her, but she shits all over my efforts without fail every time. I feel like she may lack empathy, she's extremely entitled, reckless and spoilt. If she doesn't get her own way she's impossible. She definitely takes after my mother in that regard (a classic narcissist).

I would never cut her out of my life because she's my sister and I love her deeply, but I'm so exhausted of this vicious cycle. I feel like she takes and takes, be it money, time and effort and gives nothing back but negativity. I just wish I knew why she has such a hatred of me, and how I could fix it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Sister hates me for seemingly no reason. Worried she'll use her newborn baby as a weapon. Unsure how to fix our relationship, if there's even a way.

540,"So my mom ""works"" for Amazon. Me and her just had a fight right now about her storing too many things. Whenever she sees something being given away (ex. Couches, chairs etc.) She gets them knowing that we don't have space and then ends up selling them. However when she gets these things and sells them she makes US do yhe heavy lifting, storing it and giving it away. The problem is that I tell her this and she ends getting mad saying it doesn't matter because I have to do it since I live with her and she ""pays"" the bills. She won't listen to reason, she literally makes rules and only apply them when it benefits her. When talking to us she said she couldn't believe she had two grown men in her house and she still has to work (that's because NO ONE WANTS TO GIVE HER THEIR MONEY). But realize, she said 2. She said I'm not grown so I can't do anything myself. She won't let me go out myself because I'm not grown. But when it comes to MONEY I'm grown and should be paying for myself. Don't get me wrong I WANT a job. I do NOT want her taking my money to pay the bills when she can't even clean up after herself.

 Here's the thing, her job has employee's and she makes them do the work. She doesn't even have to go outside. But whenever there are no employee's available she makes me and my brother do the work. We don't get paid. I'm only 16 and I don't know if it's fair or not but does that not mean WE are doing her job? I don't mind doing responsibilities, she just refuses to do anything for herself. She constantly makes us move furniture in her room or the living room around anytime she gets ""bored"" of it. I once suggested that everyone to do their own dishes to save time but then she threw a fit saying she doesn't have to do nothing ""she pays the bills"". She says if I don't listen to her she'll kick me out. I get that these are just responsibilities I have to do, but when I'm doing YOUR work are you even paying the bills? And not to mention her boyfriend that lives with us, is the one with the job and she makes him go out and do HER job sometimes too.

It's all over stupid stuff I know, but my biggest problem is that she says it's because we don't have anything else to do. I literally had to DROP OUT of school because of anxiety attacks caused by her constantly moving state to state every year just because she got bored of the place. I could get a job, but whenever one of her children gets a job she just takes their money saying she'll give it back and never does using the excuse ""I pay the bills"". She owes my brother $1000 he was using to save up to get a car so he CAN get a better job but she won't give it back. It's almost like she's purposefully ruining our chances  to make our own money just so she can have us do her work. 

Not only that but recently we argued and she started saying homophobic stuff so that adds fuel to the flames. I just can't stand living with her anymore. She claims to need money but then spends it all on useless junk. She says that she pays for us but makes US do HER work. Is this fair? Am I really just being a brat or do I have a right to be mad at her for not doing anything? I'm seriously debating running away.

I'm starting saying that for a series of weird reasons I missed 2 years of school and I'm now in 12th grade (there are 13 grades in my country) in a crappy little school in a course In which I couldn't care less, In my class there are like 8 people and this school is known for being easy and for people that failed other ""serious"" schools (don't know how to explain better, I'm not in US so the system is different). Subjects are so easy, this year I never studied at home and I'm still going pretty good, even doing nothing all the mornings (usually i'm playing games or drawing because teachers don't care about it). Plus I kinda moved away from the group of people that I hanged out with because most of these people are the cliche' teen guys with their totally unintresting girlfriends that talk about NOTHING all day (you know, that types of people that always talk about what other people did, what other people said, some bullshit drama etc), guess what? Even after 3 month from that moving away thing only a girl in that group managed to keep contacts with me and she understood my point.
I have some hobbies but I'm just bored of spending the day by myself studing computer shit by myself and smoking weed alone thinking about something different to do (still better than hanging out with toxic people tho).
I don't really know what to do, I'm not an introvert guy at all, I dont' have problems making friends but I live in a small city and all the people that I talk to seems pretty boring or uninteresting.
All day I'm either angry with myself or pissed off by people, and I'm just waiting another year and an half hoping that when I will be in uni things will change.

547,"A bit of backstory: my parents have always been a bit... difficult. My dad is chronically grumpy, unhappy and very judgemental. I've accepted the fact that he's probably never going to be openly proud of me and will always have a problem with my decisions in life. But my real problem is my mum... 

She's ridiculously overprotective. When I was in school I wasn't really allowed to go out with my friends a lot, as I grew up I wasn't allowed to drink or go to parties, and I became lonely. The friends I did have she would plant doubts about in my head, always telling me they were using me or were bad people. All through uni I remained lonely, too scared to enter into a relationship because I knew she wouldn't approve and I was too scared to tell her because I knew she would throw one of her strops, not talk to me, threaten to divorce my dad and leave us etc. I couldn't handle the stress of it. 

As I got older her behaviour never changed, if anything it actually got worse. At one point when I was 24 I was going to move out with a friend, a gay guy. She told me he was only pretending to be gay and wanted sex with me, and I only wanted to move out to be a slut and sleep with guys. She said she would leave if I did and I wouldn't see her again. In the end I didn't move out.

Eventually when I was 25 I had my first relationship with a guy, he was the first guy I ever slept with. I hid my relationship from all my family.  In the end I realised this guy actually was bad for me and ended it. Since then I dated a few guys but never really found a decent man.

At 26 I moved out and bought my own place, unfortunately around the time I ended up hospitalised with sever depression. Over a year later I am doing well, I've had CBT and changed my life. I love the independence of living alone, albeit still in the same town as my parents. A few months ago I started dating a really great guy. He treats me well, and we dated for about 3 weeks before we first slept together. I decided it was time to tell them I was seeing a guy. At first mum seemed OK with it, but recently that changed.

She still thinks I'm a virgin.. Now she's telling me my boyfriend is only with me for sex and because I told her he was staying last week she really got angry and said he's obviously pressuring me for sex. She had another go about it yesterday and said I was going to end up leaving my family for him. I ended up in tears to my boyfriend who was incredible and really calmed me down.

I had enough since i am little depressed of my current situation. My high school was the biggest mistake i have ever done. I should have choose art school. Instead i chose general highschool with every subject. I pretty much suck i am not interested in any subject. 
I don't have friends here and school is a torture for me. Not talking about my family where my parents argue a lot. 
I have a long termed boyfriend (19) which lives in another country (we are from europe). 
We plan to go to his dad's house since he supports us and he completely loves us and would do first and last for us. Leaving to their country would help me to cure depression since my dad doesnt know about my boyfriend whole time (he would kill me) and i could attend art school there with high level and it could help me to do what i love.
I plan to leave soon. My question is if i leave a letter for my parents with explanation can they call the police to look for me? I really dont know how it works. If you have any ideas and tips please let me know.

It either hasn’t kicked in yet or isn’t working so yeah I still want to kill myself, which leads me to my therapist. I had an appointment today and I really feel like she doesn’t care about me. She wants me to go to an IOP because I am taking up time from her seeing other patients. It really makes me feel happy when she says that every session /s. She tells me the same thing every week and it’s not helping at all.

We haven’t covered anything else, just thoughts. It’s not helping at all, in fact I think it’s gotten worse. But in today’s session I asked to see a new psychiatrist because the one I was put with made me very uncomfortable and she seemed annoyed at that request so I didn’t say anything else about that, we went through the negative thoughts routine as usual, and then she asked me if my mom had gotten me into IOP yet and I said “I’m not sure” because I honestly did not know, and she got angry at me and then started talking about how she wants me in there asap because the time she is using to see me she could be seeing another child apart of one of her pediatric programs. And I wasn’t sure what to say so I just let her essentially lecture me about how she could be seeing someone else, and then the session time was up and she allowed me to leave.

When I was 12, I started having thoughts on suicide. I convinced myself my life was great and they went away, but when it got serious and I couldn’t handle it, I told my parents. They scolded me and shouted that I was crazy. They convinced me to believe that people like that go to asylums. They told me to not even tell my youth group leader because people will take me away from them. I asked them to not tell my siblings, but after around 6 months they spurted it out as an insult during an argument. Something like “your known to believe false things, like when you (air quotes) “thought” you had depression”

They are nice parents, but I guess talking about suicide triggers them

But now I’m 16 and it’s getting the best of me. Randomly for no reason I get extremely sad and I can’t function, I started marking down the days I feel this and it happens in chunks of 2-3 days, every 2 weeks (sometimes shorter). I’m doing things I don’t understand, like pushing away my closest (and only) cousin. Why would I do that??? For the past month I’ve been looking for a way out. Don’t get me wrong I have a good life!!! I have a high paying job, just got my license, a GF, and “A”grades in school with AP classes. But something inside me is saying I’m gonna let everyone down. And it’ll be better if I just end it now instead of having to face defeat.

I’ve been putting out **so many applications**, but I’ve barely gotten any calls for interviews, let alone a job offer. I reworked my entire resume and even have an Associate’s Degree now, but can’t even get hired as a cashier.

557,"Hello, I am a recent college graduate and am attending a teacher job fair in less than a week. I’m stressing out about what to wear to this, because I don’t have an abundant wardrobe for seemingly professional situations like this. Plus, my money situation is not so good right now (which is why I’m going to this job fair in the first place!)

I’m a male, and have dress black pants and dress khaki pants. I have black dress shoes as well. The stress comes in with what to wear on my upper body. I have many nice plain colored polo shirts that I usually wear for business casual events, and no one bats an eye. I only have one white button down shirt. I have a suit that was acquired probably 6-7 years ago before college, and it’s gotten to the point of being slightly uncomfortable to wear. 

My question is, do you think a polo shirt and black or khaki pants would be fine to wear to a teacher job fair? Would the people there even look at me twice for what I am wearing? Or am I stressing a little too much over this?",12Feb2019,1

I know he’s straight for a fact, so I’m sure it’s not actually him.

My question is, should I tell him that someone is using his photos on a gay dating site? I would want someone to tell me if it were me, but my friend who found his photos on their brought up the point that although we can message the account and ask them to take it down, it’s possible they won’t, and so why would we upset him if there isn’t anything we can do about it?

562,"A real first-world problem here I know but I’m afraid I’m going to screw this up somehow. Both of these jobs are 6 month contracts by the way.

Basically, I had an interview yesterday with a pretty big tech company and I believe it went super well. Right after I finished, I received a call from a smaller start-up tech company I interviewed at last week and was offered the position. The only problem is this position is only part time (about 24 hours a week). The big company is full time and the pay is also a little higher. 

I called my recruiter back for the start-up this morning and tried to buy some more time so now I have till end of day today to accept the offer. I also called a different recruiter for the big company and asked him if he could somehow speed up the decision process since it usually takes about a week. He said he would try to find out and let me know. No updates from him yet but I would really love any advice on what I should do. 

I’ve already asked friends and families and I’ve gotten people saying to just trust my gut and wait for the offer that I know is coming. And others say to accept the part-time role and back out last minute if I receive the other offer. I’m not totally sure about doing this simply because I would feel shitty about it. My friends say companies screw people over way harder than that so I shouldn’t feel guilty at all.

Are there any other repercussions if I back out last minute. Even if I sign a contract and go through a background check I still have the decision to back out at anytime I’d like. I understand that the recruiting agency will frown upon it and I will probably never be able to work with them again. I also know that there’s a small chance it would screw me over for a future job but I already have a real job offer lined up which begins in August at a consulting firm so for now I just need something to keep me occupied for 6 months.",12Feb2019,1

So I am 30 years old (M), have a good job, good education. Pretty normal guy for the most part I think. But I just feel lost in life. Like sometimes I’m not sure who I am as a person. Ill sit down and make plans for things to happen (wake up early consistently, read the bible, do devotionals, etc.) but won’t do them or just won’t be consistent with things and fall into bad habits. Other times I’ll act a certain way or say a funny sarcastic joke to someone but realize that that it might have been perceived as mean so will beat myself up over that and try not to do that too often. I know I want to have a kids and get married, so am out there and at least looking but not trying to rush into things and just trying to enjoy my life in the meantime. As I feel like I still have time for that at 30. Just lots of little things like that make me unsure of direction in my life and sometimes I'm not even sure of who I am as a person.

She told me she's not telling my sister anything and that I shouldn't either. And that if I were to say anything she'd say I raped her.

566,"Hi Reddit, I just really need help. 
Background of the stories: I am half Singaporean half Vietnamese. My parents made a mistake years ago, as they didn’t apply for my mother’s Visit Pass/ Permanent Residence so my mum cannot move here for now. We are trying to apply for her. I also have a brother who’s 22 years old this year. My dad, my brother and I lives here in Singapore under a rental scheme under my father’s name. My brother just got married to a girl after knowing her for 4 months, she just successfully got a Long Term Visit Pass. Both of them are not very smart.


1. Because my mum is not here and my dad has always been listening to his friends (most of them are bad friends who usually lure him to buy their products/give them money/gamble), my dad is into some shady shits. There are days where he beat me up because he wasn’t happy. I didn’t reach out, I was scared. 1.5 year ago, he threatened to kick us out of the house because my mother confronted him about his shady shits (we couldn’t do anything as he was and is the main tenant under the rental scheme and my mum didn’t want bad things happening to us). He doesn’t care about us at all. There were days i was sick enough to die, he knew but did nothing. I had to drag myself to doc and feed myself as my bro was @ work. He doesn’t pay bills, do chores,.. no one knows what he does or how much he makes. He doesn’t give us a cent.. These fee days my mum is here for chinese new year, she confronted him as she was suspecting shits. He got angry, called me and my bro out, we fought. He was told to get out of the hse. He agreed. My heart breaks, he’s still my father and my mother still cares about him. She obviously still loves him but this is too much. He made her cry too many times. He exploited her (takes her money and gambles it all). That is the best choice, but my heart aches. What should I do?

2. My brother married a Vietnamese, we all live in the same hse (same room also because the hse is very small). He always listens to his wife blindly and they are both stubborn and childish. However the wife is street-smart. She controls his financial because ‘he is not mature enough’ while he doesn’t know shit about hers (she just started working and got her salary and all). It’d be nothing but her actions make my mother curious. She secretly calls back to her family, promising them to bring back $. She insists on getting her own bank account and doesn’t want any of us to know how much she has. My mother provides her everything. Before meeting my bro, she didn’t know English or had any skills/expertise as she dropped out of high school. Didn’t even travel to foreign country. My mother paid for all expenses (her visiting to Singapore, her studying fees to become a manicurist as she wanted, living expenses,..) After almost a year going to manicuring course, she achieved nothing but a meaningless cert. When asked to do my mum’s manicure, her skills were so bad my mum was so upset. She always has this attitude that she is the best and she knows everything and always right. But she doesn’t know shit. She’s manipulating my bro and he blindly listens cuz the guy wants to satisfy his sexual needs, so he doesn’t listen to his own mother. We don’t know how much she has hidden from us and tonight when we confronted her, she said she is upset but still not having any actions to prove her honesty. Still insist on her keeping all of her money without telling her husband, or spend it on him. What should I do? 

3. Saying this makes me look like a complacent kid (and honestly I am one), but I know and am better than my brother (he dropped out of high school also and is very slow at learning, still childish and blur). I always try to understand my mum, look after my brother and the financial side. 2 years ago, I was assigned a duty to give him $30 a week from his salary and pay the bills. I forgot to give him in 2 weeks, this guy with his needs to smoke a pack a day, threatened to kill me, he hit my head until it bled, after that he acts innocent that he didn’t waste money on ciggs, he used for transportation but it only costed him like $3/week for transport???? and said oh it was all my fault and everyone started accusing me for not being straightforward and shady though I kept record of everything and tried to show them. Because I was schooling and couldn’t make money, I had to live on his income and was ashamed about it so I tried to save every cents I could by starving myself and prevent myself from taking public transport to save. No one believed me. They said I am too sneaky and foxy so I fooled them, I used all those money for my own shits (though records show that I didn’t do it and it all went to bills and giving him money???). Up until now, they still say so. I have a really high self-esteem and it hurts me whenever I hear them saying so. What should I do?

4, i am still schooling and recently have been working part-time to earn money for my own. But I was so greedy, I learned about Forex and tried to make money with it. I won some, lost some and became addicted. After losing all my salary, I used part the saving that my mum gave me to pay my tuition fee on it and lost it. The fee is due in 2 days. If i told my mum, idk what would happen except that she would still give me the money to pay the fee, but she is upset enough and I don’t want this to burden her. I’m still short of S$600, should I take up a loan? Should I tell my mum? What should I do? 

5. I am not an extrovert. I can’t make friends at my new school because I’m afraid that if I let anyone in my life, they will leave sooner or later because I am not a nice person to stick around with. I am always alone in school, my self-esteem is a barrier for me to make friends. Yes, I have my friends from previous school. But we are in different schools/countries now. Every free period/break I’m alone, every period I’m sitting alone quietly though I want to speak to them so bad. I can’t take this loneliness. I want friends but can’t make.

These seem like small things, but because my mum trusts me a lot as everyone sees me as the mature one and I have been trying to act tough for 15 years. These shits all coming together at once is just overwhelming. I’m lost and disappointed at myself, don’t know what to do. I feel helpless and powerless. I want to kill myself.",12Feb2019,1
567,"Hello!

I'm in a bit of a rocky situation with my family and I could use some strangers perspectives. The story is as follows:

My brother gave me, my mom and dad a combined Christmas/birthday present, which was a citytrip and a fun event. The fun event was mostly fun for my mom, since she knows most about it. As faith had it, the fun event was right on my birthday. Way before booking, I let my brother know I did not want the citytrip or the fun event and to just send mom&amp;dad on a fun weekend. My dad initially also did not want to go, but my brother insisted it was perfect for my mom so we should go. I kept saying no, but he still insisted we had to go cause he managed to think of such a nice present. I eventually caved as well as my dad, so we went.

Arriving at the accommodation my brother booked for us, it was quite a shabby location and a shabby apartment. At first we did not have our own bathroom, but with an upgrade we paid there on the spot we managed to get our own bathroom. I was personally quite disappointed we were in such a shabby place on my birthday. An argument started over text and my brothers main arguments were that he could not have known this. Right now, I am in an argument with my mom since my brothers birthday is coming up soon. I'm pretty busy with school so I said I didn't know when I had time. She said they could go with the three of them, because we also did my birthday with the three of us (that I initially did not want to do). I didn't like that and explained why I was still a bit pissed I was put in a shabby apartment on my birthday as a present I did not want to have in the first place. She said some hurtful things over text that had nothing to do with this entire situation and then started about an entire different topic.

What do I do now?",12Feb2019,1

571,"I work at the church my parents go to. It's a big church, and needs a lot of work to stay clean. People reserve and use the building often, so I have to work around people being there, so a few times a month, I have to work until 9-10pm because people use the building that late. It's easier for me to work later in the day (2-6pm) because I have to clean some areas that are being used during office hours, so it's easier to clean something that 's not being used. I work on Saturdays because the building needs to be clean for Sunday services. An office guy has mentioned to one of my coworkers that he's worried about my safety working at the building later in the day. The church isn't in the safest part of town, but it's certainly not the most dangerous. He's also mentioned his concern for my safety to my mom.

I am very vigilant about my safety, and I make sure that everything that can be done for my safety is done.

The issue is, my focus is on Polynesian languages (specifically Tahitian) and the main graduate school I’m looking at is in Hawaii and I’m extremely temperature sensitive. I can’t wear long sleeves all the time if at all.

Ok so I need some advice. 

Growing up both my parents worked full time (most the time they would work more than 40 hours a week) and so they hired a nanny, ill refer to her as nan, when my older brother was born. So for some background, nan has been working for my family for 24 years now and has been as big a part of my life as my biological parents have been (everyone was really invovled, i was blessed with a great support system growing up), but feel it is important to mention that biologically nan and i are not related. With this being said, shes family. I would go to war for this woman in a heartbeat. 

Now here are the issues, recently shes been having some health issues that include falling twice in probably the last 8 months and just recently she got admitted to the ICU for multiple bloodclots. Both falls ended up with her being injured but no broken bones, both times she had multi-week recoveries. Shes somewhat overweight and has had joint and mobility issues for a long time. 

More important information: she lives alone, shes a self-described ""Creature of habit"" and once she gets into a routine she will not change at all. 

So here are the questions I would like help answering:

1. Would it be rude of me if i just got her, without telling her, some sort of device she could wear on her body or was always nearby that could alert someone if something happens? 
2. Should i run this by nan's biological family? she has two kids both who live relatively close (both within a 1.5 hour drive) but I have never been close to either of them. My family is also better off and my mom has already offered to completely cover all the charges related to this idea
3. How do i persuade nan to constantly have this around in case something happens?
4. Has anyone bought products like this and have any reviews they could give me?

589,"TL;dr - Parents were together for almost 40 years. Mom died 2 years ago. Dad getting married again to a 36 year old with an 8 year old kid. My dad is not rich just really lonely. 
MAIN QUESTION: Do I have to go to this wedding? How can I weasel my way out of this? 


-Dad cheated on my mom several times, even had a kid while married. I remember seeing him bring prostitutes into his marital bedroom as a little kid. (Looking back now I realized who they were). Eventually he found Christianity and what not. 

-Dad is 60 years old planning on getting married to a 36 year old with an 8 year old daughter. 

-I honestly could care less about his love life, him getting screwed over financially or whatever else. His life; his business. 

-The wedding will take place in a Caribbean country. It will cost a little over $1200 USD for the trip. 

- I have the money, I just don’t want to spend it and honestly don’t want to wear the terribly ugly suit color he picked. (Not a tie or a pocket square, the WHOLE dang suit is a color and it’s not black, grey or even brown)

- He doesn’t really have anyone else to come on his side. Only 2 people actually. She will have about 15-25 people lol. 

-He is going to marry someone he has never lived with. 

PERSONAL BIAS - When assessing myself I always think about how other people view me. I don’t think my father realizes how much of a catch he is. His oral hygiene has significant room for improvement. He lacks formal education (votes based on 1 or 2 items, doesn’t understand financial markets, is unable to debate most topics from a scholarly standpoint and no clue how to use technology). He has almost zero friends (I mean for Pete’s sake, he has 4 kids and isn’t cool with any of them besides me). He’s a known cheater; as a matter of fact, he cheated on my mom with the girl he’s going to marry almost 30 years ago. She lives in Europe and he lives in the USA. I think he’s horny, lonely and slightly delusional.

I should preface this: this is the FOURTH Tango I've replaced in the last 3 years due to it just going ""missing."" Maybe I lost it, maybe it got thrown out with trash or Goodwill donations. Well, I replaced it last month and it went -- almost immediately -- missing. So I knew, yep, someone took it.

I went into my son's room, did some snooping in his top dresser drawer and found it, its charger and a bottle of Astroglide from my bedroom.

I confronted him with it. Simply saying, ""I'm not here to shame you, you're a teenager, humans have needs, I get it... but I'm entitled to privacy.""

He admitted it! And said he feels violated because I went into his drawer (this is an issue for us since I found drugs there before). 

So my question: am I out of line for doing it? I feel defensive because I stole back something he stole! The fact that it's so intimate an item also has me feeling very violated and disturbed. 

Is this normal? Am I wrong? What next? HELP.

594,"My mom just passed away last week. She was still pretty young and very healthy (early 60's), but died of ALS.   


My dad was her full-time primary caregiver for about 2 years while the disease was very bad (basically he never left her side except for when I or my husband would come by a couple of times a week so he could get out/do errands, etc.) They were married for almost 38 years, together for over 40, and he loved her deeply. My dad is also not very good at being alone - he gets lonely easily, and has never been single for long (even before being with my mom - very much the serial monogamist.)   


I should not we are relatively fine financially.  


I offered for him to move in with my husband and I, as we have an extra bedroom and no kids yet, but he said doesn't want that - doesn't want to ""cramp our young lifestyles."" He still has a desktop publishing/web development company of his own that he does freelancing through, so he does work to keep himself busy. My husband does a similar line of work, and they are collaborating on a project together, which gives my husband a good excuse to see him/reach out often.   


Before my mom got diagnosed, he taught IT at a local college. I might suggest he resume doing that, as he really loved it.   


He plans to do some travelling to visit friends and family, which I fully support.  


I've been trying to still visit him a few times a week, call/text him often, and my husband and I are taking him out for Valentine's Day dinner.  


Is there anything else you can think of that I can do to help him or support him through his grieving? Obviously my mom's passing has been hard on all of us, but it has affected my dad the hardest of all, understandably so.

595,"Hey all, on mobile so apologies in advance. Im *supposed* to graduate this spring with bs in physics and in mathematics, and I am just finishing up the last few classes to get my degree. One of my professors for a required class has been difficult to deal with to say the least. He grades his weekly homework assignments by picking one of the problems at random and having that problem count for 100% of the grade. A little annoying but I have seen it before, just motivates you to triple check your answers and your grade shouldnt be too bad. Our first exam was supposed to cover 3 chapters, and he had only assigned hw for the first 2 chapters, talked about chapter 3 for one lecture and then we had the test next class period. No biggie, I studied all three chapters, did all the problems in the book, should’ve been ready for it. Test day comes and the test is one question, no parts a-e or anything, just one question on the chapter he never assigned hw for. Long story short I got a 50, and now i basically have to ace the next test to have a shot at passing/graduating. If i fail/drop i will have to wait a full year til next spring to take this class again and get my degree, which is obviously not ideal. I have class with him tomorrow, still a little heated and thats clouding my judgement, any ideas on what to say to him? Any help is appreciated.",12Feb2019,1

Hello, I am high school student and I just recently got out of mental hospital that I was in for four weeks because I have been constantly trying to commit suicide. I go back to school Wednesday, and it is currently Tuesday night. I am sitting on my bed trying to complete my homework, and it seems impossible. I am 100+ pages of notes behind in my ap history class, 42 pages of notes behind in my chemistry class, 3 projects and 18 assignments behind in my tech class, and i am missing 6 essays and 34 assignments in my language class. 

 the thing is, my school is dumb and uses trimesters, so i only have until the beginning of march to complete my homework. i asked my teachers when the deadline for everything is, and i only have the day before exams to turn everything in. my tech class teacher is a horrible teacher, and cuts me no slack ever. she told me that i am going to have to find spare time myself to finish missing work. i can't come in after school because my mom works until 6 pm and doesn't get home until 6:30. i also can't walk home because i live in a severely cold climate and i live about 3 km from my school. i also can't come in before school because my mom or dad aren't able to drive me, and my bus is always extremely late. i get to school with 8-10 minutes to spare.

 another issue is i can't have a study hall because it won't work with my schedule at school. i also can't take an incomplete in the classes because i have a full time summer job so i can't do summer school, unless i quit the job but that will be huge risk because i need to support my family some how.

  it is going to be very hard for me to complete all of this work before exams, and i just need advice on what to do. thank you! :)",12Feb2019,1
602,"So I’ve been drawing since 2006. My art has definitely improved since then, but ever since 2016, I seem to have stagnated. I rarely draw bodies or poses, my colors are always flat, and I’m prisoner to the head facing 3/4ths to the left portraits.

I’ve tried practicing; I’m trying to break out of my artistic comfort zone, but I just can’t seem to manage it. Whatever advice I read out there, I try to apply to my own art, but it turns out wrong in a number of ways. I find that the more detailed or dynamic I try to make a piece, the worse it gets. But when I stick to the simple things, the pieces turn out somewhat decent.

However, I don’t want to stick with my current simple style, because I feel it doesn’t get taken seriously, and it won’t bring much attention to my art. But it’s what I’m good at, and trying to branch out hasn’t brought any progress, despite working for it for the past two years.

606,"Hello. So I'm going through a tough patch at this moment, no job, depressed, and I don't know what I can do for my future. 


Currently I have a Bachelors in Biology, and I was applying for a graduate school as one of my last options since my previous applications to another type of graduate school bombed, but after they messed up a part of my application, and did not inform me of it, I was informed after the cycle closed that none of my information was processed and the $800+ that I spent was wasted. 

I'm getting older and now that that has been wasted, I don't know what to do. I regret doing a Bachelors in Biology, but I've been looking up what I can do with it, but I don't know what I need to do. After learning of all that money wasted, all I can see in my future is darkness. 

I've been applying for jobs, yet getting rejected everywhere, and I have no people I can go to to get recommendations. I've wasted so much money on applications to schools that I continue to get rejected from, I've applied to jobs that I am qualified for yet don't get them, and I don't know what I can do to get a stable future for myself.

Honestly I need someone to give some advice on the options that I have and where I can go from here. I have a Bachelors in Biology. What the hell can I do with this now? What are my options? Are there any good graduate programs that I can go to? Is there anything I can apply to immediately so that I don't have to wait for another year looking for jobs and wasting money going nowhere?

607,"So school was never difficult for me just extremely uninteresting. Now I want to go to school but cannot receive any aid because I paid for three classes out of pocket and failed them. Can’t even get loans. Now i’m struggling to find employment. I often find serving jobs but getting there late or missing work leads me to quit or be fired. I’ve had around 23 jobs. Starbucks, your local eatery , a cashier at the airport. I’m like a chameleon imitating the job part for a while then the house of cards comes tumbling down. See I look totally normal good looking, fit, outgoing, very social, good with girls etc. Yet I cannot seem to hold a job. The most money I made was last year about 15k at two serving jobs.     I’m starting to beleive I have some sort of autism and it’s really the only thing that makes sense. Sometimes I take peoples word literally usually when they make a straight faced joke and say something normally, I often have to play the situation out to see if it’s a joke or not. I honestly don’t want to be broke at 30. Seriously just want to win the lottery and make all my problems go away. Like honestly why can’t I just win ? Still my hope im the lottery just leads me to believe I am autistic , maybe it’s OCD. Idk I just have this obsession almost like it’s my life purpose to win the lottery. Still the odds are against me but it literally would fix everything. I’m like the perfect character to play if life was a video game. Just don’t have any money.

611,"~If you aren’t a fan of bisexuality or open relationships, don’t bother with this one.

I’ve felt an incredible connection to this girl (we’ll call her Laura) since we met in Elementary School. At the time, I figured the butterflies I felt in my chest every time I saw her were just a side effect of the thrill of having a new friend. But they didn’t go away. 
We entered middle school together. During those years we kissed a few times in my room. It was a long time ago but I still remember each time vividly. She left for eighth grade, when she was re-districted.  
I then dated a guy for some of eighth grade and almost all of freshman year. It was a good relationship and I genuinely thought I liked him a lot, but I spent more of that year and a half thinking about Laura than I care to admit. When we reunited Freshman year, I came to learn that she was also dating someone else. 
The guy and I eventually broke up and I dated a different girl for a few months in the summer. The relationship was pretty unhealthy and there was a rather large age gap. It’s not a choice I’m proud of. But Laura and another friend of mine (we’ll call him Lenny) helped get me out of the relationship. 
Laura was still with her girlfriend and began to distance herself from me, so I got closer with Lenny. Eventually Lenny and I developed an open relationship. This felt like the best plan to me because at that point I knew I had feelings for Laura, but I also knew that Lenny was good for me. 
Shortly after this started, Laura started to have issues with her relationship. Her girlfriend would cheat on her and then threaten suicide when Laura tried to leave. I did my best to help her as she had helped me. It didn’t go as planned. 
Laura and I had what I can really only describe as a “thing” for about a month while she sorted out her relationship. Finally, she broke up with her girlfriend. I was excited to learn this, because I hoped that she and I could now be together, but then she met someone else and broke things off with me abruptly. 
I decided then that I would work on my relationship with Lenny and that I shouldn’t try to pursue anything else. My relationship with him was still open, and remains so to this day, but I stopped looking for love from other people and it’s been pretty peaceful. 
Until now.
Laura and her most recent girlfriend broke up two weeks ago. And now she’s posting old pictures of us from when we were together and telling people that she misses me. And today we’re supposed to hang out in private at her request. 
I’m worried I’m just something to hold her over until she finds someone else. And I’m worried that the feelings I have for her will ruin the healthy and loving relationship I already have with Lenny.

612,"My boyfriend (22M) and I (23F) recently graduated from college and moved about 45 min from our college town to Kansas City Mo. I found a job I really like making $50k and he's recently started a job as well, making a little less than that. My job situation is great, I am off at 4 every day and we both only drive 15-20 min each way to get to work.

Anyway, I'm turning 23 today and have started thinking a lot about our life and how it's going. We like our apartment and our jobs, and overall things have been going really well so far.. almost too well, like we're too comfortable. I started worrying that we will do the typical midwest thing and stay in the KC area, get married in a few years, have kids and move to one of the suburbs outside of KC, and that'll be it. I absolutely hate the weather in the midwest, and I am more of an outdoorsy person, so the arts and BBQ culture here isn't really my thing. I love mountains, beaches, etc. and it would be so nice to live somewhere where I'm not stuck inside 3 months out of the year. But the cost of living is great, traffic isn't bad, and like I mentioned, we have been doing really well. We just don't really do that much. Maybe it's because it's the end of winter, but for the last 3 months all we've done on the weekends is go to the gym, watch tv, etc. 

I visited Santa Cruz CA for work over the summer, and I was amazed at how different it was. We could see the beach AND mountains from our hotel. The people there all seemed so happy and there was so much to do. After work we went to a beach party and hiked in the most beautiful park I've ever seen. And this was totally normal for our coworkers who lived there. But wow, the cost of living is crazy. In KC we could buy a house even with what we're making now. I can't imagine even affording rent in CA.

We talked about the idea of moving away from KC someday, and he said that he definitely isn't opposed to it. I'm just not sure when the opportunity would arise. I guess I'm just worried that we are missing out on a whole different lifestyle and choosing comfortability and convenience over the challenge of leaving for somewhere we'd potentially love even more. but then again, expectations aren't always reality, and I couldn't even imagine spending 3k a month on a place to live. 

I'm just curious if anyone has thoughts or personal experience on this situation.

613,"I am so conflicted. My BIL is one of the nicest people on this planet. He would help anyone at any time. The problem is, he constantly forgets about himself or puts his needs at the back burner. I talked to him tonight.
It had been awhile and I wasn’t up to date with all his new stuff going on. He’s supposed to be getting married and I thought he was happy. He’s not...at all. He sounds like someone on the verge of a mental break. In his culture, he’s supposed to marry who the family likes from a family of their choosing. He’s only doing this to make them happy. He said as long as everyone is happy, it doesn’t matter if he is.
Believe me, when I heard this I had plenty to say. I know what he is doing is 100% unhealthy. I also know it’ll probably blow up in his face. I told him that it wouldn’t be fair to the girl either since he doesn’t actually love her. The girl is accepting the same deal. She’s doing this to make her family happy and doesn’t see any red flags with BIL...so I guess she’s thinking it’ll be fine.
Here’s where it gets a little more complicated. He’s totally in love with someone else and he’s been in love for over four years. He begged his family to accept a marriage between them but they said no. His response was that he would never get married and if he ever does, it’s not because he wants it.
This situation hurts me. He told me because his brother broke the rules to marry me. Out of everyone we probably have the healthiest marriage and we are truly happy. I want for him what I have for myself. Someone this good and this nice deserves true happiness. He cried quite a bit and is forcing himself to accept the other situation because he doesn’t want the family to get angry with him. 
I told him I would support whatever decision he makes and his brother would as well. I want him to know he would never be chastised by us for being himself. I did warn him about the marital and psychological toll this decision will take on him. He wants the other girl but won’t do anything about it because he’s afraid of his family.
I couldn’t imagine myself marrying someone I didn’t love to make others happy. He said he wished he had a different heart and that this heart of his will only keep him in hell. I know I can’t make decisions for him. I gave him my best advice and let him know he can always call or come talk. I just wanted to get this out.

614,"My mother’s boyfriend of 3 years has had a constant struggle with alcoholism. Over the years, he has lost most of his family relationships through the wake of his addiction. Him and my mom were friends and decided to take it to the next level and have been living with each other ever since. He has drunk and drove on several occasions and lost my family dog multiple times while under the influence. He finally went to rehab and was sober for about six months before he began drinking again. He was in AA but quickly had a falling out with his sponsor and stopped going to meetings. He has been drinking on and off ever since (about a year).

Last week, he got in a drunk driving accident. He had my family dog in the car with him and struck a parked vehicle while blackout drunk. There was a woman with her small child in the other car but he drove off before she could get the license plate. There were no serious injuries to anyone involved (including the dog). She called the police and they eventually caught up with him after he got home with his car visibly damaged.

Here’s where things get a little more messed up: he’s a firefighter in my town and is friends with most of the police officers. When they realized it was him, they chalked it up as a hit-and-run which eliminated the fact that he was so drunk he couldn’t stand. I believe he should be back in rehab immediately but he doesn’t want to go. My mom is now defending his decision not to go claiming “you can bring a horse to the water but you can’t make him drink” (poor choice of words, Mom).

This is unacceptable in my book. That innocent woman and her child could have been killed and so could my dog. For him to get off scot free makes me sick to my stomach and anyone else would be in a jail cell. I understand that police and firefighters have a code with one another and look out for eachother but at the very least he should use this golden opportunity to go get the help that he needs. I’m certain that something like this will happen again and I’m afraid someone will get seriously hurt next time.

I grew up with an alcoholic father and my mom threw him out because of his drinking. To see her accepting this behavior when she claimed it ruined her first marriage is shocking to me. I simply don’t want this type of presence in my life, the life of my fiancé or my future children. I feel like a line has been drawn. She isn’t condoning the behavior (she says he did something horrible) but also isn’t doing anything to make him go to rehab when she has that type of influence on him. It is also worth noting that I have a somewhat rocky relationship with my Mom due to various other events in our lives.

I don’t know what to do from here. As long as this type of behavior continues, I don’t want it to be a part of my life. But I love my Mom and am afraid this is going to cause a rift in the family. She won’t force him to get help and he is a ticking time bomb. The police don't seem to help but if I do nothing, somebody could get hurt.

625,"Hello everyone, I (25 M) did kinda of an immature thing in hindsight where I called out my friend (25F) for ignoring my text messages for quite some time. After the interaction and me saying stupid shit like ""you're being rude and disrespectful,"" I feel like I was being too harsh. 

She apologized and we just kinda left the conversation there where I told her I still want to be friends and that's it. Of course, she works at the local corner store where I frequent and she was there working. I knew that we would eventually see each other in real life again. Everything was super cordial and it was like nothing happened. My questions I guess now is: should I initiate the conversation, should I invite her to things that I am doing, should I ask her if we are okay? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure where to go from here. I think in my heart I know we are cool, but I want to to know if I should give some pause to the interaction between me and her and just give her some space before I initiate anything.

I want to help him but I also think he needs to speak to a poc who could guide him out of his ignorant mindset. If there are any volunteers please let me know, every time I've tried to talk to him about this he just says things like ""So you wanna detail that opinion a bit more about the ""disadvantages"" that is to blame for blacks overly distributed rates of criminality and economic hardship in areas where the system isn't the main nor primary contributor"" or "" Why is 13% of the population doing 50% of the crime?""

631,"Ok, so my birthday is this weekend (Saturday), and about two months back my dad presented the idea of going to Florida for the weekend for a family vacation. Due to the nature of my dad’s work, we can’t vacation during the summer as a family because he gets ridiculously busy. 

When my dad initially brought up the idea, he said I could take my girlfriend along, or a friend. The sad reality is that I had to separate from my lifelong friend group, because they now only want to drink and party on the weekends. Actually, it was more so they separated from me, because I don’t want to drink and party, and they think I’m no fun anymore. 

About a couple weeks ago, me and my girlfriend broke up, which put me in the dumps. It sucked knowing that the trip to Florida could have an empty seat. 

My parents at supper the night after the breakup asked who I was thinking on bringing to Florida, I then confessed that me and my girlfriend broke up, and I told them that I was too busy to be able to ask around. My mom gave me an ultimatum to find someone or else my younger sister would get to take a friend along. 

I later brought up that I would rather stay home, which made the dinner table go silent for a second, and then my dad dismissed it, and kept prodding me to think of someone. He mentioned that my friend, Kevin, would enjoy hanging out with me “for old times sake”. I had to tell my dad that me and my lifelong friends no longer see eye to eye, as a conflict of interests has started to emerge the past couple of years. 

Couple days after that, I did think of a friend that tends to be behind the scenes in my life, his name is Tyler. I mentioned that to my parents. They both told me that he couldn’t go with us. 

Now, to fully understand why they won’t let him come, Tyler’s mom runs an auto insurance company in town, and my parents thought it’d be great to also have a client relationship stemming from their friendship. Some years later, and my mom got in a car accident, and basically Tyler’s mom backstabbed my mom, which caused everyone to hate each other now. Except me and Tyler of course. 

Back on task, I tried so hard to get my parents to bring Tyler along, they kept reminding me that because of his family his presence brings up bad memories. I finally gave in and told them that I wouldn’t have anyone to bring along then. My parents pretty much told me “too bad”. 

I then gave in, I accepted that my sister would be able to have an annoying friend come along on a vacation meant for celebrating my birthday. 

Fast forward to this past Sunday, and I stood my ground a little bit, I made it clear that Tyler is my choice of a friend I’m bringing to Florida. My parents of course said it wasn’t going to happen, and so I said either Tyler comes along, or I’m not going. 

My dad cuts in and exclaims “well, if you really feel that way, we’ll go to Florida without you, we’ll be sure to bring back some souvenirs for you. Celebrate your birthday with Tyler for all we care!” 

This made me sad, so I caved. Well, Monday came around, and I got word that my sister now has the pick of which friend to bring. Turns out, my sister chose a friend ahead of time, and they prepped on letting teachers know that my sister’s friend might miss school. 

I got pushed into calling out my parents on this, and how they can’t even be bothered with letting me be happy. I pointed out their hypocrisy in clearly stating ANY friend. Which at this point, my dad told me to “sit my ass at home” for my birthday. 

So fast forward to today, we leave Friday morning. This Tuesday morning I had a dream that I was fishing off the piers of Florida, not a care in the world. I realized that I could still go to Florida, and have fun, despite what’s happened. 

I made an apology to my parents, but honestly, I figured I was still going on the trip. I asked if they managed to book the Airbnb. My dad tauntingly mentioned how neat the place is they got for rent, and how I won’t be able to enjoy it. 

I was half confused, and asked what he meant, I asked if we were doing this for my birthday. My dad said it still is for my birthday, but the catch is I don’t get to go. I told him how it doesn’t make sense that I can’t go on a trip meant to celebrate my birthday. My dad basically told me that I was determined to hangout with Tyler, so I get to do that “back here”. My dad followed up, and said that both him and mom got set on this decision, and now it’s final. 

It sucks, I didn’t pay any attention in my high school classes. I mean, since getting accepted into college, and being told I’m not at risk of my acceptance being rescinded over bad grades, I haven’t put much effort in. It’s just, today was worse. I’m on release periods starting during my high school’s scheduled lunch break. 

I went straight to bed, and I haven’t moved. Being uninvited from my own party is so weird, you’d never think that someone could possibly be uninvited from their own party. 

I don’t play much video games, but at this point I’m starting to like the idea of having pizza and video games at my parents’ house... with Tyler as well. I think we’ll do this all weekend as well. 

It still doesn’t help me at this point get over being uninvited from a trip to Florida, we’ve only been there a handful of times since no family live there. 

How do I cope? I was never rude towards my parents at anyone point. Yet, I still feel like I’ve done wrong.

632,"From the first time I met him I got a creepy vibe from him even though he didn't say or do anything at the time to make him a creep. 

The first time I knew he definitely is was when I went out for drinks with colleagues and he kept staring at me and saying things which made me uncomfortable enough to make someone swap seats with me the opposite side of the table. 

For example; there was an adorable little puppy on the table opposite us, so I kept looking over and smiling cos, well, it's an adorable little puppy! He asked ""So is there a guy over there you want to take home?"" I replied ""Umm, no. There's a puppy."" He then said or asked something else that was off (I don't really remember exactly what as it was a while ago and I'd had a few glasses of wine) I just remember that I wanted to get off of the chair I was sat in next to him. This was before I knew he would be my new line manager. 

Since being more at the location I work in and being my new manager he has made me feel more uncomfortable. He looks me up and down, has an even more creepy vibe and asks me more creepy things. For instance, yesterday's conversation which went like this:

Him: How was your weekend?

Me: Was alright, thanks. Still tired from the party I went to Saturday.

Him: Guessing you were worse for wear yesterday then?

Me: Yeah

Him: (What I thought he said) Was it worth it?

Me: Yeah, it was a decent party.

Him: No, I said was HE worth it?

Me: Er, I wasn't with any ""he"". 

He didn't reply and just made some weird face. 

What's the best way to make him know/tell him he needs to stop being a gross pervert?

633,"Hi all, to start off this explanation, I want to explain that my dad has done this since I've had a bank account, but would always pay me back after he got paid from a job (he is an independent contractor) and I've never had a problem with it, until the past few months.

&amp;#x200B;

He owes me over 2,000$, I am a full time student, and I work close to 30 hours a week so I can save up money (I am very paranoid about money, I want to be somewhat secure even as a student). He has slowly been taking money out of my account since october, however I did not understand the severity of the situation of until lately.

&amp;#x200B;

My father is a very kind man, though he has been in credit card debt for a very long time, he is also addicted to vicodin, him and my mother are still together, though the relationship has been rocky despite these recent issues. My mother is a local politician, she is very well known throughout the community, her image is important to her. Though she pushes herself into work to ignore the growing issues in our family (mainly my fathers troubles). He steals my moms vicodin (that she needs for her sciatica), and he has used my moms credit cards in an abusive manner (spending over the limit, something of that sort), she gave him these credit cards to use in case of an emergency (specially for me and my sister). He now owes my mom over 50k because of his spending, just since October. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has a decent head on her shoulders, she is good at budgeting, has good credit, no addictive traits, etc etc. They are both opposites now. My dad's drug abuse has been a constant for years, I remember vividly him almost passing out at the wheel while taking me to and from school (too much valium?). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, despite this all, I believe my fathers debt is even worse than me and my mom imagined. My mom got a call from a ""loan shark"" (my fathers coworkers brother) threatening her and my and my sister, unless she was able to pay off the entirety of his debt. She had already given them 10k, apparently my father lied to my mom (typical) about how much the entirety of the debt was, and he refuses to give her more information.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I fear somewhat for the safety of me and my sister, and of course they threatened to go public with it (because my mother is running for reelection in a few months), we have had similar issues before (people stalking my mom, general weird things because of her position), but this deems to be more serious than anything in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I will not get my money back this time, I dont know if there is any solution to this.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has refused for years to get my father help, which he needs, he is addicted to vicodin because of his chronic pain, and I'm sure its due to self medicating as well (because I am sure he is also depressed). 

&amp;#x200B;

The first step is to separate our joint account, but I don't know if I can do much more than that. I am frustrated that I have so many hours wasted busting my ass trying to keep up my grades and working was all for nothing, just to help him pay his bills, or pay off whoever. I am frustrated that my mother never cared until it fully involved her to this extent. I know that I cannot control the actions of others, but I want out. I was saving up to be able to move out (granted I have a few grand in savings and in the app ""digit"", but I want everything back.)

&amp;#x200B;

not sure if this is the best sub to post this in, but I appreciate any kind words or advice that can be given

TLDR; My father is addicted to vicodin, is in debt to a loan shark, and owes me 2k and my mom 50k, his situation is getting worse (debt and addiction) and my mother, me, and my sisters safety has been threatened by said loan shark",12Feb2019,1

644,"Long story short: a friend of mine is getting harassed by someone she doesn’t know online. 

It all happens on instagram, where this person regularly creates fake accounts to follow her / send her creepy dm’s. 
Setting her account to private didn’t help as the person still somehow got the info from the things she posted (so the stalker probably knows or is one of her ‘follower friends‘)
She now deleted her account, and recreated another one set to private right away.
Now again a fake account tried to follow her, which has posted a pic with her profile pic blended in a different kind of background (so it is clear what this is about).

The question is: is there any way to find out who it is? Especially if it is a person she knows (most probably) it would be easier to clear things of once an for all. Most importantly it would make it possible to press charges.
To find out the ip address / anything. 
She’s kind of at a loss atm, and considering the circumstances and her powerlessness in the situation it’s kind of understandable.

I tried so hard to fix everything but she has really bad mental problems, her cousin suicided, her mom treats her like shit and she tried to kill herself twice. I wanted to help her.

When I returned to work we started talking again, she told me that she was sorry about everything and we agreed on trying to make it work out again, obviously it didn't and after our last argue happened the same, one week later she returned with her ex.

At this point I already knew that we couldn't be together and embraced it. But after a few weeks she was talking out loud again with a co-worker that her ex was going to work in there. After hearing this I really didn't know what to do so I quit.

646,"As a background, my childhood has definitely not helped my situation. I have had parents who were very demanding of success from me from a young age. This made me afraid of failure and disappointing people. From the ages of 11 to 16 I have received consistent bullying that has ranged from verbal to physical abuse over the way i look. I have always been nerdy, but during my youth I also had glasses and braces which really didn't help me out. I was always called repulsive and useless which didn't effect me so much at the time, but has since created deep insecurities within me.

At the time of writing this, I am 18 and have almost no confidence. It is now engrained in my head that I am repulsive and almost useless. The only way my confidence is ever raised is through compliments, as if someone calls me something positive (which is extremely rare) it assures me momentarily that my insecurities of being ugly and good for nothing are false. However, my lack of social presence and growing loneliness has meant that most of my interactions with people are negative for me. I struggle to make new friends as the bullying has made me presume people don't want to hang out with me, as if I am almost a burden on them by simply being present. The lack of good friends, girlfriends and supportive parents means no one in my life supports me and assures me I am doing well, with my feelings only becoming worse when I see people receiving love from friends and family which I an seemingly lacking. 

As I continue to get older, and the stress in my life to succeed during exams and other stressful experiences increase, I fear I will reach an even lower low, and I honestly don't want to know what that looks and feels like.

648,"So I am currently a lab manager at a prestigious university and have been applying to graduate programs. I had an interview yesterday about a sponsor for an MS program I had applied for. These people wanted me to work in their lab and were asking me questions like “why do you want to work with us?” Etc. And I was replying enthusiastically like you do in an interview. 

The kicker- they want me to start now and offered me no benefits and a huuuuuge pay cut from my current salary. I am a type one diabetic so I really need health insurance. However, during the interview the hourly rate was made clear but not the hours/week- it’s part time. This was made clear after the interview where I already agreed on an hourly rate. I assumed it was full time (benefits, no salary cut) Also, I can’t quit my job now as I would need to train someone new and that would take at least a couple months for my boss to hire someone and me train them. I was expecting to start in August when school starts. When they asked me in the interview how soon I can start, I said maybe April? But even that is too soon. 

I find out next month if I get into a different grad program and I would prefer to be in that one. It includes a TA position with health insurance, a stipend, and free tuition. I am holding out for that program. Also, the guys who interviewed me were strange and I didn’t like them much.

One of my parents is a doctor so I would think if it’s for that then they’d know to do it laying down. 

It came back into my mind because of something my parent said to me, they asked why I lock my door and if “I’m scared they’re going to rape me” which I thought was a very weird thing to say and brought back this memory and Ive been thinking about it ever since and I’m not sure how to figure it out.

656,"So hey I guess idk I guess let's just jump straight into this shit (long read just skip to bottom if you can't be bothered)

So basically my family has always been pretty fucked up but I didn't care to much I guess I sort of trained myself to literally not give a fuck about almost anything which has its pros and cons but that isn't the point. So up untill 3 weeks ago I've been living with my mom and sister going to a school in a good neighborhood with alot of resources and shit for learning and I was decently happy with my situation sure my sister despised me and my mom was in and out of the hospital but whatever I didn't care until 3 weeks ago when I just got out of school and for some reason my dad picked me up obviously I'm confused because I haven't seen this dude in basically years now(not of my own choice) and he said well your mom said to stay with me a while so I say ok( no fucks given) a week goes by and I can't get a hold of my mom so I just go to my house and start knocking (didn't have my key on me at the time) *completely ignored* so I fuck off and come back the next day with the key and just go in and to make a medium length convos with a lot of pauses short my mom basically told me her plan of disowning me and my sister and moving at this point I'm just fucking proplexed as this came out of nowhere besides the daily barrage of ""you were a mistake"" ""you ruined my life"" and the cherry on top ""I never loved you"" so as I can't do much I just get my clothes guitar and some other shit and fuck off of course I'm not happy about it but what can you do my dad complains about the long drive to school and said he's going to transfer me so goodbye friends and after a couple days of living at my dad's I realized I wasn't really welcomed my step mom obviously really doesn't like me she eyes me whenever I'm in view and never speaks to me unless my dad is there not surprising though as she is expecting my step brother which I just found out about in like 1 month and if this shit wasn't hard enough to deal with now I have drama at school and from an outside prospective I seem like the dick in the situation so the one place I go to escape the bitter reality of my life has been corrupted as well now it seems like almost every one I know hates me doesn't talk to me or is just putting up with me now for the cherry on top of this filthy Frank cake is that I've been like really suicidal since like I was 11 and of course now those thoughts pop up again just at the right time to almost make me want to do it who knows which way the scales will tip though 

To summarize for you people who can't follow my writing (I don't blame you)
-Got disowned
-Most people aren't very found it me at the moment including most of my family
-Grades are getting fucked
-Transfering schools
-Suicidal
-Also not getting any sleep because of the above mentioned to the point where I'm getting sick and I got hella bags
Did I mention I'm 14 that could probably be assumed but I'll save you the hassle

I’m trying to read things and come to terms with it instead of just being in denial, but now I feel so much pressure on the time I have here. And I just feel extremely anxious. It helps me talking to those who don’t have the fear, but then I keep coming back to the internet to watch videos and read things trying to face my fear and accept that I am mortal. It doesn’t seem to be helping.

I want to go back to not thinking about death 24/7 and hanging out with friends and making memories. And be like those I know who aren’t are terribly afraid as death as I am.

I mean thinking about this has made me try and be a better person and nicer to my parents, but other than that it’s greatly worsened my quality of life because I spend most of my time freaking out now instead of working on advancing my career or filling enjoying time with friends.

He goes on walks of 5-7 miles a day, dog park every day. I thought he would be happy and it would help him get over losing his friend. The opposite happened, and now he has severe separation anxiety (never had this before), to the extent I can't leave him alone for more than an hour without a complaint from the neighbors.  In the last 3 months we have tried adaptil diffusers, CBD, Kong's, exhaustive exercise. Finally trying Prozac now. He can't go to daycare because it's too stressful and he does not get along with all dogs. In a month I will need to go back to work in an office and I have no idea what to do.

Most recently when we hung out, I tried really hard not to pay too much attention to the fellow, avoided eye contact, etc. I might have tried to hard to ignore him, but I want to keep my crush under wraps and I’m terrified someone will figure it out if I’m too friendly.

Since then, I’ve sent him a couple messages about hanging out or working on a project together and he hasn’t answered any of them for a few days. I’ve still been talking to the lady of the duo, like nothing is different.

I’m trying to be rational; he’s probably busy. But I can’t help but feel like maybe I did something wrong. I’m terrified that I fucked up what seemed to be a really promising friendship.

673,"I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MULTITASK.
There I said it. I don’t know how to pay attention to multiple things at the same time. When actively focusing on a task I use ALL my mental resources on this task. There is a benefit: I have immense concentration. If I i.e start reading a book. I will not stop till it’s done or I get tired. There is a big downside: in work-settings or social settings that require attention on multiple things my ability to multitask makes me falls short.

Some examples:

When I’m watching a movie with my girlfriend she feels invisible bc I’m so engaged. She sometimes jokes that I have a low brain capacity.

When playing a sport staying attentive on the ball, players and at the same time planing future plays, my brain goes left and right at the same time.

WHY do I engage in everything I do actively with this undived attention and spend more mental capacity than I can afford? 

Something I have learned to cope, is to make things a habit, so that I do some things unconsciously and can use my conscious focus elsewhere, but again this takes time to develop.

People perceive me as ‘slow-minded’ and I may very well be. I’m looking for tips on how to more efficiently use my mental resources, to keep me motivated and getting more done faster. Also is there a term for this, so I can do some research?",12Feb2019,1
674,"This feeling has been growing consistently, and has made me distant, reserved and unsociable around others. I've been hurt by a lot of people these past few years, some of whom I thought actually cared about me. Those experiences have left me with a cold heart.

Human suffering doesn't affect me anymore. I've become numb. I attended a funeral back in November 2018. A close friend's father had died and I was asked to attend. So naturally I did. When they were lowering the casket, my friend gave a speech about all the things her father had taught her. Everyone was crying. Everyone...except me. 

I felt no pity, no sympathy, nothing. Just blankly stared at the wailing crowd... thinking to myself: ""When will all of this be over?"". When the thought crossed my mind, I felt chilled to the core.

I never said anything, of course. But I'm getting concerned that this will affect all my relationships, current and future. Frankly I do NOT want that. Sadly, my responses have become instinctual. No matter how much willpower I use I still come off as cold. I don't want the people close to me to have to endure this... disposition.

Problem is I have no idea how to resolve this mess. Positivity doesn't work. Talking it out hasn't solved anything other than putting it out in the air.

675,"I've got no one else I can talk to anymore so I'd really appreciate it anyone could give me some advice. One of my first memories was being told I have boobs while playing with my friends when I was 5. I knew then I was a freak and that this fact would be a part of my whole life from then on. Kids would point it out all through school, and I've never really thought of myself as a real person, like some kind of third gender that consisted of only me. I'm not even a nice person so you don't have to feel sorry for me. And I’m not suicidal (yet) I just want the life that I deserve. I deserve a fucking medal for the amount of emotional pain I’ve been through. But now I know I’ll never even have an average life, now I’m scarred by the first 23 years. 

When I was 16 I finally worked up the courage to try and fix the problem, and went to doctor. I’m fucking shocked it wasn’t picked up earlier when I’ve had it all my life. Telling my parents was the hardest thing I’ve ever done and my mum stony-faced said she didn’t think there was any problem, but she came to a follow up appointment at the doctors. The doctor confirmed I had gyno but there was no genetic problem. He said the NHS doesn’t do cosmetic surgery but I could wait 6 months to see a counsellor if I wanted. On the ride home I asked my mum if we could go private (they definitely had the money) and she said no. She asked me (once) if I wanted to see a counsellor while I was in tears, which wasn’t like me. And that was it, the climax of my life so far just dismissed in a couple of hours. I don’t think I processed this properly and just carried on my life as usual. I stayed inside, wore specific types of clothes that would hide it, and never even considered that I would one day get a girlfriend.

So I left for university and left all my friends behind and never made any again. I dropped out after 6 months, it was impossible, I don’t know why they even let me in after my mediocre school results. I also thought I was ugly, but the first girl I ever asked out last year said yes and clearly fancied me. I’m 6’2 and now consider myself to have an attractive face. That date really fucked me up, she couldn’t have given any clearer signs that she wanted to have sex but I just carried on making out. On the 2nd date she ended it because I was a pussy, she said it nicer than that but that was the gist of it. And I now remain a virgin.

I still live at home, and my parents have been wonderful apart from this one issue. I really feel like I’m going mental, why didn’t they help me? They never asked me about my mental health when I stayed inside all through my teenage years, or when I dropped out of uni. Do they just not care? I really don’t fucking get it. It’s pathetic that I even care about it at my age but the truth is it’s ruined my life. I’ve got some real mental damage from it, I’ve definitely not like normal people. I’ve finally got over my alcohol/weed addiction (probably why I’m having a bit of a breakdown right now haha). Should I hate my parents? They’re all I have in my life though. Is it even worth trying hard in life now, I can’t make friends or get a girlfriend because I’m so weird. I just want to go back to being 16 and tell how important this problem is.

I met Lucy at the start of this year we hit it off but only as friends but we’re like best friends and we can tell each other anything. December of last year she started dating a guy and I’ll call him Cory.  Cory and Lucy went off on their first date and it worked out. At first I was happy for her because I didn’t know Cory that well but I did know he was extremely popular. Now Cory was notorious in our school amongst everyone as even though he was a freshman he was taking snaps with varsity football. Cory also does a lot of drugs like constantly and recently got a weeks suspension for vaping in a bathroom during class. Lucy always told me she would never want to date a guy who’s like this but this doesn’t send red flags to her. He also treats her like she’s just an object. He even created a whole rumor that him and Lucy had sex which I doubt but I don’t really know either way it reflects badly on him but still no red flags. Then I started to learn more about Cory from a friend who went to middle school with him. He told me that Cory constantly spent time hitting on girls and try to sucker them in towards them. In middle school he would lure girls to him just so they could send him nudes or he could “help” her lose her virginity. He always has a girl come onto him and then leave her in 2-3 months because they won’t sucker up to him but at that point it’s already too late. We share a lot of mutual friends but she’s slowly losing these friends so that she can be with Cory and his friends. In the end when he breaks her there’s no one that’s going to be there for her. I just realized I forgot to mention that Cory is about 1.5 years older than her but we’re still in the same grade. 

I NEED to tell her that she needs to end this. There is no doubt in my mind that he is going to harm her at some point whether that’s mentally or physically.  She needs to know but I’m scared that I’ll ruin our friendship if I tell her what she doesn’t want to hear.

I switched to studying biology but it’s pointless because I’ll never get a job because I’ll be too old by the time I graduate. Because I wasted time due to being an idiot. I mean, when (if) I start my phd I’ll be in my 30s - that’s pathetic and nobody’s gonna want to deal with that.

I’ve been unemployed for over a year and am likely unemployable now because I’ve been out so long. I’m also ill frequently so that’s difficult.

I still live at home because I don’t make enough money to move out because I’m a loser and I can’t stay with anyone because I have no friends.

I can’t drive because of anxiety (excuse) and because I’ll probably fail anyway because I’m stupid.

I’m still a virgin and I’ve never dated. I’m scared to lose my virginity mostly because I’m afraid of getting pregnant but mostly because I don’t trust the guy I lose it to not to run off and talk badly about me. I’ve never dated because I’m ugly.

I'm a freshman in college right now. On October 25, 2015, when I was a sophomore in high school, I received a 16-second long voicemail. It sounded like someone sobbing or crying, obviously very distraught. 8 seconds in they manage to choke out ""Is this... (my name)?"" Then the person gulps and says something that to me sounds like ""Oh my god, I can barely-"" and then it ends. I have nightmares about this voicemail.

I've called and texted this number a few times over the years, but to no avail.

Today, I decided to call again. No answer. I called again. No answer. A few minutes later, I get a call back from the number. I introduced myself and told her about the voicemail. She told me she didn't know me, recognize my voice, and didn't have any idea as to who could have sent it. Her name is Gabby and she went to St. Ann High School, although now she is a freshman in college like me. I told her my name and I went to East High School. Her voice was not familiar to me either, nor did it sound like the person in the voicemail. I told her that I would send her a recording of it when we hung up, and I did so.

She listened to the voicemail. After listening, she texted me to ask if I knew Peter Reilly, a boy who had also gone to East and graduated a year or two before me. I wasn't friends with him. We weren't even acquaintances, but I did know him. We auditioned for the same plays at East and we were even assigned to do a scene together for an audition. St. Ann's is an all-girls private school, so when they put on plays and musicals, they need boys from other schools to audition there. Peter had done plays at plays at Gabby's school with her, so that's how they know each other.

She told me that around 2 months after I received my voicemail, she had received some sinister voicemails from Peter’s number. She said that one was a little girl’s voice saying her name over and over again, and another one where the voice said: “I killed someone.” Gabby has since deleted all of her voicemails.

Peter has always seemed like a kind, unthreatening person. We agree that he’s not behind this and that Peter’s number was probably spoofed to send voicemails to Gabby. Gabby’s number was probably spoofed to send voicemails to mine.

  
SO. Here are my questions/what I need advice on:

* Could my number have been spoofed to contact someone like Gabby’s was? Is there a way that I can talk to anyone who may have been contacted by someone pretending to be me?
* This is all probably a dumb prank, but what are the chances that this could be part of something bigger?
* I want to investigate further? Where do I start? What kind of connections should I try to make?
* Should I even investigate at all? This happened over 3 years ago, what could come from looking further now?
* Are there any ACTUAL cases similar to this somewhere, whether it be real life or just stories? Because if this rings a bell, maybe it’s proof that someone is playing a dumb prank.

To save some money my mother hired an independent mover ($300) while a moving company was ($500). What was promised to be delivered in 4 days was two weeks late and dropped off at midnight. It was supposed to be in a moving truck, it was plastic wrapped on an old trailer full of motorcycles.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My amazing $900 mattress was crystal white when we handed it over, and soft as a cloud. It was delivered with the underside wet, on top which was soft as a cloud the upper material now feels like a rock and has some type of grainy powder on it.

Whenever I actually have the motivation to go grocery shopping the food usually just rots in my fridge. I havent checked the mail in weeks, my plants are dead, and even things that used to make me happy that id do in my free time are now just chores.
 I think it started because I used to be homeless. I was so motivated that I got a job, got an apartment, and won 50/50 custody of my son. I worked so hard to get where I am, I just wanted to sit and enjoy my homr for a bit... And that's all I've been doing since. 
It's a lot less severe when I have my son, but still it's a major problem in my life. 
I've googled ""how to get motivated"" and it's all the same stuff that revolves around meeting life goals and exercising, but I'm perfectly motivated outside of my house.

I'm a junior in University studying  Mechanical Engineering. Engineering students live and die by their  internships, trying to get a full time position without one can be  terribly difficult. I have prepared and have been fortunate enough to  accept an internship for summer 2019.

During  my time as a student I came into contact with a smaller company's CEO.  After I explained my desire to land an internship he tried to help me by  giving me notices of various openings at his company. For a variety of  reasons, things never aligned and I never worked for his company.

Our  university career fair was this past week and my CEO friend was there. I  said hello and told him of my success of landing an internship with  another company for the summer. He was happy for me and said, ""too bad,  because we have a problem that a mechanical engineer could help us  with."" He asked for a recommendation and I gave him the resumee of one  of my friends.

After  speaking with said friend, it is a part time position that they are  looking to fill right now. Maybe I misunderstood and thought it was a  position for the coming summer. Maybe I'm just an idiot for not grabbing  the opportunity while it was in front of me. It has occurred to me that  maybe they wanted someone to work from now until the end of summer or  any other time.

Could it damage my relationship with the CEO if I email or call to say I'm interested even after I recommended somebody else? This would be a BIG deal for me. Should I try to roll the dice and get the position?",12Feb2019,1
695,"I'm not sure if its the same for everyone, or if its just me. However, I find that some of the best friends someone could have are of the opposite sex. Although, its not that black and white. In my opinion for a true friendship to work between opposite genders, your feelings department needs to take a detour. By that I mean you need BOTH not develop feelings for each other. That being said, I've never had very many TRUE friends. Sure, i have my roommates, my classmates, people I sit with at lunch. But with the trust issues I've had for a while, I find it impossible to find people that I can talk to comfortably.

When I started college, it was the same struggle of finding friends that I could talk to. Then I started to talk to this girl. She is attractive, but I was never attracted to her. It became pretty clear that she didn't like me in that sense as well. It got to the point where we would talk about everything, from guys to girls, from relationship issues to family problems. We got to the point where we would both consider each other one of or our best friend at school.

Now, I've never been jealous before, I've heard stories about literally every guy she found attractive or wanted to go out with. I've even help try and set her up with people I know better than her. But the other day, I dont know what happened. She had been talking to this guy for little over a week now. and i dont even know him, only know his first name. But for some reason I was jealous. Became a little paranoid that she was lying and skipping out on me when we got plans. I still dont know if she was or if I was just not thinking straight. but either way, for the first time I became jealous. Now i realized that i actually do have feelings for her.

I consider myself a logical person for the most part, and i came to the conclusion almost instantly that a relationship would be pointless. I know she would never go out with me (lots of backstory, but assume she wont). So i came to the conclusion that I had to tell her, and cut ties from her for a bit. and well, thats what i did

Her response was something along the lines of ""we can still be friends you'll get over it"". Which i dont know if anyone reading this has, but when you like someone to a certain degree. It's not that simple to get over someone, especially not someone that you normally spent as much time together as we did.

Obviously she is pissed at me, she has good reason dont get me wrong. But continuing to talk to her just makes it worse. and I dont think she understands why i cant talk to her or msg her. I also just realized that i spent an hour typing this up when i have an essay due tomorrow that i haven't started.  So... ill leave by saying this.

Although I'm slowly starting to branch out and talk to more people. She was the one person at school that I could talk to despite me not talking as much as I wanted to, and what i need advice on... well, i just want my friend back but i know if i start to talk to her again with even the slightest bit of feelings toward her, its over. I just need to know how i can get over her so i can get back the one friendship that changed college for me.

On top of that shes interracial and should know both sides of where she comes from, my side of the family all want to meet her n be in her life.

I dont want Taylor to grow up thinking her daddy doesnt love her or that she wasnt good enough for me to be around or to have to suffer the racial injustices of this world that goes with being black without daddy being there to help her up tell her he loves her and do his best to make things better, thats all i want.

I do love my parents but they're ruining my life.They fight all the time and even stopped all communication over 4 year ago all they do is shout and curse at each other everyday. They live under the same roof and use me and my sister as a means to communicate with each other. Sometimes it gets really v*iolent* , Mom can gets crazy sometimes and she *threatened to kill* him and herself more than once she says if she did it it's his fault and we can go live with grandma. I'm scared of leaving them alone. I tried to tell someone but they brushed it off as normal couple fighting, but they've been fighting since I was 8 and they refuse to get divorce bcuz ""they're staying for us"".

Mom is sick. She can't have a reasonable conversation and she always acts as victim when confronted. Whenever I tell her about my day or my social anxiety she mocks me and compare me to other kids and how I'll never be normal. I mean i get where she's coming from, she was forced to quit school and marry my dad. But I'm so tired and overwhelmed. I feel like the parent and it's so draining. I wish my sister could help but she just stir things up by telling each one what the other said.

Also my parents were always so hard on me. I was always in trouble for something. I have to keep good grades or my phone gets taken. They wont let me go out, had strict curfews, I was followed around and I wasn't allowed to let my hair down. If I did something my dad would hit me so bad leaving bruises sometimes.But my sister was given all the support and she was allowed to do whatever she wants bcuz she's the youngest.

And when I was around 7 my parents used to make fun of my weight and when I'm out with dad he would tell me to suck my belly in or people will laugh at me which lead me to stop eating breakfast, or i'd eat and throw it all up, exercise at night all at age 9. I stopped throwing up now but I still can't eat without feeling guilty. I know I look unhealthy but I can't help it.

I developed severe anxiety. I’m a socially awkward mess I have social anxiety. I can't make friends or talk in class without shaking badly, and I sound so immature around strangers or even friends . I don't know if I'm developmentally arrested, but at home I take care of everything and I feel like the parent of the family but with strangers t's like my child self came out.My parents or teachers don't understand this whole social anxiety thing or they just don't care so I can't see a therapist or talk to someone.

I study English in college, and I read a lot of books without looking up words, but when I'm asked a question or when I want to write an essay or even just answering a simple text like 'what's up' , my mind goes completely blanks no matter how casual the conversation is. and when writing I can't remember simple vocabularies nor complex ones, and I took a lot of time to answer or write. I don't how to put the things I want to say into words so I ended up rumbling or saying meaningless things .I suffer from this problem when speaking in my native language too especially in writing so I don't know if I have a learning disability or something. but it's making me so anxious I don't know what to do or how to change it.

Despite him clearly caring enough about me to text every single day for what seems like hours, he rarely does anything else. Always coming up with obvious shoddy excuses as to why he can’t come on playstation or even more importantly, meet up irl. Texting only does so much for me but it seems to do more than fill his side of satisfaction. I’ve even purposely tried laying off being the one to start conversations to see if he only still talked to me because I was talking to him, but that has just lead him to start even more talks. So it shows me he clearly values me as a friend, yet why does he flake on me nearly every damn time? Outside of general conversation, he only really seems to do things that benefit himself, such as the trip we’ve planned to go on, which I agreed to go on more for him than myself.

Some info before anyone makes judgement or advice. 
1. I do have friends, but we don’t really hangout that much due to school, work, etc. 
2. I have made one friend from my past. He and I play some Apex, fortnite from time to time. 
3. I’m trying to make friends in my new university as much as I can. Should I still try?
4. I did say I have to go home for my responsibilities. That being said, my mum said if I have anything,(Wanting to hang out, meetings, classes etc) to just let her know and she’ll take care of it. 
5. I wanna stay late, but on some days I have to stay till 3:50 in classes, and others I leave as early as 12-1 in the afternoon. With both of those times, it makes me wanna go home ASAP. ",12Feb2019,1
717,"I have a sister. She's 31.She doesn't work. She has worked maybe 1.5 years in her entire life. My mum pays her car, phone, makeup, clothes, gym, food. She also cooks for her, washes her clothes, and cleans the house. My sister is sitting all day on the couch on her laptop, watching trash tv. Twice a week she goes to most expensive gym in town. She never vacuumed, never cleaned, never helopd around house. My mum is getting old. She's retired now, but her pension is small and she works side jobs like cleaning people's houses and ironing clothes. She has a bad knee and spine. She can't do this forever. When my dad died 2 months ago, instead of giving the house to mum (so she could get benefits on house repairs from our county), she refused and started screaming at mum how she is mentally unstable and she doesn't trust her and she wants her share now. My mum is a sweethart. She could've kick her out ages ago but decided not to because she loves us to death. My sister is just evil and only looks after her ass. 0 compassion. Now that she has 1/3 of the house, my mum can't legaly kick her out. And my mum gave her a car legaly. All my sister has to do is drive my mum maybe once a month somewhere like doctor or grocery, and every time my mum askes her she starts screaming how she does everything in this house. I'm not even joking, there is a dent in the couch where she sits all day every day. 
My sister never invested one cent into this house. My mum and me remodeled most of our house alone. 
And i'm done. It's eating me alive to watch that. I'm going to move out because it's not good for my mental health to watch that because i want to deck my sister in the face. Sister that has everything payed for and my mum never asked anything from her, is ruining my mum. She is going to ruin my dear mum. She won't stop u till that leech sucks her dry.

When i tried once to talk to my mum she said: please don't fight with her. All will fall to it's place someday, you'll see. 

And that's it.
I work away from home for 10 months. I would gladly send half of my paycheck to my mum every month so she can travel and stop working, but i'm not doing that because i know my hard earned money will be given to my sister that is so lazy to wash up her plate after she eats her meal that my mum cooked.
When she got what she wanted, i overheard her talking on the phone with one of her trashy friends. She was speaking so ill of my mum in the lines of: what does she think i'm stupid? I didn't drive her for free (haha free, funny, i guess fuel, insurance, tires, food, water and electricity is free) for years to get screwed over. Now she'll see. Ofc i got what i wanted, i'm not an idiot.
It broke my heart. 
How to finally convince my mum to stop giving her money? I will give her a thousand a month to spend on cabs if needed, just so she doesn't give that mooching piece of crap a single cent. It's enough. I just can't.",12Feb2019,1
718,"My brother was recently sentenced to a couple of years for armed robbery (no one was hurt, fyi). Obviously it was a poor decision, and he is now going to pay the price.

I plan to write him to show love and keep his spirits up since we don't have any other family. I'm kind of stuck on what to say, but I know I want to encourage him. Any suggestions on what someone in that situation may need to hear ? Please, none of the punitive stuff, he feels awful enough as it is. He's actually a good kid, but addiction and the wrong crowd made for where we are today. I just don't want him to give up on life completely and think he's a failure . I've also never been in his shoes ",12Feb2019,1
719," I'm a 15-year-old boy and the fact that I'm not even allowed to lock my door makes me uncomfortable. Recently, I found that my parents had searched through my discord and found an argument I had with my friend. They then pulled me out of my room and threatened to punish me. This conversation may not have been private, but I have other things on there that VERY MUCH are private. I don't want them snooping and I have no way to approach them. Every time I try to ask my mom about it, I am told that I don't get privacy until I move out. They always check my phone and my computer in order to find out any unknown details about me. Even if I don't want them to. I really need to know if this happens to anyone else and if not, what do I do? ",12Feb2019,1
720,"I recently got a job offer at a clinic and the clinic manager has all the paper work ready, they already contacted my references but now she is saying that the HR representative needs verbal confirmation on letting them verify and contact my previous employers. To be honest, I don’t want them to because most of the managers I worked with were pricks, and in my last recent job I ended up having to file a sexual harassment complaint. I’m scared that this is going to stir things up if they get in contact with this previous employer because it kind of caused some drama between the manger, HR and some other coworkers. I don’t know what to do, it has been hard to find a decent paying job, and I finally found one and they want to hire me but all this is causing a set back since I was suppose to start tomorrow.

721,"I realized while typing out the title that similar situations might've been posted an uncountable amount of times, but anyway.. 

A few weeks ago I had a party at my dorm, and a girl who recently moved to my building joined. We hit it off pretty quickly and we ended up sleeping together. 
This was no problem, since she told me beforehand that she just wanted us to be FWB and nothing more. I was totally fine with this, because I'm not currently looking for a commitment - since the party, we have been together a handful of times. 

Cut to yesterday evening.. we were in bed together and we were talking about the party. She told me that she didn't mean what she said about not wanting more than a FWB thing with me.
She said multiple things like this during the evening, a la; she would get sad if she saw me with another girl and that she's been telling all her friends about me. Not just mentioning me, but actually having conversations about me. Also that I'm her type etc.

This is literally a recipe for heartbreak.. I do enjoy spending time with her, a lot, but I really don't feel the same way. The only thing going through my head, when she's telling me all that stuff is ""shit, now I have to watch myself when I'm out drinking, just in case she or her friends are close by"".

I'm not even able to bring girls to my place now, because she's living in the same building, literally six or seven doors down.

What do I do? 
I don't want to break her heart, but I don't want to get her hopes up either by continuing to sleep with her.
But since we aren't exclusive and our deal from the beginning was to just be FWB, should I just continue to sleep with her?

722,(I’m in school) I like a girl a lot and I want to know if I should ask her out.  I play truth or dare with her everyday and we talk all the time.  I stayed up to 2:00 in the morning talking with her.  ,12Feb2019,1
