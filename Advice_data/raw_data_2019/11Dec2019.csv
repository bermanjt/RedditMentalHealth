My dissertation is about violence in videogames and the effect it has on teenage boys. I am planning on having my teenage cousin play DOOM; for multiple reasons it's the perfect game for my study . How could I get data from his gameplay? Especially to do with how he is thinking when he plays or what questions I could ask him during or afterwards?

4,"We did secret Santa for my track team and I got this guy who I don't know very well. On the slip there was questions that you were supposed to answer like what's your hobby, your favorite candy, and favorite restaurant and at the bottom you could put anything else you wanted your secret Santa to know. The person I got put that his hobby was track (obviously I already knew that) his favorite candy is all candy, his favorite restaurant is all restaurants and he didn't put anything else other than that. I'm having a really hard time thinking of something to get especially since this group of people are the really loud and kind of judgmental type of people and I feel like if I get him the wrong thing then they'll make fun of me. I don't want to get him anything track related because I feel like they'll think of that as lame and I'm not sure what to do. The guy that I got is a Male 17 year old",11Dec2019,1

6,"I was a huge procrastinator and lousy student in college in a highly ranked university. I had no vision or plans for what I wanted to do once I was finished with school. I studied nutrition science, which is a subject I loved deeply before going to school , but ultimately became uninterested in the curriculum. I thought I’d end up in some field of holistic dentistry but wasn’t quite convinced that dental school was the path for me. I partied hard and often and my grades started to slip quickly.

Fast forward to now, I have had a successful career in various sales roles and make a decent income as it relates to my peers. However, I feel like a huge failure for not having a bachelors degree and it’s gotten to the point where I feel legitimately incompetent and depressed. A once outgoing and confident person, I now dread meeting new people in fear they will ask the questions of “what do you do?” and “where did you graduate from?”. I am constantly being told I am very intelligent but I feel like I’m living a lie because I know I do not have the piece of paper to back it up.

It’s been 6 years since I stopped taking classes. With a new semester approaching in January, I’ve began to wonder if I should go back and finish school. I have about 2.5 years left to degree completion and $25,000 in debt from previous student loans. I would have to get additional loans to finish school.

My question is, should I try to go back? Is it with incurring additional debt? I want to go back to school to learn a useful skill that I can build upon and I’d love to hear any advice/recommendations you have for me.",11Dec2019,1

11,"So I’m gonna start you off with a warning I am a senior in high school so I’m still hella young. I don’t know what to do it has become increasingly obvious that something is happening between one of my best friends and gf and I know it’s not just me bc others have come up to me and brought it up as well and this isn’t the first time this has happened. She also is definitely hiding something now(I think?). We have been very open and dated for almost 1.5 now but just earlier today when I was visiting her at work and asked if I could change the music playing. She said sure and i went to grab her phone and she freaked out and snatched it from me(never happened before). I may just be crazy. Something like this happened between them early last year and we talked about it then and it was all good, but hearing that she told my best friend (that she’s been talking too) that and other stuff is kinda disheartening. Another thing is while over these past 3 or 4 weeks maybe it’s became very obvious that they are now close friends and that’s cool and all, but when my best friend has multiple times mentioned how he wants to hu with her it just makes me uncomfy. Idk what to do help!",11Dec2019,1
12,"My friend recently came out to me as trans (male to female), and asked me to refer to them with she/her or they/their pronouns. I have tried my hardest to use their pronouns but I've slipped up once or twice. They are fine with that since many others they came out to don't even try.

Before they came out as trans, they were originally identified as a gay male. I was still very supporting of them and did not disrespect them. Over time, I noticed them saying some nasty things about cis/and or straight people. For a while I ignored it, assuming that they had reasons behind it but, it has only been getting worse. Since they came out to me as trans, they are displaying a lot of heterosexism (idk if that's really a word). I've been trying to see their pov but it's tough with the insults that are pointed to a group that I am part of. I'm not completely ignoring them but I'm really worried that I might say something offensive and hearing the awful thing they have said about others I am pretty scared of what will happen if I confront them.",11Dec2019,1
13,"So there’s this girl i’ve been thinking about for a while now. I haven’t really thought about her like that until now. She’s pretty, cool, and funny, and I wanna try to get with her.

She’s cool with all of us, and she’s even said before that she likes me more than the two of my friends. She’s been flirty with me too and is super nice to me. I want to show signs that i’m interested, but i’m scared to because she is way out of my league. (We are in 10th grade and she is a cheerleader) I’m also not the most confident guy out there. Last year i had social anxiety, but i managed to overcome it and gain some confidence. Even though i’m more confident than i ever was in my life, it doesn’t come pare with other guys she knows. So my question is, should i still go for it? Should i still try to get with her?",11Dec2019,1
14,"I hope that made sense.  But let me explain,  my gf is due to see me from another country.  She's an adult (almost 20) and we've known each other for a while,  but my gf had kept me secret because of what I have heard about her very overbearing parents. Again,  im not sure if they are,  because I've never met them.  I've only heard stories and stories can indeed be changed to suit the audience. 

Finally,  about three months ago, she told her parents about me.  Her mum,  understandably,  wants to meet me,  which I understand.  I'm aware that her mum wants to make sure I'm safe and not some murdering pimp. Again,  I fully unstand this,  but due to personal circumstances,  currently I can't travel.  I can later on in the future,  but not right now.  I've explained this to her mum,  but she's adamant that I visit them to make sure I'm ok.  I have answered the mother's questions as best a I can with straight, honest answers.  I don't have anything to hide because I'm not ashamed of who I am. 

Ive been honest and open,  as well as truthful about me and my intentions with their daughter,  but I feel,  that the gf mum isn't so nice. Maybe the mum is,  im not so sure at this point of initial conversation.  But from my dealings with the mum,  they haven't been so nice and positive. 

She's accused me of manipulating their daughter,  sleeping with women behind her back and asked me to persuade her daughter to cancel her trip. 
We don't see each other often,  because the gf is in uni/ college in another country.  So anytime is very much appreciated. 
I haven't coerced their daughter into anything and now,  the gf mum is threatening to hire a private investigator in to my life. 
I want to send this to her mum,  but unsure if this seems and sounds like I'm being a massive cock. 


This is what I truly want to write. 
Look,  here's the truth: I can't stop x doing what she wants to do.  She's an adult,  irrespective of what you think,  feel or otherwise have any idea.  X will be safe,  well looked after and will come back to you alive with all her body parts.  I'm not gonna kill her, im not gonna traffic her to Europe for anything sinister.  

Secondly,  I don't appreciate you insinuating that, because I'm a man,  im going and sleeping with other people.  I haven't judged you in anyways and you have no right to judge me and think that just because I'm a man,  I am something I'm not. 

Right now,  due to personal circumstances,  I can't come to x country.  That's how it is.  If I could change it,  I would.  But I can't.  Later on in the year,  yes,  I'll be able to.  But right now,  it's not feasible.

What do people think.  Any feedback from anyone with be appreciated

Ps. Sometimes I don't get all of my thoughts in my head down on paper.  If anyone has any questions, im open to answer them within reason.",11Dec2019,1
15,"Hello. Im on mobile, so sorry for typos.

I dont know if I should move out. I (18F) wanna be short. I am in college and live with two roommates my age. We live here cus of college and didnt know each other before. They are closer becauae they are in the same course. Its ok, doesnt bother me.

In mid November some stuff happened and we has a talk. One of them was very rude to me while  saying I cleaned badly. I apologized for the mistakes I did commit, because some of them were irresponsible and they were indees right that it should be better. Nevertheless, I feel like they were picky about everything I did. Even before this they would comment everything I did, not especially rudely, but why comment everything? I was very hurt at their tone. I had been 100% clear that I am always up for a conversation and admiting mistakes when I make them, and all they need to do is respectfully say that I have been doing things wrong and they would enjoy for me to do them better. 

Still, after that I did better the things I did wrong (take in mind I did not clean that bad, just a few bad mistakes that I fixed after realising, and that its my first time living alone too) but somehow, I feel like Im still judged. Today I did a minor mistake which was I left the mop inside the water from yesterday to today in case someone wanted to use it. Gets dirty, I get it, I apologized and placed the water out. But the mop was yesterday next to the bathroom and then it suddently moved to in front od my door. I just feel like they picky everything I do but domt say it, ans when they do theyre so mad about it theyre rude.

Dont get me wrong, I know I make these mistakes, but were teenagers, Im learning too, and when they leave hairs on the showers floor, get the sink I clean dirty with bits of toothpaste, etc, I dont get annoyed because roommates and friends do things for each other. Were loving together we have to be understanding and they arent understanding to me.

Lets not even talk about how they said shit behind my back about me because I like tarot and I (PLAYFULLY) scare them with ghost stories (obviously playful). 

Things have passed and Ive been trying to do things better, but I was in a phrase of beggining my trust, and they broke it very soon, and now as I cook Im scared, as I cleaned Im scared , Im paranoid, I force myself to laugh and be friendly to them.

Reminder, I am and always was open to improve and motivated to clean the house. They just decided to hide their judgement for me. Eveytime I feel like something is wrong, it is wrong. I dont feel confortable, but its not like theyre awful to me. At least they pretend to be friendly if they hate me.

I feel targetted. I HAVE made mistakes, but also some things are just targetting. When Im alone I sometimes dont want to go back home, and when Im with them, because theyre not rude, I dont know if I should move out of not.

I want to, but I dont know if Im overreacting or if theyre really targetting me. To this point they might not be doing nothing at all, but its me still feeling bad, and I want to be confortable.

Give me advice. Im open to anything.",11Dec2019,1

17,"So I'm a student currently in highschool. I have been assigned this rather large assignment and for whatever reason, I've just not done it. This is uncharacteristic of me as I usually do my work as soon as I get it (and I haven't put off any work from subjects other than this one). There's no reason why I haven't done my project, and it's due soon. I've wasted weeks of time that my teacher has given me and I'm stressed out (to no one's fault but my own).

My question is, why can't I make myself just do my project?",11Dec2019,1
18,"So to sum up quickly, I moved 60 miles away for Uni 3 months ago. I'm generally a very relaxed and easy going guy (18M), my ex (was my gf when we moved) also moved to the same place for Uni, we were having issues and a few very serious and toxic situations happened after we moved, she was diagnosed with severe anxiety and now we're split up and she moved back home to focus on her mental health. So I had been almost looking after her for 6 months but I didn't realise why she felt the way she did until she was diagnosed, but situations that happened past that meant we had to split up there was no other choice. 

She moved back home around 6 weeks ago now , we had been back and forth trying to salvage something but I had to end it properly around a week or two ago, she was my best friend, we'd been together 2 years (although last 6 months were very on and off) and had been on holiday and was fairly serious I thought for someone my age. 

When we were on and off after she moved back home, it caused me extreme stress because she was incredibly invested when I wasn't sure if I wanted to rekindle a relationship. It was either we try or we cut it off, this went on for a month so I had to cut it off for her own sake as well as mines, unfair on her to be so invested when I'm unsure and caused me too much stress knowing how invested she was when I couldn't decide. 

It's the first stint I've gone without speaking to her for 2 years, it's hard to explain how I feel like I start thinking about our relationship because something reminds me of it. 

Even though I've got the best family and good friends back home and in my new city I've just felt lonely and flat, I've felt this way since she moved back home, even though we couldn't continue a relationship. I'm not anxious or depressed I don't think, I seen a Councillor last week and she said I've experienced alot of trauma from the situations which happened, I'm a healthy person and take care of myself, I eat well train hard, do well in school and have good friends so I can't understand why I feel unhappy. I've kept doing all the right things but still feel flat it's weird. 

Usually I'm very content with being by myself, sometimes even preferred it. But now when I'm on my own I get these kind of thoughts but when I'm with friends or family I'm completely fine. I don't understand why.",11Dec2019,1
19,"My Dad has depression. I found out by finding his anti-depressants. I've struggled on and off with depression over the years. When I stumbled on his pills I was not depressed. In fact I felt like I had solved depression, or at least my own depression, and I was even writing a book in an attempt to share what I learned and maybe help people with their own struggles. For me, my depression stemmed from a bad relationship. I had a girlfriend who didn't match me emotionally or mentally. Once I finally broke up with her after many years, I was finally happy again. And now I'm in a relationship that fulfills me in a way that just fills my heart with happiness. This is important because I could be projecting this situation onto my Dad's.

I feel that his depression is due, mainly, to his relationship with my Mom. She is the only long-term relationship I think he's had. I know he got dumped in a relationship prior to his marriage to my Mom, but that's it. In part, due to his lack of relationship experience, I believe he's made a mistake in marrying my Mom. Their relationship leaves a LOT to be desired. I'll list some basic things:

* Bickering: every time I see my parents together they bicker. Without fail. And my Mom brings me into it like I should back her up.
* Pitying: My Mom, in more recent years, acts in a pretty pitying way toward my Dad. I think this stems from him dealing with depression, while her being a ""happy-go-lucky"" and ""positive minded"" person. She doesn't understand depression at all. Therefore instead of supporting him she is like ""oh your poor dad, he works so hard"".
* No shared interests: My mom likes social things. Sports, clubs, going out and hanging out. My Dad likes hanging out with his friends, artistic things, woodcarving. Relaxing on his own.

The funny thing about all this is my Mom is honestly the most amazing person toward everyone else. She regularly calls up friends/family to just ask them how things are going. She is outgoing, and super sociable and friendly. She'll make 3 friends on a grocery run. If we're waiting in a line-up to ANYthing, you can be DAMN sure she'll strike up a conversation with the person next to her, no matter who they are - what they look like, their status, nothing matters. She's just... bubbly, loving, energetic. Incredible. I love her so much sometimes it hurts!

My Dad is the complete opposite! He is incredibly quiet, smart, and introverted. He's artistic. He builds amazing things just for others to see: stuff like Christmas decorations, stuff for Easter, woodcarving. He likes movies like Predator, shows like Seinfeld, watching sports - I guess he has a classic Dad-taste in things (which he's passed on to me). He has amazing friends who he remains close with. He hates reading (lol). He's super funny. He's also quite closed off. I've never seen him cry except for my dog dying. We also don't talk much and when we do it feels kinda forced. I feel like he feels bad for not talking to me more, about the important things - relationships, life. I have a hard time admitting I love him, because I don't know if he actually loves me.

The point in listing these things is:

They are a total mismatch, and it's possible they would be happier with other people. I asked my Mom once about it and she even said they have talked about/considered getting a divorce. The person you marry should be someone you like spending time with. I don't think my Dad ever enjoys spending time with my Mom, at least not as much as she does with him. And sometimes I don't blame him - she can be annoying! Especially to him. It's like he's the dummy she unloads all her naggy, annoyingness on so that she can stay the amazing person she is to everyone else in her life. It's also likely she's built up a resentment towards him, for his depression, for his lack of interest in her, for his lack of loving-ness for her? I don't know.

I want my Dad to be happy. I hate that he is depressed. I understand that it is his own battle, that he needs to ""change on his own"" or whatever... But sometimes I feel like I should tell him all of this... I don't know.

I am scared to tell him all of this because I don't know if it will result in anything positive. My parents have been married a long time. Maybe sticking it out is the best option - that's the approach they're taking at least. They've talked about divorce, I mean... how is that the way you want to spend the rest of your life? Don't you want to be with someone who lights up your day? Don't you want to be excited to get home and hug your wife?

I just want to help my Dad, I can't stop worrying about him. I want to call him and just have an honest conversation about all this but I don't want to say things I am in no place to say. I want to respect him and his decisions. I don't know what to do. Please help me.

Maybe I should just focus on the simpler stuff? Like ""hey dad, can you try to be more loving towards mom, and try to avoid bickering so much? I know she's annoying as hell sometimes, but it's just the way she is, she can't help it...""",11Dec2019,1

26,"My higher education story is a bit of a long one, but I'll try to keep it short.

Six years ago I went to college majoring as an aerospace engineer, that didnt pan out and after my second year I ended up moving back home and trying community college.

At community college I shifted focus to a broader science degree and after 2 years I ended up finishing and earning an associate's degree in science and an associate's degree in art.

At the two above said colleges I hardly tried, and I ended up leaving my community college with a GPA of 2.1. 

After community college I began taking online classes in the CIS field at an entirely new university. I love the field and I finally feel as though I found an educational path that suits me. I'm about to complete my third semester at this university and I can proudly say I dragged my GPA kicking and screaming up to a 3.2 (3.8 major GPA).

My problem is this: I graduate in a little over a year and I have zero work experience. Never worked a help desk, I've done some minor PC building and troubleshooting but nothing resume worthy. I've worked in the food industry my entire life and I've chose to stay on this path to pay my tuition and living expenses. 

What should I do moving forward? Is there still time for me to get relevant work experience with internships given I graduate so soon? Should I apply at every bottom level tech job possible and attempt to work full time through my remaining classes? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

29,"I’ve never been one to care much about money, but lately I’ve been holding some animosity towards one my my best friends because she spends money like no tomorrow.

A little bit of context: when I turned 18 I became homeless. I worked really hard for six years and now live with this friend in a small townhouse. I’ve worked for everything I have but sometimes I still struggle finding my next meal or putting gas in my car. 

My friend pretty much lives off of her parents, who she claims aren’t rich. However, this year they dropped over $4000 to send her to Europe for a month and pay her $500 rent every month. The money she does earn from the little work she does, is basically her fun money. So she’s constantly buying new clothes taking long trips to fun places and adding to her extensive crystal collection.

I’m not big on clothes and crystals, but the traveling gets to me. I’ve dreamed about going to Europe my whole life, I just can’t afford it. And it really hurts knowing that I struggle just feeding myself while she can just call daddy and ask for however much money she needs to do whatever she wants.

To put salt on the wound she insists that she doesn’t come from much. That she “totally understands what its like to be poor”. But then turns around and says things like “I’m going to ask my dad to give me the jeep because he never uses it. It’s more of a toy than a family car.”

I can’t even fathom the concept of a car being a toy.

Nevertheless, she’s one of my best friends and I love her. We’ve been through a lot together despite our economic differences. I don’t want to harbor these feelings toward her anymore. I keep telling myself that I’ve done a great job working for what I have, but that doesn’t change the fact that I’m extremely jealous.

Is there anything I can do to stop feeling this way? Or are there any words of encouragement anyone can give me? I don’t want to feel this way about someone I really care about.",11Dec2019,1

31,"So I'm (21 F) sick of being single but I don't know how to overcome my anxiety.

Ever since I was 13 I'd always day dream about getting into a relationship but because of my own insecurities I'd convinced myself that I just wasn't interested in it. 

My self confidence has grown a lot over the past few years but when it comes into getting into a relationship my anxiety goes haywire and is the only thing stopping me. 

The thought of having someone fully accept me for me is absolutely terrifying to me and I don't know how to take the first steps into overcoming it. 

I am also a bit insecure about my age and experience (sexually having NO experience what so ever) and I don't want to be pressured into doing anything I'm not yet comfortable with.

My anxiety is so bad that at one stage a few years ago I thought the guy I was interested in liked me back (wasn't true) and it caused me to have an anxiety attack that slowly ebbed away after two weeks. In that period I couldn't even eat or sleep properly and ended up loosing 5kgs that I have never been able to put back on. 

I have thought about even going to therapy for it but the last time I went to therapy it didn't turn out to well (not to blame the therapists as she was just trying to do her job, but she basically told me she didn't understand why I did the things I did and as someone who themselves doesn't quite understand that was very hard to hear. I never went back). 

I have thought too about just finding comfort in my own company but I am constantly thinking and daydreaming about being in a relationship. It's almost an obsession. I know that this craving I am having is not going to be fulfilled just by being by myself.

Anyway, I'm sorry if this is a bit jumbly because I don't quite know what I'm looking for. Any advice on anything is much appreciated :)",11Dec2019,1

I want to change it back to Biology but at this point I feel like I've invested too much time and money to switch back. (My current student loan debt is at around 15K.)

(but she knows i didn't want her to talk to him because when we broke for about 3 months they talked and she called him cute but she only talked to him because i wouldnt treat her right.this is also not what im talking about now). she told me she only talked to him because she had been asking me to treat her right and stuff and that she wanted the attention because i don't give her anything anymore. but she lied about talking to him when i asked but we were broken up and she lied about blocking him but were broken up as well it was the same break up. but after that week she stopped talking to him and then that was it. idk if any of this matters because nothing happened and its her life she can do what she wants. i don't love the prospect of flirting but its my girlfriends life and she didn't flirt with him. idk if it even matters if she intiates any conversation. i obviously don't wanna break up with my gf. so any advice/ help would be great",11Dec2019,1

I find myself in a relationship with a 23 year old girlfriend (I am 24). As we were having a discussion about a newspaper article I read regarding men’s health, she revealed the fact she has never been to an OBGYN. This is deeply concerning to me, as I know women are supposed to go regularly. I was raised in the north and had a proper sexual education - she was raised in the Deep South and was taught nothing but abstinence, and apparently nothing about her body.

I don’t want to press the issue too hard as it is a young relationship, but she needs to get checked - not only for STDs, but the full gauntlet, whatever that may entail.

How should I address this issue?",11Dec2019,1

41,"ok so first of i live in england just for context so college is not university just so you know. it’s like education for 16-18 but you can do it at any age aswell but it comes after the end of high school.

so im a 16 year old girl and i recently started college and i’m doing a performing arts course. i really struggled with school and my attendance was low but i passed my gcses fine and everything i just have anxiety. my goal is to go to university and i’m starting to think i’ve picked the wrong course. no one on my course plans to go to uni and the qualification i’ll get at the end of my course isnt really going to help me and i feel like this isn’t my full potential or my passion. i want a career in social work or something but i panicked and picked this course because i didn’t want to do a levels. as i said i struggle with anxiety and had no idea what to expect with this course but i do like performing arts and have been in many clubs. my next big task is to create my own dance routine and i literally can’t think of anything worse and i panic when i think about showing people and the whole thing. i really have no interest in it. i thought i could do it but i’m really behind and struggling with attendance again and don’t feel like i fit in with the people on my course. i feel like if i stick with it i’m wasting 2 years of my life for a qualification i don’t want and isn’t going to take me to uni. my mental health is getting worse my face is breaking out in eczema and i feel disgusting. my mum has suggested i take a year off and work then join college at the start of next year and do health and social care instead. i’m worried this will make me a failure and i’ll drift from my friends from school that go to the same college. but i’m scared that if i carry on i’ll just push myself too far and become depressed again. i don’t want to disappoint everyone and just give up but i have no motivation to try and do any work i don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

TLDR; college is making me depressed and my physical health deteriorate and i think i picked the wrong course, do i stick with it and not give up or do i take a year off and work then change courses next year.",11Dec2019,1
42,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons. 

So for starters, I (16M) am a freshman. I’ve amassed this friend group. It’s a pretty great friend group with a lot of people and we all pretty much like each other and get along very well. However, there’s oneeee problem. 

There’s this one girl, let’s call her.... A. A (16F) has had a rough childhood. She’s been through A LOT. But.... she’s really sensitive. Say anything remotely bad, and she cries. She’s a good person though. 

So throughout this week, I’ve been my usually self. I tell my friends I hate them and whatnot. Obviously it’s sarcasm and they know this, and just see it as me being me. But recently A has taken very hard of it. Yesterday she did something silly, and I said something about her existence and it making me crumble when I see her, and she started crying. She left to the girl’s bathroom. My female friends went to comfort her, before coming back and telling me that I should watch what I say, and that you have to listen to people’s feelings, and not all of them are the same to not get hurt easily, and that some get hurt easier than others. My whole counter-argument was that she’s been through a lot already, but she cries because some kid at school said a joke?? I also keep telling my friends that I think she’s weak. She’s weak because she gets offended easily, but not only that, she’s sensitive. And that doesn’t make you strong, not one bit. I think the strong overcomes the weak, and A is not strong at all. Even through what she’s been through. If she was, she wouldn’t have gotten offended, but she has. Now my friends think I’m some Social Darwinist, with survival of the fittest-like ideals. 

And today, I told her to her face, I don’t care about people like her, meaning I don’t care about sensitive people because they are weak. And she left once again and possibly cried. All my friends are saying, my best friend specifically, “You need to be more nicer, if you want to keep your friends. I care about you, but you need to change your ways, for you, your future, and your friends.” And I keep shrugging it off, because I believe I’ve done nothing wrong. 

Sure, the words I’ve said have been mean, but they’re true and factual. And I try to have a logical approach to everything. So what do you think? Am I in the right or wrong here? Should I apologize to her and the whole friend group? Thanks!",11Dec2019,1

48,"My grandmother is turning 97 years old this week, so I've been thinking about a birthday present for her. The issues with that are: she cannot see much of anything anymore, she has absolutely no intuition when it comes to handling any sort of gadget or tool, she has no interest in anything that isn't already a part of her bubble (she's the iconic example of ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks""), she can hardly walk anymore or do much of anything physically, and all she likes to do is listen to one single radio station that hosts a specific talk show that she's been listening to for the last 50 years. 

Since listening for the sake of entertainment and mental stimulation makes up such a significant part of her world today, I thought it might be intuitive to set up an Alexa or some other smart speaker with which she can easily interact (synced to an ipad or cheap laptop running Spotify that I can easily set up) and play / explore new music and podcasts that are being created every single day. The only problem with that plan is that she hates music. 

My Dad told me that she hasn't cared for music for as long as he has been alive, and not once did she hint at liking a song or even caring to remember the name of an artist. All of that being said, since it is in her nature to be stubborn and set in her beliefs, is it possible that she just didn't like any of the state of popular music that her generation was exposed to, and that she might actually be pleasantly surprised with all of the directions that music has gone since she closed the door on it? 

Sure, at the very least she could explore podcasts and forego music entirely, but I personally get a lot of joy and inspiration from certain songs and it makes me sad to think that she might not know what she is missing out on, and I'd like to at least try to improve her quality of life as much as I can.

I already have what I think is a decent plan to introduce her to some songs in order to gauge her reaction and see if I can spot a spark of interest, but I'm currently stumbling in regards to what those songs (or even genres to focus on) should be. I need variety; ideally a spread of good representations of different genres that she is sure to be unfamiliar with. Any suggestions or constructive criticisms about my idea could make a world of difference for her, and are much appreciated!",11Dec2019,1
49,"My friend is 18/F. Lives with her grandparents, and works in fast food. Her grandparents don't understand technology or anything like that, so it's hard to explain any of this to them. But she's my best friend and I'm really worried about this whole situation, and even she's nervous about any of it.

But my friend has been looking for a relationship recently. She met this guy online, and at first he was totally normal. After awhile, he asks her if she'd be interested in a sugar daddy/baby type relationship with him, and being a little desperate she says yes she's interested. 

So they talk some more, and she told him she was saving up for a car. He offers to help, saying he had a friend who could help sell one. My friend, being very dumb and not thinking it through, said that would be awesome and told him that she had $2k. It wasn't until later though, that she realized something was up. She's a very sweet person, but she's very naive. 

When she thought about it some more, she realized it sounded too good to be true and tried to back out. But he wouldn't stop pressuring her into sending his ""friend"" money, telling her she was going to spoil his reputation and he was starting to seem like a joke to whoever was selling the car. He kept promising he wasn't trying to do her any wrong, and that they could sell the car later. After *three days* of him constantly texting her, she gives in and sends $1k. Not only that, but he knows her address, name, and what she looks like. 

Now he's trying to meet up with her. Told her she has to do what he says, because he would never lead her astray. Apparently, dudes in Canada right now but he's from New York. But all of this has her completely sketched and neither of us know what to do. If she hadn't of sent him money, or given him her address, this wouldn't be so bad and we could just ignore him. But he keeps offering to send her pizza and stuff to her house. 

She tried to block his number, but only succeeded in deleting all the text where he offers to buy her a car, and all this other stuff. But since he text her like every day, we still have text of him asking for her to send him the remaining money they ""owe."" (His words) she has pictures of what he supposedly looks like though. 

How does she get out of this mess? Right now I've told her to stop responding to his messages, and I'm also trying to catfish him right now so he'll focus on some fake ass person instead of her. If she tells him to leave her alone, he gets mad, asking if she doesn't trust him, and that she's got him wrong. 

Now this really could be some guy who's just trying to help her and has good intentions, but right now neither of us believe that. Wtf are we supposed to do?",11Dec2019,1
50,"TL;DR at bottom

Hello, people of the internet. I suppose I will start off by saying I am a 23F currently living at home. I recently graduated college with my bachelors in biology but got bitchslapped with major depression and anxiety and flunked the last class which would have let me get into the lab sciences program I was aiming for. Skip past a couple months of recurring alcohol and drug abuse to now where I am about to finish retaking this class with a passing grade on top of working 40 - 50 hours weeks between two jobs. 

When I call the school to confirm things are OK to go for starting said program this upcoming summer turns out - oops - gal doesnt actually know if there are even seats open. May have to wait until summer 2021 to start.

Deal I had with my mother was go to this program or move out. We butt heads a lot. I can consistantly plan on being yelled at/bitched to/generally insulted for 45 min to an hour and a half every single day. She makes it pretty clear that I am a huge disappointment and just need to shut up and do what she says because I am clearly too stupid and irresponsible to do anything. Yes I am a spineless bitch, no I dont feel like I have other options at the moment due to limited savings (read: blew it all on booze while in school).

So, since the odds of going to school seem pretty slim stacked with I would be stuck in the same situation while being stretched absolutely paper thin I go house hunting. There are apartments scattered about and then I start looking at cheap houses because why not.

I come across this gorgeous yellow and brick house. Right downtown, close to work, backs up to a long trail. Definitely dont have a savings for a downpayment but everything else I could totally make work. Someone had gone and painted every single room a different crazy color - its ugly and chaotic and I am immediately in love. 

I definitely dont have the savings for both, I could squeak by with school option and a cheap apartment living off ramen or commuting 2hrs three times a week or just have this beautiful little piece of freedom. I know I should go to school, my degree is worthless without it, but I'd really appreciate some perspective. Is it so wrong or stupid to want this? And how the hell am I supposed to survive otherwise?

Thanks if you have made it this far. I don't have any real life friends since moving back and its nice to pretend someone else cares if even for a moment. Any advice appreciated.

68,"I dont know where to start with this really, its such a complicated story but ill try to sum it up briefly.

I meet a girl, she's single, broke up with her ex like 4 months ago, we both become part of a big friend group. She gets with another guy in the group for about a month, but ends it randomly and it causes the whole friend group to split up, with me and her on the same side. She always knew I liked her, and starts sending some flirty texts and being super weird in person, lots of eye contact and clinging close to me. I tell her how I feel one day, and she doesnt say anything, she doesnt say yes or no, she just kinda sat there and listened. I took it as a flat out rejection and was sad for a few weeks. She ended up going to a party with a close friend of mine, and while at the party explained that she doesnt have feelings for me, but could develop them. I finally came to my senses and realized i was never showing her attention or talking to her, so i recently began texting her and shes told the same friend that she likes it and thinks its cute. I saw her in person a few days ago and things were nice, she gave me a super big hug, posted pics of me and her, sat close to me, etc. Now heres the problem, she started talking to this other guy about a week ago, and has told my friend that at first she thought she had feelings for him, but that she really just thinks theyre friends. She has also said that she is not gonna be ready for a relationship for a while due to her messy break up from before i met her. Now the weird thing is that shes been acting super odd about him, inviting him to parties and hangouts, facetiming him, wearing a hoodie from the school he goes to (To be fair she does wear a lot of school hoodies, but this one in particular shes been wearing a lot). Anyway i have no clue what to do, I barely know how to hold a conversation with her, and when i see her in person im too much of a pussy to make a move. Any advice on this would be much appreciated, its a super confusing situation and I sometimes am told i overanalyze shit, so my mental health is not at its highest right now. I know I need to start talking to her and being friendlier in person, so any tips on how to do so would be helpful, or even just overall advice on whats going on.",11Dec2019,1

70,"This is strange thing to struggle with, but I 100% cannot have a cat ever. I have always loved animals and done better and better with them as I aged. Because of this, when I was younger my dad told me maybe when I move out he might see about helping me get a cat. I've lived with that for a long time and got excited about it and did research on what I would need and etc. I am older now but have not moved out yet and my circumstances have changed enough that it would be a horrible idea for me to get a cat or really any other pet besides the one I have at this time. I currently own a tarantula and my boyfriend owns a bird so if we stay together long term and end up married which is what looks like is going to happen, there will be no way I will be able to get a cat. We have been talking about a dog recently too but that will be way in the future if it happens. My mother is also allergic to cats and hairless cats tend to be more of a handful. My boyfriend has also told me he would prefer we dont get a cat and I understand why. This would all be fine on its own, but I can't get the idea and wants and everything I had planned out of my head. Its been an ongoing dream for years and years of my life and its hard to let go of. Pets are a huge part of my life and theyve always been important to me. Ive been trying to wait out the desire or see if I take interest in something else but it's been 3 years since I started trying to give up on that dream and I still haven't been able to completely let it go. I also know getting any pet right after moving out would be a terrible idea anyway. 

For context: tarantulas live minimum 10-15 years and birds live minimum 20 years. Some birds can live 50 years. Some even longer. Some live longer than their owner does. Tarantualas are probably max 35 years. Both very fragile pets. 

Even if we eventually have no other pets, Im the only one of us who wants a cat and my mom is allergic so those are two big factors that overall mean Im not getting a cat.",11Dec2019,1
71,"Disclaimer: I live in university dorms so I know its unreasonable to expect that only people we know are brought into the flat. 

My (22F) flatmate (18F) keeps bringing strangers into the flat. When I strangers I don't just mean people that I don't know. I mean actual strangers that she doesn't even know. To be fair to my flatmate she's a lovely girl who will always stop and talk to people. This is a great quality but her friendliness extends to inviting people back to the flat that she's literally met an hour ago. I get that that's part of university life, people make new friends/have one night stands etc. I don't mind people coming over but I struggle when it's absolute strangers. 
One of my issues is that she often brings men round (not for sex) and the flat is meant to be all female. Three of us don't mind men in the flat but one girl is extremely anxious around men. I don't think it's fair to have men over, particularly men you don't know, when one of the girls is nervous around them. This is her home and she should feel safe. 
Another issue is that we are never told when she's bringing around these people. You can be in your pjs looking a little scruffy and suddenly bump into an absolute stranger with no warning. I think it's common courtesy to ask if you can have guests over as the rest of us do and at the very least just warn the rest of us that you have a guest round. 
Also, in the nicest way possible the people she brings round for the most part are bizarre. We've had a girl rob our kitchen, a girl vomit exorcist style all over our carpets at three am, a man attempting to gain entry to all our of (thankfully locked) bedrooms. One man she brought back ended up sleeping on our sofa which none of the rest of us found out until another flatmate started screaming when he walked into her bedroom to use the bathroom. We've had some real issues with the people she brings, one of them has even begun stalking another girl in the flat even attempting to break into it. It's a real drain and quite frankly the fear of leaving your room in case there's a stranger there is getting old. Some days you just want to bimble about knowing it's just your flatmates in. 
I've spoken several time to the flatmate about having strangers over, particularly unannounced and she's apologised each time and promised to ask first but she's still doing it. 
None of us want to report her to the accommodation board, that's last option resort, but we're all sick of the strangers in our flat all the time.

He is the one who progressed it to a relationship from just dating, he asked me to his families for Christmas, and he has said the 'L' word a few times (although not directly to me). When we're together he's very affectionate, but...

He doesn't text much at all, this is how he is but it bothers me as currently we see each other once a week. When we see each other he doesn't really ask me how I am, and it just doesn't feel like a relationship half the time as it feels like I'm not really part of his life. Lack of validation is an issue.

This week he's only going to be free tomorrow, except for playing a gig at night - he's suggested that I go to his beforehand for food, then to the gig with him and we stay at his overnight.

He's always talking to me only, touching me only, play fighting with me, and all of that.

This girl I sit directly across from in my class is the best past of the day. She’s not a well known person at my school and is just a quite and shy.

Last night I smoked some weed and everything was great, I went out with my good friends and had a good night, I then went home and we where chilling my my shed and I decided to smoke another bowl, I smoke a bowl and something didn’t feel right, I felt like I was gonna puke so I went out side.

I’m outside and I catch my breath and I sit down in the shed, things started to be really weird, I kept seeing weird shapes made out into life and I was trapped into this dimension where I would be tripping out for ever, my soul kept telling my body “get up you’re going to die” so I got up and went outside, I locked my friends in the shed and I started running, all I could remember was it was like a broken vhs and it kept skipping and rewinding and I couldn’t stop glitching until I forced my body to move, I ran down the street and I fell into the snow (btw I live in Canada so it’s extremely cold outside) I had no shoes or jacket on, 

I wake up still tripping out and I ran to my house screaming “mommy where are you” and I opened up the shed and my friends are holding onto my telling me I’m okay and I was just having a bad trip, my girlfriend puts me in the shower and I start even tripping harder and I ran outside to the shed completely naked.

I eventually went to bed and slept it off.

105,"We were once pretty close, or at least as close as two adults with standard-issue adult lives can be. We hung out at least once a week, knew each other's darkest secrets, and occasionally got hammered together when the occasion called for it. As it stands now, with the exception of a couple of short texts, we haven't spoken in approximately two years. There was no ""Bye Felicia"" drama, no harsh words, just a tense conversation followed by radio silence. Her last text a week after our final conversation was basically, ""I need space."" I responded, ""I agree, I think we both do,"" because I'm not good at feelings and I was tired of the weirdness between us.

I've texted a few times since then (just noncommittal ""Hey this thing made me think of that thing you like!"" type stuff to test the waters) and she answered briefly (""Oh, cool. I never saw that before!"" with no further commentary). We don't cross paths IRL and we don't like or comment on one another's social media at all. I just assumed we'd both decided to move on without each other. 'Friends for a season...' and all that malarkey.

A few weeks ago I found out through a mutual friend her SO has end-stage cancer. I'm appalled at the utter fucking balls this universe has on it, ripping apart the most loving, tight-knit, supportive family I've known since the Seavers. After umpteen years she &amp; her SO are the tightest two peas in a pod I've ever met. They are absolutely each other's best friends. He is kind and funny and adores her in a way most of us can only dream of. Their kids even like them and spend time together **on purpose** (I was raised by narcissists so they're basically bigfoot to me).  Of course no one is perfect, but they have always been the personification of relationship goals. 

Even if I hated her (and I don't), this nightmare breaks my heart for them. I want to contact her. I want her to know that I'm thinking of her and am here if she needs anything. But I also don't want to a) stress her out by bringing up an unpleasant memory, or b) make this about me or our iffy friend status, both of which are probably well below the last thing on her Give A Shit list.

Here's the text I drafted: 

*""I hope I'm not adding to your stress by reaching out, but you and SO and the kids have been in my thoughts every day, and I'm pulling for you with my whole heart. ♥️ If there's anything at all I can do to support you, please ask.""*

Is this selfish? Am I making this about me and my guilt? I genuinely care, but I suspect I might be trying to feel less shitty about not being a friend to her, or avoid making her dislike me more by not acknowledging the horror she is living through.

Of course my parents found this funny, which made it all the worse for my toddler brain. I haven't got an explanation for how this fear could have manifested in my brain that early.

I had extreme social anxiety very early on too.

I had panic attacks when water would get into my nose and eyes when my mom bathed me. I remember her pouring a full bucket of water over my head once because of this, which made it worse. Much worse.

I was unable to go to the bathroom unless accompanied by my mom until I was about 7-8. I would hold it in all day while gran babysat me. Urinated on myself many times because of this. Was unable to pee in a school bathroom until 5th grade. I don't understand why I did this.

One day my family dragged me off to one of those faith healers, whatever they are, instead of bringing me to an actual doctor. I don't know why but it's because ""I was always scared of something"". I think this was related to the rain thing. I never understood any of it.

I would do things like avoid seeing specific family members for no apparent reason. I'd get scared of them if they were even slightly overbearing or too loud. 

What I really want to do here is understand these behaviors. My braindead family failed to help me as a child. So I just want to understand.",11Dec2019,1
111,"Hi everyone, this is my first time on reddit,

I'm a 20yo full-time online student and also work from home full time as well. I live in a friendly but small bachelor apartment. I don't have a driver's license (yet, drivers ed starts January); I do all my shopping, including groceries online. There is limited contact with family (only on holidays), and I don't have any friends.

I want to have a normal life, but I don't have a support system. Quitting my job or dropping out of university aren't options. I'm working on figuring out an online business to possibly save me some time, but this in and of itself consumes more time.

I try to fight off negative feelings, but I'm very isolated, and as the months have gone by, it is starting to take a toll on my mind. I have two years and three months left of school. My work is very stressful, I'm the #1 sales person, but its telemarketing and people are scarcely pleasant.

I don't want to give up because I've been making a lot of progress in the work aspect of life, but my social life has become non-existent over the last year, and now my mental health is starting to deteriorate. I get a huge rush when I open my front door to take the garbage out, it's scary for me but at the same time feels empowering, I haven't left my apartment otherwise in three months

I want to do this more I want to have a normal life, but it doesn't feel like I can until I finish school so I can get a better living.",11Dec2019,1
112,"I have a 'manager' who is not my direct manager but is a level above me and therefore ""oversees"" some of the projects I work on. For 6 months, I was working on a project and he was pretty unavailable (on top of being in a really inconvenient time zone where my work day is his midnight and vice versa) so every time I would schedule a meeting with him (at my midnight), he would show up for 10 min and not come for the rest or read first paragraph of the proposal and not the rest of it. He didn't know a lot about our market, just didn't seem to care a lot about the project and the project just didn't go anywhere. I felt like he was pushing a different agenda. At some point, one of my colleagues really stepped up and spent a lot of time helping me make this thing move forward last month.  She reviewed and corrected all of the documentation and she spent all her nights and weekends helping me.  On top of that, she pushed me to get this project in front of the right people quickly, so we presented it and it was really successful.

Now he is really upset, saying that my colleague should not have been involved, the decisions we made were ""wrong"" and that he wanted to take the lead.  Even though this project was a success (and reviewed with many layers of management above him who do not shy from feedback), he is saying that our project is STILL full of mistakes. At the very last minute (literally, the 11th hour), after this proposal was blessed by many layers above him, he finally read this document and gave me 1 page of vague editorial changes I ran out of time to incorporate. He is mad at my colleague for taking ""his"" role, mad at me for not incorporating his changes and has complained about this to my boss, her boss and everyone he can get his hands on. So now my success feels like this mess.

Tomorrow, he has called for a post mortem where he can complain about this in a public forum in front of my boss, her boss and our senior management.  Our company has told me that I should feel ""empowered"" to run projects on my own so I feel compelled to stand up for my colleague and my project. At the same time, this guy is confrontational, takes things personally and has a tendency to bully me until I talk him out of it...like someone who asks for feedback but will debate you on your feedback. 

How do I handle this? I have the stats on this project including how much time my colleague spent vs. how much time this guy spent but I don't want to tip this guy over the edge. I also want to politely maneuver out of working with him in the future and continue to work with my colleague (or anyone else).

115,"•i posted this on the suicide watch community on Reddit already(i just copied and pasted it)
•i am planning to talk about my feelings of being suicidal in group tomorrow 
•i am not in any current danger

okay, first off the thing that i want to talk about i TECHNICALLY could talk about it BUT i’m pretty sure the therapists, MHS’s or my doctor at the program would have to report it because i’m a minor. i briefly mentioned something similar to my therapist i saw before i started this outpatient program, but i didn’t tell her about what i want to talk about. i told her in the past that when i’ve been impulsive i would post “risqué” things on an app with the intention that people would respond to me; which of course they did, and i would generally respond to a couple of people out of the 85 or so that had messaged me. after i was no longer impulsive i would block all of the people that messaged me(and reporting some of the people that had sent me explicit photos without my consent). i also told her the main reason for posting was to see from those situations/conversations if i could find someone to meet up with. ALSO i told her that if someone were outside of my house at that moment, or close to where i lived, i probably would’ve had sex with them- these are guys over the age of 18 mind you. i then told her that i had never taken any further actions than just talking and that the most personal information people had of me was the state i lived in. at the time that was true, but later things changed. one day i was impulsive, went on the app and posted something- yada yada yada- but after taking down the post and blocking everyone, i continued to talk to someone. someone that right off the bat i told them my age, and after learning that i was underage, told me they were okay with it. we exchanged other social media information and began to talk on those apps. some other facts are that he has offered to buy me sex toys, to give me weed, and we’ve talked about meeting up, and i have sent him pictures of myself. i’m scared to talk about it because i don’t want my parents to find out, which i’m assuming they will because i’m assuming the police will get involved(another reason of why i am scared). i am fucking terrified that i’ll have to press charges or he’ll press charges against me bc i sent pictures of myself/i put him in a position where he is in possession of child pornography. another aspect that is making me more suicidal is the fact that he told me(he claimed) he had a 16 year old girlfriend a couple of years ago- and a couple of years ago still would have been illegal seeing that he is 38 years old(or so he claims). a big part of me feels obligated to tell someone bc he is talking to me(a 16 year old) and had a 16 year old gf not too long ago. i only know his first name and where he lives(or has claimed to live in). i am also scared and stressed and suicidal bc idk if he is a pedohile, if he’s a danger to the community, or just likes talking to mature teenagers(typing that out sounds stupid to me now but it’s just how i feel and i’m so fucking confused and emotional). what if he’s just a nice guy and some fucking 16 year old girl responding to his response to her post ruins his life???? this is stressing me out so much. i’m so scared. i love my program, and i love the staff there. i want to talk to them about this all but i’m also so afraid that they’ll think i’m disgusting.",11Dec2019,1

She had a bully (lily) last year and then ended up becoming friends. I believe lily has had some sort of conflict at home and is being raised by wealthy relatives, so there’s some acting out from trauma there. 

Her other friends don’t get along with lily. They’re all pretty much assholes to one another. Nobody is innocent but lily does get handsy and pushy more than the others. 

My daughters friends told her that if she’s friends with a bully, it means she’s a bully too and they won’t be friends with her. For the year I’ve told her to remain neutral, and she has. It’s just not working anymore.

120,"Hi, all. 

I am helping my younger sister with her practical exam in becoming a CNA. This requires her to perform some tests on me as a nurse would in a doctor's office. However, she asked me how much I weighed so that she can get a good idea for when she weighs me (just in case that is one of the tasks she has to perform, the tasks are given at random). My family doesn't know this, but I had an eating disorder (untreated) and the topic of weight really triggers me. I don't want my sister to know how much I weigh, nor do I want her teacher to know either. (I once went to the doctor and the nurse announced my weight out loud to the entire office). I know that a patient can refuse to have the weight taken by the nurse, but this is a different case as this is her test to become a certified nurse assistant, and I don't want to decline and then have her fail her test. 

Tomorrow, I have to go with her to her school for a ""practice"" exam, I am deathly afraid of being asked my weight. Should I quietly go up to her teacher and explain the situation or decline to that test if she is given that test when the actual test day comes?",11Dec2019,1

129,"Hi, guys. So long story short, my boyfriend and I of three years broke up about two months ago because we ultimately wanted very different things for out future (I wanted kids, he didn't, I wanted to move back home, he didn't, etc.). So, over the last two months we would go no contact for maybe at most a week, then one of us would break it. Since the break up, we've spoken to each other at least once or twice a week, hung out every now and then, and hooked up like 3 times. On multiple occasions we have said to one another that we still love one another and are really struggling with everything. So, yesterday, we hooked up and later on he asks me if I had been talking to any guys. I told him I didn't want to lie to him, so yes, I had been talking to some guys, but it hadn't gone past simply talking (it's true).

This morning, I wake up to a text from him that he had sent me super freaking early in the morning basically saying that we were never hooking up or speaking again and to delete his number. I was like what the hell? I freaked out, of course, and I was like where is this coming from? Basically, he was hurt that I was talking to other guys, even though I was saying that I was still in love with him. He said he couldn't handle hooking up with me anymore knowing I was talking to other guys. I was like okay, that's fine, but just know that me talking to other guys doesn't equal me not being in love with you anymore. It's nothing more than me actively trying to cope and move on from the situation. 

So, after talking for a bit, we get to this point where we each are agreeing that we know we can't get back together because it won't work in the long run, but neither of us wants to cut the other out of our lives, and we also don't want to just be friends because we want that intimacy...sooo what the fuck do we do?? Neither of us have any idea what to do, all we know is that we can't be in an actual relationship together, but neither of us are willing to completely give the other person up. I suggested maybe setting up some guidelines and borders with what we were each comfortable with the other doing, but not being in an actual relationship, or even labeling it one, but I don't know.

I bought a Dell laptop around August 2017, it came faulty and within the same week I reported to the store about it and they said they could ONLY send to Dell for repair, they told me to contact Dell which I did and cutting the story short they refused everything and only accepted repairs, so I sent the laptop for repair.  
It happened 2 times for the same problems and hardware replacement, after the 2nd repair the laptop didn't even powered on. All this inside the 2y legal period I have to ask for the refund and new unit. Dell refused both of those choices more than 10 times via e-mail and phone.  
I live in Portugal, Europe, and according to the laws I searched online I had the right to get a full refund or a new unit within the first 14 days but was refused by the store.  
I've put this situation on consumer's trial (Julgado de Paz, not sure what's the translation) around mid 2018 and the situation is still stagnated because both the store and Dell refuse to have any legal duty about it, we had a ""mediator"" tried to join us together and get the a conclusion but the store didn't do anything. Then the judge gave 1month to the store to try and talk to whoever they bought the faulty laptop from and I got a response today saying they couldnt reach a consensus with them because the warranty is off since the time it was bought...  
I have email proving the store refused the refund or new unit every single time within the 2y period.  
Could you give me your opinions?

Does she just want to be friends with me? Is she just shy?  What does this mean? Because i’m pretty sure she is straight but she probably thinks i’m straight too because no one knows. I think i’m overthinking this.",11Dec2019,1
143,"So at least two of my closest friends have called me annoying now. I know what you're probably thinking "" if you guys are close surely they were just kidding or messing with you. They probably didn't mean it."" For most people that's the case but both of my friends were frustrated with me and have said this many times to my face and behind my back. 

Lately one of my friends, let's call her A, has been getting really mad at me for small things. I've been taking care of her trash and picking up her stuff and doing other small favors for her since we met in preschool. Now we're sophomores in high school and I'm still doing the same stuff. I give A half of my cookie that I buy at lunch and I throw away all her trash with mine. I help her with homework all the time and I stay up until she understands what shes doing. As far as I know, I've always been there for her. But A's not always there for me.

If I forget to get a pass to a class that A has later I'll ask her to get me one and give it to me before study hall. I've only done this maybe 5 time since the start of the year but a couple of days ago she snapped at me and told me to stop forgetting and get the pass myself. So I did and I barely made it back before the bell rang for my next hour. I haven't asked her to get me a pass since. 

We're also on the bowling team together and sometimes A can get really worked up and upset if she's not doing as well as she'd like. I always try to help and cheer her up, tell her it's ok and she'll get it because she's a great bowler.  When I say stuff like this she usually tells me to shut up but if anyone else on the team tells her that same thing she'll thank them and give them a hug and laugh with them like it was no big deal.

The thing is I've talked to A before and she knows I can't stand being treated like this. I feel awful. I don't know if she just doesn't realize how much it hurts or what but day after day she gets mad at me for talking to her and asking her questions. Whenever I talk about myself or any problems I have I doubt she's paying any attention nor does she care about anything I'm saying if she is. I listen to A whenever she talks to me tho. I make sure to ask her about it the next day and everything. 

So basically I'm annoying and A just dosen't seem to like me anymore and I have no clue how to fix either of these problems. So please give me any advice you can I'm pretty desperate.",11Dec2019,1

152,"Hello to whoever is reading this,

I am a 17 year old male and currently live in a semi-abusive household. For as long as I can remember my mom has always disliked me. I was born to piece together a shattered marriage and wasn't even aware of it, so when that didn't work and they got divorced things turned for the worse. I would be blamed me for anything and everything (which sometimes I didn't even know existed). She always showed favoritism towards my brothers and would leave me feeling sad and lonely. Her actions early in my life has caused me to grow up with high levels of depression(which was diagnosed by a doctor so I'm not just trying to be hip by saying that) and insomnia because of the fights she would have with my dad. Over the years my mom has verbally mentally and physically abused me and has left me in a state of hating my self.  I do not wish to cause any harm to my mother because I still love her. My Mom(with whom I live with) has threatened to kick me out and send me to a in-patient psych-ward, or send me to live with my father in Indonesia. I do not wish for either of these things to happen because I have no future in a 3rd world country and I have been told by doctors that I don't belong in a pysch-ward. I can acknowledge the reasoning behind her actions, but not to the extent of what she has done because I used to do a lot of drugs and would skip school. I have been clean from drugs for 6-7 months and have been putting in as much possible effort to fix my school situation as I possibly can. The reasoning behind why I don't believe that she should go to the extents that she has is because: 1. Ive been clean, 2. I have been putting in a lot of time into fixing my situation, 3. I have been going to therapy to help my self, yet she does not acknowledge any of my efforts to change. I believe that I can't contact the police because that would result in me having to live with my dad because of not being able to stay in an abusive household. If I were to move to Indonesia I would not be able to return back to the US because I would not have enough money to live because the currency exchange is 14,000 to 1 and I would also lose any chance of an education which would prevent me from going to college for the major I wish to pursue(which I already have many college credits for and a good enough GPA for the hope scholarship). I currently am currently am employed at a local Papa Johns and have $0.12 in my bank account. Now that you know my story, what Should I do?",11Dec2019,1

I don't know how to explain it but I feel like my life is ending extremely fast. I can't find a single thing enjoyable right now, two of my college classes this year have literally sucked the life out of me. I've gotten to the point where I don't know what I want to do with my life. Should I keep going down this path? Should I go military? Should I go work a 9/5 job?

155,"I work at a gas station (fairly new, only worked there about a month) and before this I worked for a different gas station so o started off knowing what I was doing for the most part.  I love the job but the manager treats me like I’m a child and don’t know what I’m doing. I’m the youngest one there (20 f) and I’m the only one who she yells at/ talks down to. 

Few examples: 

I asked where something went and she told me that it was a stupid question and she thought I was smarter than that. 

I told her I needed to ask off one day to see my psychiatrist (I have multiple diagnosed mental disorders that I struggle heavily with) and she said that “all kids now a days have some type of made up problem, get over it”

She told me over the phone to look to the right of something (it was to the left not right) and she asked “oh you don’t know your rights and lefts now?” 

The safe jammed when I was using it and she said loudly in front of customers that I can’t do simple things like put money in the safe and said “now I have to stay extra time to baby sit you and make sure you don’t screw anything up” (again, in front of customers) 



I’m constantly told how I catch on slow, mess everything up and have to be watched constantly which is 100% not right considering I’ve been alone for 2-4 hours with no issue and never am off on counts and my other coworkers say that I’m doing fine. 

If this was my first job I don’t think I would mind so much but I’ve been a manager for multiple stores and being talked down to like this really hurts because I know that I’m fully capable of everything that I need to be. Everybody says that’s just how she is and I should get used to it but I hate feeling like I’m a burden when I haven’t done anything wrong or make small mistakes that I can easily fix. 


I know it’s not a big deal but it still really gets to me and I feel like she hates me when I try my hardest to always be kind and do my job the best I can.  What should I do? 

TL;DR manager constantly treats me like I don’t know what I’m doing and talks down to me in front of customers and other employees and acts like I’m a little kid, laughing at me and calling me stupid. What should I do?",11Dec2019,1
156,"Sorry, this is going to be long but I need honest perspective and advice. 

My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years, we have 1 kid under 1. 4 years ago we added a second dog to our family, a French Bulldog. Hindsight makes it clear that we should not have gotten this dog, my husband and I have both agreed that if we could go back in time we would not have gotten the dog. He is intense in every way. He is barrier aggressive/hyper-focused, which adds to the problem that despite trying training classes twice, we have not made any significant progress on his behaviors and have a hard time keeping him separated to curb his behaviors because it makes him that much more worked up and difficult to calm or control. He has aggressively bitten both my husband and I - making us bleed, leaving large lumps/bruises, and once where my husband needed stitches. This has mostly stopped, although he will lunge like he wants to bite if he is worked up and hyper focused on something and we try to break that. He also has a bad habit of getting “play aggressive “ with us and guests in order to get attention and if not addressed in a specific calm way will bite the person. However, he does have very sweet and calm moments where he is almost like a different dog - it just takes FORVER to get there and the moments are fleeting. 

Now we get to where I’d like others perspectives- I think it is only time (and it’s past time) where we will need to rehome this dog. Neither of us can trust him around our kid, we can’t just put our kid on the floor for tummy time, play in his exersaucer, or to practice crawling, etc. (things that babies need to be able to do for development) without both of us stopping what we’re doing so that one person can monitor the baby and one person can monitor the dog. This does limit the amount of floor time our kid gets. The options my husband gives to mitigate this is to put the dog in his crate/pen area on another level of the house or to take the baby to his room, which means we aren’t hanging out as a family. The dog has not injured our kid, but we also have ensured that there isn’t an opportunity to do so. The more active the kid gets though the less sure I am that we will continue to be able to ensure there isn’t an opportunity to do so. My husband knows I want to rehome the dog - I’ve made it clear in no uncertain terms that I do not enjoy this dog and think our quality of life and the dog’s would improve with rehoming. My husband feels too much responsibility to go through with rehoming the dog and tries to make it work. However, this is the first puppy he has had as an adult and with it being a difficult dog, there’s definitely more work that has been needed than we’ve been able to do, especially because progress has been so slow/non-existent. We are constantly bickering/arguing/ignoring/passive aggressive comments about this dog. I want him to prioritize our kid and our family’s quality of life over the dog and stop trying to force something to work that isn’t. I also know that we will both feel guilty and wonder about how the dog is doing if we do rehome. It doesn’t seem like I get through to my husband when I share my concerns about our kids impending independent movement and how that will be near impossible to control with both the dog and kid moving around. I don’t think it’s reasonable or fair for the dog to put him in his pen area alone for any more chunks of the day so that our kid can move around. Putting up a gate to separate them won’t work because the dog will just bark the whole time, plus we’ll still be separated because if we leave the dog alone on one side of the gate he will find something to destroy as he has scratched up our doors/walls trying/succeeding to open doors. 

Clearly I know that the dog needs more/better/consistent training. Unfortunately, we don’t have the finances to pay for a private trainer any time in the near future, so please don’t give that as advice. We have done what we could, are doing what we can, and it’s not going to look any different at this point. 

I’m looking for any advice/perspective - am I the problem? How can I better communicate with my husband? What would you do? Do you agree that the dog would be better off in a new home? How do we deal with the guilt and worry I know we will both feel if we do rehome the dog?",11Dec2019,1

In the end we decided to be friends but the relationship had to be built from the ground up again. I wasn’t really with him on this plan but i thought I might give it one more shot, he seemed apologetic and ashamed of his actions. 

He has changed his life for the better now, he studies a lot more, and is more nice towards everybody and has a better way of life. I’m really proud of him for making a big change in his life.

But after a while even though he improved a lot I can’t find it in my heart to truly forgive him. I don’t want to remain friends with him.

163,"So my friend’s friend has been extremely suicidal, and she’s been doing anything she can to get her hands on something to cut herself with. Obviously my connection to her is very loose, and I wouldn’t even go as far as to consider her an acquaintance since we’ve never even met, so I don’t think that any direct assistance on my end would be received well. And I fully understand that even if I did know her well, my support would only help to a minimal extent. Obviously, a visit to a psychiatrist, therapist, etc would be the most logical course of action and is what I first recommended. Here’s the problem: her parents don’t “believe” in mental health problems, thus she doesn’t have the opportunity to acquire any form of help, at least through her parents given that she’s under 18. On top of this, she seems to be extremely emotionally unstable, and has attempted suicide for extraordinarily minor things. I don’t recall any specific exams my friend gave me but they were things that most normal people would consider a minor inconvenience. She clearly needs a lot of help and it really pains me to see my friend trying to shoulder this burden alone, but I don’t know what to do for her.

I talked to her once and gave her my number another day but never heard anything and it kind of sent me into a depression again because I just really liked her.

178,"have a few nostalgic moments in my life but I easily get over them, but there is one nostalgic experience I cannot get over, and that is Rainbow Six Siege.

August 17th 2018 and I come home from driving my bicycle around some golf club and I finally get to play the game I've been dreaming of playing for years, literally. I remember watching it for months, Rappel and breach videos, night maps, old Hereford, and I really thought that this is it, this is the real life special ops simulator, so on my first day on, I get teamkilled, trashtalked, and kicked out of the match. I was confused and furious and was so close to refunding the game, my friend insisted that we should refund the game, because We played r6 together, I didn't return it and a week later I finish my standard Saturday routine and I come back and start playing R6 with my friend again, We had a blast, it was THE game we wanted for years, I really liked the background and menu which was Para Bellum, a nice Italian theme with beautiful Italian music, we had extreme amounts of fun until September 4th, where a depressing England theme came and they removed the map we loved and the Para Bellum theme. We liked it but after 2 months around the end of November, my friend was sick of the game and quit, I solo queued the game for the next 9 months with about 5 of those 9 months actually not playing at all, Quit around September-October 2019, came back before around 2-3 weeks in November 2019, now I find myself that I cannot enjoy any video game anymore, and I cannot enjoy r6 siege anymore, every game seems so bland and I rarely even get mildly excited to play any game anymore, and it actually makes me sad, I just want to enjoy video games, I am not addicted but if you are playing a video game you should have a blast and enjoy it, not play  something you don't like. So I need advice for how to overcome this nostalgia and how to enjoy video games and especially Rainbow Six Siege like I did back in August 2018. Thank you for your help.",11Dec2019,1

I’ve tried getting him to open up about it without pushing the issue just asking him how he is and telling him he doesn’t have to talk about it if he’s not comfortable. He mentioned wanting to talk about it but not having time to because it’d take a while and I had a final the next morning. It was already really late at this point. I happened to glance over at something he was writing and it mentioned something about him not wanting to do it during this week. He was writing on his own emotions I do believe.

182,"Hello! For some context, I'm a 16 year old girl. I've moved around a good bit, so I've been to a lot of schools. Recently, in my 9th grade year, I had some problems with friends, lies,  and rumors and I wasn't doing well mentally.  I switched to cyber for the rest of that year and became incredibly lonely. I made sure to be able to see people, and remain social. I got a job, went to a youth group, hung out with my few good friends. But it wasnt enough. So I begged my parents to let me go to school again. They agreed and sent me to a private school. And things aren't going well. I made a few really close friends at one school, but not my own. My school had 9 kids in the high school,  that's all. And I dont get along with really anyone at all. There is a lot of bullying and I'm overall really sad because of it. I wake up and just think about going back to bed, not because I'm tired , because I have no motivation to leave my house. That school is half an hour away from my house, and so is the school my friends go to. I have asked my parents to let me switch schools again and my mom said that it's a waste of time since high school is only a few years and everyone is miserable. She told me that I have to graduate from this school because it's too much of a hassle to change schools again. And I know it's kind of stupid going to reddit for my dumb teenage advice, but I really dont know what to do. I'm just really sad at my school.

188,"So a little backstory is, I used to work at this same retail store I currently work at 3 years ago when I was 16 years old for a little over a year. (2016-2017)I left because they couldn’t give me enough time off to get my surgery(Not that that’s relevant) I came back this year (2019)after leaving the job I was with since I left in 2017.  What drew me back to this retail store is working in the back room. When I was 16 I was a minor still in school so I never really got to work in the backroom much as they only work there in the mornings when I would be in school, however working in the back room was and still is my favorite part about working there. My issue is the lady that coordinates the back room. We’re new to each other, I’m not exactly sure if she knows that I previously worked there or not. W’ell call her Angie. 
The first day I worked in the backroom and had to use the restroom I just left without saying anything like I would when I previously worked there. I’ve never had to let anyone know I was going to the restroom unless I was working as the main cashier because someone would have to take my place. When I returned from the restroom which wasn’t more than 3 minutes later, Angie told me I needed to let her know when I was going to use the restroom because she “needed to know where her team is”. I said “ok” and went back to work even though I was uncomfortable with the thought. 

After that I noticed I was getting scheduled to work in the front- on the sales floor, or as cashier frequently. I talked to the store manager we’ll call Terry and told her I prefer to work in the backroom and she said “ok, but you have to work fast.” From then on I got the impression that someone told her I’d been slow working back there which isn’t true at all. I didn’t think too hard about it though. 

Next time I worked with Angie in the backroom  and had to use the restroom, about 20 minutes after we took our first 15 minute break I let her know I’d be going just to not cause any issues.  She decides to scold me for not going on our 15 minute break and tells me in the future I need to use that time to use the restroom. Which isn’t mandatory by law. Keep in mind this is in front of a team of about 15 people. 

Another example is of her being passive aggressive is We have 2 new works we’ll call Katie and Rick. When working in the backroom we work with a partner. Katie was my partner for the day, It was the first time I’d be partnered with her. We got along well and talked as we worked. we work in a tight space so when someone is talking to your partner, you can’t not hear it. Angie comes up to Katie and starts saying “I heard you and rick work really great together that’s good when you have someone that you work really well with, when he gets here I’ll have him work with you”. I felt like she was just saying that to say it in front of me. When rick arrived she actually made me leave my station so he could take my place with Katie. 

Next time I worked I was partnered with a guy named James who I also have never worked with. We got along really well and worked fast, Angie couldn’t keep up with bringing us more boxes to open. When our team took our 15 minute break, Angie started speaking in Spanish telling my coworker when we returned I would be working with her because I was too slow. Angie knows I don’t speak Spanish but what she doesn’t know is I can understand it. What she said about me being slow wasn’t true as I said we were too fast for her to keep up. Keep in mind 4 people in the break room not including Angie and I can understand what she is saying.  From then on I just got the Impression that she doesn’t like me and doesn’t want the other associates to like me either hence why she moves me when we work well together. And actually lies about me being slow. 
Now I can’t decide if I’m being overly sensitive and weather to bear the brunt of her passive aggressive behavior, confront her, or talk to the store manager. Any advice would be appreciated",11Dec2019,1

I, 21F, used to run pretty intensely but I got injured a lot and I am just about to start running again after a stress fracture in my knee that kept me from exercising for a little over a year. In the interim, I gained 20 lbs and brought back some old self esteem issues. I’m nervous about starting to run again because it’s been a while since I was this out of shape and I feel really self conscious about how I look in all my old running clothes, so much so that I’m scared to see all my old running friends like this. In the past, I ran about 50 miles a week with one long run and two speed sessions a week. I tried to incorporate some weights but I wasn’t good at sticking to it (probably why I got injured so much). This training was mostly focused on getting faster for long distance running. I know I shouldn’t just jump back into it at the same mileage to avoid injury, but I was wondering if there’s a way I should adjust the training to focus on weight loss. I know that incorporating weights would be good but to be honest I have no idea how to put together a solid weight lifting workout so I was wondering if people have advice on that too. I’ve also never really dieted (properly at least) in the past, partially because from about 12-16 I had anorexia. I’m fully recovered now but whenever I express concerns about wanting to eat healthier for weight loss to my family or even my friends they all get concerned and tell me to just avoid the dieting part of fitness in case it brings something back. I don’t think it’s possible to lose weight (which I actually need to do now) without paying attention to what you eat.

196,"Humbly seeking advice.

So far I've been following the standard convention that was reinforced by my upbringing.

The idea of:

\- Go to university.

\- Get into student debt.

\- Get that ""high paying"" job.

\- Pay off the debt.

\- Buy small suburban house that is practical for the daily commute to work, as well as pay off by the time you retire.

&amp;#x200B;

While that is the dream for many, I've started to have some serious concerns about this if its really the way to go.

So here I am, Turning 31, Married no kids thankfully, Wife is self employed so her income changes on a weekly basis, 78k student debt that's growing with inflation, lower paying office job roughly 40k a year after taxes, in a city I dislike that is costing me nearly half my income in rent. I still manage to put money aside, living cheap where I can but with city house prices always climbing higher it just seems so futile for a deposit to live even an hour away from the CBD. 

So I started to think what about buying a house with a modest amount of land in a small outback town? Renting it out while I'm part of the city rat race, have it paid off well before retirement and move in when ready?

Everyone in my daily life, family, co-workers even my wife thinks I'm a little odd for thinking about this idea and should focus on the suburban/city apartment life, but I notice no one can give me a strong pro/con argument about this idea since everyone is following the standard convention.

So am I crazy for wanting to buy a home that is remote village cheap and just rent during my work life? Has anyone gone against this rat race norm? If so how is it going?

200,"About 10 years ago, I thought it would be fun and sexy to do a solo masturbation video, produced by a reputable adult website. It was exciting to me. I was in the best shape I'd ever been in. I felt confident in body, which was probably a new feeling. I was actually turned on by the whole experience and liked the idea of people watching. I was paid about $500, given some nice high-quality photos and a video of myself. I knew that the video and photos would be available to paying members of the website. I used a made-up name for the video and all felt good. 

I shared this with a few close friends and boyfriends over the years, but not with very many people. It was my sexy, dark secret that I felt excited to share at my own discretion.

Fast forward 10 years. I get an anonymous message in my social media inbox from someone I don't know. It's a link to my video. Even though the video is 10 years old, the website featured and posted it as if it was just made, giving it quite a lot of views.

Honestly, my heart dropped. I felt dizzy. Suddenly I felt so violated and uneasy about something I'd been so comfortable with. 

It was my original understanding that you had to be a paying member of the website to view the video. I didn't think it was available to everyone. I know that sounds silly, but in my head I thought the audience was a lot smaller, internet or not. It has now been downloaded and cut up into multiple videos, making it seem like there was more than one.

Furthermore, I did a search for some of the video titles and they are available on at least a dozen free porn sites, some well-known, some less so. Collectively across all the sites I felt comfortable clicking on, the views are at about 500,000 - which is insane to me. 

I contacted the original website that shot the video and they said they can remove my content for $1,000. As far as the other websites it was available on, there was nothing they could do about that.

I submitted a ""content removal request form"" to each website that gave me the option. I haven't heard back from any of those ones.

I don't know what to do. I knew there was a risk of someone recognizing me or coming across the video, but it didn't matter much to me at the time. ""There's so much porn out there, what are the chances!"" I told myself.

Now it's all I can think about. How did the person that messaged me know it was me? Do I know them, but they made a fake account to message me? Why would they message me? Are they attempting to blackmail me? 

Do I fork over the $1,000 to have it removed from the original site at least? What about all the other websites? What if it gets deleted and then just uploaded again later?

I feel trapped, scared, and ashamed. 

What did I think would happen?

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I hate where I grew up, after graduating college I moved across the country with my friend where I felt like I was on vacation 24/7, living my best life, having a great time, and felt genuinely happy for the first time in my entire life. After a legitimate series of unfortunate events, I was laid off from my job and had a hard time finding more work. In a panic I applied to a job back home, and ended up getting it, and moved back with my family. I now live in a big city about an hour and a half away from family, the city I ALWAYS wanted to live in while I was growing up. But this city has gone downhill in the past \~4 years and I'm absolutely miserable here. The job I got is stringing me along and refuses to promote me despite my hard work and entire team raving about how great I am. My role in the industry is essentially gone and replaced with a role I don't care to do. My company won't pay for me to get training in what I DO want to do, nor will they support me in shadowing people in that role within the company, etc. I'm basically just trapped here, can't get a new job in the company, can't get a job anywhere else. I hate everyone in this city, I'm angry the minute I leave my apartment. I don't belong here AT ALL. It's expensive, I have NO friends and haven't made any friends in the year and a half I've been here despite my efforts. I'm making terrible money, and I miss the city I was living in before. My mental health is absolutely going down the drain and I can't even afford therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my problem, family has explicitly told me that I am basically never to leave again and need to live near them (even though living an hour and a half away without a car is PRETTY hard to visit). Keep in mind that I'm 25 and have obviously left before against their will. I have so so so SO much guilt that I ever left that city in the first place, I wake up every day thinking about my life before. But cross country moves are hard. I have a cat that is literally the only reason I'm still alive, and she moved across the country with me originally, and I'd hate to put her through that again. Every time I complain about my situation to anyone, they tell me I should just up and leave, but I don't know if this seems like a rash decision. Is a year and a half long enough to decide whether or not you like a city? How do you handle a disapproving family, and can someone please tell me that this is the time I should be out living my life?? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Life is miserable after moving across country back home after living in a nicer place. Want to go back, but don't know what to do because family refuses to allow it (again) and don't want to put my furbaby through trauma (again) and the career path I put myself on is essentially a dead end until I teach myself the skills I need for a different job.",11Dec2019,1

204,"Hello guys: I'll just get straight into it. 

I left home at 18, I'm nearly 21 now. I have a quickly fading relationship with my mom, as I left home because of her abusive ex-boyfriend (who still lives in the home). My family knew and didn't act on it for over ten years. I just had a phone call with my brother, and he got irritated when I tried to figure out plans for us to get together over the holiday (he's flying in from Texas). So he hung up on me (he's 17, in college). I love my family very much, and I try to make an effort to see them, but I feel that their dismissive attitudes are starting to weigh on me.

I live on my own, pay my own bills, go to school, etc. No one helps with my mental health or well being. I can't blame my brother-- he is extremely uncomfortable discussing any sort of emotions or plans when it comes to my parents or family, and I understand that. It just hurts that everyone in my family treats me the same. No one will talk about what happened (and what continues to happen). Now I'm debating skipping ""home"" for the holidays altogether. 

I recently moved, so I don't think spending time with these newly made friends over the holidays is really an option, I just get really sad this time of year and wish I was doing something. Ever since I was a kid all I wanted during the holiday season was to have a happy Christmas morning with my mom and sisters, but that literally can't happen, regardless of whether I go or not.

TLDR: I have to choose between staying at my university for another semester so I can enjoy time with the friends I've made (Which would disappoint people in my life), or move and accomplish the goals I've always wanted (which would disappoint people in my life). Please consider reading everything.

My life is a mess right now. I'm a second year college student, finishing my 3rd semester. I'm a guy, 19 years old. I just figured this was important information. Anyway, I'm falling apart. i have so many aspects of my life pulling in different directions right now. I never wanted to go to the college I'm at right now. I was guilted and practically blackmailed by my parents into staying closer to home. The only saving grace was being at the dorm and away from my family most of the year. I promised my mother I'd give her a year here, as a result of the guilt, and by the time I tried getting into the other college, I didn't have enough transferable credits. So I took another semester, still in the dorms. For the better half of the semester I've been trying to sort through my life and what I want for myself. I have a fiancee and we're going on 4 years strong soon, and her family is extremely supportive of my wants and desires. They want me to be happy. But I tell my parents what I want and I disappoint them because its not what they had in mind. Its not what they wanted. Hell, i waited months after I proposed to my girlfriend to tell my parents because I knew how disappointed they would be. and I was right. the next day they ""had me over for dinner"" and proceeded to reprimand me and yell at me for ""ruining my life."" All because they want me to wait. I understand what they want and why. But there's no meeting in the middle with them. And in the end I should have the final say in my direction. My fiancee and i wanted to marry this upcoming October in 2020, 2 years after i proposed. and we told my parents this. but they've made no apparent commitment to it. For nearly 4 years they've treated our relationship as a joke or a sideshow, despite how happy i've been. The only support i have is from my girlfriend's side of the family. but the dilemma comes from my situation right now. the end of the semester is in less than a week and I made plans before the semester even started to move to the university i wanted to go to, regardless of what my family said, because i'd have enough transferable credits by end of the semester. But over the course of the semester I became incredibly great friends with my roommate and suite-mate in the dorm and for the first time I'm actually enjoying the college experience, despite the sh\*t i've gone through with courses. But I made so many promises and assurances to my fiancee that I'd move up to be with her and finish out school, essentially tying myself down. Which is what I've always wanted. And right now I have to decide whether to forgo this next semester, where my friends want to do all this fun stuff with me, or if I should abandon what I know here and move. All the resources are there to move. Its just complicated because my roommate doesn't know my plans (I've been struggling with this decision for weeks) and my parents don't know because they won't even listen to me. I'm supposed to talk about transferring with an adviser in a couple days, but as much as I want to go and be off my parents' leash, i'd like to stay and finish out the school year and finish having some fun before moving. Which in itself is complicated because my fiancee and her aunt's Christmas travelling plans revolve around me moving up. Either decision I make I'm f\*cked. Either way I disappoint someone. the way I see it is that if I stay, I'll still be able to enjoy the life i want, just a little later with a slightly different path, whereas if I do move, i'll never be able to get that college experience I have now back. But at the same time I've made all these promises. I'm so lost and broken about it that I can't emotionally function. its taking a tole on my relationship. I need help.",11Dec2019,1

210,"Hey r/advice,

I really need your help. So the story is my friend broke up with his gf because it seemed he got bored. That gf then wanted to get with me only a few days after. I am pretty close with my friend and he said he doesn't care who his ex got with. But I'm worried that if I get with his ex he won't like me anymore (sorry if that was confusing). I sorta like her and wanna see where it might go.  So r/advice what's your opinion on this and do you think I could still be friends with my friends if I got with his ex?",11Dec2019,1
211,"I am wondering how to resolve a situation. 

Our club/coven has been dedicated to practicing witches (please no unnecessary comments about our religion. Not wiccan also) and also other things like walks, hiking, martial arts, second language study and other stuff outside what normal covens do (we are quite intense compared to others, I think). This is about 1/2+ of what we do. We also normally hold our rituals out of town so we don't get caught/interrupted. Most members have had bad experiences with religious groups/people in the area the past and may lose jobs and family if known).

We also have fitness tests and requirements (though they are very relaxed rules like be able to jog 1km) and mainly to make sure people stay at a fit level that they can participate safely in activities as well as trust and bonding exercises. We have members with disabilities and medical issues so make sure that most meetings are held in easy access areas but we do go on some hard treks. and when they can't come they don't but if they can they will. Even guy in wheelchair makes most meetings.

One of the people seeking membership doesn't want to go on hikes, walks, and martial arts and stuff and also doesn't want to go to rituals when they are held in areas that she cannot walk to easily (200m+ away from where cars are parked).  She also doesn't like/often participate in meditation and second language studies. She has been seeking for about 3 months now.

Should I change what we do to include less of the things she doesn't want to do/enjoy? even though no others have spoken about wanting that, most people enjoy them and we have done them from the start. I think this because I have been told it is exclusionary of fat people to have fitness requirements for members and we may have upset the member who doesn't want to do the activities. She thinks we are shaming her weight (THIS WAS NOT OUR INTENTION AT ALL). 

We have thinked so far the only solutions are maybe we will either have to change activities and things or not let her in (we have thinked if we don't change and let her in it will be a waste of all peoples time as she will not do most of things and we will have to try and make sure she keeps informed).

We will have to hold the rituals probably in houses also and so may not be do like they were with candles and things.

What is the best way you think to resolve this situations.",11Dec2019,1

213,"I’ve been a scare actor seasonally for about four years now. At the most recent haunt I went to work for, my acting partner was said 35 yr old M, we’ll call him D. We spent a lot of nights acting together, and I had just freshly turned 18 (as in like a week prior to the haunt opening and us meeting). He wound up getting me multiple presents through the season, and I thanked him many times over and I made it clear I appreciated what he was doing, but not romantically. Eventually he wound up asking to pursue me romantically, and with me just turning 18 I wasn’t sure I wanted to date someone who was 35, so much older than I was it seemed. My friends and family also weren’t for the idea at all
Essentially, he was incredibly persistent, and eventually tried to get me to continually ask my parents over and over and over to meet him, which no one was comfortable with. He even offered to “just show up” when I was out with my family so they’d have to meet him, and tried to invite himself over to my family and friends thanksgiving get together that it was OBVIOUS he wouldn’t be welcomed at. He went further to call my family and friends close minded, saying they “couldn’t diasaprove” of the relationship because were “both adults”. He followed that by saying it was hard for him to “imagine anyone else loving me the way he does” which honestly just pissed me off.
He ultimately told me he would just leave me alone and thanks for the memories, to which he received a negative response from me as he accused me “as breaking a promise I’d always be here” which I literally said I always would be, as a friend.
I feel like I lost a good friend, because he was a great friend. But I feel ultimately there’s something wrong with a 35 year old man pursuing a just turned 18 yr old so hard? Did I do the right thing by cutting him off, and were the things he said wrong? 
Thank you guys",11Dec2019,1
214,"This story is quite long, so if you don’t have any interest in looking at your phone for the next 30 minutes, I would leave.

This story starts two years ago. It’s the very end of the sixth grade (I know, I’m young). My friend group at the time consisted of my friends Mk, Sage, and Chris. Keep in mind, these three people had been my friends since we were all in diapers, so we were CLOSE.  

Anyway, so my friend Chris is what the school system would call “special”. Mentally Chris is fine (he’s actually incredibly smart), it’s his body that’s the problem. His disease causes his bones to age at a very high rate, making his structure very frail and uneasy. This never bothered us though, Chris was a great guy. He was smart, funny, kind. So when Chris told me he had a crush of my BFF MK, I was overjoyed. MK and I were the closest of all. Our mothers had been great friends, which means we were destined to be friends. Anyway, at first I was supportive of Chris. I had seemed to forget that MK had no interest in crushes and thought they were ridiculous, but we’ll come back to that later.

I have always been very sure of my instincts, so when Chris started to annoy me, it worried me. Chris had never annoyed me before, so what was happening? Sage nor MK didn’t seem to notice, so I never brought it up. Skip ahead a few months, and our very first day of 7th grade starts. I had obviously kept in touch with MK and Sage over the summer, but had purposely avoided Chris. I of course felt bad, but Chris had really started to get on my nerves. I couldn’t explain the feeling, I thought he was my friend and yet I couldn’t seem to be around him. Still, I kept to myself...until MK called me one day to complain about Chris. I was relieved, I wasn’t alone! But that relief quickly turned to dread. Chris liked MK but MK did not like Chris back. Eh, whatever, happens all the time. 

“I just don’t get it. He’s started to act so weird around me.” 

“Well it’s because he has a crush on you-“

Shit. 

I forgot that Chris had directly told me NOT to tell anyone. Especially not MK. 
MK was terrified. As I stated before, she hated the concept of crushes. She just didn’t get “love” .  I told her it would be alright, and that she should just brush it off. 
Well she tried to, for months. It wasn’t working. Whenever Chris would walk in the room, her shoulders would stiffen up, and she would get ridiculously tense. It was quite sad. MK was never an outgoing person, the only people she talked to where Sage, Chris, and myself. But now, she couldn’t even talk to us with Chris there. 

As I stated before, Chris is incredibly smart, but what I forgot to mention is that so is Mk. They were both enrolled in all enrichment classes, meaning I could only see them in two classes. According to Mk, Chris would follow her in the hallways, drop his pencil so she could pick it up, and even place his hand “accidentally” on hers in class. And it didn’t end there. They also lived two streets away from each other and he would purposely rest his head on her shoulder. And MK couldn’t do anything because the school system believes that if your mean to the special kid, you are a terrible person. No matter who we told, it was always turned on us. And don’t think Chris didn’t know he could use this to his advantage. Behind closed door, Chris wouldn’t do his homework, he would cheat on tests, he would talk back to teachers. If we said anything to him about how he was being an absolute CREEP he would storm off and get his aid.  

Feeling helpless, MK pulled the cold turkey. Even though she shared every class with him, and shared the same bus with him, she refused to talk to him. She just pretended not to hear her. Well Chris caught on...fast. He confronted me and Sage very fast. 

“Why isn’t she talking to me?”
“Did I do something wrong?”
“She’s being a jerk!”
“What’s wrong with her?!”

There’s so many things I wanted to yell at him. There’s so many times I’ve wanted to slap his snarky face. But I can’t. We can’t. For 6 months MK pulled cold turkey. Chris was driven insane but his crush on her. He cried to his parents, he would push her against the bus window, he would do ANYTHING to get her to talk to him. 

Eventually, MK broke. She would talk to him now, barely though. One day MK comes in to school. She comes storming through the school doors, red in the face, steam coming from her ears. Chris is trailing behind her, blabbering something. I look at Sage nervously. 

“What’s wrong?”
“This.” 

Mk pointed at Chris. 

“Anna, Mk thinks you can SEE cold.” 
I stare at him, confused. 

“She thinks you can see cold.” 

I stare at sage, who snickers. Apparently, On the bus Chris made a comment about how pRetTy the snow looks. MK responded with “No, it looks cold and miserable.” Chris, trying to show off his “smarts” says something about how you can’t see cold. When sage and I learn this, we back Mk up. The debate continues into lunch. Eventually it turns into everyone against Chris. 

That’s when Chris finds himself losing. And Chris does not like to lose. Chris storms off crying, going to go tell on us. We all stare after him, mouths wide open. I think that was the defying moment where I realized I don’t want to be friends with Chris 


This behavior continues on into the 8th grade. Chris being an asshole, Mk feeling uncomfortable, Chris never apologizing, and sage and I feeling helpless. It’s now the 8th grade. Sadly. Chris’s behavior has only gotten creepier, meaner, and more annoying. And we can’t do anything. Because we will get in trouble for trying to protect our friend from a bully. Because although I could beat Chris up without even trying (which I will never do), Chris is a manipulative, lying, bully. 

So that’s where you redditors come in. I need advice, and fast. I can’t stand to see another day of MK not being able to feel comfortable in her own friend group. I know my friends and I may seem like jerks,  but I promise you I have called myself a jerk 100000000000 times. I miss the old Chris and I hate the situation I’m in. If you want more details on the Chris problem, just comment because I’m willing to answer any questions. 

Hopefully this doesn’t get hurried :)",11Dec2019,1
215,"I'm on mobile so I'm sorry if it looks off, I also don't know if this is the right subreddit or not.

B = kitten's name

Um I don't know how to start this off and I'm sorry if it's all over the place as I said before I don't know how to start this off (nor do I know how to explain it). I would really appreciate any advice/answers!

Anyway, recently (October 4th this year) my family and I have gotten a new addition to our family, at the time B was around 4-5 months old, and he is a very playful and is a 'crackhead' ( my mom's word for hyper &amp; crazy ) 

B will go absolutely insane when he starts playing and will throw himself on the floor while play fighting with our 2 other cats (both over a year old), chasing after yellow nerf balls, jumping so high up in the air when you use the wand and especially when B is play fighting or chasing after stuff he flings himself into the wall, flips himself and slams into sh*t, basically, he f*cking yeets himself into anything. 

When he does yeet himself he hits his hip/back leg area and his head sometimes too, B acts like he didn't do just that and doesn't show any signs of being hurt but I know that doesn't mean he isn't hurt, he's just not showing it.

It f*cking terrifies me when B does that because I'm scared he will (sooner or later) hurt himself badly, I have tried to stop playing with him once he starts winding up but since we have other cats that hasn't been working.

To be honest, I will admit that it may not be as bad as I think it is but I'd rather be safe than sorry, I'm just worried that it means there is something wrong with him, please help and let me know because if it isn't as bad as I thought then I wouldn't have to worry so much but, of course I would still keep an eye on B, thank you!",11Dec2019,1

218,"A month ago I [F] met my coworker [M] who is actually my supervisor. I had seen him a couple times from a distance before, but we had never talked until the day we ""officially"" met. We talked a few times during the week and fast forward to next week he spent lots of time talking to me and joking around which was kinda weird cause he never came by before.

Following day, it wasn't so busy and my other coworker asked me if I'm in a relationship and immediately I knew this had to do with my supervisor ( I already thought he was cute but no one knew). Next thing you know she says ""my bf and coworkers think that he's making a move"" and proceeds to say ""he's spending too much time with you"" ""you guys are cute together"". I laughed it off and told her I thought he was cute. (Dating is allowed at my workplace.)

Anyway, next day we had a few weird interactions and at one point he winked at me but I didn't say anything. That night he kept trying to talk to me but I was sorta trying to avoid him cause earlier during the day my coworkers who started all this kept making funny faces which was so childish but I had to be professional so I didn't react. At the end of the night one of my coworkers told me he was looking for me. I found him while leaving and he asked me if he'll see me tomorrow and I said no I'm off and he didn't say anything for a second and his mood seemed to be a bit off all of a sudden. I told him I'll see him sometime next week and left.

Next day when I saw him he sorta got mad at me for something but honestly seems like he was already mad and took it out on me. Problem is we haven't talked since that day which sucks because he would always come by since we started talking :( but then again we have had different shifts and I took a few days off, plus it has been quite busy. 

I just feel like he knows that I know he was trying to make a move? But I'm not 100% sure cause he was so nice and all of a sudden he got mad that day? I feel like it all has to do with that rumor and me knowing. I feel like I should tell my coworkers to stop with the rumors so that it's not awkward for us to work together.

Also that same week he got mad at my coworker for calling him to come and help her but during the previous week he told me to call him whenever I needed anything? This was kinda weird cause a few of my coworkers have told me they don't like him and say he's bipolar but he honestly seems like a nice guy and willing to help. 

I'm kinda nervous to face him because he probably thinks I'm bitchy since I did try to avoid him a few times but the only reason for that was that it's inappropriate in my opinion to be in a relationship with my supervisor. If it were to go that far I would honestly quit from there and then pursue the relationship.

Anyway what do you guys think I should do about this situation?

I wouldn't let it bother me, but now my stress eating has gotten to the point where I literally make myself sick. I eat and eat and eat and once I'm finally done, my stomach hurts and I'm nauseous.

I’m in the military, marine corps. A few months back we had his 2 month field op in California. We had like 40 people in one “can” (it’s literally a huge can cut in half) 

This guy that slept next to me... uh so we had a problem with peope coming in and stealing shit. Someone stole his ray bans. And someone stole my AirPods (long story) 

Well, we got back and it’s been a couple of weeks and like last week he saw me wearing ray bans, same model. I didn’t think anything of it but yesterday I heard him talking smack behind my back to his friends  implying I stole his. 

Ok so that’s the issue this is my argument which again seems like a no brainer to me but I may just be delusional. 

I’m from California, DO YOU KNOW HOW COMMON THESE SHITS ARE IN CALI? that’s argument one. DO YOU KNOW HOW EVEN MORE COMMON THESE SHITS ARE ON A MILITARY BASE??? argument 3: EVEN MORE ON A MARINE CORPS BASE?????? 

ok so real story, I haven’t been here for long. We didn’t know each other before we went to this field op. He was implying “he didn’t have ray bans in said field op but mangically he has them after field op x “

I have a eye issue which it was recommended to me to always wear sunglasses by my optometrist so I thought hey if imma wear ugly ass glasses might as well get nice sunglssses. Again, he hadn’t known me before this thing so how the fuck could he have seen me? Then, I did take mine to the field op BUT I never used them because I valued too much to scratch them which proved to be the right decision becuase I took my issues sunglasses as well and they got so scratched up.

My fiancé wanted to write her off 3 years ago after she showed her true colors and treated us both awfully but I tried to encourage him to mend things because it’s his mom(i now know this was wrong of me) so he sucked it up and played nice. 
This past weekend she was a b— to me while we were visiting and so was her daughter. They were both being repulsive to my fiancé and I and I caught them talking crap about me multiple times. By the end of the night I finally had it. I called her out for talking s— about me and she pretended to be soooo sorry but later she complained to my fiancé that I had a meltdown over nothing and that they weren’t even taking about me(she’s a compulsive liar). I didn’t have a meltdown I was just quietly crying and trying to hide it when she asked me what was wrong. (I’m very shy and I don’t typically tell people what’s wrong) so I told her I heard her talking s— and that if she had a problem please just tell me. She said okay...No meltdown at all. ANYWAY that and her and her daughters behavior that night caused my fiancé and I to finally be done with her. I told him I wasn’t going over for Christmas and I want a break from his family. 
Tonight, he told his mom how he really felt about her and that he’d wanted to write her off 3 years ago but I was keeping them together. She blamed me for telling him to do this(I didn’t of course) and then told him how much of a mistake he was making and needless to say she isn’t in our lives anymore. We won’t reach out this time unless she apologizes(she never has before. We always have to reach out after SHES the one in the wrong.Yes, this has happened before)

230,"A few weeks ago, I was in the emergency room at a local hospital and they claimed I had pneumonia.   When I would cough, I would get pain almost as bad as a kidney stone in the right side lung.   I had multiple kidney stones in my life, so I know how bad the pain can be.

The next day, after I was in the hospital, I tried to get out of bed, and I screamed out in pain.  The pain was worst then a kidney stone, when I tried to raise my body and I guess I was putting pressure on my lung when I tried to get up.   I took tylenol (extended release) and the next day after that one, I was able to get out of bed, and within a few days, I could cough without pain.

Now this is where it gets complicated, I was at my lung doctor today, and he looked at the x-ray from the hospital and said that he believes I didn't take a deep breadth  (I was coughing a lot the day I was in the hospital), so I could of been coughing when they did the x-ray.   The doctor explained it as, if you cough, your lungs would compress, and that could show up in the x-ray as a solid area.   That is how he explained it, in a way I could understand.    He said that is why they always ask you to take a deep breadth when they do the x-ray.  So he isn't even sure if I had pneumonia because of the x-ray.   He said it could of just been bronchitis.

My question is on the pain though, does anyone know if you can get that much pain in your lungs, from:

1) A pulled muscle?   If you are coughing all day, day after day, for a couple weeks.  Could a pulled muscle cause as much pain as a kidney stone?    

2) Can you get as much pain as a kidney stone, if I had bronchitis?   Or does only pneumonia cause that much pain, or even that doesn't?

3) What other things could cause that much pain in the lungs?    

&amp;#x200B;

232,"I'm currently a grad student, studying international finance and economics, who is applying for internships. A professor of mine told me that my ""first.last@gmail.com"" wasn't considered a professional email address. 

I figured that he was probably right and that it was time to get my own custom domain. I signed up through gsuite and created a @firstlast.com domain. If I'm using it to apply (and hopefully get accepted) for professional and more conservative finance internships in New York, would contact@firstlast.com be my best bet?

233,"Over awhile now it seems I noticed a pattern where the majority of my friends seem to speak more about themselves and not ask much about me. A couple of them do, maybe 5% or so, but the rest seem content to talk about their interests or drama with rarely any questions my way-unless it's like one then going back to them.

Yes, my life isn't that interesting but it would be nice to get asked about it more every once in awhile. Most days it feels like my boyfriend is my only best friend now.

234,"I love my Dad to death, he's a great person and he was my childhood hero. Since becoming an adult I have realized my Dad is one of the unhappiest people I know - he works hard and earns a lot of money, he has a long term girlfriend after my mom and him divorced, he owns property and has recently started going on vacations but he is miserable much of the time.

He works probably 12 hours a day, 8 at his job, 2 hours for the commute, and then a few hours at one of the rental properties he owns or on his own home. He works out, too, and sleeps an average of 5 or 6 hours a day.

His whole life seems to be work and it makes me feel like shit because I know he is working hard in part so he can pass on what he has earned to me one day. 

I have tried talking to him and suggesting hobbies, reading, Christianity, but he is content in his ways... I don't want him to live the remainder of his years in misery, but he is a very stubburn person when it comes to change.

Do you have any advice for me? Anything I could try that would help him slow down a bit and enjoy his life? I would really appreciate any advice from you people, thanks in advance",11Dec2019,1

243,"My grandsons were taken into CPS custody and put in foster care in 2014. Once it was obvious that my son and the boys mom were not going to get custody back and after many family discussions we decided it would be best for them to be adopted as long as the adoptive parents were open to us being in their lives.  I know many people will wonder why we did not adopt the boys, but we wanted what was best for them. Being in our home where their parents can show up when they want to and act like their parent for 5 mins and then disappearing for another year wasn’t something we though would be in their best interest, but this is just one of many reasons.  As they were taken by CPS after a domestic dispute they were placed in foster care initially.  The foster parents were great with the boys, they already had a biological daughter and they seemed like the perfect fit.  We had the boys over at our house regularly, taking them on weekends and when they went on vacation.  Once the bio parents lost complete custody (2017) and adoption discussions came up  we were told that the foster parents were interested in adopting them and wanted us to continue being apart of their lives. We could continue being grandparents and the boys would be with amazing loving parents.  We continue seeing the boys every month or 2, and things were great until this September when the adoption was finalized. Within a few weeks we received an email stating they didn’t want us to see the boys anymore. No reason, just they felt or was best. We have never had an argument, never had any issues at all so this came totally out of left field. They blocked us from all social media and told us to not contact them.  We did try to contact them through email to reason with them, to ask why but were again told we can no longer see the boys and that’s that. They did offer to send school pictures. These boys have been in my life for 7 years and I’m devastated.  I feel like I was lied to because clearly as soon as the adoption was finalized they said we can’t see them.  I have contacted a lawyer and she said we have a strong case for seeking visitations with them but it will take a while to go through the courts.  I just can’t help feeling guilty for taking them to court knowing all the cost associated with a lawyer and then having to deal with them once (hopefully) visitations are reinstated. I guess I’m just looking to hear what others would do in this situation, take them to court?

Scared my Girlfriend is pregnant...

On Saturday my Girlfriend and I were messing around and being stupid, and I put my penis in her unprotected. I didn’t really thrust too much it was just in her for a couple of seconds (At the very most 10. I pulled it out and then we started to panic. We checked her period tracker app and it said that she was ovulating the day before, which means she could’ve been fertile that day. She also had cramps for 2 days before that which we think might have been implantation cramps. We got Plan B on Sunday and she took it.

I didn’t ejaculate, and it wasn’t like I was hardcore going at it... it was just in her for a couple of seconds. I only worry because of pre-cum. I have tried to edge myself while masturbating for a long time to see if pre-cum comes out and I don’t think I have ever seen any come out.. but I feel like it might have come out this time for whatever reason. I’m also just scared that she was ovulating at that time, and even though she took Plan B, if the egg had already met with the sperm the Plan B wouldn’t do anything to prevent it...

It may be illogical to be worried, but I can’t help it... we chose to do something stupid at a very stupid time and now I’m going to be worried for a long time. Please somebody just reassure me with facts

She wanted her car back and offered to pay for the 2.5 weeks I watched the dogs and the transfer fee (about 500 bucks). I told them since I had driven it they only needed to give me 350. I provided proof the car had stopped being driven (switched insurance over and plates, took pic of odometer). I also rushed and had my beater fixed up so they could have the car. They were happy and they're they'd pay it on thursday. The title is in my name as is the registration. We had no set payment schedule or arrangement, more of a lackadaisical 'we will figure it out'. Then, she decided she didn't want cash payments, just the car back. She has been asking me to drop the car off at her place and sign the title over, wanting to pay me back later.  Now today she messages me she is only paying 100 and wants the car back NOW. I'm fine with giving the car back. I'm not fine with the bait and switch. She called me a horrible person and threatened to slander my name as well, claiming I left her dogs alone for 2 days when I have proof I did no such thing (we have a camera in our house and that's where they were).

248,"Hi,

I have something that’s been bothering me as of recently. A few weeks ago I met and hooked up with a girl and it felt like we hit it off (this is girl #1). She ended up inviting me to  her formal and I thought it would be fun to go because she was fun and we got along well. 

Closer to the formal, I met a new girl and hooked up with her and I thought we hit it off even better (this is girl #2). She said that she was also going to that formal and would see me there. 

So I said cool and was still excited to go with girl#1 to her formal and have a good time with her, not really hoping for anything besides having a good time and meeting new people. Also was excited to see girl #2 but not much more. 

The formal comes and we are having a good time and everyone is pretty tipsy. Then I finally run into girl #2 and without even thinking we suddenly pick up right where we left off after talking for a bit and begin to hook up again. 

I was pretty drunk at this point and had basically forgotten about my actual formal date and decided to go back with girl #2 and hang with her for the rest of the night.

The next day comes around and I feel pretty bad about what I did. My date sent me a text responding to “my thank you for taking me text” essentially voicing her anger and distaste with what happened.

I feel really really bad and am terrible with dealing with these type of situations. What do you suggest that I do or say to ensure that we can stay friends and there are no hard feelings? I know it was disrespectful to do that and feel like the alcohol played a role in my poor decision process. (Tbf tho I do have a bit of a crush on girl#2) but still don’t want to ruin my friendship with girl1.

249,"I study in the US for my undergrad and I just finished my finals. I was dumb in September and didn't think I would want to go home in December winter break. I'm an international student and it would cost $2,515 for a round trip. My winter break is exactly 25 days if you don't count the time I spend on flights. The next time I would be able to go home is the first week of September since I have an internship lined up for the summer. The last time I was home was in September. I don't think I miss home now (just slightly) but I might miss it a lot in the next few months and I wouldn't be able to leave because of school. 

The reason I'm thinking about this is $2,515 is a lot. It's the same as my 1 quarter's housing fee. It would put a financial burden on my family but they said they would figure it out. I don't know how much because they never tell me the exact money they have. Should I just trust their judgment and go or should I just stay? Staying just means that I'll be in my dorm. My roommate isn't really a friend and she's leaving. I don't know anyone who is in the city for the winter break.

Backstory: I’m sick of my high school for multiple reasons 1.

I am constantly harassed not only by students but by teachers.

252,"I'm a senior in college (I graduate next semester) I'm 29 had always struggled with finishing my degree. I found out completely out of nowhere that my financial aid got taken away because I'm apparently ""over credits"". 

I was given multiple emails stating I WAS going to receive financial aid and I even **called the financial aid office at my college** before my semester even started to make sure everything would be in order for me to have a smooth semester.

I waited 3 whole weeks for that money to come in and didn't even have money for food and was almost 2 months behind on my rent because of this. It got to the point that I was becoming extremely behind on my course-work because I didn't have money for my textbooks and course materials. 

My family is very low income, my father has Parkinson's disease and has so much debt he can barely afford to live and my mother only makes about 25k a year. My family doesn't really have the means to help me and I can't even really have them co-sign any loans. My mother had to help me financially a lot this semester (eating less in order to send me money), I also work but only PT for the time being as I only have 1 semester left.

tbh, I did horrible this semester I haven't gotten my final grades back but I'm positive I failed at least half my classes due to the overwhelming financial stress this whole ordeal has been. I completely shut down this semester, I tried to focus on my coursework but I just had zero motivation, this entire semester I've constantly stress to pay my rent, and basic living expenses. I could barely commit to studying because I simply had no will power to.

The whole experience made me so emotionally upset because of how little my university cared about my situation they basically treated me like some f\*\* up. that on top of being surrounded by middle to upper-class students I feel so disconnected because I know most these students aren't dealing with as much as I am and it just infuriates me because I can see and obvious factor of these students successes in academia is mostly due to ""mommy and daddy's money"". If I simply got the $2000 loan I needed for my rent and materials the outcome of this semester would have been completely different.

I'm just trying to understand why I couldn't muster the will power to put effort into my studies. Could anyone help me out?",11Dec2019,1

256,"I work at a pet store and one day, we were cleaning the bird cages before open. I was helping train a new employee. I took the bowls and such to the back to soak in the disinfectant and returned to help him catch the birds. Shortly after, I noticed two white cage dividers, which were extra and we didn’t need. I figured he brought them out thinking we’d need them. I didn’t say anything until after we had finished. He asked me what they were for. I said “oh, we don’t need them.” And he responded, “why’d you bring them out then?” A month later, he still insists I brought them out. I had no reason to and have never touched them before or since this incident. 

This morning, the same coworker (we work together often) mentioned me promising to adopt a budgie (parakeet) from a customer who’s birds had laid eggs. That customer had come in and described me. A manager who was there during the supposed incident where I made the promise mentioned my name, (an uncommon name that I won’t share here) and the woman said that was me. 

I don’t remember promising to adopt a budgie. I don’t remember a customer telling me theirs laid eggs. I would not have said I could take one because I couldn’t. I live with a roommate who said no more birds (I have one and she has 3, but I’m a tenant more than anything and she’s very concerned about maintaining quarantine). I don’t remember any part of this interaction. I’m generally a forgetful person, but I’m mostly a “oh, now that you mention it, I remember” type of forgetful and not a full on “that never happened...” person. 

I stopped by my work after my shift to pick up bird food, and a completely different set of coworkers told me the woman came back and asked for me again. They aren’t gaslighting me, unless the whole staff is in on it. 

I don’t have insurance at the moment, I’m applying for Medicaid but that takes time. My family has a history of cancer and my biggest concern is that this is an undeniable sign of just that.

However, one person doesn't want to participate in any of the physical or outdoor activities we do. Like walks, hikes, martial arts, meditation, and studying in the park. She also doesn't want to have to do the compulsory second language study we do. We asked if there are anythings stopping her from doing these, and she said she just doesn't want to and that it doesn't interest her (she doesn't work I feel I should add so there isn't anything stopping her with time). These make up well over half of everything we do. She has been going for 3 months. Should we get rid of the physical things, as I have been told it is exclusionary of overweight people.

258,"Disclaimer: this is a throwaway. 

I have a best friend who is 17, I am 24. We met online about 6 years ago and she told me for a long time that she was the same age as me, when she told me she was in fact not the same age as me I decided that we could still be friends because that's all we were - friends. I struggled with this decision as I felt creepy for having an underaged friend, but to this day I have never been intimate, sexual, or romantic with her. I never intend on crossing that boundary. 

My friend will be 18 this next May.

The reason I'm making this post is because I have another friend - he is 23, 24 in February. I met him before her and introduced them and they were friends for a few years too. Within the past 6 months things have become romantic for them, though they both deny that they are swapping any NSFW content and that no sexual relations have been had. It's clear from some screenshots I have seen that they have been a little inappropriate, but only in text conversations. 

Both parties knew how old the other one was before they began dating, and the initial agreement was that they wouldn't be official until my best friend was 18, this ended up being too far away for them. The no sexual stuff rule seems to have stuck though. 

The reason I'm making this post is this - is this child grooming? I'm worried about it. After listening to all the videos on Onision and hearing about how he groomed girls just before they turned 18 so he could have sex with them when they came of age I am worried. I know these two are deeply in love and I believe that my friend would not hurt my best friend. I don't even know what I'd do if this was child grooming, what could I even say? I know their intention is to be sexual once she turns 18, which means if they stick to what they planned to do it may be legal? I don't know.

It's awkward too because my friend and I (the 23 year old one) briefly had sexual relations during our teenage years and so being supportive of my best friend being with him has been quite weird. I don't want to come across as jealous because I have my own boyfriend now and it has nothing to do with jealously. I just want to do what's right.",11Dec2019,1
259,"I’ve always felt this way, but I’ve never actually told my sister about it. My sister is 23 and I am 19, and we don’t have any other siblings. Basically, my sister is very good looking, and I’m not like her at all. We have similar body types, but she’s a few inches shorter than me (although we’re both really short). Usually when I tell guys this, they go “oh wow! That’s so tiny/cute/hot/etc.” I don’t think guys would like it if I told them their height was ok but their brother’s taller and hotter. 

Also she has a cute, soft, almost childlike face, and wears braces. I have a long, very angular face. People always think I’m the older sister. We’re black and she’s lighter skinned with freckles, while I’m pretty dark, and lighter is still better in our community of course. She’s had lots of boyfriends, while I haven’t. I have gone on dates and received attention and all that, and people have told me I’m good looking, but I feel like I can’t be like her.

If I got into a long term relationship one day, eventually my boyfriend would meet her, and he’d probably think “dammit, I got the uglier one.” I’ve shown her picture to my friends, and they always say “oh, I’m sorry.” I showed her to guys and they said “wow, she’s hot! I mean...you’re hot too. At least her nose is bigger than yours?” Growing up relatives would always compliment her beauty, and not mine. My mom tries to give me compliments to even it out, but it doesn’t help.

This has been a really long rant, but I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve already heard all that empty stuff about being beautiful in my own way, or it’s what’s on the inside that counts, or that pretty people have problems too. It doesn’t mean anything to me, because I just want to look like my sister and I can’t. How do I deal with this fact?",11Dec2019,1

268,"
A couple months ago I was browsing pornhub like usual till I discovered stepmom porn, so I was curious and clicked on it and I thought it was okay. Then the next day I kept having these thoughts about doing it with my mom that I found disgusting and shameful. I didn’t want these thoughts in my head I tried everything to get them out but they would just keep coming. So I thought maybe I was attracted to my mom, but I don’t think I was because the thought of doing it with her disgusted me and I would have no desire to even deep down. Ever since, I’ve still had the thoughts and at this point I’m so used to them that the thoughts only gross me out a little bit.  And I fear that in a couple months it might not bother me at all and then I’ll slowly begin to be attracted to my mother. So any advice? I have really strict parents that I can’t keep anything from so I don’t know what I’d say if I wanted to go to therapy for something private.",11Dec2019,1

273,"I feel like I’m the one of the most loneliest, invisible, and unliked female in the world. And this is why: outside of my immediate family I feel like I don’t really have anyone. I’ve felt this way for YEARS. Middle school started this feeling for me. I haven’t had an actual friend since 6th grade. I’m 21 and I still feel lonely, invisible, and overlooked. I receive little to no attention from anyone, male or female. Anytime I make an effort to make a friend it almost never ever works out. I can’t keep or make a friend to save my life. Sometimes I question if it’s because I’m ugly, if it’s because I’m too weird, or is it because I’m not enough. I mean I wouldn’t say I’m all that but I don’t think I’m a terrible person or strikingly ugly, so I don’t get what it is.  Often times I feel discouraged and won’t even really put in effort to make a friend, bc I already feel like it won’t work out or last. The other person I try to make friends with just doesn’t have the same energy as me since 9/10 they already have friends of their own so it wouldn’t really matter to them if we became friends or not. 

 I’m in college and I have yet to make an actual friend. Had one freshmen year and she completely flaked on me and it’s been me all by myself since.  The people where I’m from aren’t that friendly and inviting so it makes it even harder on me to make a friend. I want a best friend/ friends I want someone I can have fun with and just completely be myself. I want a social life. It just seems so far out of reach.

I suspected they were in my other roommate's room, because she has admitted to being messy and is a bit weird about always sliding out of her room and shutting the door quickly so no one can glimpse inside. Anyways, today I decided to peek in when she was at work just to check if she did in fact have our dishes. And...omg. It was horrifying. Worse than I ever could have imagined. She definitely had tons of dirty dishes, as well as loads of other trash and junk. Empty cardboard boxes stacked practically to the ceiling, empty ice cream containers with our spoons still in them, empty soda cans, wrappers, etc. It looked like the rooms on the TV show Hoarders. I just shut the door. 

Now I don't know what to do though. I'm less concerned about the dishes (although that's annoying) but more worried about the general state of her room. And kind of her mental state but when she moved in she said she's always been pretty messy and would keep it confined to her room, so I guess it's not abnormal for her. It's gross, though.

281,"Sorry for poor formatting I’m on mobile. 

I’m going to try and make this as short as possible and just get straight to the point. The main people are Ex- my ex girlfriend, Mack- current girlfriend, Elizabeth- other girl.


It all begins in my junior year where I had been with my ex for around 3 years. At that point we didn’t have the best relationship but it was ok. I began going to a new school that year where she went as I’m still in high school and the old school wasn’t a fit for me. On my first day at this new school I walk into one of my class and see the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. But the thing was she wasn’t the most beautiful girl, she was very attractive but I wouldn’t say I was attracted to her looks only, I was just imminently attracted to her. Before I could even talk to her I just had this insane connection with her I’d never felt before where every time I’d glance in her direction I’d get this ultra intense feeling of butterflies but something different. I don’t know how to describe the feeling but I’ve never had anything near it with any other person ever. After a week or so I work up the courage to talk to her and she compliments my shirt and I compliment her and we talk about my old school blah blah blah but the whole time I just feel like I know her on another level and we are just meant for eachother, and the thing was I could tell she felt the same way because I’d constantly just catch myself looking in her direction and making direct eye contact with her as she did the same and by the way we talked to eachother I knew there was a connection. During this time I was still in a relationship with my EX which pretty much fell apart. I don’t want to get too much into detail but it just wasn’t working at all anymore because I stopped caring because all I could think about was how badly I wanted Elizabeth. It was so crazy that I could literally think about her and get the feeling of butterflies like without seeing her for days. Sadly she ended up having to switch out of her class and I realized I never got her full name or any type of communication with her. I became really depressed after and eventually broke up with my ex because of constant fighting from me not caring and held my desire for Elizabeth. Fast forward to my next year of high school where I find a new girlfriend who I’ve been with for a while now. Me and Mack my new girlfriend are amazing we have a great relationship we hang all the time love spending time together we’re close with each other’s families like everything is perfect. At this point I’ve almost forgotten about Elizabeth so everything is good. Until one day she follows me on Instagram. Everything came back that day, Elizabeth became all I thought about even with my already very good relationship. About a month later in present time I see Elizabeth in the halls and everytime I do we lock eyes and just stare at eachother and I get the most intense butterflies I’ve ever felt. I also currently am having the same relationship issues that I had with my ex that started soon as Elizabeth followed me. 


Any advice on what I Should do? I love Mack and it would hurt so much to lose her but I just feel like I’ll always regret not going for Elizabeth as I do truly feel an almost love at first sight with her. Someone please help me this was mostly just to vent but any feedback would be appreciated.",11Dec2019,1
282,"Some quick background. I'm in the process of restoring one of my first cars, a silver blue 1983 Mercedes 300SD. It's the car that taught me how to work on cars. I drove it all over the country in it on waste vegetable oil and made countless memories. I sadly sold it in 2011. But then saw it on Craigslist and bought it back! The car is worth scrap value to anyone else but it's irreplaceable to me.

On to the story

A few months ago I had the Veggiewagen shipped across the country and began the restoration. Until she went in for paint I spent literally every day after work and every weekend either tearing her apart or under the sun in a junkyard getting replacement parts. But some things I just can't do and paint is one of them. 

It's incredibly difficult to find someone who will do this sort of work. Most body shops are just collision. Restorers don't even want to talk prices. It's five figures. But lucky me, I managed to get a list of places from a fun sassy lady in a paint shop. As I went down the list everyone was booked up. The last place sounded great though. I really liked J, the guy I talked to. He had me go to the shop to talk to R the guy who runs the place. 

When I got there the place was shady. Door was locked. Wanted me to pay as they did the work. Their yelp reviews were bad and no social media presence. But dude really knew his stuff, seemed cool and the price was right. They also told me they could put on the custom $4k leather upholstery I bought. Upholsterers are impossible to find. Shut up and take my money! I gave them a deposit and had my car towed to their shop.

Last week I went to drop off some more parts and was a little early. Door was locked, obviously. There was an older lady in an F250 very loudly trying to be discreet. She came up to my Jeep and asked to talk to me down the street. Ummm... okay? She told me her son's truck had been there for 9 months, she'd given them 30k dollars and she couldn't get in touch with R or J. They were only supposed to put in *air suspension*. That's like a two week job. I'm now freaked. We exchanged information to try and help each other out. 

But once I saw R later everything seemed fine. We talked Jeeps, details on the restoration, how bad the weather was, all that good stuff. Walked away feeling super amped about my project. Guys, I seriously plan it in my head every night before going to sleep.

Fast forward to two hours ago. The older lady sent me a text with a link to an article. The DA charged 13 people with a criminal conspiracy including J. Some of the charges included ""chop shop activity"". The chop shop... same place the Veggiewagen is sitting outside of as I type. FML.

I'm still processing and figuring out what to do. I think there's a chance that now that J is gone R is just doing what he loves. But that's a big leap of faith. Even if it's the case what if the DA shuts it down and impounds the cars?

I don't see any great options. I can just ask to get it back and forfeit the deposit. But the old lady tried to do that and they wanted to keep juicing her son for months. And if that's the route I take should I just tell the truth or make up some other reason (I don't have the money). I could hire a repo guy to straight up steal it back. That leaves 7k worth of stuff I restored or bought in their shop. And it's a no go if the car is not accessible.

Reddit, I need some ideas bad. I get that it's just a car... but it's not. It's family to me. I'm willing to spend 20k getting it back, but obviously would prefer to spend nothing. I'd like to get back everything I gave them but I have to get the car itself. Any advice?",11Dec2019,1

291,"This was a tough, complicated situation... so it's best you read through the whole thing.

Let's start with some background. I have a cousin, let's call him Mick. So I've obviously known Mick a very long time, AKA, my whole life. We were very close up until a few days ago, (but we'll get to that later.) When I say close, I mean I've supported him through his toughest times; his suicidal thoughts, his sexuality, everything. I've been there supporting him and caring for him through it all. When anyone else tried to fight one of us, or get us to turn on each other, our favorite thing to do was to say, ""loyalty!"". We had each other. And I have never once betrayed his trust. (sorry if this sounds like a brag but it's not intended that way; this is necessary info for you to understand how upset i was).

We are both part of his school drama club. We are both part of one friend group.

This weekend, I got into a fight with one of the people in our friend group.

Since we're a theatre/drama club, we're banned from consuming sweets for a period of time so we don't wreck our voices. Our teacher is very strict and very adamant about this.

The fight started because people in our friend group were sharing pictures and messages of them with their sweet foods, breaking the sugar ban. Everyone was laughing about it, and it became a cool joke to say things like, ""I broke the vocal ban with a donut today, lmao"". After a while, I got fed up and I jokingly threatened to tell our teacher about it. Later, I seriously told them off, saying that they shouldn't be ""bragging about breaking the rules as if it makes you the big hero"". That's when one of our friends got really mad at me. Let's call her Ella. They argued that ""I shouldn't be acting like I'm a saint when y'all have done the exact same thing"". I argue that they don't know that I broke the rules since I have never shared it if i did just to make a ""funny joke"". I argued that I just wanted them to stop treating breaking the rules as if it's something you should be proud of or praised for doing. Though a few of our friends got pissed at me for saying that, I still feel like it was the truth and it needed to be said. This is the first conflict. I can't tell if I was right for telling them off, or too judge-y for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we come back to the topic of my cousin. During this fight, he had my back and was defending me the whole time. Loyalty at its finest. In our private chat, we would vent our frustrations about the situation and the people we were fighting with. Later, I found out he was secretly sharing our private conversations with the person i fought with, Ella. I confronted him about it, and he was very guilty and apologetic for betraying my trust. He claimed that Ella begged him to share our conversations with him, and she threatened to hurt herself, *or worse,* if he didn't share that info with her. Mick decided he couldn't let that happen and so chose Ella over me. This broke my heart. No matter the reason, I couldn't believe the person I was so close with, trusted and cared for so much would do this to me, would break my trust so quickly and easily.

A day later, I realized that he was still on good terms with Ella, despite her being (in my own personal opinion) manipulative and ruining our relationship out of her own selfishness. In fact, he and Ella are closer than ever. He called her his ""family"", told her he loved her, and supported her wholeheartedly. He's never been that affectionate with me. He's never even told *me* he's loved me. This deeply hurt and offended me. I confronted him about it, claiming he chose his side. He got mad and argued that it's not wrong to want to fix his relationship with Ella. He got so mad at me that he decided he is going to stop trying to fix our relationship.

I'm starting to feel as if I've been played, as if I never really was as important to him as I liked to think I was. I feel devastated, but at the same time, I can't help but feel as if I'm right in this situation. But now I'm starting to rethink everything, because what if I've just blown this out of proportion, and ended up losing a best friend over nothing? Should I just forgive, apologize, and work to patch things up with Mick? Or is this justified? What do i do?",11Dec2019,1

295,"Hello, 

I’m just going to be as raw as possible but not give a big sob story. Three days ago, I started feeling a butterfly in my stomach type feeling. It is almost like my stomach has a void while simultaneously in knots. I’m not upset about anything specific. But this feeling is waking me up at night, is almost constant throughout the day (aside from when I’m at the gym or doing something very distracting). But I’m feeling so uneasy about it; almost as if it’s going to last forever. I’ve never experienced this type of anxiety. I’ve only had some social anxiety issues (red flushing face and chest, sweaty hands, flight or flight) that I’ve worked through quite a bit. 

I did have some dramatic life changes happen: 

1. In September I discovered my husband had been cheating on me while out of town for work (he’s out of town now). We’ve made great strides in our own therapy since then. I do feel like I’ve forgiven him but at the same time I’m definitely not as emotional as I was before — sort of as if I’m either a) going number or b) emotionally maturing. I have no clue. But I do feel like I’ve really moved forward in healing. We still have a lot of work to do but there’s been a lot of progress so far. 

2. I just finished a semester of college + interning 300 hours on top of class and homework. I’m now on my “down time” and have been taking it very easy with doing things I wholeheartedly enjoy like being with my son, working out, cooking. In six months, I’ll graduate and begin my career. I’m very motivated to be successful and am doing well in this area. 

3. Two weeks ago I transitioned fully to a plant based whole food diet. (Idk if this is significant)? I’m eating plenty of food and am not hungry. 

4. Since not interning or in school the past few weeks, I’ve been using social media more. I want to stop but kinda feel hooked right now. I do sort of feel like I’m living in my phone but this isn’t something new to me — I just have more time to do it right now since I’m not as busy working during December break. 


I’m just overall so anxiety filled. I’ve always dealt with racing thoughts, worry, and not being in the moment. But having a PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION is scaring the shit out of me. I feel so out of control. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",11Dec2019,1

297,"Hello. I'll just warn everyone now, this may be very long. It's 12am and I'm currently crying, as I have done plenty of times before, about the fact that I that my fiancé spent almost 4 years with an abusive Narc Ex-girlfriend.


I'm going to give as much background as I can without going on a tangent.

(Also, English may be my native language but I'm still horrible at it. Sorry in advance) 

He=Fiancé 
Nex=Ex-girlfriend 
Me, I=Me (not sure if that would be needed but oh well) 

He met her during his last year of high school. He was going through a dark time and in the beginning she was very helpful with his state of mind. He didn't have a good relationship with his mother at the time. (He admitted to his mother that he was depressed and suicidal. She blew it off and called him a drama queen. He didn't trust her after that and wanted to get away.) After graduating high school, he moved in with Nex and her mother. Nex didn't work because of ""anxiety"" but she was truly just lazy. He started working long hours to help pay bills and to buy Nex whatever she wanted. The relationship started going downhill from there. It went from Nex being lazy to her yelling more and more, hitting him and forcing him to have sex with her. 

He tried leaving once and she threatened to call the cops on his friend (friend smokes weed). So he ended up staying with her for 3 years. 
He was unhappy and thought so little of himself. He didn't think he could do any better because she constantly told him he wasn't worth better. 

We met around their 4th year together. Started as friends, I supported him through tough spots in the relationship, until he finally broke it off with Nex. He asked me out a while after and now we're engaged.

I'm going to adress some things yall may have questions/comments about.

1. Could he be lying/manipulating me?

No. I've ask myself this question plenty of times. Maybe he was exaggerating. Maybe it's just a reason to bash his ex because he's bitter about the breakup. Etc. I've done my research so to speak. I've met the girl in person, talked to mutual friends, my fiancees parents as well. All of them have witnessed her wrath. She oozes self absorbed.

2. Aren't you just jealous?

Yes and no. Yes, because I'm human and I get jealous. No, because I wanted to be as civil as possible. I didn't want any drama. I kept to myself and was polite around her always. I really do my best to have an unbiased opinion on things. I know everyone on reddit claims that but you're just going to have to take my word for it.

3. He could have just said no.

I'm tired of being told this. Abuse and rape are still abuse and rape, no matter which gender it happens to. Please, I don't need those comments right now.


The whole reason I'm posting this: closure?

It's like I have all the answers I need but I keep asking why.

Why did he stay? Why didn't he say anything? How could he be so fucking stupid? I feel ignorant and horrible every time I lie awake at night and ask myself these questions. It's like I want to hold him and tell him everything is OK but I also want to shake him and scream ""WHY?! I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!"". I've been trying hard to move on with everything and forget about the past. I want to enjoy my life with my fiancé, not obsess over everything that's happened. It will go away and then start picking at my brain until I'm crying, almost sobbing if it weren't for him being asleep next To me. I'll just browse his social media (we both get into each other's phones, know the password, etc(in the healthiest way possible. I promise. I'm not trying to sound like a control freak)) looking at old pictures of them. I can't help myself. I've tried just ignoring the feeling. Making myself busy with something else, but it always creeps up on me until I'm drowning in this huge pool of sadness and anger. It physically hurts me to look at. It will put me in this horrible, sad, mood for days. I do my best to hide it from my fiancé because I know it bothers him to talk about. I'm just lost and I don't know what to do.

Am I really jealous? Is that all this amounts to? It can't be that simple. I hate her, not because she's his ex, but because of what she did.

I don't know what to do. I just want these awful feelings to go away.

Any advice would be great. If there's another sub I should post this to, please let me know. 
(FYI I can't afford therapy so I guess that's off the table)

But now I reached out to him and he  reached out an hour later and we discussed our issues in our relationship which led to our downfall. I apologized and he apologized as well.

But he says he doesnt think he has the same feelings as he used to for me. But he said we are good and he accepts my apology. And that we will talk later this week and go from there.

Both of us liked eachother and we both said how good it was and then it just turned to crap because of what I did.

So I don't know where we stand at all.

He was very hurt by my behavior that much I can tell and he isn't sure that this will be the last time it happen. I can DM for what I did. 

It was a mix of poor communication and jumping to conclusions on my part. And us not having time for eachother.

Is it over for us or is it something that can be salvaged? What does his behavior indicate?

He accepted my apology and we had a really good talk about everything and we still have other things to go over. I really like him and my feelings for him haven't changed. And I told him that it was going really well for us and this happened, I acknowledged where I went wrong and explained myself and apologized which he accepted.

So what does this mean?",11Dec2019,1
299," 

I'm a senior in college (I graduate next semester) I'm 29 had always struggled with finishing my degree. I found out completely out of nowhere that my financial aid got taken away because I'm apparently ""over credits"".

I was given multiple emails stating I WAS going to receive financial aid and I even **called the financial aid office at my college** before my semester even started to make sure everything would be in order for me to have a smooth semester.

I waited 3 whole weeks for that money to come in and didn't even have money for food and was almost 2 months behind on my rent because of this. It got to the point that I was becoming extremely behind on my course-work because I didn't have money for my textbooks and course materials.

My family is very low income, my father has Parkinson's disease and has so much debt he can barely afford to live and my mother only makes about 25k a year. My family doesn't really have the means to help me and I can't even really have them co-sign any loans. My mother had to help me financially a lot this semester (eating less in order to send me money), I also work but only PT for the time being as I only have 1 semester left.

tbh, I did horrible this semester I haven't gotten my final grades back but I'm positive I failed at least half my classes due to the overwhelming financial stress this whole ordeal has been. I completely shut down this semester, I tried to focus on my coursework but I just had zero motivation, this entire semester I've constantly stress to pay my rent, and basic living expenses. I could barely commit to studying because I simply had no will power to.

The whole experience made me so emotionally upset because of how little my university cared about my situation they basically treated me like some f\*\* up. that on top of being surrounded by middle to upper-class students I feel so disconnected because I know most these students aren't dealing with as much as I am and it just infuriates me because I can see and obvious factor of these students successes in academia is mostly due to ""mommy and daddy's money"". If I simply got the $2000 loan I needed for my rent and materials the outcome of this semester would have been completely different.

I'm just trying to understand why I couldn't muster the will power to put effort into my studies. Could anyone help me out?",11Dec2019,1

302,"This story is pretty long....
I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 3 years, since we were both 18. We met in high school when we were younger, but didn't start a relationship until after high school ended. We both come from toxic families (narcissistic, abusive mothers, absentee fathers); whereas he had his grandparents to bring him up, I really had/have no family who cares much about my well-being. 

When we began our relationship, I was living in a transitional living shelter &amp; we started living together about 6 months into our relationship because I ended up getting kicked out for not being able to keep a job/save money (the issue that has me ""stuck"" in this situation.) To make an already long story a bit shorter, I got my own place for a while through public housing &amp; gave it up because I just wanted to be with him so bad all the time (attachment issues, yes, I'm aware that I have them &amp; am working on them). So, now we've been living together again for about 5 months &amp; things are getting very toxic. We both suffer from anxiety &amp; depression; my anxiety is social, his more generalized. I can't lie &amp; say that it hasn't been like this the whole time, but my mindset was much different entering our relationship than now. I no longer want to stay down &amp; stagnant &amp; I know he doesn't either, but I've been actively trying to change my thought patterns through meditation, mantras, affirmations, etc. &amp; he's more stuck in his ways &amp; his depression/suicidal thoughts are getting worse now.... I just started a new job &amp; I'm really struggling already, but I'm determined to keep it &amp; save money at least until I can find something better but I'm eager to get out of this environment, without ending up God knows where. We've had too many physical altercations, too many suicide threats &amp; enough toxicity. He really is a sweet, caring man and I love him dearly, but he doesn't want help &amp; I just want to be independent &amp; not feel like I'm being sucked into the black hole everytime this happens. 

I depend on him for transportation, although I've slowly been learning how to drive and do already have a car. I know the answer may seem clear to many, but I just really need advice on how to cope with/get through this situation.",11Dec2019,1

Anyways, I got a call from work by mistake and I let it ring as I said I was NA. My fiance became concerned and said I should pick it up and take a shift if I was called in for work. I said it's ok this call is a mistake as I said I was NA today. But even then he said I should take the shifts if I am called for them because he was concerned I won't keep this job aftee xmas...

I asked her what the account was and she just kept responding “just search lauren, just search lauren”. I ended up finding the models second account and asked if the bio was right and she said “no, just forget about it” and I said, “the account is x right?” And she just said “never mind, never mind, forget about it.” But in that moment I felt such a great wave of anxiety.. i know its not the way she wanted to say it, but it sounded as if i did something wrong. She has done that one or two other times. And another habit she does is when I ask try to talk to her or ask her questions while she’s on her phone, it takes her maybe 30-60 seconds to even look up. And whenever she responds to me while on her phone, it’s usually her staring at her phone while mumbling a very faint answer that i can barely understand. I understand that she is very popular and has many friends back home, but what the hell? And she is always on her phone, so this happens frequently. Just to be clear, its not the phone usage I care about, its her not paying attention/responding when i ask her a simple question. Whenever she talks to me when I’m on my phone, I just put my phone down for 2 minutes and go back to what i was doing later.

319,"My situation:

I am about to start my second semester at the University of Houston. It wasn't my first pick but they offered a lot of money and UT didn't accept me into my choice major (Mechanical Engineering). I've always had a fondness for physics and math growing up and watching those educational videos on Youtube: ASAPscience, Vsauce, Veritasium, etc. Well after my second semester at UH is up I am very much considering transferring into UT. 

pros: 

I would be at my dream school with a top engineering program. UT Rank 11 vs UH rank 69 (nice).

If an employer considered a resume between a UH and UT student, he would pick the UT student. 

UT is an overall more lively and social place where I'd have a good time. I have a lot of friends there already.

&amp;#x200B;

cons:

I don't know how to do much. I barely started learning to do my own laundry and can cook very very basic meals. I have everything figured out staying home at UH. At UT I'd be sort of lost, or at the very least struggling to stay on track.

I'd be leaving behind a lot of important things. Yes, I know I should be thinking of myself, but my girlfriend has been a huge rock for me. If it wasn't for her I don't think my first semester would have gone as smoothly as it did. I developed a good studying habit that I lacked in high school and I was overall super happy at home because I was able to be with her almost every day.

I'd be leaving behind family. Honestly this one is not really a con, I love my family very much but I had already prepped myself in leaving them before I changed my decision to stay home and go to UH.

The debt would go from about 12k to 30k if I did my math right. I was in my school's dual credit program which gave me almost a whole year head start on college. So if UT has an accelerated Master's program I could have my master's by the time most students have their bachelors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for all of this text but I am really in need of some advice. I think it'd be a better long run decision financially and even psychologically if I chose to transfer to UT, but I don't know if I am ready for this much change when I just started getting used to UH. I'd be leaving behind much and I'm not really sure exactly how much I am gaining. If any engineering graduates or just college graduates in general, hell anyone, could weigh in, I am all ears.

321,"Going to start by saying I am sorry if the formatting in this is bad, I am on mobile Reddit for the first time. 

My sister recently turned eighteen and has a two month old baby. She graduated last year, lives at home, and works. The baby's father is seventeen and in high school, but also has a job. I am twenty-two, living at home, and going to a college that's only a few blocks away. I also work, but I specifically work from home. Because I work from home and I get out of my classes around the time she goes to work, I've been babysitting for the last month for about five hours a day, five days a week. 

Almost every time I have gotten home to babysit for her, she is either watching television, full volume, or playing games on her phone while her baby cries. Every time this has happened, he has had a dirty diaper that he's clearly been sitting in for hours, and he's also very obviously not been fed in at least a few hours, eating up to seven ounces at a time once I finally feed him. 

The boyfriend is more attentive to the baby's needs, but not by a lot. They're both very impersonal towards the baby, they treat him like a chore they can put off doing rather than a human life they're responsible for. 

My parents are rarely home, but they've both talked to my sister and her boyfriend about this on multiple occasions. However, nothing has changed.

Yesterday, when I took over babysitting duties, the baby was crying. They told me he had been changed within the last hour. I checked his diaper, and it looked like he had not been changed all day. He also had a rash forming, and I learned from my mother that he hadn't had a bath in a over a week. I took care of him, then I messaged both my sister and her boyfriend and told them to tell me the truth about when the baby has been changed- I've been watching kids a lot longer than they've had one, there's no point in trying to lie to me. 

I gave the baby a bath, fed him, put him in clean clothes, then did his laundry, which my sister clearly hadn't done in a long time. 

Today, my sister and her boyfriend told me they no longer wanted me to watch their baby because they don't trust me and I called them bad parents. It's worth noting that I never called them bad parents, I called them out on lying to me and receipts can be provided. They told me that the boyfriend's parents would be babysitting from now on.

In a way, I'm kind of okay with this. They never had a consistent schedule for exactly when they wanted me to babysit and often asked me to babysit or cancelled me needing to babysit at the last minute, and it was affecting my job. Despite the fact I work from home, I still work with other people, who were starting to get irritated with the fact I had no consistent schedule.

However, the boyfriend's parents have a history of being as bad as he is. They're both unemployed, with no vehicle and they have a history of not paying their bills and getting their electricity/gas/etc shut off for sometimes weeks on end. They let my sister and her boyfriend get away with anything they want, and they take money from the boyfriend's paychecks to pay for food/rent/things like video games etc that aren't necessities.

My sister and her boyfriend, despite having jobs, don't pay for anything for the baby- my parents pay for it all- formula, diapers, a stroller, a car seat, you name it- and they won't do anything to jeopardize their relationship with their grandson.

I'm worried about my nephew. I love him so much. I want to protect him, but I don't know what to do in this situation. My boyfriend and I are planning on moving in together once it gets warmer and we've discussed filing for custody of my nephew if things get worse. However, we live in a VERY conservative state, and we aren't sure that would go over well for us as a queer couple. Nobody can talk any sense into my sister and her boyfriend.

Should I get social services involved in this? I've kept a written log of things my sister has done that are highly concerning, including physically attacking me. Should I wait to see if they learn at all as they get older? How can I protect my nephew when they don't want me around him?",11Dec2019,1

323,"The title pretty much says it all.

I guess a little background might help tho. So I’m 18 and a male if that means anything. My parents have been divorced since around my freshman year of high school (currently in my freshman year of college). I’m very much used to them being divorced. My dad lives in Texas and my mom lives in Nevada. 

They were divorced as my mom was cheating and my dad likely was too. 

But now, my dad won’t tell me that he’s currently seeing his business partner (who is married). I kind of understand why he won’t tell me, but I’m not mad that he’s seeing a married woman. It would be hypocritical of me to say that he’s doing something wrong or bad when everyone has done something shitty like having an affair. 

My mom on the other hand hasn’t really learned that cheating is wrong and recently dumped her boyfriend (that she was cheating on) and is I guess seeing a woman now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I don’t think that’s wrong, I’m very much and LGBTQ+ ally. But she’s actively hiding that from me.

I try to talk to my sister (in her 20’s) about it but she sort of dismisses my concerns as she says that everyone does stupid things but they’re my parents so i have to be supportive blah blah blah.

The one thing in my life I try to be with everyone is honest. I don’t just go around telling people my life story but if they ask, i’m an open book. I have told my parents pretty much everything about me and what goes on. They even know that I have a slight drug problem. I want them to know so that if the need arises, they can help.

This isn’t to say that my parents don’t love me if that’s how it’s coming across. Because they are the most loving parents I could ever hope for. I never went without anything. But i feel sort of betrayed that they can’t even tell their kid something that could affect not only them or myself, but the family as a whole.

After we did that we were at her house and on the couch watching a movie with her parents and I put my arm around her after she did the same thing and she slept laying on me until the end of the movie. After the movie hung out in the same position for a while with my arm around her. She also this time indicated that I sit next to her for the movie and put my arm back around her after the movie. (I'm gonna refer to the girl as Bella)

Honestly I feel like she would do a lot of this stuff with other guy friends. The next night is where I got really confused. I didn't plan on going over her house the next night. She called me probably around 7 asking if I started the homework, I didn't so she told me to, and that she wanted me to look at hers. She was with a girl friend of hers who I'm also friends with doing the homework (I'll call her Kelly). After we talked on the phone she called another friend of mine, a guy who she is also close with (I'll call him Mark) and I assume asked if he started it she said she was going to call him. Minutes later she calls me back and it's Kelly on the phone telling me to just come over Bella's. Bella was in the background, I don't know why not on the phone. Kelly told me I had to where pajamas and also asked if I could get smarties. These were actually things Bella wanted not Kelly, which I figured. So I put sweats on and stopped on my way over and grabbed smarties. I was sure that Mark was gonna go since I knew they called him but he didn't go though he was asked. Bella was very happy I brought smarties and hugged me unsurprisingly. Also posted a picture of me on her story with the smarties saying like ""my whole heart"" and basically exspressing love but again this isn't a very abnormal thing for her to do. The three of us worked on our homework and people were swiping up saying cute and stuff like that about me. Someone swiped up and said something but Bella immediately showed Kelly and her mom but wouldn't show me. I was annoyed by this. Bella and Kelly were whispering back and forth trying to decide if and how they should tell me. Kelly's phone was broken so they just passed Bella's back and forth to share messages with each other. They kept trying to give me hints so that I'd figure it out because Bella didn't wanna say it. Bella said at one point ""you'll know one day"". I was more confused then I've ever been. Bella then leaves the room to call Mark because she needed to ask him something regarding the situation. While she was out of the room Kelly asks me if I have feelings for Bella I lied and insisted no. Then Kelly drops this bomb saying Bella is starting to have feelings for me, the thing is I don't know if she knew that for a fact or was just assuming(emphasize starting). Kelly and Bella aren't very close but they were together all day and I don't doubt talked about me. Then Bella comes back, they whisper to one another quickly. I think it was fairly obvious to Kelly that I was lying. Bella tries to drop more hints that go over my head then just shows me the comment on her story. All it said was ""I think he has a crush on you"" I forget what she replied but it was something like ""I don't know about that"". So now I'm even more confused because why was that a big deal. It's not the first time someone has said something like that. I exspress my confusion so she starts texting me. Somehow I have no idea how but what she didn't want to say is that I looked hot. I don't understand how that connects. Apparently it had something to do with me wearing sweats and ""not even trying"". I asked why she didn't say that and she gave me two reasons. 1. She didn't want it to ruin our friendship and 2. It's weird. She also said she's just shy when it comes to stuff like that though I don't think she normally is. I texted Mark asking why Bella called he told me to ask her. I asked her still through text and she said to ask him if he knew if I had a crush on her. She said he said no. I've never told him I did but I do kind of make it obvious in the way I am with her. So he definitely told her that he thinks I do. When Bella walked back into the room after talking to him earlier she even said aloud to Kelly that Mark said ""it's obvious"" I just didn't know the context earlier. Another strange thing was that while texting each other she told me to unsave the chats. The final confusing thing was towards then end of the text conversation she obviously wanted the conversation to be over so I said ""love you bye"" she sayed ""love you more"" I then replied ""impossible"". And then she says ""I'm possible"" back and then verbally says do you get it, kind of like if it was a joke. I don't get it and that whole thing was over after that. After Kelly left I stayed to finish my work and Bella put her head on my shoulder again. She also like hugged my arm as I sat in a chair next to her finishing my homework. Then when done hugged goodbye and I left. I talked to Mark and he didn't really seem to know much about the situation. I've never been more confused.

Everything seems likes blur, almost like reality is a dream or a figment of my imagination, it sounds stupid but it just feels that way. I feel sad and mad on the inside constantly, I have mood swings like one minute I’ll be super happy and the next I’ll feel like absolute shit again. I don’t know what the cause is and I’m feeling so lost. I’ve been with my girl for almost 2 years and I’m worried I’m starting to be over it. I don’t know if I am though, some days we’ll have a great time together and I’ll feel great, but then a lot we have bad times and she yells and doesn’t understand me. She’s hurt because my mood lately has been fucking up our relationship, but the part that sucks is that she doesn’t even try to understand what I’m dealing with. Last year she was going through some shit and she yelled at me almost everyday, put me down and called me names but I was so patient and I stuck by her side through it all, and it sucks that she isn’t willing to do the same. I think I have a few sources of my recent depression, I’m overwhelmed by the fact that I’m graduating highschool in a couple months, I don’t have a backup plan my only plan is making it in skateing which is going ok, on the side I make music too, my soundcloud is “cycywannadie” but I don’t really look at that as a future, more just something I do on the side for fun. but other than that if it doesn’t work I don’t know what I’ll do. I’m failing every class and I skip school whenever I can. I’m fighting with my girl and I feel like none of my friends or family understands me. I’ve been doing unhealthy shit to cope with the pain, some on the smaller scale like smoking weed and cigarettes and on the more serious scale I’ve been popping oxy’s and xans.

We were very close, she was an absolutely wonderful mother and human being. I'm 29 and female, I was the one taking care of her and I'm the primary relative that will need to be present during the two day viewing/service. A good deal of people are coming from casual work colleagues to old friends from elementary school to distance cousins. I'm thankful they want to support me and show love for my mom.

Personally, I'm doing very well with the loss. My mother taught me how to be strong and joyful and I'm doing that well. Normally, I do not attend funerals unless the deceased or family would have needed me there. My mother felt the same but wanted a viewing for those who needed closure.

I'm dreading dealing with all of these people. I would be anxious to see most of these people on any day let alone in a room with my deceased mother. It's ridiculous because I'm doing so well with my mother's passing (I know she would be proud) but the thought of talking with all of these strangers about such an intimate thing is making me lose it.

What do I say to them? What am I even suppose to make conversation about? Can I just thank them for attending and their support and then ask how they are and talk about the weather? Any advice or help is seriously appreciated. Normally I would ask my mom what to do in this situation.",11Dec2019,1
341,"TL;DR Excessively fantasized about some random instagram girl and can't stop thinking about her, how do I stop this. 

I'm 20(M), still a virgin. I've always had lots of friends, of both genders, but never had much luck with dating, never even had a proper relationship. But none of that ever bothered me. Infact I was always perfectly happy and contented with my social life and where my career was heading .....until about a month ago. I just saw some random girl on one of my friend's social media feeds and for some reason I was attracted to her. I went through her posts for a while and then stopped, thinking that was the end of it, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. I kept fantasizing about how it would be if I knew this girl irl, kept adding some kind of scenario where I'd interact with her. It gradually grew to me making up parts of her personality in my head, then got really bad when I started giving her a fucking backstory. It got out of hand before I realised it, but I had built an entire imaginary world around this girl, thinking of my ""relationship""with her and all the quirky parts of her persona that made her that much more charming.

I dont understand what's wrong with me, this girl doesnt even know I exist. Even if she did, she's nothing like what I've dreamt her up to be and I still can't quit thinking about this imaginary ""perfect woman"" I've created. This entire time, not once have I fantasized about banging her, I just keep thinking of more and more conversations I'd have with this person, as if we were both in some Richard Linklater Film. I used to be a focused kid, I was actually dedicated to my academics but its been 2 weeks since I've been able to get any actual work done cause I'm too busy day dreaming about this woman, I just want it to stop so I can go back to normal.

350,"I worked for a great company right out of college (Top 10 in the industry) for a few years in the city I went to college in. Fast forward to 6 months ago I decided to leave to move across the country and pursue a new life and great job opportunity. Left all of my friends/family and an SO behind.

I felt that because my industry is out west and not back home I didn't have much upward mobility and I've always wanted to try living somewhere else. I've had my ups and downs since arriving here and have made a few friends on top of the ones I already knew before I moved here. Recently an existential dread / loneliness / missing home as set in that I can't shake. Former coworkers have reached out saying they miss me and I definitely feel this sense that I could be having a great life back home and maybe I didn't make the right decision.

Back home everything wasn't perfect either and I want to provide context for why I left. Living in your college town after college is weird because all of your friends move away and you have to start over.

352,"Hey r/Advice,

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my story, and I'm hoping you can weigh in on it. I'll apologize in advance if it comes across as vent-y; it's been a helluva long day.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting in 2017 I began working at a small tech company in my home town. The company outwardly appeared to be a well put-together managed service provider for small business/enterprise IT. Basically an outsourced IT department that smaller companies without massive, sprawling infrastructure budgets rely on to handle their IT needs. Everything from day-to-day tasks (""my printer isn't working"", ""Outlook is slow"" etc.) to comparatively massive projects involving datacenter work, network architecture, security deployments, you name it. We also have to be able to provide support for all the work we do and the systems we roll out, end to end. 

&amp;#x200B;

It can be overwhelming for sure, but I was fresh out of a mediocre run at University, lacking real experience beyond the odd IT contractor job, and needed to get my foot in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took the job, and initially I was hired on the premise of simply helping this MSP internally to roll out a new CRM system. As I began working through that and showing success, I was brought on to help deploy some shelf-ware the company had been sitting on. This, too was a success, and things seemed to be moving in a good direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

However I started to notice that the ""corporate culture"", if it could be called that, was a bit strange. Despite outward appearances, the company consisted of the two owners who were old friends, the odd contractor or two hired from an external agency, and now me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've got nothing against working for a small business and trying to build things up, but both the owners are in their later 40s and appear to be winding down. They've been running this ""company"" (meaning just the two of them) for the last seven years without any major growth. They have enough clients to get by, and some of them are pretty high-end, but it still left me a bit baffled that after seven years working as an MSP, they had two (now three) people, less than 30 clients, and no real level of planning or organization.

&amp;#x200B;

However, they were exceptionally nice and understanding when it came to giving me opportunities to gain experience and learn in the field, so I kept working harder. The money wasn't bad, I thought, and the experience would look great on any future resume. It was a good chance to learn from some older guys in the industry, too.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the projects kept coming, and coming and coming. No longer was my role relegated to helping them move shelf-ware, or improve CRM. Now I was handling project planning, architecting deployments for new clients, fielding first and second level technical calls, helping with sales and management, and generally being asked to put out a lot of fires. 

&amp;#x200B;

During a few tumultuous months I was left on my own to handle a number of high-profile catastrophes (massive mail migrations, server failures, office moves, datacenter colocations) with minimal help or guidance. I managed to pull through every time, despite the ever-increasing level of stress. This only seemed to galvanize the two owners into shoveling more and more onto my plate. They were thrilled with my performance and were increasingly including me in more owner-oriented conversations about the state of the business and where we wanted to go. 

It became increasingly clear that I was the only one with a modicum of ""enterprise-level"" skills, by virtue of my time at University and the fact that I'm a massive nerd who actually used to enjoy learning about these types of things on my spare time. The other owner/technician was mostly content doing the minimum and did not appear to want to learn newer things like next-gen firewalls, cloud deployments etc. Why would he? He was 40+. 

The other owner was a former programmer but had no clue in regard to IT, and basically fulfilled a sales and client relations role, as he's very personable. 

&amp;#x200B;

This meant that I ended up being responsible for first level support (along with the other tech/owner), second level support, advanced support for networks and servers, while also being the only one doing the billing and other administrative tasks that relied on the CRM I'd set up all those years ago since ""I knew it best"". I also was increasingly called upon to assist in sales and project planning as a ""sales engineer"". At this point, I feel like I'm doing everybody's job. My pay still hasn't gone up in three years, and I can't ask for a raise because I do the books and I know we can't afford it. 

They invited me to be a marginal partner in the company, but all it really gets me is a nice business card and more of an excuse to do more and more work. 

My ""boss"" has also mentioned on numerous occasions that if I quit, he'd close the doors on the business. Unfortunately the OTHER owner has no retirement plan and relies on this job to stay afloat. So if I up and walked, my boss would shut it down, leave his business partner without any income or support, and leave our clients out in the cold. And that's on me if I quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm out of my depth. I feel taken advantage of and being held hostage. I'm working so much that it's impacting my family life and I'm rife with stress most times. My wife and I try to get away when we can, but I can never really escape work; I'm asked to bring my laptop and be available all the time, to the point where I was actually working from San Diego on the day of my wedding, before the ceremony. My wife's family is in California (we're in Canada), and the trips there have been my only, tiny respite from the stress of this job. However as we're actually starting to get more busy these days, time away is harder to ask for and even harder to get. Invariably when I ask to take some time to myself, to recuperate and try to not burn out, I get browbeat into feeling guilty by the others. 

During the leadup to Christmas I have been trying to nail down a time for my wife and I to go see her family. It's usually dismissed as ""we'll talk about it later"" by my boss, but time was getting on and tickets were getting expensive, so I pushed the issue and managed to get a date agreed upon that I could be ""away"" for Christmas (while being ready to work remotely at a moments notice). We booked the tickets and this morning at work I let my boss know so we could mark it off on the calendar.  He blew up at me saying we'd not agreed to those dates 100% and that I was ""dictating to him when I would be leaving"". This got me a bit heated and in the argument I was quick to point out that if we had planned it well in advance like I'd been trying to do, we'd be prepared, and that because he didn't give me a confirmatory until 9 days before we'd have to leave, at CHRISTMAS TIME, he'd cost me an additional 2K on the tickets. 

Boss blew up, saying that at another company I'd be fired and I should be thankful he's not kicking me to the curb right now. 

  
Still heated, I told him if that was how it was going to be, and this coming on the heels of three other instances where he's blown up and gone on a tirade at my expense (first was because I was having an anxiety attack on my way to a job and was late, second was because I told him we didn't have time to run an environmental scan at a client location because I had to make another call), I told him I was putting in my notice.

&amp;#x200B;

After everybody cooled off and talked it out, I didn't end up quitting, but I'm stuck feeling like I'm trapped at this low paying job, where I do a majority of the work, get yelled at for wanting to take time for my mental health, feel like I can't disconnect or turn off, and feel responsible for my co-workers well-being if the bigger-boss decides to close the doors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The classic line from the big boss is that I don't know how good I've got it being ""self employed' like this, and that working at a company would be way worse. That he does a lot to make sure we're looked after and he deals with way more stress than us. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do about this. I feel like I can't quit because I'd screw over the guy without a retirement plan. I feel like I wouldn't be able to find a decent job given my performance at University and that I should stick with the guys who actually gave me a chance. But I'm exhausted. I haven't even had time to go see my doctor to try and address my anxiety and depression, and I can't catch a break. 

&amp;#x200B;

353,"I just graduated school this year and headed to the US for college. I am originally from Colombia, lived there pretty much my whole life, all my friends and family live there, except for my dad. I just finished my first semester and am gonna head back home for break. I came here, due to the fact that I wanted to study physics and I have a higher chance of being succesful here in the US.

Anyway, lately, I have been thinking about going back home to study. I dont like my life here. I am not depressed or anything, I am just not enjoying it here. I have gotten a few friends so far but nothing like back home. I find parties and people somewhat dull. It might just be me being homesick, but that is just how I feel. I talk to my friends from back home and they all seem to be having lots of fun, while I am here, feeling really lonely. I am thinking of heading back home permanently to finish my studies there; I really dont know what to do. I enjoy my classes and get good grades, but I feel like my life would be so much better back home. 

Also, my father lives here, and so he never got to see me much when I lived in Colombia. He leads a lonely life and he is really happy that I am here; I am afraid it would crush and disappoint him, as well as the rest of my family who expect great things from me.

354,"Hi all, one of my first Reddit posts here!

I (27F) have been trying for six months to land a job as a producer in the advertising/VFX industry but haven't been able to be succesfull. 
 
I would love to pick your brain on what I can do better.

My background: bachelor in design and arts (industrial &amp; graphic design, photography, video, prototyping), vast knowledge of Adobe Creative suite (Photoshop, illustrator, InDesign and basic Première), Microsoft Office 365 and Rhino 3D. Experience working as a photographer, graphic designer and 3 years currently working as project manager&amp;in-house creative. Eclectic passions for cinema, art, photography, videogames, storytelling.

My managerial skills are surely transferable to a producer job but I've been receiving rejections because indeed, I have no direct experience in the advertising or VFX field.

I've been asked to come in for interviews but no matter how good they are, eventually they always find someone with already some experience. It feels like solid commitment, passion, and fast learning aren't enough for someone to hire me.

I've been offered a job as a runner for a VFX production company but that would entail cutting my salary in half (not really doable considering the lifestyle I'm living right now) and a very slow career advancement curve inside the company.

Anybody that works in the field that could give me some guidance?",11Dec2019,1

358,"I have recently graduated from an a state university with a degree in agricultural economics. My issue is I have no passion for agriculture and was pushed into this degree because I did not know what I wanted to do even though I love the outdoors. I am currently looking for work in a management trainee role or a position relating to finance, however, I feel I should have just went for a conventional business degree due to how competitive these industries are. My plan as of right now is gain experience in a trainee role and either go back for an MBA or Masters in Finance (this depends on the type of experience I get). I am worried since this particular job market is so competitive, my agricultural economics degree will inhibit me from reaching my potential when put next to candidates with a conventional business undergrad (in regards to future financial position unrelated to agriculture). This being said, should I go back for a second bachelors degree in finance? or would the opportunity cost be too great?

Right now I'm currently a student at a CC (community college) working a part time job making just enough money to essentially get by but save nothing. This semester I have failed one class and dropped out of another out of pure what I'd like to call unmotivated frustration. 

I've been going to this CC for about 5 years obviously not as a full time student yet I'm still burnt out. I feel like I should take a break and have considered taking up a trade as potentially an electrician; as my major has changed at least 4 times. I have most of my general ed completed it's just major related courses I'm missing. 

Right now I work in a restaurant but would like to pick up skills that are more sought after. My ultimate goal is to get a BA or BS so my time there wasnt wasted but I feel like I wouldn't go back if I started an apprenticeship. (So I do intend on going back.)

My only problem is that I’m having trouble staying engaged overall in college. Even though I’m passing my classes I find myself procrastinating and lacking effort.

367,"My (16F) best friend (16F) of 8 years started talking to a new guy. At first I liked him, but know i’m starting to get concerned.

In the past, she has only ever dated/talked to guys who were attractive, since she is very pretty. This new guy is the only guy who she has talked to who has a real personality. He’s incredibly funny and nice which is why I liked him in the beginning. I don’t want to sound mean but my friend is way out of his league, but their personalities match so well.

Recently my friend convinced me to go my first party with him and his friends. My friend got super drunk and I stayed basically sober because this dude was all over her. She was clearly not in the right state of mind to consent to anything. I stuck by her side and made sure she wasn’t taken advantage of by him. He was very persistent which was a red flag.

Another red flag was the fact that out of the 3 girls he’s had sex with in the past, the only 2 we have talked to both said they felt pressured to have sex with him. They said they didn’t want to at first but he convinced them to. I don’t think that is right.

The other red flags were that they haven’t had sex yet but they have done sexual things. She shares pretty much everything with me and told me that he was trying to do sexual things to her as she was driving and another time while they were in a busy parking lot in the middle of the day. She told him that it wasn’t the time or place to be doing that, but he kept trying to. That is highly concerning since this dude has no concept of what is appropriate or knows when to stop.

I told her she needs to stop talking to him and quit hanging out with him because he’s on his way to becoming a rapist. She isn’t listening and continues to talk to him because he has a great personality. I have no idea how to convince her this guy isn’t worth the risk.",11Dec2019,1

372,"So I'm 18 years old and I'm in Upper Secondary School (kind of the same idea as high school in the USA), and I also live with my parents. I got a fast food job around 9 months ago and have been doing that part-time on top of school which have both been working out pretty nicely together. In my country we have pretty good welfare services too, and since I'm a student I can apply to student housing which is significantly cheaper than renting a regular apartment.

There are 5 people in my family including myself. I get along pretty well with my younger brother and sister, but my parents, which are married, just feel like an unnecessary source of negative energy(didn't know the right word for this). When I was younger, my parents seemed to love each other more (or maybe I was just young and didn't understand), but during the past few years I've noticed how my parents treat each other and it seems really bipolar between the two. Half the time they are happy with each other and treat each other normally but the other half is just this really passive aggressive arguing about each others problems and doesn't lead to anywhere. I don't want to get into it because it's none of my business, but I've mentioned to my mother before of how I don't enjoy my time at home. Our house is pretty open and you can hear what another person says pretty far through the walls, and it's not fun hearing them argue about the dumbest and most pointless shit known to man. 

My father has a hoarding problem and it's really annoying having to live around useless stuff that isn't yours, which only one person in the household has a problem with throwing away, all the time. Every time it's brought up, he takes it really personally and gets all defensive about it, or he just says he'll deal with it later, and nothing ever ends up happening. My father also seems like a complete asshole/weirdo sometimes which is why my sister and I don't like bringing friends over, or being around him in public because he causes a scene about some pointless shit more often than anyone should.

My mother is a good person, but shes constantly trying to shove her bullshit religion down my throat which I have no interest in. She also constantly breaths down my neck about school and work balance, where I spend my free time outside, who I hang out with, and just never seems to leave me alone when I'd like.

I make enough money from work to be able to pay for the student housing, and since I'm 18, I can legally move out without my parents being able to do anything about it. On top of that, if my income wasn't enough to pay for rent, food etc. I could get financial support from the government welfare system.

It's got to the point where I am taking shifts at work, studying in the library, or going out with friends to hang out just so I don't have to be at home, and usually if I am at home at the same time as my parents, I spend 99% of the time in my own room not with them.

We’re each other’s plus one to events, emotional support, first person we go to with big news. We’ve cried and laughed and told secrets and assured each other that we love one another, no matter what. Then there’s the flirting: constant.
All of this could still land us in friendly territory, but she says things that make me do a double-take.

Her: We should celebrate our anniversary!
Me: Absolutely! A friendiversary. Jamie and I do that, we-
Her: Ew, no, that sounds much too platonic.

Me: *talks about my fear of commitment (in the context of going on dates with someone else, mind you)*
Her: *talking fast* I know what you mean. I’ve been in circles this past week, thinking about how intense our friendship has gotten, it feels like more, but I realized I could never- *I can barely keep up with her words, and then she’s changed the subject*

Me: ...that’s when realized I had accidentally agreed to a polyamorous relationship. It took me two days but I finally called her and told her I can’t emotionally handle that. We haven’t talked since, and we don’t plan to for awhile. Seems like the healthiest option. :(
Her: :) That sucks.
Me: You don’t seem all that broken up about it.
Her: Shit, was it my face? Did my face do the thing? Let me try again-
Me: *thinking I’m very Daring and Edgy for saying this* You’re just jealous ;)
Her: *genuinely, as if this is obvious* Oh yeah totally *quickly changes subject*

Her: *alludes to having feelings for me*
Me: Is that what you were referring to when you talked about fear of commitment?
Her: Absolutely. But we don’t need to psychoanalyze me... *changes subject*

She told her brother to “turn off the fire” for like the 3rd time, and I exploded. It’s actual wood! It ain’t electric! You don’t turn it off, you put it out! Her brother said it’s an Arabic thing. Fair enough. Later I tease her about it, and she laughs and says...
Her: I will fuck you up
Me: *suggestively* Please do
Her: *eyes widen and she blushes fiercely. Fans herself facetiously* I don’t know what I’m feeling but it’s not ‘turned off’
*we both lose it, laughing*

!!!! what the h*ck I don’t believe I am mistaken in saying this is not Ordinary Casual Platonic behavior

The kissing isn’t the important part. It’s the elephant in the room that’s infuriating. And yet still, I’m reluctant to do a thing about it. For one, it would be utterly illogical.

List of reasons we can’t date:
- We’re both terrified of romantic intimacy
- We’re both perfectionists that like some semblance of control, and relationships offer uncontrolled variables
- She’s Muslim
- And follows a lot of the customs
- I’m a gal. Women dating women is not one of those customs.
- Her family might disown her
- She’s technically bisexual, but for the above reasons I don’t think she plans to do anything other than marry a man
- What if it ruined our friendship
- Worse, what if it worked out. That would be terrifying
- I don’t even know what I want out of this. All I know is that ignoring it is killing me

But here’s the real reason I don’t want to approach this: Vulnerability scares me. What if I let my guard down, and she puts hers up? I don’t want to risk seeming foolish and embarrassing myself. That thought is unbearably humiliating.

We’re spending all of New Years Eve together. I suggested throwing a party, and she was willing to do it if it’s what I wanted, but admitted earnestly that “you’re the only person I need.” I replied with “You sure know how to romance a girl!” Good Lord. Anyway, I could bring it up then.

I could go in for a kiss, and face all the awkwardness that would follow.
I could try to have a deep, open, honest conversation, which sounds much too mushy and full of risk.
I could make it a challenge. Say something along the lines of “what if you kissed me” or “what if I kissed you. Right now. What would you do” and/or call her a coward because she’d hate that. And hopefully through that, bring up the emotional stuff while still maintaining the upper hand and not seeming completely helpless?
Or I could play it safe and avoid this altogether.
There’s always the option of waiting (I do love a slow burn romance) but what if it dies down, or one of us finds someone else?

She talks about the value of Feeling. Of embracing feeling whether it’s good or bad, reveling in the intensity of an emotion. Yet we’re both shying away from this, albeit for good reason.

385,"I left my ex-girlfriend because I found her to be manipulative and deceitful (and she cheated on me). 
After our break up, the next day she reveals that she’s pregnant, and it’s mine. She tells me that I am either 100% in or 100% out. I was 19 at the time. 
I freaked out and I was meant to be flying interstate for my dream job. I said I didn’t want a child, I wasn’t ready for one, and neither is she, and I am not interested in being involved with her. 

So, we part ways and over the duration of her pregnancy she tries to manipulate me back into getting with her. 

Time skip to 7 months pregnant, the guilt gets to me and I feel horrible for abandoning my son to be. I reach out to her and attempt to make amends, and see if she’s interested in coparenting. She is. Cool. We talk regularly and make some verbal agreements about our expectations of what is to come. Sorted.

Faster forward another month, she’s 8 months pregnant,  and now she’s got a new boyfriend, cool, she then tells me that if I am gonna be involved in the child’s life, I need to understand that I’ll only be a secondary father figure and financial support. Nope. I tell her that I am not interested in this and we part ways again. 

Fast forward 6 months, my job starts to line up, i fly interstate to do my last interviews and testing and get approved. 

I fly back home and the police are at my door. They tell me that my sons been submitted to hospital with a bunch of injuries, 19 fractures, 4 broken bones. Over at least two weeks..The Department of child protection has stepped in and taken him off her.They ask me if I want any involvement with the child. I say yes. I’ve been working close with the DCP in order to see my son. We have to go to court, and I need a lawyer, this puts massive financial strain on me. Her family fabricates a bunch of lies about me, all with little to no justification or evidence. But these baseless accusations force the DCP and police to look into them. 

 They’ve accused me of being abusive, using drugs, being violent, having mental health issues, being an alcoholic and a bunch of other things about a page long. In addition to this, I can never do anything right with my son either, I don’t use the right brand formula, the right brand nappies, he’s got nappy rash so it’s my fault. He’s got conjunctivitis so that’s my fault too. 

I can no longer fly interstate to do my dream job now because I’ve got to stay with my son.

I am struggling emotionally with the legal battle, working to pay the lawyer, defending my self against the attacks on my character and the sudden change in lifestyle I’ve had, in addition to having the only job I’ve wanted ripped out from under me.

The right thing for me to do is to take my son in to protect him from me ex.

The thing that’s best for me ( mental health wise) is to let me ex’s parent take him.

I need some advice or some perspective. Please help.

TL;DR 
I leave ex, she’s pregnant afterwards
Ex/her new bf beat my son
I go for custody

So my last parent were murdered a year ago.  I received a good deal of money from them.  Literally went from wondering if I was gonna eat, to a decent amount of money.  Not rich at all but don't need to worry about money right now.  Invested the money in tech and it has grown at a high rate.  

I have been mostly spending the money on drugs, and don't know what else to do.

She complains that we never get stuff done in the morning. She's right. I can put up with all the other crap, but it would be devastating for her to leave me for my stupid habit/disorder/whatever. It's not like a fundamental clash of personality or disloyalty, it's sleeping in too much. How stupid is that!? Ugh. 

Anyway. Second problem, I'm a 13th-year senior in high school, probably to some extent because of this. I was never ever a straight-A student, and I ALWAYS had mediocre attendance and middling-to-abysmal grades. No scholarship for this guy. But I'll be damned if I don't graduate high school with a diploma. Seeing as the last trimester just ended, IN THEORY I'll have enough credits to pass this week. But guess who's overslept every day since Thursday or so. 

The third problem, my internship. My internship, mind you, is a pretty sweet deal. Twice a month to weekly, every Saturday at around 9 AM. Don't have to do much, 60 dollar weekly stipend. I didn't attend last week partially due to oversleeping. So last night I decided to nip it in the bud. 

Even if I didn't get any sleep the night before. I was gonna see my friends then too. So I set my alarm (my girlfriend has unplugged it twice and I really wish she'd quit it), but I set it wrong! So it woke me up at 5 AM instead. So whatever, I turn it off and go back to sleep. 7 AM rolls around, time for school. My dad tells me it's time to get up. So okay, I'll be up in a few minutes, even if I miss school I'll surely be ready by 3 for my friends. Shows what I know. I don't actually wake up until 9. PM. Girlfriend rightfully mad at me, family rightfully chewing me out. 

Even when I get to sleep at 9 PM I still sleep almost 12 hours. Sleep debt only goes so far, I do this all the time. I'm treading a thin line and have to improve so I can make appointments again instead of sleeping my life away. Now what Reddit?

In my 20's. Quit shitty job. No parents tho :(  I have been mostly doing drugs, and don't know what else to do.

I have become a useless fuck. Literally don't know what to do with myself. A stagnating, waste of space. Just fucking feel like a useless person. I used to be energized..worked my ass off every night wanting to ""hit it big"" bullshit that we dream of.  My dad died for this, I don't fucking deserve it.

397,"So I have to keep this pretty vague, as my partner frequents reddit quite alot. But I'm having a bit of an issue with my partner.  Who's extremely stubborn and me being a victim of extreme mental abuse and a nice bouquet of mental issues, cannot speak out about it. So my partner is almost completely oblivious to my feelings about this. 
We are fairly young, and extremely messy. It's embarrassing and I hate it. I hate it a lot. I work full time and my partner stays at home looking for work.  But it feels like they're doing nothing,  they look for jobs online, play games and cook dinnerand that's it. I'm exhausted when I get home and physically cannot bring myself to clean let alone stand or communicate with another person. Both of our parents are horders too, my partners mother being extremely bad. And mine only slightly bad.  My partner is depressed as well but I feel that they are just wallowing in their depression now.  Half of this is my fault, I never said anything because I was scared because of past treatment (not from my partner). 
I'm not going to leave them or give an ultimatum until I speak with them and give them the chance to prove themself.  But my question is how can I communicate with them without freaking out? Without letting my past experience get in the way?",11Dec2019,1

401,"Yeah. Idk what to do because I love my friends, they are lovely people, but I don’t really feel included all the time, and when I do hang out with them I want to leave. It’s not because I don’t like them, I just get exhausted after being with them for four hours. They aren’t super immature,I’m an introvert. 

They are wonderful people but we kinda don’t have many things in common, like we like some of the same music but they would never listen to half of my favourite bands, most of them don’t read the same sort of books I do, they never shut up about boys and well... I’m a lesbian and don’t care about relationships atm. They never are in any music things I do and aren’t really into running around the streets at night, hanging in stairwells or hiking or really anything adventurous.

Why don’t I make new friends? I hate talking to people I’m not close to and I go to an all girls private school, my grade is 13-14, you can imagine what they’re like. They’re either scared of the dark and annoying as hell or alcoholic drug addicted homophobic bitches.

404,"My partner and I have broken up before because he is constantly on his phone and leaves me on read or ignores my messages completely but is active online. I could give this a break but he is regularly on his phone chatting up his other friends, looking up fantasy sports, and being on Instagram when we are together. We will watch a show and he will miss the entire first half of the show because he is on his phone. I’ve told him I am going to go home because I didn’t come to hangout with someone just for them to not be there mentally. 

He’s a fun and great guy when he isn’t on his phone but I really want to live a life where I get to travel, see new places, and be engaged. He is really into video games and his phone which is nice at times but is something I frown upon and how modern society has ruined us. 

Should I maybe spend less time with my partner? Or withdraw attention from him? He only seems to care about me not responding if he is about to go to a basketball game and I haven’t wished him good luck or asked about him playing. Other than that he doesn’t care. 

We mainly chat on Instagram and he has his notifications turned off because he has a chat group of gay guys on Instagram who message each other stuff all the time. I said he could just mute their notifications so he isn’t missing notifications about messages I sent him. He hasn’t done anything about it yet. 

He doesn’t seem interested in my life as much as I am into his (I love him so I try to appreciate his interests but I feel dumb when he doesn’t reciprocate). I always compliment him and tell him how sexy he is when we aren’t fucking but he only tells me that kind of stuff when we are having sex....",11Dec2019,1
405,"At the end of 2015 I started a business in a trending industry that involved publishing books of illustrations. I really enjoy drawing these sorts of illustrations and I gained some traction, around 1,500 likes on FB. I published 3 books and had 2 almost finished and like 12 others started. The industry changed and the trend died (stopped growing) and I struggled to adapt. I was making money selling individual drawings at one point but the industry switched to packs of drawings and books only. I tried to rebrand and intended to redo my book covers and authors and/or republish them but by this time a lot of toxic behaviors from others in the industry had worn me down and burned me out a bit. In addition to that my own health took a toll and knocked me out of properly participating for roughly 2 years so my rebranding never really finished rebranding past my facebook page (and even there it's still incomplete). I have still got avid fans of my work and make posts of book progress and things, but was unable to publish in that time, though I did run some events. 

I've been struggling to do anything with it at all. It feels really overwhelming. I'm not making any money but there are people who are in the industry and that makes me feel like I should put more effort in and it will come. But I'm also wondering if I should just tie up loose ends and move onto something new also. My original plan was to release my pages as themed books, but many only have 9-15 pages and you need 30+ for a book. I could release them all as packs instead and finish my re-branding of the original books, that would be far less work and allow me to re-evaluate but I'm feeling like it's over but I don't want to leave with loose ends...and I have so many unfinished projects.

Before I got sick due to events out of my control (there was a fire that affected me) I wanted to make a game. I got really into designing it but the fire has taken all that work away and I have only a couple of snippits I posted online which make no sense. I've got other game ideas but I don't want to start working on a new business while an old one is in play and I don't think I could handle game dev as a hobby or two businesses at the same time due to my health. I could handle my current business as a hobby. But I feel guilty, and I don't think I could just switch without tying loose ends or even tying the ends and closing the chapter completely...at least for a while.

I've gone over this hundreds of times and every time I think I have the answer I go to act on it and go woah wait this is not going to work because I forgot about x/y/z! And it's driving me a bit crazy. I would love to hear from you all on what you think I should do.",11Dec2019,1

i think it started getting really bad last year round june when i tried to commit suicide. 

still haven’t really talked about that whole situation with any of my loved ones or friends (i really wanna but idk how to bring it up). but i do have a therapist i see once a month for an hour. she’s awesome 

well it’s been shitty. but it recently got worse in more ways than one

my dad got really sick, he might die, he’s not getting any better right now but my brother says that there’s a big chance he’ll bounce back cause he’s a strong and stubborn man. i hope hes right 

other than that, i moved into with my best guy friend “dean”. 

now, dean and i used to date in grade 11 and beginning of grade 12. we lost our virginities together. we got along super well but ended up agreeing that we would do so much better as friends. and we were right, we’re both the closest friends ever. 

that is until we moved in together in september 

i started getting fuckin weird vibes from him, i asked some mutual friends and even his close friends if there was anything wrong, and they said he’s fine and that nothing was up 

he started drinking a lot too. like.. a fucking.. lot. almost every day he’s be getting drunk. he missed class all the time. he just wasn’t doing great 

i was super worried for him and we had an intervention around halloween time. we got him to the health and wellness centre on campus and he talked to a psychiatrist or something.

i thought everything was fine. he stopped drinking 

until last week when i came home and he was fucking b l a s t e d. fucking shitfaced man

i got mad at him and we got into an argument, i got fed up and went to my room to call it a night and just sleep after a long day of tests labs and assignments 

look, i fucking love the guy but i don’t know man i don’t fucking know ok

i was in my room and i heard him pacing outside and suddenly he just barges into my room.

just a quick defence, i’m a small girl i’m 5’3 and kinda petite, he’s a big 6’3-4 guy and he works out aight? 

he hit me a couple of times and held me down and just fucked me, any time i would struggle he would hit me again 

so yeah. i uh don’t know what to do. 

i don’t want him to get into trouble but at the same time i’m absolutely livid 

it’s been a week since then, he’s tried to talk to me multiple times every day and he’s apologizing constantly. i haven’t spoken to him since except basic greetings

i honestly have too many problems i gotta deal with, i don’t have fuckin time to deal with this shit now 

honestly imm a little worried cause i feel kinda apathetic bout the whole thing

414,"Hi all,

I work in IT. A big part of my job is presenting solutions to prospective clients. Since I'm an engineer, I usually handle the technical parts of the presentation while my managers handle the rest of the part like the company info and all. 

Over the past few months, there have been some shuffling around this company and I've been assigned a few managers who are, to put it bluntly, straight up incompetent.

I'm not talking minor gaffes, which everyone does occasionally. I'm talking messing up documents, using the wrong talking points, literally lying to the client to sell something and just not having the basic sense of what's needed to be properly presentable to the client. The last meeting where these managers fumbled around on an online call searching for the right documents for 5 straight minutes was the one the made me crack. I have half a mind to complain to their managers but I don't want to come across as a tattletail. I just don't want these incompetent people messing up this company's reputation among our clients because my career depends on that too. What should I do?",11Dec2019,1

I didn't make any more friends after leaving thinking I've enough already. I can contact them through social media but I think it can never be the same because I was underground for years.

And im in a relationship rn. We've been together for 8 months now. This entire relationship ive had horrible trust issues and it's not even my partners fault. 

I dont want to lose him but sometimes my trust issues hurt me so badly that I feel like everybody cheats all the time and that he eventually will or currently is. Although, he’s never actually done anything even close to cheating.(I don’t think)

I have this trauma from my past relationships. They all cheated on me and so now I have some pretty extreme trust issues to the point where I hurt my own feelings sometimes thinking that I, for no reason at all, can’t trust that my partner won’t cheat on me.

Sometimes it gets to my head and I’ll even consider breaking up. Which I of course never want to do. I love him and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. If my pesky trust issues won’t get in the way of that.

Anyways, do you guys have any suggestions on how I could get rid of these persistent trust issues that I have?

419,"When I was new at work, I tried my best to be very nice to everyone, and I think I was overly nice. There was this one older man who might have confused that with being flirtatious. Looking back I think I touched my hair a lot when I talked to him, because i do that when I'm nervous. I honestly thought he was going to be like, one of my managers or something. He's not at all. He's in the same position as me, just old.

&amp;nbsp;

As days went on, I realized I was kind of annoyed by him. He works on a different floor than me so I barely see him. But anytime we do cross paths, he tries to have a whole conversation. Like, ""Hey, how was your night?"" I've never known anyone who ever asked how your *night* is.. Or he'll ask, ""Are you okay?"" Bitch wtf.. yes I'm okay. Why is he asking me that? I'd literally be on my way to the bathroom or something and he'd ask me if I'm okay. It makes me uncomfortable, idk how to explain it.

&amp;nbsp;

On top of that, he has mentioned a few too many times that he stays at a hotel (he lives too far to commute every day). I have told this to my husband and he assumes the guy is mentioning it to open the idea of me coming over to this hotel.. which, idk, I doubt.. but just the idea of that makes me want to throw up.

&amp;nbsp;

The other thing that set me off about him is that he comes over a lot to have very long conversations with the guy who sits in the cubicle *next* to me. I can't help but think he's doing that just to get me to hear him. And what really bothered me was that one day he had an extensive conversation with my cubicle neighbor about guns. He apparently loves guns (he's ex-military) and was going on about how Texas doesn't see mass shootings because everyone there owns a gun already and just shoots potential mass shooters before a mass shooting can commence... or something. I'm not going to get into my political views or say whether I agree or disagree with him, but I will say that it made me very uncomfortable when he talked about this. I'm a paranoid type.. I always think someone who's mentally ill can just walk into the office one day and commit a heinous act... and now that I now he likes guns, probably has one in his car... idk.. I'm conflicted. Maybe I should be nice to him just so he doesn't kill me.. eheh... sorry I now that's stupid and paranoid to say.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway. I am not attracted to this man AT ALL. I'm married, and even if I wasn't, he's the complete opposite of what I find attractive. This is all my fault for being so nice in the beginning. I'm still nice, but I've settled in here and don't need to have ice breakers with people anymore and just don't feel like having conversations at all with him anymore. Our work barely overlaps, so I'd virtually never need to talk to him about anything work related. When he says hi I still say hi back, but then I try to immediately distract myself by something else, like my phone, or I'll walk elsewhere. But doing that is stupid on my part because I'm just giving myself unneeded stress.

&amp;nbsp;

I wish there was a way for me to tell him, ""Hey, can you not talk to me anymore about anything that isn't work-related?""",11Dec2019,1
420,"We met and became friends because of anime. It was that kind of miraculous friendship where you can talk for hours and hours and never run out of topics. We sent page long messages to each other about all sorts of topics - life, favorite books, past memories, future worries.
That started when I was back in HS and when I went to uni, I started having less time. I sent back the long messages later and later, some of them never even got sent back. We still had daily contact and I tried to hang onto this friendship.
This month, I finally finished uni and I finally have freedom again. I wanted to pick up again, and have those amazing discussions, but in the meantime she never talks about anything anymore - except for the same one topic she's been talking about for the past year. She found a game (with its own huuuge lore) and it's the only thing she ever talks about. How it gives her life, how the storyline goes, how the characters interact, how she found some merchandise, etc.
I don't see the appeal, but I try to stay supportive and interested (with more or less success).
I know I fucked up when I let go of her in uni, but I'm hopeful because we still talk. Apparently she's been a bit down recently because she hates her work and sees no way out of it, but she also doesn't really talk it out much other than the occasional complaint.

I guess I just wish I knew how to reconnect with her, or find the other topics she is still interested in. I've never been this one-dimensional about anything in my life, I have no idea how it works. Am I not allowed to bring up any other topics? Or should I keep trying?",11Dec2019,1

422,"So I have decided to meet with my grandparents in January. I haven’t seen them since around 2008, when the relationship between my mum and my grandad broke down. There are a lot of internal conflicts in my family and I feel a lot of loyalty to my mum. That being said my grandad is in his late 90s now, times ticking and I would never forgive myself if he died and I never saw him. In addition my grandparents have never met my wife, and it’s the only family my wife has not met.

To make matters worse, my family split again a few years ago when my mum had a major falling out with my uncle. My uncle has always been closer to my grandad and my mum has always resented that relationship, not openly but you get a feel for these things. I think that resentment, along with the core arguments they had, led to the fallout that happened between them. I still see my uncle and my mum doesn’t appear bothered, but it’s certainly a salty subject we avoid in the family.

The core of my issue is I’m worried how I should approach the subject with my mum, or not at all. She just started treatment for a serious health condition which doesn’t help as the timing couldn’t be worse. But ultimately if I keep putting it off, I know I’ll never go and meet him.",11Dec2019,1
423,"Posting on behalf of my partner..
Location: Australia

Currently working in a sector that is quite hard to move around as it is not in huge demand so any roles advertised are snapped up quite quickly.

So basically an ex-colleague left the work environment due to managerial toxicity. Shortly after, her role was advertised as (as an example lets call it burger flipper). Interally there was also another role (lets call this seniour burger flipper) which everyone knew about. What our manager has done was advertise the role for the burger flipper, skip all other external applicants and hire one of her own friends for that role. Upon starting that role, on the first day the person was immediately advertised as a senior burger flipper. 

What makes everyone else angry is that there was no opportunity for any internal staff to interview for this, nor was there any acknowledgement from the managers manager (as they did it when they went to an interstate meeting - even the managers manager was shocked).

When asking our manager why the person was given the senior role despite being on boarded as a normal burger flipper they just said  ""i do what i want"".

This is one of many instances of nepotism and managerial abuse of powers to onboard multiple friends to the company.

some backstory. in fourth grade my teacher was horrificly bad. hed scream at me and my classmates and he accused me of lying when i read a word wrong. i wish i had more examples but i cant remember much, my therapist thinks it has to do wihh trauma. my dad said i was having constant panic attacks which i didnt really know about

final straw was when he picked me up and forced me into the bus for a field trip when i was scared. my dad picked me up and i didn’t go back, he pulled me out.

my mom homeschooled me for a few months and then decided drinking and complainign about how much she hated us was more important. im only just sort of getting it isnt totally my fault. my moms a severe alcoholic and a narc. she’s abusive and thankfully doesnt live with me anymore

But now i’m 14 with a 4th grade education and it looks bleak. I tried offing myself when i was 9 or 10 with scarves because i genuinely just wanted to die. i still kinda do but my mentality is ill do it eventually i dunno

i have no motivation. i can barely force myself to clean. i dont keep up with any hygiene but showering really. im so tired all the time. i have a therapist but it doesnt feel like it helps. im on medication but im not taking it right now. that got too tiring too i guess

my dad thinks i’m choosing to be like this, he acts like i want this, like i can just pick a pen up and work. ive TRIED. i did two pages before i broke out hysterically sobbing, i just couldnt. i couldnt do it. 

my therapist thinks a disorder could be possible, weve ruled out a couple things like aspergers and stuff, haven’t delved into it much at all though

i dont have any hope. i dont think i can start. school again. every time i try it feels like theres a physical just. square block in my brain stopping me from processing anything. nobody understands that analogy of it but its the only accurate kinda one i have

i dont know what to do. i wanna be clear this isnt a suicidal post or anything ik thats against the rules, im not actively suicidal. 

i want help. i dont know how to go about actually learning or whatever. im so scared ill never get a job or go to college. not to mention i have some pretty bad medical issues right now so i’m basically on bedrest, which has been taking a toll on me mentally already :(

439,"I’ll try to keep it short.

8 months ago I started a new job which i have some (but not much) experience. My work is basically common sense.  The co-worker in question (Lets call her Susan) has been around for years and years, almost two decades now but she is NOT Certified. We started off ‘OKAY’ at the beginning... I was the new fish in the pond and honestly I was lost and needed guidance as any new employee does, fast forward to the last 2 months, I know what I am now doing and need to do everyday without assistance. On the days I work with my OTHER co-workers there is absolutely no issues,anger or ill feeling. 
On the days I work with ‘Susan’ I feel physically sick before I even get to work and she greets everybody except me, throughout the day she will instruct me on every detail of every task I already know I need to do, she absolutely never has any manners and talks rudely to everybody. I cannot even get a Please or thank you for anything. It has now escalated into her hovering above me and picking out the smallest issue with the way I conduct my work and if it isn’t how she does it I have to stop and change the way I was doing the task (sometimes meaning starting over) 
This has now escalated into small subtle whispers under her breath, constant complaining about every small thing, blaming everybody for her mistakes and recently she threw down a basket into hot oil in front of me causing me to be burnt in the eye and on another occasion my arms &amp; chest - she did not apologise rather blame me for being in the way. We have had a verbal argument during work hours which caused me to leave work and be told by my boss that if it happens again I will be dismissed.  I’ve gotten to the point Of throwing in the the towel completely but I absolutely love every other aspect of my job, the money is great, the people (except Susan) are awesome and great to get along with, it’s also very close to my home. Susan is the only problem. 
Should I go ahead and put in a formal complaint? (tips on this would be great as I’ve never done it before) or would anybody have any other advice? A conversation with her is not an option and she is quite favoured by the bosses.",11Dec2019,1
441,"I'm a uni student living with my mum and sisters.

My sister is leeching off of my mother who is already mentally, physically and financially drained. My mother is getting on in years and should be at the stage where she is retiring and relaxing. Instead, she's stuck with a 30 yr old mentally/emotionally unstable daughter (whom she loves very much) that refuses to take responsibility for any aspect of her life and expects others to provide for her. 

My sister moved into what used to be my mother's room a few years ago, so now my mum sleeps in my little sister's room on the floor.  She (sister) stays in bed all day, scrolling through her phone and flirting with random men online. On the rare occasion that she does something to help around the house, she complains about being tired for days after and reminds us that she's already done work when we ask her to help out again. She hasn't had a job in a long time, and she constantly uses my things (that I buy with my own limited income) so they run out quicker and I'm forced to spend more, which makes budgeting and saving harder. She recently splurged at an expensive lingerie shop with my mum's money.

 I don't think my sister is an entirely horrible person, she can be extremely empathetic and I really care about her. I believe she has trouble adjusting to reality and has many undiagnosed mental/personality disorders. It seems she has no long-term goals or aspirations. 

My mum tries confronting her about her lifestyle many times, and all my sister does is either laugh it off or get irrationally angry and then retire to 'her' room again. She always manages to find a way to put the blame on other people/external circumstance. I have NEVER seen her admit her wrongs. Everytime she goes on one of her rampages I feel really tense and start to freeze up. My mum is obviously extremely stressed out and thinks about her a lot. I know it hurts her that her 30 year old daughter is dependent on others and hasn't accomplished enough to support herself. I really love my mum and don't want her to suffer like this. I feel useless for not being able to do anything to help.

How can I help my mum out in this situation? Appreciate any and all advice.",11Dec2019,1

443,"My friend, let's call them Alex, starts opening up to me about how they want to die. Not actively. Just, if today happens to be the day they die, then great. Alex then proceeded to talk about their detachment to everything: family, friends, school, the world in general. Alex doesn't feel loved, and they feel irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Alex hopes to have a short life. I asked Alex if they thought they could see themselves loving someone in the future, or loving a family of their own. Alex said they could see themselves being a good parent, but that future was so far and they didn't think they'd live that long. I was surprised when Alex confided all this in me, I asked if they wanted to change this feeling. Alex said, jokingly but not quite, it'd be easier to die than change.

This all really rattled me, but Alex said it's not something that's too deep to them--that how they feel is just a fact of life. I guess I'm just surprised. Alex has had stellar grades all their life. They're always admired by our peers, crushed on by other people. It sucks to see them in such a nonchalant attitude. Everything Alex has expressed to me so far sounds a lot like symptoms of depression, although I'm not sure if it's my place to tell them.

444,"Some possible hints I've gave my cousin, and how she's become kinda mad probably at some of them:

1.I've asked my cousin 2-3 times when she's going to upload another photo to Instagram (last time was July).

2.I've told my cousin's boyfriend that I miss my cousin several times, and when I do that he says she misses me too, but I honestly am sure that's complete bullshit.

3.Because my cousin's boyfriend had stopped responding to my messages (previously he answered almost every time), and I wanted to see if he was actually seeing the messages I sent to him, I sent him a picture of my hip which I had beat until it became red, and I did it because I was incredibly sad that I think my cousin hates me and wants me to die. When I told him why I did it, he told me to stop and that my cousin likes me and cares about me. Again, this is probably complete bullshit, and is actually the opposite.

4.I probably made my cousin irritated when I told her she's the best football player in the world (she plays football in a football team), because I wanted her to feel nice. 

5.Few months ago, when I was at my aunt's 50th anniversary party, I tried to impress my cousin by drinking beer even though I'm not allowed to, and it backfired because she became mad at me and took away the beer, probably just because she just wanted to feel good for herself that she stopped a crime, not because she wanted to care about her little cousin.

6.At the same party, me, my cousin and her boyfriend were going to go outside to take a walk with our dogs, but it was late at night so it was really cold and my cousin became mad at me for not putting on extra clothes, so I couldn't go with them until I put on a jacket. I had told her when I walked outside without a jacket that she wants me to get a cold, and that that was the reason why I did it.

7.I once got a picture of my cousin from my cousin's boyfriend, and I told him to tell her I think she looks good, then he told me she says I look good too. This was probably just a lie though to make me feel good. 

8.I once washed my cousin's plate, bowl and glass after she was done with her midnight snack, but she didn't thank me, which has to be because I’m awful and can't understand anything. I probably shouldn't have expected a thanks, as I'm just a stupid kid.

9.I got really nervous when I met them once, because I was playing guitar and my cousin asked me if I was practising trying to play a song, and well I just said uuuuh um for like five seconds, because I didn't want to say the wrong answer. 

This is why I have a crush on my cousin:

1.She called me cute once when I described what the letters in her name meant.

2.She offered me a ride to the store to buy candy.

3.She offered me her used Coke Zero one time, and although I didn't like it before when I had tried, I drank it because it was my cousin who offered me the drink, and just because I tasted my cousin's used Coke Zero I now drink it instead of regular Coke. That's good I guess? 

4.My cousin made me food once late at night.

5.My cousin let me choose the music we were going to listen to from her phone when we were in the car.

6.She has recommended me several good TV shows.

7.She accepts all my hugs, unlike my most of my friends.

8.She let me excercise with her for one day, even though I don't actually excercise most of the time.

9.She is always so sweet compared to girls in my class.

449,"I am currently doing a two year course which will allow me to go to university.
I feel very lonely in my current school as I’m the only ‘white’ person there and it plasters a lot of unnecessary stereotypes on me so I feel pressured to act a certain way. They call me the ‘white girl’ and just assume that I’m not trustworthy or responsible. If i leave, I’m afraid everyone is going to judge and realise that the “white girl” quit. I’m currently failing the two year program there and my grades are the lowest they have ever been. With those grades there is no way i will be able to enter a good uni.

In my old school, they offer the same course and its an international school so i will not be the only ‘white girl’ there so i will be free from expectations and stereotypes. I have old friends there which would make me feel more comfortable. However they can be quite judgemental at times and ever since I’ve told them, they’ve slipped in sly comments like: oh you should’ve known that you were going to fail there bla bla bla... another thing is that i will be joining their classes so i will be VERY behind in some new subjects that i will have to take. It is an extremely small community there (only 34 people). Only one other person will be joining in January, which is the same time i will enter if i decide to join. But one thing i do know is that i will be able to do very well in that school because they will grill you to achieve good grades. I have achieved very good grades there before as proof.

459,"I will preface this by saying that I posted the following almost verbatim in the wrong sub before reading the rules properly, so as it has been removed I will post it here as others have suggested.

EDIT: Okay, so from what you guys are saying, I am realizing it probably has more to do with noises in general than people speaking in their native tongues. This is probably an issue which needs to be addressed in itself. I have a deep respect for other cultures and their history. I would even go so far as to say I have a certain admiration for people who can speak other languages. So it's most likely a combination of noise sensitivity which may be a result of an un-diagnosed condition, and perhaps an over inflated ego which causes me to get upset with that which I can't know. Obviously if I am really that hell-bent on listening in on other people's conversations, I should take the time to learn their language myself. I would never ever impose on somebody that they speak English or any other language specifically, I realize how idiotic that is. The reason I posted this is because I have some knee-jerk reaction to get flustered and annoyed by it regardless of the logic, which I know is wrong. I posted this in the hope that somebody may have an insight as to why that may be.

So it's not all foreign languages and it rarely bothers me when people of other nationalities are talking among themselves in their native language. Because of this I think it may be the 'sound' of the language that bothers me as I am very sensitive to noise in general. However, there are a few circumstances where I find myself getting quite worked up; specifically when someone is talking on the phone in their language around me (I find it annoying when anybody talks on the phone in any language which is an issue in itself) or, when other people are participating in a conversation which I am also a part of and they switch to a language I do not understand so they can talk between themselves only. These are not the only situations in which I am sensitive to others' forms of communication; another notable trigger is when I am near an entire group of people speaking a foreign language. As I have spent a considerable amount of time in my life learning other languages, I am able to realize that the less I understand what somebody is saying, the more agitated I get. I am also South American and so know a bit of Spanish - less than I used to, but I can understand much of what is being said. For this reason especially I feel particularly hypocritical.

I feel wrong for getting upset about this as I realize it can be very difficult for someone to learn a new language, especially as an adult, and they are often better able to express themselves in their own language rather than one they picked up many years later. Despite this, whenever someone is talking in their native language it for some reason takes precedence regarding what I'm hearing, often regardless of the volume, and it sounds like a drowning wall of sound imposed on me to the point where I feel threatened.

Clearly I do not wish to feel this way and I don't know how to change the way I perceive sounds in general. A bit more info: I have always been very sensitive to noise, even things like heavy breathing, throat clearing, coughing, sneezing, etc. Especially when it is a repetitive and/or a loud noise. Additionally, whether you believe in 'energies' or not, I feel as though I quickly absorb the sentiment and attitude of whomever I am near which is something I've been working on trying to shield myself from especially as sometimes if somebody is being negative I will over-dramatize their negativity in my head and make an even bigger deal of it within myself than they are making it themselves. I know this does not directly relate to my original question but I feel like there is a connection there.

Why is it that I feel a sense of dread and annoyance when people are speaking their own languages under the conditions I have specified?",11Dec2019,1

I find it very annoying and don't want anything to do with him. But I'm not very strong mentally, I'm afraid I will just become friends with him again only for him to keep being mean to me, as in saying ''blyat is a fucking fat ass and will die of diabetes soon hahaha go fucking die'' the thing its, I have no idea if he is actually thinking (which is my guess) or if he is just kidding, which isn't funny at all. I always put on a dead face when he does it, as to show that I am not affected (which I'm good at) And he has said that he just wants to make me sad. still, have no idea if he means it or not.

468,"So let's start with a little backstory. So about 4 years ago we had a large, kinda popular group. Now some shit happened between two main people, let's call them Zee and Yumi. So now their are suddenly 2 sides and I now had to choose one. But I couldn't bring myself to do so, and decided to have ties with both of them which was a VERY big mistake as it resulted with me loosing my friendship with both of them. Now fast forward 4 years, that is now. We entered sophomore year and me and my bff, Clara got seperated into different sections. Now luckily none of these people are in my section, thought Clara got the same section as Zee and Yumi. Now they all became friends and formed a group. Clara asked me if i was all right with it, and i was totally fine. like I'm her bff not bf lol. So yeah, now i had to hang out with them, may it be parties or sometime having lunch and slowly we started to enjoy together, though not very often. We were genuinely having fun in each other's company or I thought so. Like Yumi had became very frank with me and we talked on snapchat on a daily basis. But now Clara told me today that Yumi was bad mouthing some really bad things about me to her that how I'm a fake person and leaves friends, how I'm a total drama queen and some other hurting shit. Yumi also asked Clara not to tell me any of this. Ofcourse being my best friend Clara shut her up and told me about it, but now it won't be same. I just can't hang around Yumi as easily and carefreely as before. Heck, I can't even hang around her anymore without feeling like chocking and just leaving. This made all of this toxic. I don't want to have any connection with her but Clara have strictly told me against it and ofcourse I have to follow it... And I understand why. I'm not supposed to know about this... I never take these kind of accusations or rumours get to me but coming from someone who you trusted, it's really difficult.

470,"TL:DR - My husbands attitude has been very negative lately and he's threatening to quit his job while also wanting to attend college full time. I'm afraid he's unhappy in the marriage/our life and is acting out negatively. I need advice on how to deal with this and how to support him 

I've been struggling for a while in my marriage and need some support and advice on how to handle this season in my life. I (32F) and my husband (39M) have been married going on 4 years, together for 5. We've had financial struggles throughout our relationship and finally filed for bankruptcy last fall. We were on the verge of divorce due to the financial strain. He was working at a car lot selling cars on commission only so basically making min wage and we have 3 kids to support, a mortgage, and 2 car payments. It was rough. I was the one balancing our checkbook and paying bills, buying groceries, facing the struggle daily and carrying the burden. I worked full time at a job I hated but had to work in order to pay bills and stay afloat. I made decent money but obviously not enough to carry the household so after a couple years of trying to make it work and support him in his sales career I had finally had enough and was on the verge of a mental breakdown. We got into trouble with credit cards and were drowning in debt. In comes the bankruptcy to wipe it all away and start fresh. Things got a lot better between us. He got a better paying job so that helped out a lot with the financial stress we were under. He now works for a delivery company, works M-F with option to work on Saturdays for extra pay and is home by 5pm or earlier daily. Awesome. May I mention this is his 3rd time working for this company. (He's quit for other jobs)  He is constantly griping about the job, the stops, the amount of packages, the customers. I am a very supportive wife, to a fault probably, but I'm getting tired of this person I don't know. He isn't who I married. When I met him he was upbeat and positive and had been divorced for about a year. He was always taking his 2 girls somewhere to do something fun. He has always worked hard and fixed things around the house, he takes care of the yard work, etc. He's a very good husband. Lately he's been angry, like resentful. He spouts off at the kids, he's always playing games on his phone, bad moods. He is at a point in life where he realizes we have no retirement set up for our future and he is on the verge of 40. I think it's like a mid life crisis or something but it's hard to deal with the change in personality. I am an em-path, suffer from depression and anxiety, and work full time from home, I also still carry the burden of paying bills, balancing the checkbook(he helps a little now), handling grocery and household shopping, you name it. I have a lot of demons to tend to personally and have to do it on my own. There is no support from him. It hurts so much. We talked about his demeanor a couple months ago and decided he should start therapy so he did and has a few appointments under his belt so he IS working on himself. My fear is that it's not enough. I feel like he isn't happy in the relationship but is a creature of habit so he just goes through the motions every day. He is affectionate, etc but it's just not the same. He's been cheated on in every relationship so he's very insecure and I do everything I can to reassure him but it's difficult when I don't want to be around him. His bad moods quickly turn into MY bad moods. He gets angry, so do I. He gets bitchy to the kids, so do I. I don't know what to do to help our situation and to turn things around. I don't know how to support him but also lead him. He is now on a journey to become a psychologist. This is amazing! All of us should have goals. BUT, he expected to jump right in full time and also work full time and get his degree in a couple years. Okay great, BUT you have a family now and need to put them and your marriage first. He qualified for a pell grant but of course it didn't fully cover costs and we can't afford another loan payment especially with him griping and threatening to quit his job. Like what is this?! I'm not good at communication but I try very hard. He won't ever come to me to talk. I always have to initiate it so I'm just tired of doing it all and being the MOM of him and the kids. He has a very high sex drive... his behavior has depleted mine. It's not attractive to me to whine about doing what adults have to do- you know, what it takes! Please guide me. Sorry this is all over the place. I've been crying since I got off the phone with him this morning. I just want him to wake up and be who he was OR tell me he's not happy and why so we can fix it or move on. The stress is getting to the kids who are talking to their grandma about how daddy is mad all the time and yells at them. It's crazy and not the life I want. Have any of you been through something similar? What did you to to turn things around? Any advice is much appreciated. If you'd read this far thank you so much.",11Dec2019,1

475,"Throwaway account- We are a group of friends: me, my boyfriend, and some other friends who I got to know through him, including the person I will talk about.

I had met this friend a 2-3 times when we were all hanging out together. She is a nice person but I never felt close to her or even call her an actual friend, more like an acquintance. Anyway, one night we happen to be alone and she revealed to me she is transgender. I had no problem with that whatsoever and we continued to spend the night hanging out together. During this time, she asked a few questions which gave me no other choice but to admit that my boyfriend and I had a few problems, and had broken up for a while. I didn't want to share this information initially, and when I did, I regretted it, but whatever. I offer her to spend the night at my house since it was late and she had no means to get back home. I slept on the couch, waking up thus to a horrible neck and back pain. In the morning, I cooked for us and we chatted a bit, before she got up and left. I felt like she tried to get more information out of my about my relationship troubles and I tried to change the subject as much as I could. While leaving, she thanked me for hosting her and to call her if I needed someone to talk to.

A few days later, I accidentally revealed to my boyfriend her secret. I guessed since he knew her better, he wouls have already known, howver he didn't. I felt a bit bad about telling him, but because I trusted him, I just let it go. I found out through my boyfriend a bit later that she had also shared my problems to the other people in the group who barely knew me and my boyfriend personally, and that they had made some rude comments about us.

I texted her and I told her I felt very betrayed about her sharing my secret. She said she felt the same way about me telling her secret to my boyfriend, although he never trashed talked her or told someone else.

My boyfriend and I got into an argument about me being hypocritical, that I got angry at her when I did the exact same thing. He told me what I did is not right, that I took her the right to come out on her own terms, that her gossiping behind my back is not as bad as me sharing something so crucial.

We spent a few days apart and then I found out, in the meanwhile, he had hung out with them doing xtc and going to a light show, having fun, while I was alone in my room crying. I felt so betrayed and sad about that. I felt it is not fair that hs fought with me and hung out with her while she had also hurt me a lot. I feel he didn't stand up for me like he did for her towards me.

I am so confused as to what to do. I apologized to her and she apologized to me, but I still feel angry and I don't want to hang out with them anymore. I am also annoyed at my boyfriend for the above reasons. I don't know what to do and I want some outside perspective.

Tldr: I accidentally outed my friend, while she also shared something my secret behind my back. My boyfriend got mad at me for being a hypocrite and argued with me like still hanging out with them. I am angry and sad.",11Dec2019,1
476,"My boyfriend has always been a 'fussy eater'. As a kid his diet consisted of about 3 different meals and since he's grown up it's improved but the majority of things we eat are chicken or pork with rice or pasta without many, if any, fruit and veg. It's not that he's stubborn and doesn't want to try new things, he just doesn't like a lot of food, particularly vegetables. He doesn't like a lot of tastes and textures. The items he will eat are potatoes (roasted or in the form of chips), carrots, broccoli, and onions (cooked white onion or raw red onion). Now he is trying to lose weight and although he's exercising more I'm very aware of the fact that any progress he makes, if any, will be much slower without a change in diet. I'm considering getting him to eat more vegetables by essentially hiding them in his food which I feel horrible about because it's very sneaky and I'm essentially lying, but I want to help him be healthy.

479,"Hi everyone, thanks for looking at this post. This will probably be a long rant. Some background knowledge about me that will hopefully explain some stuff about this post is that I am a 20 year old male that has never been in a relationship. I considered myself straight and I masturbated like daily for the past four years, too. I started becoming obsessed with my sexuality and stuff beginning of the past summer.

Alright so, pretty much right at the beginning of the summer, I was masturbating to muscular girls just as usual and stuff. Afterwards, I thought to myself: what if my girlfriend does not look like what I'm masturbating to, like the fitness girls. What if I'm not able to get an erection with my girlfriend. Now I'm not sure why, but this thought stuck with me and made me obsessive over my sexuality. I was confident that I was straight, but after this thought, I started question things more. I started wondering if I was gay or straight.

Over the summer, I spent the majority of the time trying to find the answer to my sexuality. I did quizzes, looked at other reddit posts, and looked at pictures to try and find an answer that I could satisfy my brain with. I discovered that trying to get that definitive answer is more difficult than I first thought. I used getting an erection as an indicator as to which sexuality I was. I looked at naked guys and girls, and whenever the guys had an erection, I did to. I didn't get an erection when I looked at just a vagina. When I looked at a guy casually I didn't get an erection, and when I looked at a muscular girl I did get an erection. After this, I told myself that I was straight and I suppressed every gay thought and such that I got. By the end of the summer, I told myself that I was straight but my mind still obsessed over whether or not I was straight or gay.

As time went on, the thought of ""what if I don't get an erection with my girlfriend"" still stressed me out every day. During the Autumn season, I became more accepting over my sexuality being bisexual or just simply gay. When I started accepting myself as gay, my mind became more at ease. I felt less stressed all the time and I stopped worrying so much about sexuality and stuff. However, this feeling of low stress didn't last too long. Recently, I started worrying about masturbation a lot. Previously, I masturbated like daily, and I don't know if this was excessive or not. All I masturbated to was pretty much muscular women. But lately, I started worrying when I should be masturbating and to what I should be masturbating to. I don't know if I should masturbate daily, or possibly if I should masturbate to muscular girls even though it brings back the worry of not being able to get an erection.

Right now, the biggest thing is not being able to get an erection when the time comes. Also, I don't really know my sexuality and I don't know how often I should masturbate or what should I masturbate to. Simply, I don't really know what to do next. I don't wanna be worrying all the time about my sexuality or what gets me an erection and what doesn't. But, I feel as since I have been worrying about it for the past months it has just stuck in my mind for a reason. Thanks for taking the time to read this and any advice would be helpful! Thanks!",11Dec2019,1
480,"tl;dr 

1. My older brother is highly sceptical of what my parents say 
2. Thinks he has some disease whenever the smallest symptom appear
3. Little respect for my parents
4. Very stubborn

My parents and I have been trying to change him for good but it has been difficult with him not listening to any advices my parents are giving. He is in university and should be out of his rebellious stage but he is getting worse and worse. If we do show him any online research of what he is doing is unhealthy for him, he will just wave it off and say that the research is not reliable even when many studies show the same thing. 

His sleeping habits are out of the charts as he sleeps at like 8 but wakes up at 3 just to sleep at 5 to finally wake up at 7. Plus, he will take a nap everyday after he comes back and when it is time to have dinner, he would be reluctant to do so. He says he has no appetite and would barely eat, one spoon is basically all he eats. When my parents remind him of how unhealthy it is, he says he doesn't care. However, whenever there is the smallest bit of something uncomfortable like having back pain which is probably caused by his bad sitting posture. He games a lot as well and will often go into long gaming sessions without taking a break. It is only when a few (3-4) doctors tell him there is nothing wrong, then will he stop talking about it but something new will always come up. 

How could I help him, I genuinely want him to be healthier as I know this is not going to go well for him. It also pains me for me to see him treat my parents without respect even though my parents have worked so hard to provide him his life. This is my first post so I am unsure of how to format one so please go easy on me. Once again, I am desperate  to help him. Please give me anything...",11Dec2019,1

But there's one problem. He constantly invites strangers to my house. He never lets me meet them, but it seems like every time I have errands to run, he always presses me about how long I'll be gone or I'll see someone's car in the driveway I've never met before when I return. I can constantly hear him sneaking around at night.

He's always going to bars. not even looking for another job or anything. He even texts me while he's gone, telling me that he'll be home soon and wanting me to hide for some reason.

This is crazy, I don't want these little tramps knowing where I live, they could come and take everything I own.

Tonight was the worst. I went out with my boyfriend. Long story short, it was supposed to be an all night thing. I was planning to spend the night there, so I sent the other kids away to my sister's, but we had a fight, so I went home.

I come home and he's in the kitchen, he starts berating me with questions, like ""why are you here? I thought you were spending the night out."".

She started crying and ran away, I just kept yelling. Then I started to yell at him. I kept telling him to look for a job and that ""this sh!t has got to f*cking stop.""

He just rolled his eyes at me and locked himself up in his room. He said to ""just let me live my life""

503,"Sorry if this is in the wrong place or anything. 

For my whole life I've been chubby, not grossly overweight or anything but definitely got a spare tire. For one year I lost it but it was using very unhealthy means and during that year I swore that if I got fat again I would just resort to those unhealthy means again. Well once I actually started eating again I gained back all the weight and recently have added another 10lbs. 

So my question is, how do I 1) control my impulses to eat just for the taste of it and 2) how do I stop hating myself to the point of nausea every time I do eat. I know I just need some fucking willpower but, for the life of me, I don't seem to have any and then when I do fail I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. I just hate myself so much but that hate doesn't seem like a deterrent to the overeating.",11Dec2019,1

507,"Hey, here's a quick little rant about the stage of my life right now, and hopefully you guys can share some thoughts on this one. English is not my first lang so apologies for any mistake. 


First off I'm a Male, 20 y old. 
I was always a happy kid, always on my computer playing videogames or going out to play football with my friends. My only problem in life was that I had an abusive father that would beat me up for the most stupid things really, but as a kid I kinda learned to side that off and they were the only times I would be sad af. Also helped that my dad worked abroad so my only bad bad times were when he was at home. Fast forward a bit into my first relationship that was really really bad, a lot of ""fights"", long distance, and it was never a fulfilling relationship, those were the times when I started feeling sad for no reason, or being sad for more than 2h at a time, those were the times where my father wasn't the only thing making me sad, and I started experiencing sadness in other ways. I learned a lot and I had a lot of hard times, but hard times that I always blamed on my bad relationship.

Now let's get to the present. 1 year and a half ago I ended my relationship and was into the ""single life"" again. I was pretty bad in life, especially in school, I had failed one year and watched all my friends go to college and it was not really good, but I was filled with hope for a new life, a new single life. My expectations were really high, I wanted to meet new girls, to go beyond my group of friends that I've met for like 10 years, and to meet new people. First 3 months were ok, although I did not meet any girl or got with any girl, I was hopefull and I was enjoying summer and stuff. Then when the winter came my life really sucked, my friends were busy with college, and I was just there, with no life, no girl, nothing. I developed some insomnia and anxiety plus a a depressive mood, although I wouldn't call it depression. I was that way until may 25 2019 basically, doubting myself, getting my expectations wrecked because I wasn't meeting girls, I wasn't having any luck with meeting new people and being in a new, happy life. May 25 is my birthday, and I went on a night out with one friend and another friend of his. That night boosted my confidence and hope to new levels. I'm tall, I have a semi-attractive face, and a really good body, but I just can't really see myself as attractive, and if I do, it's always temporary. The main reason behind that is that I have a huge forehead, like really big, I'm not balding but my hairline has always been really high, my sister's hairline is really high aswell. It's a ""the biggest in a room with 30 guys"" kind of big, probably a fivehead, and wide aswell. But then again the rest of my face is pretty, but especially when I'm really focusing on my forehead, I can't see myself as attractive. So that night made wonders for me because I was out with 2 friends that were good with women, and I ended up getting with 2 girls in that night, getting really drunk, and making out and that kind of shit. Next day I was full with confidence, FINALLY I'M HAVING LUCK, this is only the beginning of a great journey! And it was, for 1 or 2 weeks. I didn't have sex with those 2 girls, and when I tried to message one of them she ghosted me, but it wasn't a problem, literally 2 days after that I met a girl through a friend that said she was interested, and in a matter of 2 days we were having sex. Look at me... Slumping all those months and now I'm on the top! Dating, having sex, talking with girls, studying to my exams I'll do in 2 weeks and really confident about it, Yey. That all ended in 2 weeks. In my country we have 2 attempts on our exams. I did my first attempt and failed, and in the day I failed the girl I was seeing literally ghosted me. Didnt really care about it for 2 or 3 days, thinking she would come back or that I would meet another girl. Soon enough I was back in my depressive and hopeless mood. Started smoking weed, almost daily, to cope with that shit. Actually graduated on my 2nd attempt. Now through my summer holidays i was with another girl I met at a bar , had sex and stuff but it only lasted 2 days because we didn't really connect, and it was OK. My summer was really on and off, I was probably smoking weed everyday and getting rly drunk every other day on parties and stuff, always with that empty part of myself, that lack of confidence, and really struggling. Almost in the end of the summer, 1 week before college started, I was with another girl... This one... She was really fukin pretty, had the perfect body for me, and it was rly good, we were together for 3 days in a row, ended up having sex and then... She ghosted me, after 4 of 5 days. This time I didn't have 2 or 3 days of Bliss or hope after the ghost. This time literally the next day I was back at my worse. College started so I figured out my journey was only beginning, although literally every girl I was with ghosted me but college was starting so who cares? I'll have plenty of chances. Not really, I'm in an engeneering school, it's full of guys, there are literally 10 girls here, if not less. Now the days went on and I'm constantly going down a really bad path. Smoking weed almost everyday, dreading my life every day, i miss a lot of classes, i lock myself inside the bathroom for 1 or 2h at a time looking at my phone because I don't want to go out, my confidence and self esteem fluctuate a lot, one minute i may think I'm worth it and this is just a bad time and things will get better and I'm actually an attractive guy. The other minute I hate myself and I think that no girl will want to be with me, that those girls that were with me only were with me because of my body, or because they found me attractive at first but then were like ""nah"". Always blaming my huge forehead and bad hairline for it tho. Right now my mornings are the worst, I go to college only to ignore everyone and lock myself inside places because I don't want to be seen and I don't want to see anyone. I don't study, I'll probably fail a lot of classes, when I go home I spend my day watching videos on YouTube, then I go to the gym (the only thing I'm consistent in and the only good thing I do), then I go out at night to grab a drink or just chill with my group of friends and I always feel that voidx seeing that they all have girlfriends and that they study and have success in life and I'm just here struggling.

All it takes for me to see myself as awful and disgusting is a rejection. So even tho some girls tell me and my friends I'm attractive and stuff, I always think I'm not, I always think I'm discuting, and that they only find me attractive because they saw me at night in a bar, or fresh after a haircut, but I always think that's not the true me, and when they see the true me they will think I'm not that attractive.

Right now I don't have any motivation to study, I have social anxiety when it comes to girls, and I'm watching all my friends doing good in life and I'm just here struggling, a true Mr Struggle.

I talk with no girls apart from my best friend, no texts, nothing.

I think my biggest problems are my my mood swings and my unstable confidence, because confidence rules my day, if I'm feeling myself I'm happy and I go out with a smile, I talk to people, I'm a positive guy. But that doesn't happen very often and if it does its for a very short time.
I always end up feeling ugly and not attractive again and that makes me go into hide mode and not wanting to talk to anyone and think my life sucks and no one will me like me mode.
Call me superficial but if I'm not feeling myself/feeling attractive I can't function and be in a good mood.

Sorry for the long rant, hope we can all talk about this as I'm sure some of you have some of this problems aswell.",11Dec2019,1

515," so basically I go to school in a small classroom with 4 other people, he is one of them. he is also a cunt. Since I have no friends and the friends that I did have, I don't want anything to do with me. So naturally, since we have the same humor and like the same things, we became friends. But a year later now I realize that he is super mean, And very strange. I have no idea when he is being serious about stuff, lying, or telling the truth. I find it very annoying and don't want anything to do with him. But I'm not very strong mentally, I'm afraid I will just become friends with him again only for him to keep being mean to me, as in saying ''blyat is a fucking fat ass and will die of diabetes soon hahaha go fucking die'' the thing its, I have no idea if he is actually thinking (which is my guess) or if he is just kidding, which isn't funny at all. I always put on a dead face when he does it, as to show that I am not affected (which I'm good at) And he has said that he just wants to make me sad. still, have no idea if he means it or not. So I just want advice on how I can avoid him. And not forget that he was mean to me. I realize that what he is doing is extremely toxic and that any normal person would've just avoided him early on. Everyone in my school hates him because he is weird and has said some racist things out loud.",11Dec2019,1

it was doing the SAME job maybe even better 
then she started screaming at me some more and told me to get away and does it herself 
then she held the other broom yelling it my face acting like she was gonna wack it at me.. 
whenever shes angry she ALWAYS takes it out on me .. even if shes angry because a boyfriend she has she takes it out on me. then she got in the car and said take the bus and left..

521,"I didn’t want to put this in r/relationshipadvice because it’s really all me.

I (19F) have really bad body dysmorphia, and a history of being rejected and emotionally isolated by my peers. I go to therapy and have been going off and on most of my life, but I still have the anxiety depression 2-Hit combo that gets me from time to time.

I started dating my boyfriend (also 19) at the start of the school year, and I absolutely love him. He loves me, he’s silly with me, we buy each other gifts and cook dinner together.  We are really wonderful together, and he makes me so genuinely happy that for the first time in my life I couldn’t fathom wanting anyone else.

I met him through my good friend V (18F), and I found out pretty early on he had had a crush on her in high school. He said he was over it though, and I believed him. However I keep feeling off, and it’s probably all my anxiety and dysmorphia. He’s told me that he’s surprised he’s so attracted to me. He’s Mexican and never thought he would date a white woman, I’m very large chested and he told me he is normally attracted to women with smaller chests. Last night we were talking Christmas, and he brought up V again because I had gotten her a nice scarf and he had no idea what to get her. I said something bougie, and he said yeah. And casually mentioned that that was what had attracted him to her in the first place— her style and looks. V is all of the things I am not.

I feel so insecure. I had a nightmare last night of him cheating on me with her. They were just holding hands and laughing like I wasn’t there and my heart was broken. I’m going to talk to him about it this morning. Let him know how I’m feeling. But I know neither of them are interested in each other (V is bi but primarily dating women), but I’m just so anxious and insecure that I can’t seem to put it behind me. How can I work with myself to overcome these irrational fears of betrayal and abandonment?

TL;DR, I’m insecure in my relationship with my boyfriend and I need to work on trusting myself and him. How do I do this?",11Dec2019,1
522,"I'm at home most of the time, since I'm completing a research masters from home. I have a neighbour who is an alcoholic and who has bipolar disorder. He's had a rough year, and there have been ambulances round to help him with various breakdowns etc. He seems like the sort of person that would cause trouble, but so far he's not done anything too antisocial. I go out front to smoke, sometimes, and he decided to come over (heavily inebriated) and start complaining about his life, asking for advice, then started calling me his friend etc. I've stopped going out front so much, but apparently he came knocking to ask to speak to me a couple of weeks ago while I wasn't in. He caught me out front just, and wouldn't let me escape even when I said I needed to go in to help with something. In other words, he really tried to keep me there, talking about random stuff, and generally acting as if I'm his close friend. He answered to the phone and said ""I'm just speaking to my boy out front."" Okay.

How do I deal with this? He seems like a nice guy, mostly (unless it's an act), but I don't want to speak to him. At all. We have nothing in common, and he has so many issues, and I have no space in my life at the moment for dealing with someone else's problems like that. And I don't find our conversations interesting in the least, they're more of a chore. At the same time, I don't know what I can say to him to get him to stop thinking it's okay to try and contact me. He's always drunk, and with his mental issues I don't really know what he'd be capable of.

I might be moving away anyway within the next couple of months, but it's not certain.

If it was a normal person they'd have picked up on the fact that I didn't want to be friends, but this guy hasn't. Or, if he has, he doesn't care.

Any advice?",11Dec2019,1
523,"Hi Reddit,

I'm a freshman majoring in English and History at the top university in my country. It has beautiful campus, and the course itself interests me to a great degree, however, the procedure of study and learning is incredibly lonely. For one, I only have nine hours of contact with professors and teaching assistants a week, and the rest of the time one is expected to spend in the library reading the assigned texts and writing assignments. 

Whilst this is enjoyable as it offers a sense of independence, it makes it incredibly difficult to sustain relationships with people you meet. What adds to this feeling of loneliness, is the fact that my girlfriend is a freshman in a business degree, at much smaller university and she has made close connections with everyone on her course, due to the fact that there are less people on her course, people live on campus, and there is more opportunity for group work. I feel like a number and I have lost my independence in the relationship, and she is flourishing. Whilst our relationship is still very concrete and it is not suffering due to this, I am worried that due to the nature of my course, I am depending on her for social interaction more than I should. I have friends outside of my course from high school, however I obviously see them less due to the fact that they are not in the same university as me. I am beginning to feel a sensation of abject jealously towards my girlfriend which I hate. 

Despite the fact that the course appeals to me, the way in which it is constructed is making me feel like transferring would be the best choice for my own mental health. I have looked online and have asked others in my situation, and it seems like two subject major loneliness is a very real problem, as you spend such limited time with others, and it requires a real effort on your part to keep up with college life. What adds to this is the fact that my girlfriend will often discuss new friends and socialising and it makes me really, regrettably of course, annoyed that I am not having a similar experience. 

My questions essentially are, should I change course, stick it out, or maybe communicate with my girlfriend about my situation. I have no trouble making friends usually, however this course is really testing my patience regarding this. 

tldr: Lonely in college, girlfriend isn't, feeling like I have lost my independence, and I can't see the situation getting any better",11Dec2019,1

527,"So, I made a post recently about how a man in my boyfriend’s friend group was extremely creepy. When on a date with my friend, he kept rubbing her arms and at one point “accidentally” touched her boob after she said multiple times that she wasn’t okay with physical contact. He made comments to her about how he was just interested in her because she was my friend and he “wanted to find someone like me”. He would stare at me a lot, try to get close to me, and all in all he was an absolute creep to both her and I, although she has since cut him out of her life.

While I have deleted the original post, I wanted to update you all. I sat my boyfriend down and we had a firm talk where I explained that I would not be around him. Under any circumstance. I had been having a bad PTSD spike, so he originally assumed that it was due to my preexisting anxiety towards men due to me trying to tip toe around the matter before. We had a long talk where I was fully transparent, and within a few sentences he was absolutely livid at James (the friend) as well as with himself for not doing more. Him and I agreed that, once I know for a fact that my girl friend has James blocked so that he can’t harass her, him and I are going to have a talk with his best friend (originally he was best friends with both this guy and James) to explain what happened (as respectfully as possible for my girl friend) and work towards getting James out of the group. 

First, I want to thank everyone for the advice on the first post. (Sorry for deleting it, my boyfriend had been getting on Reddit more, and I wanted this conversation to be held in a more tactful way than “so I saw this on Reddit...” ) I don’t think I would have gotten the courage to actually confront it without being pushed here to do so. I will say that my girl friend is doing just fine and has hopped back from the creepy moment very well, which is a major success. I just refuse to be near someone as predatory and creepy as him anymore, and finally my boyfriend sees the whole picture and is as anti that as I am. I know that James is going to lie through his damn teeth when confronted, but hopefully no one buys it.

TLDR: Just an update on how things progressed with the creepy friend issue. There is a high chance that he will no longer be a part of the friend group. Huzzah!",11Dec2019,1

532,"So I know a gpa is a grade point average and to calculate it you add all your grade points and divide them by the number of pieces of data.

I just randomly thought 'I wonder what's my gpa'.

Thing is, my school uses an obscure grading system that I have no idea what it's called it how to put it into numbers.

Basically it is developing, proficient and achieved. Year 9s normally get 4D, 4P, or 4A, year 10s normally get 5D, 5P, or 5A, etc.

I can't find the name of the system or any other schools it's used in and I have no clue how to calculate a gpa with it.

538,"I'm a (married, pregnant, professionally employed) 30 year old woman. All my life I've had issues with food, and really dislike most foods and regular meals. How do I avoid passing my problems on to my child? I will probably cook him separate meals, but I cannot realistically expect to fully change my own habits or to hide them.

The back story of my food issues is such: I was raised by my Grandparents in 90's Russia. They were old, my grandfather had ulcers, and every meal consisted of something like unseasoned hot dogs, mashed potatoes or porridge. I was a picky eater to begin with and HATED their food. Eventually figured out that I could \*NOT\* eat their meals, and subsist on things like fruit, bread, milk-less cereal that I scavenged around the apartment. I did this for much of my childhood and maintained a similar diet once on my own at age 16+. There's an underlying idea that food is \*bad\*. It must be eaten covertly out of necessity, not enjoyment. I never grew very much and am really petite as an adult, probably because of poor nutrition.

As a result I eat mostly eat small portions throughout the day - fruit, berries, bread, yogurt, nuts and simple sandwiches. I dislike proper sit-down meals, most cooked foods and meat. The upside is that I have no taste for candy, junk food or pop either. I will sit down for dinner and eat cooked food if I'm at someone's house for dinner, but it does stress me out. 

I don't think that my own eating habits are likely to change. How do I avoid passing on this unhealthy attitude towards food to my child?",11Dec2019,1

545,"I posted about this months ago but I'll recap now cause i doubt anyone even remembers it if they saw my original post.

Basically I went out with this girl,it ended with her ditching me in a place I had no idea how to get home from.

Anyway she called me today asking to hang out. She called because she got kicked out of school so there wouldn't be any chance for us to see each other otherwise.

She told me she got kicked out cause a girl at our school was being rude to her so she got one of her mates involved (she didn't tell me anymore than that and I forgot to ask) anyway the reason I'm asking is cause she wasn't exactly nice to me last time we were on speaking terms; constantly talking about exes,making me do things that I made clear I couldn't  do as consistently as she required yet she persisted for me to do them every day, I'm not one for physical contact on the best of days but I did things that she told me to do like put my arm around her when we were walking (once again despite how weird it made me feel) only for her to literally push me of her when a ""fit girl walked past"" keep in mind all these girls were at least 10 years older than her. Oh yeah! And she was determined that she was gay even though she'd have me (a guy) doing couple stuff with her every day and had dated a guy no more than a month before me.

And I know it's gonna be exactly the same. But I'm stupid and still like her for whatever reason. My mum thinks I dodged a bullet with her and I did too but I have this thing about me where I literally can't say no to people 99% of the time and disappointing people makes me feel even worse. 

Last I spoke to her she'd been dealing with some serious self harm issues that I'd tried to help with buying her medkits to ease the pain of cleaning and wrapping them,being there to support her and generally trying to look after her.

I've agreed to meet her and am going forward with it but I just really need some advice on how to last throughout the evening with the same issues that plagued out relationship last time we spoke.",11Dec2019,1
546,"For one, is it normal to tell her friendS that I was raped? Not just a few close ones. Nearly everyone we both know.

I searched me name on my moms phone and found out she’s told everyone things I specifically asked her not to tell, intervened in my rape case
 (the police yelled at me because “they already told me so many times” and I STILL cry today because I can’t believe that the police not only yelled at me in my most sensitive time and that someone called pretending to be me)

My mom has narcissism. She’s told my brother and her closest friend (my godaunt) that I got raped and to give me a talk after I expressed to my mom that that in specific is NOT what I want. I told her it was too soon to talk (being that it had only been DAYS since I was raped). 

She invited her friends to dinner (what she told me)
In reality the dinner was so her friends could give me a speech about how it’s not my fault because she’s having -such- a hard time telling me 

I haven’t spoken to her friend in months (we used to be very close) because I have no clue what to say to her because I didn’t want to hear anything about me being raped from her at all,

My mom also called a friend of mine, asked what happened, and then repeated the story of me being raped only instead of me, it was my grandmother who was getting raped. 

Mind you, all when I wasn’t ready to talk about ANYTHING at all. 

The way that she’s telling her friends the story, she’s a caring mother who’s gonna “get that asshole/bastard” and just doesn’t know what to do (even though she got directly involved and took full control of MY case and decided what I’m going to do for me) 

She’s sent her friends to text me and ask her what’s going on because I won’t tell her (she’s also done that to my therapists my whole life)

She told my godaunt, my boss, her boyfriend, my brother, and a friend of hers 

She’s also told them ^ about things like my medical procedures, told them she thinks I’m pregnant (my brother picked on me and made me uncomfortable at home until I cried), made her boyfriend feel comfortable making fatjokes about me with her (even though she’s the fat one and years ago she was pretending to be protective and caring because I had an eating disorder and going over the top making sure no one called me fat)

So to make things hopefully easier to follow I'm 22yr old guy. I've worked a couple of different jobs. I've done construction for a year and a half, worked in a car dealership as a tech assistant and been a Baker for a couple of months. To say the least I'm not really a lazy worker. I mean where I am right now were forced to work minimum of 11 hour days and 6 days a week in order to keep the job. The pay is incredible but the hours really take a toll on my mental health. I have literally no life. 

But anyway with this job I've come to realize I have to opportunity to actually afford to go to college hopefully by about this same time next year. I do have a ""dream job"" but I'm not sure if it's really what I should spend all that tuition money and time on. I would love to help further advance Augmented and virtual reality. Once I've read a couple of articles about doctors using it for medical reasons I became so interested. I mean games are great and everything but to make applications or just advance it in order to hopefully help people like me who suffer from depression, some gender dysphoria and anxiety, it would give me a lot of purpose. 

See but heres the thing. Software development is definitely something I feel you need to be intelligent for. Personally I feel I'm no where near that smart to do anything like that. I've tried doing programming in high school and again about a year ago but my problem is I become discouraged when I dont understand something or come to a wall. See and the thing is that only really happens to me with programming. I'm not sure if it's because I have this mental wall that tells me I'm not good enough or something else. 

Other than that to be honest I'm not sure what I should do. I don't really have any other career choice ideas.

559,"Hello, I’m a 21 year old girl who’s been raised with my grandparents. Me and my boyfriend(23) have been together for about 4/5 months now. He’s on the spectrum, and usually functions normally.

The only time he doesn’t function normally is when he’s stressed, or being yelled at. He cries easily and breaks down. It’s hard to comfort him because I’m not always there.

His mom knows he has autism, (obviously.) she constantly yells at him for little things. (Like getting a cavity, etc.) he currently lives with her until he’s done with school, which he wants to save up money to buy a home for us.

I don’t make much of an income because I am a caregiver for my grandmother.  I am very empathetic for him because I suffer with the same problems, except I haven’t been diagnosed with autism. (I get severely depressed, anxious easily to the point of not functioning.)  he can’t move in with me because lack of room.

He’s currently paying rent to live in his mother’s apartment, and he’s paying around 80/a month. Which is nice, yes. But he constantly is at school, doing work, helping his grandparents etc. when he does see me, we both nap or play video games.

He’s had some hard times with his parents being divorced, and an abusive ex girl friend who used him for sex and money. Ever since then he’s been in therapy (it was basically PTSD.) He has spoken about his ex, his dad, etc. but he’s very very hesitant to speak about his mother.

I think he’s scared of confronting her— and she yells at him for not cleaning his room or playing video games when his day is off. He just wants to get out of there.

Most of them aren't really that big of a problem to begin with, but for some reason, she always makes it into a huge deal - almost relationship breaking. I endured and remained level-headed through it all but she perceives everything (even a grain of salt) relating to me as an issue. One example was when she would continuously bring my ex (who was mentally abusive) and compare my treatment with her and my ex (I was always with my current gf because i do not want her to feel that way but somehow it still did). Another one was she would continuously make a fuss over my whom i am friends with, and when those friends are girls, she would turn it into an issue and would continue to bring it up over and over again throughout my time with her. In order to further have fights with her, I decided to be distant with my girl friends and classmates. Aside from that, her treatment towards me is complete random, a good day can turn into a shithole just because she remembered something that piss her off. She sometimes shows her feelings for me, and somehow i'm sure that her feelings for me are deep and legitimate but her words and actions ( she would cut communication with me all of a sudden) hurts me alot of times. Despite, all of this I still stayed and somehow I got used to it. 

Months went by and her treatment towards  changed a bit (for the better), but recently, she's bringing up past mistakes and continues to make a fuss over my best friend (whom I became distant, because she's always making it a fuss everytime I interact with her).  A little while ago, it happened again but now she blocked me everywhere and the reason why was because I failed to reply to her (for like 20 mins) because I took a bath. I told her why i was not able to reply but to no avail. 

Some of my friends and relatives suggested that I should break up with her but  I do not know, I love her and I believe that she'll realize this and change.

565,"Hi, 

I have this confusing feeling as I am not sure how to analyze it. I grew up in a conservative region and then moved to America for my higher studies. 

On one hand, I have accomplished alot compare to my family and my original society. I studied abroad, I immigrated on my own. I had my job. I traveled alot. I am quiet independent and did things that can only girls from my country could dream about. 

On the other hand, I feel am behind my friends who I studied with when I was abroad. They have already started careers, getting well paid much more than me, travel too, in secure relationships less or more. 

I moved abroad for a reason that my friends abroad were born with. If I was born with that same privilege, I wouldnt need to immigrate and we were equal. 

I know I shouldnt be comparing myself to others, and if I ever, I should compare myself to someone , it should be to whom I were yesterday. Yet, whenever I feel proud of how far I have gone and how many obstacles I have moved forward from, I still feel I could have that “immigration” step if I were I born elsewhere, I would have just worked, made a career, and a found time for a beloved. 

I dont regret immigrating. Its an amazing thing and it made me get out from my comfort zone and opened my eyes even more things in this world. I had the courage, the challenge, the madness to leave everything behind and just start from scratch. Maybe I am over materializing things with that comparison. Maybe its never too late. 

Maybe I am mistaken.

And its not just that, he has two small children and he’s an amazing father which I love about him but whenever he’s with them or anybody in his family he tells me he cant text or talk and that we’ll talk later. Am I wrong for feeling rejected and upset like I’m being hidden or he doesn’t think I’m good enough. Or should I just relax because its really soon.",11Dec2019,1
575,"We just moved for my husband’s job and while I’m waiting to start my new job in January, I asked my parents if I could borrow some money to pay for a class I’m taking in the spring. My husband doesn’t make a lot and we just rebuilt our savings following the move, so I asked because I was afraid to disrupt our temporarily fragile finance system. I plan to pay them back as soon as I start my new job. They had no problem with it—or so I thought.


What my parents expected was for him to be in control of my upcoming class. They wanted him to ask for the money because he should be in charge of all major decisions for our household. They basically said our marriage is going to fail because we have separate career paths and he doesn’t oversee mine. 


So here’s my question: Is it okay that my husband and I respect each other’s career and education paths and don’t attempt to meddle in them? We do talk about everything together, but he lets me make my own choices and I let him make his. Are we doomed because of this?",11Dec2019,1

I really like him and he knows I do, we speak everyday, message good morning and goodnight.. the occasional kissy face, heart or ""x"" will come up so I think of it as a romantic friend.

we get along so well, we met up a couple weeks ago when we were drinking and ended up kissing each other, I was his first kiss in years since his actual first kiss. -were both virgins if that helps you answer my question-

Today, I was talking to my friend (bestfriend of almost 10 years) and she said, before he and I met up a couple weeks ago, her brother in law whom she is close to, saw the guy I'm talking to at a party (night we met up) , and he was ""getting with other girls"" (which I don't believe, the party was his cousins and he's just really good friends with her friends) so I think I trust him in that way.. but he also said that they had a conversation asking the guy I'm talking to if he was talking to anyone and if it was serious, but apparently he had said no he's not and acted confused..

My question is, am I reading our ""talking situation"" the wrong way? or am I just overreacting?

582,"I work in a law office in Minnesota. My boss has a short temper, and three weeks ago I slid my chair into the wall behind me and the framed picture hanging there fell. The glass shattered. I threw away the frame and picture and all, since I saw on the back that it was from Hobby Lobby, and I know that it isn't worth more than $20 at most. I also didn't think that anyone would notice since I have a bunch of other pictures in my office. The thing that broke was not fancy, it was not priceless. It was not precious. My boss just now noticed it was gone and questioned me about it, lecturing and yelling at me about how I should have told him that I broke it when I did and I told him that I didn't think that it mattered. He got pissed off and told me that I'll have to pay for it. I said I would gladly pay him back for it. 

Here's the kicker: my boss says he'll make an assessment. He comes in to my office about a minute later (I don't think that he made any kind of assessment) and says he is going to charge me $100 for the broken framed picture. I asked if he had any proof that it was worth $100 and he said ""It's my property, I can charge whatever I want for it, this is a capitalistic society"". I knew this wasn't going anywhere and I said ""ok $100 then, that's a days work for me"" (I make $16 an hour, times 8 hours is actually 128 but I'm rounding down). Should I do anything ? I know I should have gone to him about it in the first place but I honestly didn't think anyone would notice, and he didn't ....for three weeks.  I think if he decides to charge me more for it I'll tell him he has to take me to small claims court for it. I hate the way he runs his office and I don't like working here, so I am kind of expecting to be fired in the first place. He has a high turnaround of people in his office, though it's just him, me, and the legal assistant.

585,"So Christmas is coming up, and usually we'll end up going to meet up with my mum's side of the family around then. I (21 years) get a little nervous about it, but normally the event ends up being okay. I get on fine with them when I see them, but I wouldn't say I feel super close to them either (except for one cousin who I speak with a bit more). Bigger events such as parties at a venue have also felt like a chore to me more recently, due to the fact that they always end up being stressful to prepare for, so I don't feel enthusiastic about them. I also usually only feel comfortable going with my mum there, as it feels weird to go see them without her there.

Earlier this year, my dad and I fell out with my mum (due to missing another event). Things haven't improved, and this coupled with past events have caused me and my dad to pull out of wanting to go and see them this year.

The problem is I know that this is going to cause a bit of friction between us and the extended family. I do feel guilty about it, because they really haven't done anything wrong but I've felt miserable for the past few months and I don't think my mood will truly improve on the day, and we decided not to celebrate Christmas at home anyway. I also kind of had a talk with a cousin and they did bring up that it might have been rude for me to not go to the event that I missed, and some members will be visiting from out of the country (I have seen them in the summer).  This is why I'm worried and feeling guilty about not going.

I want to ask how you've dealt with skipping these events when there isn't exactly a reason directly related to them not to see them? I don't feel comfortable disclosing all of the reasons to every family member, I just want to try and come up with a decent excuse if asked and I don't think a bad mood will cut it. I don't want to damage the relationship, but I don't think I'm likely to change my mind about not going either.",11Dec2019,1

No idea what her situation is but I'm assuming it's something not good based on the fact that she said it was unexpected and she had not planned on going home as soon as yesterday.

601,"Sorry if this seems too ranty or sometimes not making sense I'm just gonna post this however it comes out because if I dont I doubt I'll ever try again.

I(17M) am not sure if I should go talk to the school counselor or something. I just feel constantly stressed and have 0 Motivation to do anything really. I used to love most of my classes and was just a B and C student but now I just feel like it doesn't really matter that much. I used to usually have a few late assignments, but now I just haven't been able to bring myself to even work on anything outside and sometimes even in class. It sucks cause I've put myself in a loop of being stressed from the amount of work I have leading to me not doing any of it and then hating myself for not getting anything done and being lazy. Even in my favorite class, english, I had to write an argumentative essay, and I really liked my thesis, but there was just this constant feeling of ""its gonna be shit, why even finish it?"" So I never did, and now I have a D in the class.

On top of this, I feel like I'm just constantly annoying my friends. All I ever seem to do anymore is complain about wishing I didn't wake up in the morning so I wouldn't have to deal with the stress of school and family. I dont want to talk to my friends about it, because they all have their own issues, and I dont want to worry them. I just feel like I would sound whiny and entitled to their time, because from an outwards view my life seems great. Both of my parents are together, we are good financially, and I'm in the best school in my state. But there's just something that feels off and I constantly am either sad, stressed, or just numb. I used to think about just killing myself about 3 years ago, but I stopped thinking like that for a while, but for the past few nights I've thought about it again. I know I never would becaue I wouldnt want to put my friends and family through that, but just the fact that those thoughts are coming back terrifies me.

Another big thing that stresses me out is the fact that I have to get a job soon. I know I have to and I should've found one already because my parents will kick me out of the house after i graduate, but I just dont know if i can handle a job right now and I dont know how to tell my parents. My friends all tell me that having a job isnt that bad and its just easy money, but i dont know if I mentally can do it. I don't have the excuse of not having time, cause I'm not in any sports or activities, I just dont feel like I can go to school and have to constantly be around people who probably think I'm annoying, and then have to go do it for even longer. The issue is I'll really need money soon for moving out, but even after that I dont know if I would be smart enough or motivated enough to go to college.

my dad died 8 years ago and i'm a 23 yo female, i have provided from my family (mother and two sisters, they are all unemployed) for the last 3 years. 

i have a very good paying job but because of the expenses, rent, my mother previous debts and my sisters school's fees it barely covers everything.

so i came up with a good small business idea, that will truly help us get back on our feet again, and even live comfortably. but the problem is i don't have the capital for it, so i applied for a loan and the lady who is responsible asked my about my job and stuff, i work as a marketer btw, so when i told her that she told me her brother needs someone to market his co-working space and i said sure have him call me and told her my commission.

the next day when i went to continue with the paper work she told me my commission are too expensive for her brother (they weren't lol, he literally opened a new co-working space which most cause hundred thousands of dollars) so i told her have him call me and i will give him  a friends and family discount.

here brother called me like 10 minutes later, and told me lets meet, i apologized booked a meeting with him for the next day, he called me all day till i answered because i was busy! to confirm our meeting, i confirmed it and met him two hours later.

he told me a little about his place and told me what he needed from me, i will list them blew just to give you a hint of what he expected from me:

\- marketing plan for the place

\- social media marketing plan

\- designs for flyers- business cards- gift cards - banners - signs - roll ups

\- distribute the flyers with him in front of colleges in area 

\- logo

and he didn't talk about money at all. i brushed it of as it's the first meeting and we will talk about after i provide him with a plan of what we are going to do.

i sent the plan two days later because it was a weekend, and he was screaming all weekend, (his opening was a week later)

he kept saying that he will tell his sister and stuff, and when i went to the bank after the weekend to finish up the papers, his sister asked me what sup and why didn't you answer him, i told her it was the weekend and i already sent him the plan.

after i gave hi the plan he expected e to start the execution right away, still no mention of money at all, and he was pretty rude and demanding too, i texted his sister and asked her about her brother budget and what type of discount does he need, i don't want him to think i'm not professional for not discussing the commission. she texted me literally this:

(he knows that you are doing this as a favor for me don't worry he won't think you're not professional, he just want to have a good quality with no payment at all).

i was physically ill after this message and went to sleep for like 12 hours. at this point my loan was submitted to the management for approval. but she is the one responsible for the loan and i'm afraid if i refused to provide the service for her brother she will mess up my loan, and i don't want to provide the service because even the thought of it made me feel weak, small and afraid of everyone. 

what would you guys do? play it save and work for them for free till i get the loan in 4 days, or should i stand up for myself and refuse and risk losing the loan, and can i do anything if she messed up y loan?

I met a guy on a dating site (Hinge). He’s such a great person and I cherish that, honestly, but I don’t think I want to be involved in a romantic relationship. We’re meeting a second time this afternoon and I’ve decided what to say and how, so that isn’t my issue.

My issue is that I’m anxious. I don’t know how the encounter will go and I find that scary. I have diagnosed issues with anxiety too, if that matters. This week is also finals week at my university; I plan to study hard today and tomorrow but I know my anxiety will interfere with that.

I don’t want to put off talking to him because I don’t want to lead him on or act fake when I know something he doesn’t. I dread leaving my apartment too but that’s not related to him and is strictly a “me” problem.

So about our fight, we've been fighting about how we never had a 2 day vacation, or any other fun trips and experiences because her parents are so streak with regards to this. So my gf is a working student, she stopped school for a year now and shes been working her ass off to the point the she's tired everyday. Her family is not wealthy. they have a big debt. and my gf is trying to ""help"" them. I understood their situation. but as time flew, i grew impatient and said how she had little time for me. i know in this part i sound like the asshole but hear me out. She is always opening up to me and complaining how she is so tired of life. How she doesnt want to pay their family's rent, their bills, and save up for her school. So i wanted to make her understand that she cant do that and carry all the responsibilities herself. She needs to give herself at least one vacation. its fine if its not including me. but at least she needs to get some rest. i asked her what if she just stopped ""helping"" with the bills for one month and actually enjoy herself. before you react, her parents said the they ""can"" pay their own bills in time and she ""doesnt"" have to help them pay bills. the fucked up thing with asian parents is how they treat us like its their time. fuck they always talk about how in their time its ""not like this"" or ""we dont do this in our time"" that kind of shit. hear me out. her family always eat in buffets for gods sakes. and they cant save for their bills. They earn a lot for a grab driver (like uber). 

disclaimer you can ask me questions if i didnt get my story straight. theres a lot more but i cant think clearly cause it just happened and i fucking hate myself for it. She says i made her feel like an idiot who doesnt know shit but take note all i wanted for her was to let her know her worth.

am i the asshole?

if so, how can i be not the asshole?

should i break up with her?

617,"I am stressed. 


I am a custodian that works in a NJ school system. I have been working here for 4 years. 9 years maintenance/custodian experience in total.

The head custodian has always been biased toward me. There has been no reason why, he just is. I have proof of this. 

New guy joined in December of last year. They fibbed his boiler logs so he can get his black seal license as quickly as possible. And the head custodian openly favorites him. (Black deal is required to work a job with a LP boiler)

Head custodian is retiring as of February and four of us interviewed for the job, including the new guy. 

Myself and a 19 year veteran were bypassed immediately, while a 9 year veteran (the right guy for the job) and the new guy are being considered. 

The new guy has NO experience, has an extremely cocky attitude, constantly tells people how great he is and that no one is right for the job except him, doesn’t not take direction and does not help unless it benefits him. As of yesterday he thinks he already got the job and has taken steps to try and control us. He is extremely hard to work with and will not listen. He has no problem putting down coworkers for their work, comparing himself to them. 

Right now there is no option to transfer. I really like it here and I have voiced my concerns with the principal, but he doesn’t have any say and that the facilities manager who has been bias towards people in the past and guilty of nepotism and the business administrator who has literally said “I want more for less” has the final decision. The principal has made it known that he doesn’t want to lose someone like me, even to a transfer. 

My question for advice is how can I adapt to this? If this person gets the job, I feel I’m going to have a giant target on my back because he is already a problem without any authority. I have been searching for a new job, but getting into a school system is basically “who you know” or “right place, right time”. I’m trying really hard to bite my tongue, but I’m really concerned that I’m going to get really angry one day and walk out and I cannot do that.  I really like this job, but I’m not sure if I can deal with this guy taking over. I don’t know what to do or how to handle it. Do I just keep my head down and take it? Do I voice my opinion? Do I just deal with it and try to find something better?

619,"I don’t know why, but every time i’m in a relationship, i always feel so anxious. I can be with an amazing girl and she treats me good, but in the end, i’m always engulfed with anxiety and i hate it. It’s not like they’re the only thing i’m placing my happiness on, I have a lot of hobbies and friends that I talk to everyday and we play games together everyday, but even when i’m with them or doing my hobbies, i still feel anxious and constantly check my phone to see if they’ve hit me back yet. My first real girlfriend that I had when i was in high school cheated on me and falsely accused me of rape, and i think that’s why i’m always anxious, I guess i’m just scared of being hurt again.

It’s because the anxiety drives me crazy and i feel miserable all the fucking time. i think i’m just going to live my life and vibe with my bro’s and i’m fine with that, because then i’ll be happier than i am when i’m in a relationship.

620,"TL;DR at bottom

Realistically I know the answer is No but I need someone to help me rationalise here.

Basically I had a girlfriend for 2 years during secondary (high) school. During that time we both applied for the same course at some of the same universities, not as some sort of weird ploy to stay together but just similar interests leading us to the same places. We broke up just after applications were sent out and long story short we now have places on the same course at the same university. 

When I realised this I didn’t think it’d be an issue because Im doing a gap year and she isn’t, there’d be a year between us. I also thought I’d be over her by the time I got there so any interactions would be fine, turns out the opposite has happened and now I’m doubting whether I should even go to that uni or if I should reapply somewhere else.

Deadlines for applications are a month away with no open days between now and then so it would be a fully impulsive decision to go to a university I know little about. I’d also have to gamble away my place at the current university, which is a pretty solid one, hoping I get accepted into the alternative.

It sounds pretty cut and dry from the outside but I cannot stress how much I dread being at the same uni as her. Not her fault it’s more my inability to get over her that’s been infinitely perpetuated by my loneliness so far this gap year (with most of my mates moving to different parts of the country while I’m still at home). Whenever I see her in person or even on social media I feel terrible consumed by regret, jealousy, loneliness, frustration. All that lovely stuff.

At first I reasoned with myself that the university is massive with like 20,000 students but the one weekend I went to visit another mate who goes there I ran into her twice, by chance, over 2 days. It just makes me feel doomed to be constantly around this girl for 3 years who makes me miserable by reminding me of better times. I’ve spent all day panic googling other places to go, but would that be an awful mistake?

Lastly I’ll add that I don’t think it’s totally based around her. I was debating if this university was really for me for a while and finding other schools a bit more appealing, but maybe that’s my subconscious at play trying to come up with an excuse to avoid her.

Advice is appreciated.

We would text everyday and call for hours. She only lived about an hour away so I would drive to see her when she wanted to hangout. (also a plus because I thought all her friends were really cool) Eventually I asked her if she wanted to start talking and she said yes and we admitted that we were into each other the night we met.

630,"Hello,

I am new to reddit, so I don't know how all of this works.  My son suffered a stroke in utero, and on a related note was recently diagnosed with cerebral palsy.  He is a little over one now.  I am an only child and my parents live on the other side of the country.  For the most part, that is the extent of my family.  My wife's family however are all within 90 minutes of us, and as a result we spend considerable time with her parents, brother and sister and their families.  

To keep it simple, my sister-in-law's husband is not a good person; I will call him ""Jim"".  Together they have two girls, one of whom is slightly younger than my son.  I was not in-town for this, but at a recent family event he made numerous comparisons between his youngest and our son.  For example, he commented how she was starting to walk and yet our son could not.  Note, he is just about to get a walker, and he may have it for several years and possibly his entire life.  My wife told me there were several other similar inappropriate comments he made.  To the point that, her parents pulled him aside and told him to cut it out.  They also did the same with their daughter, his wife, regarding his behavior.  My wife didn't really react and if she did I know she brushed it off as she is too kind of a soul to push back.

It is the Holidays, and I know we will be seeing them again shortly for an extended period of time.  I am fairly certain he will do this again, and I want to be prepared to put him in his place.  

If you were in my situation or when you were in a similar situation in the past, how would you / did you handle it?  Although I would love to clean his clock, there will be five kids all around and I don't want my kids or theirs to feel uncomfortable or to impact their relationships (granted they are all very young at the moment--under six).

None of them ever try to do better, get a better job, go to college, etc. Then they come at me like I’m selfish. They see how I live and how they live and they roll their eyes at me and think I’m living in a fantasy world. They keep expecting me to fail and say it’s all going to crumble down on top of me, but at the same time they all have to talk to me every day and pretend to hold me close when they just want me at arms length if they need something. 

It all makes me want to distance myself from them. I don’t even want my parents at my wedding so I told them it’s off so that they don’t come because I’m having it at the place I always dreamed of. I fear they’re going to just bring me down in life and at some point find a way to ruin everything I have.",11Dec2019,1

653,"So, just a small breakdown, I'm 15(FM) living in the US. My parents are both together and happily married and I have two older brothers (relevant later.)

My problem is, my dad is too touchy. From as long as I could remember, he has grabbed my head roughly and forced me to kiss him (while not allowing me to pull away) pin me to the floor while tickling my arms, neck, or sides, etc. 
He did this a lot more when I was young, and when I started to scream and cry he and my family would guilt me and say ""he's just joking, don't be so sensitive.""

I hate this. I absolutely hate it. He's never done this to my older brother (18) and has only done it to me. No one else. Everytime I say stop he throws a fit and says things like, ""fine, I'm not playing with you anymore."" Or throws his hands in the air and storms off. I feel like his intense porn addiction is somewhat to cause for this. It doesn't help that he has cornered me while screaming in my face. 

I feel like I have no right to my body, and when I told my mom this, she said as long as I live under their roof and rules I have no right to privacy. When I try bringing it to attention THAT I DON'T LIKE IT, she guilts me and says ""He just wants to play with you. Quit being mean, he thinks that you hate him.""
I don't think its sexual abuse, because ever since I ""developed"" he has refused to hug me directly and acts repulsed just by me talking to my mom about girl things like needing tampons. 

This has been happening so much that everytime I'm touched in the slightest way that he has touched me by anyone, I have to excuse myself to go cry. I don't even know why I do this. It makes me so uncomfortable. 

I just want to tell him to stop without hurting his feelings like my mom said, but everytime I do he gets upset about it. What should I do?",11Dec2019,1

I work for a really small company with only 5 employees. I guess we must be having financial trouble, because since September my paychecks are pretty much always late. Sometimes it takes about 4 weeks for me to get paid, and then 1 out of every 3 checks bounce when I try to deposit them.  I get charged a fee every time that happens, and I’m not always reimbursed by the company. Now the bank is holding all my paychecks for 9 days. 

I’m obviously looking for another job, but it might be a while before I’m hired. I don’t have much money at the moment, seeing as my work owes me over $1,000 in back pay. I’m fed up and I want to quit right now, but unless I find another job before the end of the month I’m financially screwed. Similarly, if I don’t get paid again this month I’m screwed. 

I know that legally, they have to pay me if I keep showing up and working. I just don’t know when the next paycheck is. Am I wasting my time at this job? Should I leave right now or should I wait until I find a new job? And, should I sue for my wages after I quick?

I desperately need to quit my job. I'm a young professional who was recently diagnosed with Autism and ADHD about a year ago and I'm at my wit's end. I mentally cannot endure working another day at my current job.  I work at a major University as a permanent staffed Research Assistant and it's awful.I'm mocked, put down, criticized, downplayed, overworked and underpaid. Even worse, this has started affecting me physically and mentally. For almost the entirety of Thanksgiving break, as well as a week of PTO, I was bedridden from autistic burnout. I could barely eat, I slept for 14-18+ hours each day. 

I create and manage Excel and Access databases, I automate tasks, data analysis, custom custom-built surveys (via Qualtrics, RedCap, etc), automate data reports, and other things using VBA and Python. I run IT support for all my co-RAs  I've built out 3 different websites since I've been here. And I work on four different projects (I am the ""project manager"" on 3! Which means I do the data collection, management, analysis, everything.) Everything was going well until I received my diagnosis and disclosed it.

After this, my supervisor has been doing everything in their power to demonize me from my co-workers, overwork me then claim I have issues with ""time management"", and they've even started building up a case against me with HR. I've reached out to the ADA and HR, both of which wouldn't even respond to my emails. Even worse, now my performance is starting to suffer from my deteriorating health. While I'm still managing decently under unrealistic expectations, I'm pretty sure if I don't quit, I'll be fired soon. 

I am working with a recruiter at a major tech company via a referral that specializes in recruiting individuals with disabilities. I don't even know this person, but they seem incredible and I am SO thankful, but I don't think I'm going to mentally/physically make it if I stay at my current job until something comes up. Even if I was to quit today, I'm pretty sure I'll be homeless by the time I get another job.

I have family (mom and younger sibling) that depend on me, so I really need to do something that would allow for all of us to survive. I've been looking into freelance work for Wordpress devs, but I'm not even sure where to start.

661,"Hey everyone!
I'm 21 and I have been on the pill since I was 15. I haven't really had any side effects except I gained a little bit of weight at first but nothing too bad.

I'm going to switch to a hormonal IUD on Friday because I'll go on an exchange semester to Australia starting in January so it's easier if I don't have to import the pill. I'm a bit worried because of everything I've heard. I'm worried my now perfect skin might become worse. I'm also worried about gaining weight and bleeding all the time. I've heard some women bleed for 6 months straight after getting it and also that some get bad acne. 

My boyfriend is Australian and we don't get to see each other that often so obviously I don't want to be bleeding or dealing with acne or weight gain when I'm there with him.

My gyn said that I'll only spot in the first month and after that it will be completely fine. However,  she is very pro IUD.

What is it like to switch from the pill to a hormonal IUD.  Is the fact that I never had any problems with the pill a positive sign for an IUD?",11Dec2019,1

I found I have no time for myself, I usually get up around 9 am, basically just to have a little free time but nothing substantial because I can’t really go anywhere. After work I stay up till 12-2 to again, have free time so I feel like I’m not just going to bed and waking up and going to work everyday. 

I don’t have time for my boyfriend, which is taking a strain on our relationship and emotions, since we’re looking to move in together it’s difficult to find time for even that. 

First things first, what can I do to have some free time, or schedule any time for myself with this weird mid shift? I really do love that I do right now, and the only time available for that position is those times.

It was my birthday recently, and I thought it was a good opportunity to throw a party in the coming days to see many friends I haven't seen for months, due to me burning out from too much work. I miss them a lot. 
However, in the meantime, I learned that one of my friends lost his father, one week ago.
So I was thinking about simply postponing the party to January, as I don't really feel like partying while he's suffering such a loss. I don't want to be inconsiderate, to act like nothing happened, and I certainly don't want to add to his pain. I just can't imagine how I'd feel if I were in his shoes. 
I haven't talk to him about it, as he has a lot of more important things to take care of these days. 
My gut feeling is that I should just postpone the party. On the other hand, I cannot think clearly these days, and maybe it's a dumb idea and I'm overthinking it. 
If you have any advice or personal experience to share about a similar situation, I'd be glad to hear from you.

Well we put away all of our winter clothes when it gets hot out because it just takes up a lot of space in our closet. So about a month ago when it got cold I went to get our stuff out and immediately noticed missing things.

I don’t want to accuse them of stealing my things but I work very hard and I love fashion so I do really care about these things. Plus I think him saying he wanted to steal my husbands coat and then it’s missing is extremely suspicious.

673,"I am 20 with Aspergers and BPD.

I came out as bi when I was 12. When I was 16, I came out as a lesbian. I had a few relationships, a couple of flings etc. The normal.

Then I met a guy who I'll call 'Jak'. I wasn't interested at first at all but he pined after me and I let it go into a friendship and then I decided to try a relationship after coming into the state of mind that its personality over gender. We've had a few ups and downs but overall, things have been great.

But two years later (to the day this weekend) and I am struggling hard with my sexuality. He knows I don't find him sexually attractive in a way a normal relationship would work and he is okay with that as he knows I think he is a very good looking guy anyway. We have an alright sex life that is regular. I have lived with him and his family for over a year (since my dad kicked me out when I was 19) and overall his family is very invested in me (I think) and as a whole, we love each other.

But I'm lost. I'm not sure if the lacking identity due to my BPD is affecting things and my bad mental health in general. I love him, but I don't know if I can be with him due to the fact that, I am a lesbian. His personality is so wonderful, so perfect. He has been there for me through everything from suicide attempts through to my own accusing delusions.

I can't imagine my life without him but I already know that if we broke up he'd not be able to be friends with me (at least for a long while) and I can't bear that thought. I can't bear the idea of him not being in my life. Even if I did break up with him purely because of my own sexuality, I think he would still struggle a lot.

I'm sorry if this is muddled, and I know it isn't really a question. But if anyone has any advice, or insight into how mental health/BPD specifically could be affecting everything, please do tell me all you know. This entire situation as well as the fact I've been too ill to work the last few years, had to give up and dog and horse just to be able to feed myself, my loosening grip on my sanity and my general stresses and anxieties is killing me and making me want to do awful things to myself.

The more we talk and grow to like eachother, the more I get anxiety about the thought of comming out. I never had to deal with this problem before. I always thought I only liked woman until recently. 
My family (Mainly my moms side) is very religious and completely against anything to do with homosexuality.

679,"I work in the billing office of a small clinic with an older lady (we'll call her Janet). We're in a separate office from the main clinic (but in the same building), and often Janet and I are the only two people in the office. We get along pretty well and I consider her a friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Janet has worked here for 15 years; I've been here for 5. She is \*relentlessly\* devoted to the company, and consistently overworked. She's a perfectionist who literally won't be able to sleep at night if she thinks anything has fallen through the cracks. It's not uncommon for her to work 3 to 4 hours unpaid in the evening after everyone else has gone home, so she can get her work done (our boss doesn't know this, and I'm sure he wouldn't approve). She's basically the person that everyone calls with their questions about insurance stuff, as she has more extensive knowledge about that stuff than anyone else here.  She's such a kind and helpful person that people are constantly calling her with their ""problem cases,"" and she usually takes on these cases herself, because she doesn't trust anyone else to do it correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Janet doesn't get along well with our boss (the clinic administrator); he always seems annoyed if she has to ask a question or make any sort of request. And every year her annual performance review is good, but she once confided that they haven't even given her a cost of living raise in 10 years. At her last review, I encouraged her to press for at least a small increase, but she was shot down, with my boss saying that her insurance was too expensive to allow for a raise. Meanwhile, I have gotten steady raises every year, despite the fact that I really don't do much more than the bare minimum. I'm not sure how much she makes, but she made a comment leading me to believe that she earns under $10 an hour (I make more than twice that). 

&amp;#x200B;

Janet is really struggling with money. Many times she has broken down crying because her account is overdrawn and she has to go to the food bank.  She is terrified of losing her job because she's only a few years away from retirement, and of the whole idea of finding a job at her age and having to learn a new workflow.  She's not very tech savvy and prefers to write things out by hand, even though I've offered to help her learn to complete forms online etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I desperately want to do something to help her, partially because I care about her, but also partially because she is stressed out ALL the time and it's starting to wear on me. I wish I could help her financially, but I support a disabled spouse so I never have much money left over.  I try to bring her little gifts when I can, but it really doesn't do anything to help the problem. I've tried telling her that it's not the end of the world if a few things get missed here and there; it happens in every office and it's not worth her having to work unpaid overtime like a slave. But she feels that's unacceptable, and that she's at risk of losing her job if anyone finds out that she dropped the ball. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like I can bring the issues directly to my boss, as there would be too much risk of repercussions, for either Janet or myself. He's shown zero interest in doing anything to help her out. And because it's a small clinic, there's really no one else I can talk to about it. The doctors have indicated that they want no part in the discussion. At this point it seems like there's nothing I could do except quit my job in protest, which would only increase Janet's workload (plus she seems to enjoy my company) .

No need for upvotes just need some advice. I find myself in a difficult situation. Monday morning  an employee from our office was fired. I’m not supposed to know why he was fired but it is somewhat common knowledge the reason why the individual was fired. He was fired for a just cause. Security has been on site for the last several days in case the individual returns to exact some kind of revenge. 



Today, I step outside with a friend and he notices the security guard patrolling our property. My friend then tells me that another coworker said the following to them in private. 



“That security guard is the least of my worries, he’s the first one to be taken out. I’ve already thought about how to produce the most amount of carnage. If I were to do it I would block this exit and the front exit with a vehicle. Then stand at the back corner where I can pick off people as they exit the building from one of the two locations.”



This is a fellow veteran with PTSD, he has the know how, the capability and seems to be having issues with his temper. My question is simple. 



I have PTSD but I’ve never planned something like that in my head. Am I being paranoid? Should it be reported to HR? Keep in mind though, his attitude and his problems understanding his job means he is constantly frustrated and probably at the verge of disciplinary action.

yesterday i was eating dinner alone before my final and he came up to my table, said “hi princess how’re you doing?” and winked at me. i put my head down and kept eating, hoping he would get the hint. but today, when i was eating breakfast with my roommate, he again came up to me and said “hey beautiful”. i am 19 and he is in his 40s or 50s.
i talked to my roommate about reporting him and she has not been very supportive, saying she has had men do worse things to her and she never reported it. i know this to be true and i feel awful for her, but i also would like the school to intervene so that i do not have to feel uncomfortable just getting a meal before or after class.

693,"So, I now have the opportunity to achieve my dream home, a giant Victorian in my favorite neighborhood that I have been in love with since I was a child.  It has always been a passion of mine to own and maintain a lovely old home, and my boyfriend is 100% on board with the idea.  This house has a pool and is on an acre very close to the booming downtown area.  It checks a lot of my personal boxes that I love in old houses - french doors, pocket doors, character, parlor, etc. 

The only issue is... it is a bit out of budget. ... $400K.  My boyfriend and I are planning on going in together to purchase it.  Both of us work full-time and we go to online school full time.  We have about 2 years each left before we get our bachelors and finish our degrees.  The mortgage alone costs my entire monthly salary.  It is doable, but money will be tight.  I hardly have any money left to save, and that rules out vacations for the next few years.

I find it very annoying and don't want anything to do with him. But I'm not very strong mentally, I'm afraid I will just become friends with him again only for him to keep being mean to me, as in saying ''blyat is a fucking fat ass and will die of diabetes soon hahaha go fucking die'' the thing its, I have no idea if he is actually thinking, we have that humor (which is my guess) or if he is just kidding, which isn't funny at all.

I studied in HS by going to class, taking notes, doing HW, and repeat. This has gotten me through the experience, and somehow got me friends too. I know that they say college is 80% self-study and 20% lecture material whereas high school is the inverse, but i often fail tests because the teachers don't want to tell you what'll be on the test and I often study the wrong material, or I can't grasp the material enough to do the homework or understand when I try to study. 

I try to go for help but the profs' office hours are very limited, maybe 2ish hours like 2 days a week (At best, its worse for PhD profs who tend to be department heads at my college, so they're extra busy.), and i'm not their only student right? All they do is repeat what they said in class and it doesn't help, or I immediately forget what they said and have no idea how to do the homework. I write down EVERYTHING they say and when I get back to my room an hour later i'm just as lost as I was, but they went through 1-2 problems with me. This does not help at all. Added to that there is NO tutoring available for my major, or for reall any of the classes im taking (according to the dept head ""there isn't anyone I'd say is comfortable enough with the material to tutor it, and it'd really only be you using it since everyone else just studies and does fine. idk why you can't do the same.""). Same applies for the major I want to transfer into, but I don't have money to go to another school and no idea what id' do if I weren't in college. Added to that I have NO idea what I want to do, I don't even know vaguely what I want to pursue eating for lunch until its right in front of me let alone what I want to major in.

701,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

My (M 30) gf (F 41) and I have been together for 10 months and it's been easily the best 10 months of my adult life. We spend at least a little bit of time together everyday.  Things in the bedroom are beyond amazing. We've been discussing moving in together when my lease is up next summer, yada yada yada. In general going very well.

The thing is, she is worried about posting facebook stuff (photos together, relationship status) because she's connected to her son's dad (her ex) and his family on there. He is present in his child's life and by all accounts a good dad, grandparents help her out with him a couple of days a week as well. She initially didn't want him knowing anything about me. I thought it was odd, but I don't have any kids, never dated anyone with that history, so I took it in stride.

I have since met the ex and his family. Everything went well, everyone was cordial. No big deal. So I figure her anxiety about this is over.

A few days ago, a friend of hers took a photo of us and tagged us on her Instagram story, my gf then dubbed us ""Instagram official""

Last night I bring up the topic of wanting to be ""Facebook official"" and she gets a little anxious and defensive about it, citing her connection to the ex and his family on there and she doesn't want them knowing her business. She says I can post and tag her for anything on instagram, but give her some time still on the facebook front.

Am I overreacting to this? I have a tendency to get anxious and paranoid. I don't think theres an ulterior motive here, but I am anxious by nature (which she knows about me)  I don't want to post every aspect of our lives together, just a little shout out in the ""In a Relationship"" portion and a photo or two together.

702,"We had 2 ""urban legends"" in our family. One was that my grandfather wasn't really my grandfather. The other was that when my mom was 17, she got pregnant for the 2nd time. 

The story as my mom told me almost 20 years ago was that this baby boy was taken from her by the doctor and a social worker. She was never able to hold the baby boy or even look at him. She was told that he was underweight, retarded (a catch all word I assume in 1976,) and wouldn't live through the night. Mom said the doctor yelled at her. Said she couldn't take care of a baby with needs like this. She was already a teen mother of a 2 year old, she was convinced this was the right thing. She heard the siren from the ambulance and asked the doctor ""is that him?"" 

This baby was adopted. A closed adoption. 2 years later, I was born.

We grew up in a very abusive home. My step father sexually assaulted me as a child for a year, he emotionally and physically abused me, my brother and my mom for 20 years. He died in 2005.

I am fiercely protective of my mom and my brother. I'm the only one who's been in therapy, the rest of the family has a macho attitude and thinks therapy is for crazy people. Based on the life we all shared, I don't know how I'd still be alive without therapy.

When my mom told me about my missing older brother, I did all the detective work I could online. I tried to get his birth certificate, I didn't know how to find him and it was 2000, so the internet only gave so much help.

Then DNA tests happened. I'm not sure how my missing brother found out he was adopted, but he has been determined to find us for 20 years as well. He found out my grandpa wasn't my grandpa, a suspected rumor in the family confirmed. This is how he found us. 

He called my mom on Sunday. Not only did he grow up in the same town, but my brother and I went to junior high and high school with him. He said he grew up happy. No abuse. 

My brother talked to him. Everyone loves him. I haven't talked to him yet. First off, I'm the only one in the family who would reveal the dark shit, the reason we are the way we are, so bonded and tight. My missing brother doesn't know he was stolen. My mom wants to tell him face to face. I'm imagining I'm him, wondering how he, a middle child was the only one adopted out. It makes no sense. He needs to know he was wanted, he needs to know the truth.

Part of me wishes I had been stolen so I could have avoided decades of abuse. My friends tell me this is normal, but it sounds pretty fucked up.

He always says okay I'll stop but then the next time starts right back again. My bf says I'm overreacting because their parents always did that to them.

1. Graduate in May and become a high school math teacher.
2. Become a training coordinator for a popular restaurant in N. America (for a particular franchise though, not corporate)

My dilemma is that I've dreamed of becoming a teacher since I was in pre-school, and I'm finally reaching the end of my degree. All I have left is to student teach in the spring, and then I graduate. I'm also working for this company currently that I absolutely love. Really, it's the best job I ever had. The owners and upper management have always seen my potential and I got promoted twice within my first year to a manager where I run shifts and get to train and coach employees in my store. The owner of the company wants me to become a training coordinator in which I would train employees into becoming managers throughout the company (7 stores). I would love that opportunity because I feel like I would still get to put my degree to use. Money is not a factor in this because I would make about the same in either job. The restaurant job however does reimburse car, gas, and phone payments, and I would be given a corporate card to buy supplies.

I've worked so hard to become a teacher though and I feel like I owe it to myself to at least pursue it, but I have doubts because teaching gets a really bad rep and sometimes it seems like there are more cons than pros. However, teaching isn't going anywhere whereas companies could be sold, go bankrupt, etc. My professors also truly believe in my ability to teach, and I may do an equally good job in either field. I'm just scared that I won't end up happy since I don't have as much experience teaching as I do working for the restaurant.

So I would love your advice as an outsider to my situation. My family and friends want me to pursue teaching, but my managers want me to stay with the company. Obviously both parties are biased. Should I stay with a company that I know I love or pursue the dream I worked so hard to get that I may end up loving or hating?",11Dec2019,1

I guess I never really learned to make friends, since my mother always spoke another language to her friends (a language she hasn't taught me).
Also I'm awfully shy, what makes it even harder.

718,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but whatever.

So today, I was on the bus on my way home, and I foolishly put my backpack, and my wallet on the seat next to me. When getting of the bus, I grabbed my backpack, but I left the wallet right there... I know I'm dumb...

So next thing I know this guy texts me, with a photo of my IDs saying he's got something of mine, and that I should text him back... So I do, he asks for my number, which I give him and we talk. I can't give you a transcript of the conversation, because I'm freaking out too much to remember properly but this is what he told me:

* He found my wallet at the bus stop, lying on the ground.
* There were my ID-s but nothing else in it. (I did have my money)
* He can meet me tomorrow morning, and give back my wallet.
* He repeated multiple times that there wasn't anything else in it.
* He lives close to the bus stop, and I quote ""we might even know each other"".
* He's a father with 4 kids. (This is true, he was on the bus with a bunch of kids and a woman.)

Now, I don't know. It is entirely possible that someone grabbed my wallet off the seat, took out the money, and threw it away at the stop. Or, this guy is full of shit, you be the judge. I have no clue what to do, I'm fully aware that I'm almost definitely not getting my money back, but I figured I might get some advice.

728,"Trigger warning for homophobia... obviously. 

So where I live you do college with a set class. Like every subject is done with that same class. I recently started going back to college after dropping out of art school for two years and trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I was fully out of the closet for four years before going to this new college where I decided I would test the waters before making a decision on whether to come out or not. 

And boy, am I glad I waited. Within the first three days the homophobic comments where everywhere. Jokes about being gay, saying all gays deserve to die and even tearing up the tolerance posters the school hangs up everywhere to at least try and instill more appropriate behaviour to them. 

I decided I would go back into the colest around college and keep that part of me just to my social groups. Not that I'm constantly making references to my gayness or anything, but it's nice to just... be yourself without having to pretend you understand boy troubles or get certain things straight girls do.  Eventually I felt comfortable enough to tell another classmate I was close to, who is also a closeted bisexual, and I guess one of my other classmates, who is also somewhat a friend overheard because he asked me a few times if I have a girlfriend yet. 

It was going great until a lecture got off topic and the discussion of whether the man or the woman should pay the bill arose. My opinion was asked and I said that I find it regressive to be of the mentality that the man should pay for everything seeming we always say we want equal rights but that I didnt really want to comment further as I dont really know. My prof was kinda stunned and goes ""OP, do you not go out or something?"" And I said ""well I do, but I just dont really think about things like that"" upon which my classmate took it upon himself to loudly proclaim and tell everyone ""OP likes girls so she doesn't think about things like that"" 

Needles to say I was mortified. My anxiety? Skyrocketed. I tried to laugh it off but it was too late. I had questions and glares from so many classmates. The prof bought the attention back to her and the class moved on. I was sure to be very slow in packing my things and took a long time before leaving to avoid any conflict. I called my mum crying about it. Her advice is to lie and say I had a boyfriend until about three months ago. But I dont feel comfortable with that at all. I honestly have no idea what to do about this situation so I'm wondering if anyone else maybe does? 

Any and all advice would be so welcome and appreciated, because honestly, I'm scared.",11Dec2019,1

732," I have posted this on other threads but I want all the advice I can get so apologies in advance. I am 24 years old, and as of very recently my problem has seriously started to piss me off. I am a grown adult that should have their act together and I don't.

Since I was a child I have struggled to get out of bed in the morning, and to top it off, whenever I actually do manage to haul myself out, I still feel exhausted. The not getting out is simply a matter of being lazy and too warm and comfortable. I hate how I feel when I am up, still half asleep, I never feel awake or refreshed. My sleep pattern seems to be a mess, I go to bed more or less the same time every day and wake up the same on weekdays. On weekends, Saturdays especially for some reason, I have a real problem of sleeping in until midday, and you guessed it, I still feel rubbish. It's also affecting my hygiene and eating, by the time I get home in the evenings, I sometimes skip my dinner without showering or washing my hair. Fucking disgusting.

I started law recently, and I am in college every day studying and have exams soon which I know I am going to fail. My head is always clouded, foggy, I can never think straight, and I can NEVER NEVER concentrate or remember anything, no matter how hard I try. I am always distracted, my head wandering off to daydream, and it's depressing. I am always daydreaming and I can't stop. I did my best to study but nothing went in and I am destined for disaster.

I also have Asperger's syndrome, sometimes it bothers me, sometimes it doesn't. Of course if I could reverse it I could, but it is a part of my life, I had no choice but to learn how to deal with it. So as you can guess I have no friends, I talk to people but that's it. Whilst I hate this, it really gets me and I feel lonely a lot, fortunately I have a great family. I always feel that people are jeering and mocking me behind my back, I hate being this paranoid. I could be right, I could be wrong.

I am wondering if my problem goes deeper than I think, other than being on the spectrum, if I have a mental health problem or do I need to improve my lifestyle or is this shit inevitable?",11Dec2019,1

737,"TL;DR - My boyfriend playfully tossed my daughter onto the bed, my daughter reported it to my mom who reacted with anger and hostility indirectly toward my boyfriend (and later myself), and now my daughter keeps repeating “daddy threw me on the bed,” which keeps fueling my mom’s anger. 

To preface this, the relationships and settings are the following:

My retired mom lives in my house with my daughter and me to take care of my daughter full time, as I work for most of the time she’s awake. 

My boyfriend is not my daughter’s father. He and I started dating over the summer. When my daughter first met him, she immediately called him “daddy.” (Maybe because of the similarities in one of their features, clothes, etc.) After a few more visits, we realized that she does realize my boyfriend and her father are two separate people, despite never seeing them in the same room together. She doesn’t like getting close to most people, but she formed an immediate and strong bond with him, and he with her. 

Here is where I need advice: 

For the past couple of months, my daughter has been repeating “daddy threw me on the bed.” The frequency of this phrase increased as she got more attention because of it. She can tell that it’s something that especially gets her grandma’s (my mom’s) (negative) attention. 

At first, I had shrugged it off, as pillow fights and light roughhousing were a common request from my daughter at the time, which both my boyfriend and I had joined in on as carefully as we could, my daughter having a blast bouncing around. 

However, my mom is very upset over the situation, to the point where my boyfriend doesn’t feel comfortable coming over to the house anymore, and it’s almost a daily occurrence that my mom brings it up (my daughter telling people he threw her on the bed) saying that my daughter has “brain problems” because she keeps repeating that phrase—my mom thinks it’s a form of trauma that my daughter can’t get over. 

I hadn’t attributed the incident to any particular event, but my mom has marked it down as happening the night I went to the bathroom to get ready to go out, and my boyfriend took my daughter into my room with him, where she, shortly after, ran out saying “daddy threw me on the bed.” There were no signs of injury or anything. From what I remember that night, it was dinnertime, and my mom had called my daughter out of the room to take another bite, which, when that happens, my boyfriend will encourage for her to go see her grandma. 

Prior to meeting my boyfriend, my daughter liked to have pillow fights with her bio dad, as well. Same thing, we would carefully play with her on the bed, he more rough than I, knocking her down, or tossing her on the bed, to be met with giggles and pure joy. 

I feel like the reason my daughter keeps repeating that phrase is because she gets attention from it—she’s a toddler. I also feel like the fighting and negativity between the adults is a greater trauma to my daughter and that she’s feeding off of our reactions. My mom seems to think that the event would be grounds for my boyfriend to be taken to jail or me losing custody of my daughter, and that she’s doing us a favor by not reporting it, because she doesn’t want either her or myself to lose my daughter to foster care. She also mentioned not wanting to ruin our upcoming vacation plans (all four of us).

Long story short, is this a normal reaction from a 2 year old? Should I be more worried about her? Is my mom out of line in her accusations and hostility?",11Dec2019,1

740,"This has a pretty long backstory that started a long time ago. 

I’ll change names where/if necessary so here’s who I’ll refer to everyone as if it’s necessary: 
Me: 26f
My mother: Mom (67f)
My father: Dad (59m)
My oldest half brother: Steve (49m)
My other half brother (middle child): Brad (48m)

*My half brothers and I share our mom; my dad is their stepfather and I’m his only child. 

My mom stopped working before I was born. Her and my dad are married and he always worked long hours for little pay. So I spent more time with my mom and had a closer relationship with her.

Both of my parents have a drinking problem. I started to notice around 9-10 years old. I noticed that both of them would get weird after drinking alcohol and they’d start arguing and fighting, mostly about money. Then my mom would tell me all about the fights and why dad was wrong, he’s an asshole for wanting her to get a job because her job was to raise me, she’s just putting stuff on the credit card so it’s fine, etc. 

My mom also started to have some medical issues when I was about 10. Despite these these issues, she got around fine and was of sound mind. Yet, despite us struggling, she refused to get a job. Anytime I needed anything I basically had to go to my grandma or my older half brothers, otherwise she’d put things on credit cards and cause fights with my dad. I was great at tennis in high school but I ended up having to quit and get a job to help out, which I’m not complaining about but it really bummed me out. 

Fast forward to the summer of 2012-the summer after my freshman year of college. I grew up in a college town and was attending the university here. My parents still lived in town but I lived across town in an apartment. I was accepted to my dream college in a different state, but my parents refused to be supportive of this and basically said I needed to go to the local university if I wanted their support (not financial, just in general). They wanted to be close by in case I needed anything. So I did this by their wishes. 

Since I had left home a year prior, their fighting and drinking got worse. They were in mounds of debt that couldn’t be paid, my dad blames my mom for running up the credit cards, and their house was being foreclosed on. And then my dad decided he wanted a divorce and would be moving 5 hours away. Well, my mom hasn’t worked in over 19 years now-she doesn’t know how to work a computer, her health was getting worse (although she could have still managed a sit down job at this point) and has nowhere to go. During this time, she faked having a stroke...when I got her to the hospital parking lot all of a sudden she was okay (this isn’t the first time she’s faked having a medical issue to get attention). I, of course, was angry with my dad and ended up not speaking to him for a year because my mom instilled this idea in me that he was this awful person. In the mean time, one of my brothers (Brad) came to move her in with him (in the same area where my father was going 5 hours away) with the agreement that she could stay but that she’d need to work on applying for social security (either disability or retirement, whatever she could get), alimony, etc and to find an easy job (I worked at a bulk store at the time and had a connection to get her a job as a demo associate where she could sit/stand as much as she needed) to work on becoming independent to whatever degree possible. 

What actually happened while she was there is that she got drunk every night and drunkenly called my other brother (Steve) and I to complain about Brad. Then Steve would call Brad and ask why he’s being such an asshole to our mom. She did nothing about getting a job, she did nothing about applying for social security, basically just nothing at all except for getting drunk every night. Eventually she reconciled with my dad and right around the same time, Brad got sick of her getting drunk and doing nothing and kicked her out. She moved back in with my dad and they’ve been back together since. However, Brad has cut off all communication with her, my dad, and Steve because he was sick of all their shit. 

I ended up making up with my dad about a year later in 2013. Her and my mom seemed to have been getting along better than ever and the drinking slowed down significantly. I was pretty upset about the fact that they guilted me into staying at the local university to be close to them only for them to move 5 hours away a year later, but otherwise we were all getting along very well and I finally had a decent relationship with my dad. I also started to realize that my mom was not perfect either. I did, however, very clearly tell them that if this ever happens again I wanted nothing to do with any of it. Even then I was skeptical. But over the years my relationship with both of them strengthened and I love them dearly. 

Now fast forward to 2017. Steve decides he wants to move back down to the area where my parents are living (he was living in a different state). He got a job there, then he and his girlfriend moved in with my parents. This was supposed to be temporary while he was trying to buy a home....but to this day he is still living there because he’s being EXTREMELY picky about his house. 

My parents live in a small two bedroom condo, so they’re in one room and Steve and girlfriend are in the other. Steve can be pretty difficult to get along with as it is, but he and girlfriend have long overstayed their welcome and have essentially taken over their house. My dad was getting very fed up with it very quickly, but my mom wouldn’t let him say anything. But in the mean time, she would call me CONSTANTLY complaining about them and how they wouldn’t get out of her house. Basically every conversation I had with her was extremely negative and turned in to her complaining about my dad, Steve and GF, basically everything. I tried to listen and give advice but she never listened. I finally got fed up and told her that she needs to do something about it and tell them they need to leave if she’s not going to let my dad say anything. But she wouldn’t...she just kept calling me to complain. They were taking up her space, being rude, stressing her and my dad out, and she said it was affecting their marriage and dad has started to drink heavily again. I got fed up again and told her that I would no longer discuss this with her if she wasn’t actually going to do anything about it. She finally did, but tension was already extremely high between everyone. 

My parents stay with me for a weekend about every other month so I see them pretty regularly. Every time I saw them, my mom was complaining about any and everything, nagging my dad for nothing, and just being negative in general. my dad always had a beer in hand and just stayed quiet. I could tell things were starting to get worse, but there was nothing I could do-they never listen to my advice. They’re still struggling financially and my mom isn’t eligible for retirement because of the lack of work history, and has a complicated case for disability again because of her work history but she’s done nothing to pursue it. She hardly takes care of her medical issues-a few weeks ago she had a bladder prolapse and refused to go to the hospital because they couldn’t afford it even though there was financial assistance available. Plus she said she didn’t really think it was *that* big of a deal. I also found out that my dad now keeps a cooler full of beer in his backseat and literally drinks all day long (yes, while driving). My moms condition has deteriorated to where she can’t work at all and takes opioid pain meds 2-3 times a day, but she also stays drinking (which as we all know can kill you) and then complains about my dad drinking. 

Well, fast forward to this weekend- my mom calls me crying saying my dad left her again. I asked what happened, she said he was drunk and she asked him to wash his plate and he said something snarky like “that’s what I have you for” and then started to record her with his phone, which she proceeded to try to get out of his hand. She tends to leave things out that would incriminate her (she never owns up to any wrongdoings and blames everyone else). So I call my dad and ask what happened- he says she was also drunk and when he made the snarky comment, she started throwing punches at him which is why he got his phone out to record. I asked what he was doing right now he said trying to drive around and figure out what to do. This was around noon. I asked if he was drinking and he said yes, and this wasn’t his first one either. I asked if he cares that he’s putting himself and everyone else on the road in risk, he said he doesn’t care. I freaked out and told him not to contact me anymore. I called my mom back and let her know I’m aware that she was also physically violent with my father (which she didn’t deny) and that I was also sick of her shit and not to contact me. I blocked both of their numbers and deactivated my Facebook so they couldn’t contact me. 

My boyfriend told me that the next day, my mother posted on Facebook that she went to the ER for the bladder prolapse. I’m not saying that she was faking a medical issue this time because she definitely wasn’t, but she has had this issue for weeks and decides the day after my dad leaves is the day she needs to go to the hospital and post about it on Facebook. 

So to summarize, their drinking has caused one separation, one child cutting off all communication with them for almost 8 years now, and I cut off my dad for a year. And now we have physical violence and another separation to add. My dad constantly drinks and drives and my mom takes multiple opioid pain killers a day and drinks constantly too. Despite the fact that I’m now far away from them and they don’t directly affect my life anymore (such as when I was younger and even in 2012 when they separated and moved after guilting me into staying local), I’m still extremely angry with both of them. I’ve told both of them that their drinking is problematic and neither of them think it’s a big deal. I do love them and I know they love me too, but I’m not sure if I can continue hearing about/being involved with this in any way. I told Steve that I will have no part in anything going on there and that I will not help them in any kind of way because they just keep repeating the same behaviors and blaming each other, and quite frankly I’m disgusted by both of them. Steve respected what I was saying but was still overwhelmed that “he would have to find mom somewhere to live on his own”. 

I should also note that I’ve spent plenty of time in a profession that involves helping people with substance abuse issues and I’m very familiar on interacting with addicts/alcoholics. I know how important family support is, I’ve tried extremely hard to be supportive but I cannot help them if they won’t help themselves. They do not see a problem with their behavior and have essentially told me that I need to mind my own business if I try to tell them that their drinking habits are problematic and the cause of most of those issues.


TLDR: Both of my parents have been alcoholics for as long as I can remember. I was closer with my mom who instilled the idea in me that my dad is an asshole for wanting her to get a job since we were struggling. The drinking eventually caused them to separate in 2012. My mom originally moved in with one of my brothers but he kicked her out because of the drinking and no longer speaks to her. My mom and dad eventually reconciled and I didn’t speak to my dad for a year, but then we all reconciled and had a strong relationship. Fast forward to now, tensions have built due to my other brother and GF living with them and my mom refusing to kick them out. My dad started drinking heavily again and she drinks just as often and takes opioid pain killers too. Over the weekend they both got drunk, my dad antagonized her, she threw punches at him and he left her again. I told them both that I want nothing to do with this and blocked both of them. I’ve tried to be supportive and I’ve mentioned my concerns about their drinking habits but I’m told to mind my business. I’ve been dealing with this for my whole life and I’m sick of it. 

So basically, I’m not sure if it was right for me to cut them off and block them. But I’ve also tried to be supportive to no avail. Did I make the right choice?",11Dec2019,1
741,"I think I failed life at 16 any advice

I’m 16 years old and I feel like I’m already a failure I never really payed attention at all in school due to being bullied because I was known as the “emo” kid or anything else the bullies would say to get a rise out of me, And a shit ton of family issues having my mind somewhere else I’m now in 11 grade (junior year) and I feel like I never learned anything in school and I’m scared that I’m going to fail high school. I’ve always had a small friend group but ever sense my last relationship ended with my girlfriend(now ex) all my friends dropped me except for my best friend who I’ve know for 6+ years he never gave up on me well that was until he moved out of state. It’s been 8 months since he moved and now I have nobody outside of my family of 7. I had to switch to virtual school because I was having several panic attacks every day but I would only get them at school for whatever reason but now I don’t know if I can keep up with the virtual school work. I’ve been smoking weed every day for a year now just to keep from losing my sanity(and it’s become a habit That I can’t control). All I do I sit around my house with no way to leave and no where to go which is new to me because my best friend that moved only lived two houses down from me so I was always hanging out with someone.

748,"There's a guy who works out at my gym, usually a very nice dude and I don't have a problem with him per se (i actually kinda like him) but he's been lying about being a military veteran for a while now and as a veteran myself it really bothers me sometimes. Me and another guy (also a veteran) were discussing some VA hospital issues once at the gym and he joined our conversation and all seemed legit until he claimed that he was a Marine Corps veteran, and then a few moments later claimed his unit was the 101st Airborne Division (An Army division). Now this in and of itself doesn't make him a liar, many people have served in both the Army and the Marines, but it threw up some red flags and so I asked him directly if he had served in the Army a couple of days later and he told me ""Hell no man, Marines all the way brother."" Well I didn't know how to respond and just kind of ended the conversation with a lame ""okay dude catch you later."" Since then the issue has presented itself a couple more times, different things that are pretty inconsistent and it's obvious that the dude is just trying to make himself look cool and claim to be this badass veteran but to legit vets who know better it makes him just look dumb. Like I said, he's a nice guy and I don't want to humiliate him or anything but I can't listen to him claim service anymore because it really bothers me. I'm not the confrontational type, and I'd like to continue to be this dude's acquaintance (maybe even a friend, like I said, we get along well and I don't make friends very easily so I'd like to preserve the relationship) but like I said, I don't want to hear the bullshit anymore. I know that I need to let him know that I know he's not a vet and that he should stop claiming that he is, I just don't know how I should go about it. Advice?

751,"I want to give on some background about my mom. She is an impulsive buyer and buys anything that pops out as ""5 star reviews, and works 100% guaranteed"". She doesn't know much English and she believes in anything she sees from Facebook ads to YouTube ads with influencers saying it all works out. She had spent over $500 this past week on skin products, vitamins promising weight loss, and a brace promising a better pose on random sites. She also has control over the family on what we get to buy. She gets mad and yells at my dad when we don't have enough money to buy her products. 

I had tried telling my mom that these sites are a scam and the majority are placebo effects but she would not listen. Due to a medical condition that my mom faced earlier in the year, she had to undergo surgery. The hospital denied us from getting financial aid, and so my dad is stuck still trying to pay off her medical bills. Both of my parents work at minimum wage jobs, although my mom does have some regular clients that gives her tips sometimes. This week I glanced over my dad's savings dwindling down due to him transferring them to his checking to pay off all the bills. 

I'm aware that my dad is in an abusive relationship by my mom. She had threatened to trash his name to the ground by telling relatives and our extended family about what he did. My dad was scared of that happening. He thought about divorce and talked to me and my sister about it a few years ago. He didn't go through with it because he's scared of my mom and he feels that divorce would be devastating for my sister and I. My mom has a very traditional view of life as she carried it over from her home country, and had tried arranging marriages, and a career for me. I did not like her judging me on finding my own path and she comes off as racist sometimes on who I hang out with in college.

I'm currently in college with no job, as I'm focusing on school and trying to get internships. I'm living off of my financial aid trying to save as much money as possible for my future. I had tried asking my mom if she can help me pay for my gas going to school but denied telling me that I should get a job and pay for it. Instead, she sometimes asks me for money to pay for her stuff and never pays me back. When I attempt to ask for my money back, she argues to me about her giving me a roof above my head and food is enough to pay back what she owes me.

Friends had told me to try to live through all of this until I graduate, but it's been hard on me since I can't study at all when my mom keeps bothering me about buying and arguments with my mom and dad about bills and money. 

I don't know who to talk to since I'm not too fluent with my secondary language to have someone get through with her. My mom's sister tried helping her, but my mom ended up calling them names and judged how they live their lives as ""toxic"". Our family now only has connections that are either neutral or friendly to my mom. 

I don't know what can I expect from this subreddit as this is my first time doing so. I've been feeling drained from my upcoming finals and my emotions are decreasing, so I want to vent here in hoping getting some advice to mitigate, resolve or whichever.

Here I want to ask, what should I do?",11Dec2019,1

754,"Maybe I'm thinking too deeply into this, but a ""friend"" of mine posted an instagram story where you have to tag a friend for something and post it on your story. I'm gonna sound beyond petty but he didn't tag me and he always sends memes etc... 

It's not just that though. He goes out with other people and doesent invite me even though I'm acquaintances with them and when I bring up the topic he just looks past it/jokes about it. I've spoken to him about it partially, but he hates confrontation, like he seriously can't deal with it for sh*t. I know you can't be invited to everything but a simple ""hey do you wanna come?"" would suffice, seeing as I always invite him whenever I go out. I just feel like I'm not wanted and don't know what to do. This has also been going on for a while. 

It's also really frustrating because when I first met him he was a bit broken. Didn't have that much confidence, always spoke in his chest and was just always down/depressed. Was awkward in social situations and was always quiet when we were with friend groups. 

I though about changing this and try make him the slightest bit happier in life. I spent a lot of time with him, especially with our friend group which was about 6 of us. We were all really close and of course in the beginning he was shy, never really spoke or laughed etc... Whenever I notified this I would put the attention on him and ask him for his opinion or make an inside joke to him that him and I would laugh at to lighten his mood. 

This worked for a while, he started making jokes and laughing more often, he'd speak up if he didn't want to do certain things and overall just seemed much more happier and playful. I'm not gonna lie, I felt like a proud dad because I kinda lead him to that path, me and a few of my other friends but I mostly took notice in him and always tried the hardest. Not trying to toot my own horn or anything but I always go out of my way to make others feel good, that's just how I am. I feel happy when others are happy, and for me to accomplish this made me shed a hypothetical tear in my mind (if that even makes sense haha) 

Now this is where it becomes a bit more bleak. Recently he hasn't been talking/making plans with me as much like I said earlier on and it's kinda sad. The fact that I sort of made him who he is today, and for him to ditch me and chill with other friends is a bit disheartening. And I mean sure that's life, people will leave you once they've gotten what they need from you but I didn't expect it from him of all people. Especially since we kinda share the same mind. We enjoy the same hobbies, PlayStation, music, weed etc and the amount of times we've thought the same thing and said it out loud at the same time is more than I can count lol. His girlfriend would actually get jokingly jealous and say you guys should be in a relationship, because she could see how close we were.

To be honest I just feel confused and a tad hurt about the situation. This always happens with people. I lend them a hand and they're never there when I need one. It's getting to a point where I'm thinking there's no genuine people out there anymore, they're just there to use and abuse. 

So I dunno, I'd just really appreciate some advice and let me know what you guys think. I might also just be ranting but it's good to get it off my chest.

Sorry for the long post as well. Here's an imaginary potato :)

I went to Wawa to get lunch and after I finished eating there was a guy there with a dead battery, another guy trying to give him a jump, oblivious woman in her car then my car
They were parked in this order
Jumper car , dead battery car, oblivious car, my car.

So the cable wasn’t long enough because the batteries of the jumper and dead are on opposite sides of the engine compartments. 
I see this and I try to get this oblivious woman’s attention. I’m 6 feet 1 inch and 287lbs so it’s pretty hard to miss me. 


She’s on the phone completely oblivious to anything but her own business. Which normally is what you’re supposed to do. But shes in the way.  She’s taking up the spot where jumper guys car needs to be. but she’s still intently staring at her phone and jabbering into it. Then the owner of the car with a dead battery tries to get her attention as well. When that failed, I saw that dead battery car guy needed to move his car out of the way and I helped him push it. Then when she realizes that she’s in the way she starts saying I am so sorry to dead battery guy.  I feel so bad she feels like such an asshole. And I say to her, “Well it’s too late now” twice and she goes off on me. I’m the good Samaritan here, not her. she’s the asshole and she’s proving that she’s being an asshole by being rude. I told her “we tried to get your attention 3 times. but you were on your phone so I did not want to be rude to you and interrupt you because you were on your phone.”  I was a bit frustrated at her. Because I’m just here to help and she’s being nasty to me! So after I see that the 2 guys got the battery cables to connect I got the hell out of there because I felt threatened and uncomfortable.  No good deed goes unpunished.

762,"I have something that has been bothering me for 3 years now. Literally daily. 

I grew up catholic and was taught no sex until marriage which I was planning to adhere to. I held my virginity like a badge of honour ( cringe I know ). 
I did everything else except sex with a few guys because I was so scared that no one would marry me if I lost my actual virginity ( literally what I was taught ) 
Fast forward to age 24 I began properly dating and I got my first official boyfriend who I literally fell head  over heels for. Wanting to keep him happy I didn’t tell him I wanted to wait for marriage but I said that I wanted to wait till I was ‘ ready ‘ and we experimented in lots of other sexual activities. i started to think that maybe I would wait till I’m engaged and not married. 

5 months into our relationship we got drunk, very drunk. Nothing particularly new with us. I remember us kissing and me telling him to get a condom him asking if I were sure and me saying yes. next thing you know I lost my virginity. I wasn’t drunk to the point where I was slurring I just was very very happy and giggly.  I know that in the relationship I was like a giddy teenager despite being 24. I wanted to please him just so that he stays with me. 
I didn’t regret it as much till we broke up a few months later and it has bothered me ever since. The question of whether or not I would have done it had I been sober bothers me so much that sometimes it brings me to tears. I know that I can be a wild drunk but I’ve always said no to other guys I’d been around when drunk. Was my consent invalid? Not saying I was raped but it haunts me so much that it may not have been.

763,"I've been unemployed as an IT Consultant specializing in Oracle HCM Data Conversion for the past six months. Right now, I'm driving for Uber and Lyft as much as I can while trying to apply for similar jobs, but it's gone nowhere. Reviewing my expenses, I have cut as much as I can and formed a budget to the best of my abilities, but I'm rapidly running out of time and resources to keep myself at my current standard of living.

&amp;#x200B;

To put it frankly, driving for Uber does not cover the mortgage and other necessary expenses that I need to address. I've already applied for unemployment, and trying to apply for jobs through them, but again, no traction as of yet. At this stage, this is the option I'm facing right now, and I'm hoping that someone within the community here will be able to help with some guidance or suggestions as I'm trying to keep things going, but it's going to be extremely difficult in the next few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Given all the facts in front of me, I'll need to put my house up for sale so I no longer have to pay a mortgage, and in all likelihood, move back in with my mother and brother in Las Vegas, I'm currently in Denver, CO, and try to restart myself in Las Vegas. I have a BA in Digital Media with minors in Math and IS, which basically amounts to telling people that I have a student loan to pay off, which I'm already getting forbearance on so I can reduce that expense. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is stopping me, and it's obvious now, is that I don't want to look like a failure to my family and friends, and I know they wouldn't look at it that way, but that's how I would view. My pride is essentially stopping me from doing what is necessary, as well as concern with my roommate, but that doesn't really matter at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a four bedroom, three bathroom house. Obviously, I can rent out the spare room, and move my 'office' items into my master room so I can rent out the smaller office space, and the two would share a bathroom. While that would help in the short term with the mortgage, I'd still be facing an uphill battle trying to get out of my credit card debt which is another issue I've had to get under control. Of course, I could always try to sell certain items I have, like a Nikon d7100 camera body and lenses, but I know that I wouldn't get much for them.

My friend and former co-worker has been trying to help with my resume to apply for other types of jobs with relevant skills that I possess, but again, it's been slim pickings for the past few weeks.

To that end, here's my question to the community, and while I don't expect miracle responses in the next few minutes, I'm just hoping that I can get a little guidance on what I can do to help correct the situation or help stabilize it.

&amp;#x200B;

What, if anything, could a possible do to help my current financial situation so that I can continue to be independent and responsible for myself?

769,"Still cannot believe it is happening. Best relationship ever. I will move on, just need to figure out how to end it.

TL;DR

Found my girlfriend has cheated on me (or at least attempted to). I will be breaking up with her.

1. Should I let her know that I found out by snooping on her phone or just keep quiet regarding how?
2. Should I dump her before or after Xmas/New Years?
3. Should I transition the relationship into a FWB situation?

My girlfriend and I are in our early 40s and we started dating in May. Met on Tinder. She is easily the best person I have ever went out with. It took my decades to realize who am I and what I like and she fits the bill. Extremely outgoing and incredible sex.

I have never been the jealous type, but she made me because she has commented about her views on casual sex. I discovered her phone password last week and attempted to find any evidence. Nothing on messaging, WhatsApp, or Facebook. No chatting on Bumble since April. She deleted the Tinder ap. I called her out for being on it since I kept on seeing her distance changing from home to work.

Her job can get extremely hectic and difficult. She was working on a project, 10-12 hour days, 7 days a week, for weeks. She did not want to see me at this time because she wanted to focus on her work/career. I believe her, do not think she was not cheating on me then. She wants a promotion. She finally finished this one massive project a month and a half ago around 9pm at night. Finally get to see her! We spoke briefly on the phone, on congratulated her and told her to relax and decompress and we will finally see each other the next day. We did and finally some great sex.

Last night I decided to check Instagram and there it was. On the day she finished that project, she sent a bootie call to some guy at 10:30pm. He was on a date and asked her to postpone until tomorrow. She kept on telling him to come over. He never did and they never did meet up. What really annoys me is that she put me on hold for weeks and he gets the random bootie call? We actually bumped into him and his girlfriend a couple of weeks ago randomly. I never met him before. I have a suspicion they hooked up back in the summer while I was gone for a few weeks. I was already suspicious about something at that time. Maybe not him, but someone (I have partial evidence).

I really want to end the relationship now. We have an office holiday party this week and my birthday next week, so I will hold off until then since those will be really great sex encounters. We are supposed to go to her family for Xmas since she is from two hours away and I have no family close by. Her family are really excited to meet me. I met her mother on Thanksgiving and she really liked me.

If I dump her before Xmas, she will be extremely embarrassed with her family, and I will have some stupid revenge. Yes, I am petty. However, I will have no friends or family during Xmas if I end it, and will be by myself since everyone I know will be out of town. She also promised to go on some mini vacation together in between Xmas and New Years. We get along really well and it will be a really fun time. We really click, but she is the cheating type (the quick one off).

Back to my questions:

1. Should I let her know that I found out by snooping on her phone or just keep quiet regarding how?
2. Should I dump her before or after Xmas?
3. Should I transition the relationship into a FWB situation?

For the last question, I think she might be into it. We can probably get into some kinkier stuff, stuff I would not do with my significant other (sharing).

771,"My boyfriend of 11 months recently started using whitening strips because he was sensitive about some coffee stains that recently appeared on his front teeth. I barely noticed them, but they embarrassed him quite a bit, so he started using the strips which require him to leave them in his mouth over his teeth for two hours.

When he first started using them, he absolutely refused to do anything social, even have close friends over, while they were in his mouth. The only person he would let see him with them in was me, and then only if I didn't look directly at him while we were talking. He says they embarrass him as well because they make him drool and he either has to spit or swallow it which he thinks is disgusting. He thinks they look goofy inside his mouth and doesn't want anybody to see him with them in. They also give him a lispy-sounding voice when he tries to talk, which he finds upsetting as well.

You're only supposed to use them once a day, which he has been for the past two weeks, so it hasn't been much of an issue. His teeth became noticeably whiter and brighter, so I thought at least they're working. In the past few days, though, it seems like he's using them more than once per day, and often just before we're about to do something he doesn't really want to do.

For example, I know he was wearing them last Wednesday morning just after he woke up because I saw them in his mouth. But later that evening when I suggested we hang out with some of my friends who I know he's not particularly fond of, he suddenly had them in his mouth and said he wouldn't be available until they were ready to come out. When I asked how long that would be, he said he put them in just 10 minutes ago so it would be almost two hours. But I had been talking to him a few minutes before and I didn't see them in his mouth. At the suggestion of hanging out with people he didn't like, he popped into the bathroom and came out later like he'd had the whitening strips in the whole time, then used them as an excuse not to go out. I rolled my eyes and let it go. We ended up staying in that evening.

Then a few days ago, when I suggested that we should go to the laundromat to wash our clothes, something he hates, he all of a sudden had whitening strips in his mouth again, saying that he needed to wait until he could take them out before he could do anything. You don't even have to talk to anyone at the laundromat, and it's not like anyone there would notice he had them in, but he still refused to go.

Now, he sits around all day, playing video games and never doing anything he doesn't want or socializing at all. I've noticed that he carries whitening strips in his pocket with him at all times, and his teeth are really, really, really white, like crazy white, like too white like there's something wrong with them. What should I do?

TL;DR Boyfriend started using whitening strips and now they're his excuse not to do anything he doesn't want to do.",11Dec2019,1

773,"Feeling like everyone hates me

Hey I (m17) have been feeling like my friends hate me.The feeling is worse now that I’m on my period but I still feel this when I’m not.For about 5 months now I’ve started to feel like all my friends hate me and hate to be around me.I have no idea why I keep feeling like this.I think it all stemmed from when a couple of my friends started going out without me (not the whole group out without me but people just going out with only a few of the members of our group).Even when I am out with them I subconsciously think they don’t want to be around me and want me out the group.I get really paranoid that they talk bad about me when I’m not around also.

I didn’t think much of it but now for these last few months it’s getting to me .I am in college right now and I have exams in about 5 months.I will add that I have been smoking weed for just up to a year now but I don’t smoke regularly(may smoke 5 times a month then go cold turkey for a month then smoke 5 times again ,also have done mdma a couple of times).I highly doubt it’s the drugs that are making me feel like this because I’ve not been doing them for long and not often (or am I just brainwashed lol).Do I have anxiety,is it just be being a teenager,I have no idea.If anyone could give me advice on what to do,if this is normal,that causes ect that would be great.I wouldn’t say I hate myself at all (going on what people online say the reasons my be) so I don’t think that’s the reason (maybe subconsciously idk)But anyway pls may I have some advice :)",11Dec2019,1
774,"I just blocked my friends phone number because she refused to drop an argument. I feel very bad but I don’t know what to do. I used the word natural during a conversation and she refused to drop it telling me I was wrong because nothing is natural because unnatural things are part of nature because they are made by humans, I sent her a screenshot of the first definition to come up for natural which includes “as opposed to man made”. I said can we please change the topic? Can we please talk about something else? You went to the dentist today, how was that? But she kept bringing it back to that. She was very calm the whole time but I wasn’t. I was furious and she said I’m furious because I don’t like being disagreed with and need to learn to accept other people can disagree but I was the one saying let’s agree to disagree. I kept telling her I worry our friendship is on the rocks because we argue so much and I love her and want it to work. Eventually after an hour of talking about the definition of the word natural, well really just her talking at me while I try to change the subject I said if you say one more thing about definitions I’m blocking your number for at least a few days. She kept going and I told her I’m taking time to think of how to fix our relationship. She said she didn’t do anything wrong because she was polite the whole time she refused to drop it but I can’t seem to explain to her that that isn’t the only thing that matters. I kept telling her please stop, you’re making me very uncomfortable, I’m worried about our friendship. She has autism but I feel i can’t possibly be anymore clear than i was. We’ve also argued over wether my missing meds for a day can give me headaches(she said it can’t because a different class of drugs takes two weeks to have any effect), she said coffee can’t spike my anxiety because it isn’t one of the listed effects, she’s corrected my pronunciation of a word to a different way and when I said it her way 10 minutes later she corrected me back to how I originally said it. I feel like she disagrees simply to disagree and she loves arguing, finding every minute excuse to turn things into her correcting me. She does it calmly, I get angry and she acts like I just need to accept her opinion. She has corrected my use of a word so many times but when I googled it it was always the most popular definition, she still said I was wrong. She’s the type of person who’d chuckle at you for saying the sky is blue and say actually nothing has any color, it reflects specific parts of light off of it. 

I love spending time with her when we are arguing, we’re very open about our secrets and we are both outcasts which causes some sort of kinship but i don’t know how to move on. I argue with her a lot. I told her no more conversations about ethics, politics or definitions. I just want to talk about the people we know, TV and silly nonsense. I actually love talking about philosophy and politics most of the time, I talk about that stuff with my partner or with a lot of other people and it’s not like I usually argue about it. We converse to someone changes their mind or we’ve run through our points and then we move on. My partner disagrees with me heavily on politics, more than I disagree with my friend and yet only the conversations with my friend turn to arguments",11Dec2019,1
775,"I feel so silly. 

So it was just an ordinary day. My crush texted me and we were talking. The conversation then naturally transitioned to her parents being very selective about who she dates. She then told of a situation with one of her parents and her sibling's partner. 

I said ""Jeez lol, ~~well I think I'll be fine~~""

Then i changed the subject and she responded to that and said that she has to go but that she'll text me later. 

I said sounds good. 

On the bright side, I'm glad I was brave enough to say something and I tried to be playful and flirty, but it didn't work out. 

I also think rejection isn't that difficult at all! When I saw her response, I shrugged and went on about my day. 

I think it's probably best to maintain a solid friendship and focus on that. Any tips on meeting other potential lovers? What can be learned from this situation?",11Dec2019,1

777,"Let me start by saying, I know this is a first-world problem, boo-hoo. But we spent years saving up to build our home, and worked incredibly hard for it. Hundreds of hours of research was put into the planning and design of our home. After looking at many builders, we finally selected a semi-custom builder and our home was completed and we have been living it in for a little over a year. 

Fast forward to three months ago, a new home one door down started going up that was starting to look very similar to ours. Our house is pretty unique to the neighborhood, a lot of blues and browns, and we have a stark white house. I know white houses are very popular right now, but not so much so to the area we live in. 

Long story short, their house is getting close to being completed and it looks like they took a picture of ours and asked their builder to do the same for them. Same color of white, white painted brick, same modern door and same color, cedar beams like ours, same exterior lights (which are pretty unique), same black frame windows, same black gutters, even almost identical decisions on where to put siding and board and batten. 

We don't have an HOA in the neighborhood, which is the reason I'm guessing they were able to get away with doing this. We have been told that this could affect the future resale of both of our homes. Anyone know if this is true? I know I need to just go have a conversation with them about it, but I would love to know if there are typically any protections on something like this. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm just sad about the whole thing.",11Dec2019,1
778,"My housemate just moved in 5 months ago, and she seemed fine. She said a few weird things from time to time, but she comes from a very posh background so I just put it down to being sheltered. 

However, in the last few months, she has become unbearable, she took over many drawers in the kitchen because she is vegan and didn't want to share space with us. Fine, I guess, I wish she would have said before she moved in though. 

She is extremely rude and immature, she is very selfish, negative and can't seem to see things from anyone else's point of view. She is very spikey and defensive about almost everything, from celebrities to paying the electricity. Everything is a problem. She cannot do anything for herself and often treats me as though I am her parent. If you bring up any problems with her she gets extremely defensive and saying things like, ""Oh I can't do anything right"" or ""Ok I won't bother next time"", even if I'm very gentle with her which I find quite manipulative because it means I have to stop what I'm saying or I have to power through and the whole thing becomes very messy and childish quite quickly.

I am aware she's had anorexia for most or all of her teen years, and I am wondering if she's in some kind of arrested development from this, or if she's just a brat.

779,"I’m in my senior year of college, about to graduate in the spring, and I feel like I’ve lost all hope. 

I’m a religious studies major. Curious about people’s faith and why we have a natural tendency to believe in the divine. 

I have no clue/plan of what I should do after graduation.

I work at a church as a youth minister for about 10 kids, but my agnostic views do not belong in this setting. I simply wanted to be of help, and counsel these kids during this stage of their life. I had guidance during my youth group years and I felt it helped me, but since then I have lost faith in myself.

I feel like I put on this fake positive face to get by. 

I’ve fallen out of love with my girlfriend, which has sent me through a plethora of emotions. I care for her so deeply. We are each others first love, we both took each other’s virginity, and we both shared our first kiss. I’ve tried to end it a couple of times, but I see how badly I hurt her. I love her. Just not in the way i should after 3 years. I want her to be happy, but i feel so selfish for keeping her, strapped in. I’m terrified of being alone, and perhaps this is why I can’t let her go, but I know she deserves better. We share the same birthday to the year, which adds to our cosmic connection. We come from very different backgrounds, and are different people, but we both are introverts and struggle to make new social connections. On paper, we seem to be a good fit; however, she constantly needs lots of attention, and I’m not good at giving her what she needs. I’m constantly distracted with my own issues and failures, that I never think of her first. Am I doing her a disservice, for feeding this relationship? I love her in a way that I would love anyone close to me, but I can’t keep living a lie.

After graduation, she plans either to move back to her parents place, or to go back to school for paralegal study. My only option is to make a new long distance relationship with her, or move with her to a new city where she can study, and I can continue to be clueless. 

The universe may be telling me something here...

To continue..

My parents recently had a huge fight, leaving my mother and sister (17) no choice but to move out. It seems like things are moving towards, what I thought to be unthinkable, divorce. They are in counseling, but it doesn’t seem my mother is convinced of the progress. 

I feels like everything that I knew to be “structured” is falling apart.

I smoke pot a lot. The only thing I really enjoy now. I used to enjoy playing video games, but now I’ve lost motivation. 

I’m overweight. Since at college, I must have gained 100 + pounds. I struggle to see the point in exercising and dieting, and I constantly stress feed. Constantly hear feedback from my friends and family that I need to exercise more. But I cant see the point...

We all will die right? 

Why must I live a healthy life in hope of a couple more years added on to my earthly ticket? Cancer can take any soul, healthy or not. 

I’ve lost touch with my closest friends in my friend group. But they haven’t with each other. Another pillar of my life has been eroding away. I’m being left behind. 

I can’t express how I feel. I’ve been told counseling will help me, but I know that If I really express these feelings aloud, it might destroy me more than help me. 

I write all this with tears in my eyes.
I struggle to find meaning in this world.
I recognize that I probably need help.
What can I do to change this? What is there to do? I have no hope for a future. I care too much about my girlfriend’s feelings and my own sanity to break up with her. I no longer feel support from my friends or family.

He made a friend with a girl, let's call her Mia, and bought her into our friend circle and I am happy with it and everything, but Mia likes Anna a lot and just goes everywhere with her and they do everything together. She will ignore me if Anna is there and just hugs her whenever she makes a joke and in general treats her like her most favourite person and like I don't even exist. One example is when Anna and I went to do art. Mia bought a chair for Anna and took her own chair and sat next to her without even thinking about me. I might be selfish or something but she does this everytime. She ignores me and does everything she possibly can for Anna, like her own personal servant except Anna doesn't want that. They have their own inside jokes and occasionally she talks to me if Anna isn't there or I made a really funny joke that Anna liked. Even though Anna does try her hardest to include me in everything that they do, Mia is not very welcoming and I want to become close to her, but now I feel like a third wheel and it is not a nice feeling. Every time I see Mia, I just know that the whole time that we spend with her, I am just going to be the 'other person' just trailing along with them. 

I have talked to Anna about how I feel about Mia not really like me and she said that it is just me (I have anxiety that no one likes me) and that she is just an introvert and very closed.

I also don't want to confront her because she hasn't shown any signs of hatred but she doesn't include me in things and most of the times just doesn't acknowledge my existence.

790,"Hi Everyone,

I don't normally post but I need some advice on a situation I am going back and forth about. My lease expires in a month, and our rent is going up by about $75, to $1650. I informed my roommate of this and a couple days later she told me she doesn't think she can renew our lease, as she's nervous she can't afford her half ($825) of the rent. She would try to find another place or live with her dad or a friend if she had to. 

My boyfriend of 7 months quickly offered for me to move in with him, and split his rent, which is only $750, so I'd only have to pay about $375 a month.. We talked about this for a couple days as I was initially hesitant since it seems like a big step to rush into. We have been planning to move in together recently, but not until next year when my renewed lease is up. After a couple days of talking it through, we thought we should take the chance and just go for it because I wouldn't even be bound to any lease with him, his landlord told me I could just split the rent and that's it. We go back and forth between our apartments, so we see each other everyday after we both get out of work at five and wake up with each other and get ready for work together each morning. We see each other all weekend as well, make meals together, etc.  With this, we figured that even though living together would bring it's own challenges to the surface, we have kind of been practicing it ever since we began dating seriously. Plus, we would both save SO MUCH that we could plan our future together and eventually put a down payment on a house. 

Yesterday, however, my roommate came and told me that this is her home and she doesn't want to leave it. She wants to stay and try to make ends meet by getting a new job. I believe she can do it, I'm just nervous about signing a lease with someone who isn't 100% in it. One one hand I don't want to ditch her and make her find a new living situation so fast, and I don't want to move in with my boyfriend so quick in case it's bad for us.. But on the other hand, I feel like it would give me a great jump to my savings, so that I can feel more secure financially.

800,"I'm a Web Developer, recently graduated from college and now I'm doing a Masters program. I've always been used to under-selling myself when it comes to jobs because I don't really see my full potential and thus I don't have a solid estimate of my self-worth.

Anyways, I have a friend who also graduated with me in May 2019, same major (Computer Science). We're both good friends and he does favors for me, and in return I help him out with his towing business by setting it up on Google Businesses so when people search it up his towing company will appear, as well as building a website from scratch.

The original plan was he'd pay me $100 a month to maintain the website. So basically I would make him a static website, he'd pay me $100 each month just to maintain it, add minor changes, etc. Which I thought was a good deal since it's not hard or time-consuming for me to make a website with only a front-end that provides information about his company.

Before he gave me the first $100, I had told him he did not need to pay me because I felt that since he's done a lot of favors for me (drove me to buy groceries, paid for food sometimes) I would re-pay him with the website, I saw no harm in doing this, plus the $100 was honestly nothing to me because I know websites built from scratch can range in the thousands. Because of that I decided to not ask for the payment each month and I'd finish the website for him.

However a few months later, I realized that there were more things that he'd need for the website, and it was WAY more than what we originally agreed on. We agreed on just a front-end app, but now there are more things we need, such as a back-end to handle forms, service requests, career applications, etc. I realized that yes, he did do me a few favors, but maybe I should've understood that a favor is something someone does out of their generosity and expects nothing in return. 

So now I actually do need money, and the website he needs requires a lot more time to work on, before I kind of half-assed the job because I was just caught up with so much stuff. But now there are things he needs help with, such as setting up his business on Google search, handling some advertisements, applications, a bunch of stuff. And I feel like since he's also paying his employees while also hiring, I feel like I'm entitled to some kind of compensation.

So now after all this, I realize in the future I should never under-sell my self-worth and be much more clear in the future, and also see things long-term instead of short-term.

If you agree with me that I should get some kind of compensation, how should I negotiate? What kind of amounts do you think I should ask for? He is a good friend of mine, so I'm not going to ask him for like $10,000 for the website, his company is still small and growing so I want to help him out as much as I can. But he is hiring people for $800/week for his towing business, and I'm not planning on asking him for that much. The most I would ask is something like $500 for the whole website, and maybe $50 a month or so to maintain it.

801," Okay, so as background, my friend, let's call her Anna, is a very close friend of mine and she is very nice and talks to everyone who sits next to her in classes and becomes good friends with them. He made a friend with a girl, let's call her Mia, and bought her into our friend circle and I am happy with it and everything, but Mia likes Anna a lot and just goes everywhere with her and they do everything together. She will ignore me if Anna is there and just hugs her whenever she makes a joke and in general treats her like her most favourite person and like I don't even exist. One example is when Anna and I went to do art. Mia bought a chair for Anna and took her own chair and sat next to her without even thinking about me. I might be selfish or something but she does this everytime. She ignores me and does everything she possibly can for Anna, like her own personal servant except Anna doesn't want that. They have their own inside jokes and occasionally she talks to me if Anna isn't there or I made a really funny joke that Anna liked. Even though Anna does try her hardest to include me in everything that they do, Mia is not very welcoming and I want to become close to her, but now I feel like a third wheel and it is not a nice feeling. Every time I see Mia, I just know that the whole time that we spend with her, I am just going to be the 'other person' just trailing along with them.

I have talked to Anna about how I feel about Mia not really like me and she said that it is just me (I have anxiety that no one likes me) and that she is just an introvert and very closed. I want to believe her but judging on Mia's behaviour, it doesn't seem that way. I also don't want to confront her because she hasn't shown any signs of hatred but she doesn't include me in things and most of the times just doesn't acknowledge my existence.

TL;DR I feel like the third wheel in our friendship because Mia ignores me apart from the rare times she talks with me and treats Anna like a princess/queen. So I just needed advice on what my steps could be in order to become friends with her and actually feeling like a part of the group.",11Dec2019,1

807,"I love my husband. I know he loves and cares for me. He emotionally cheated on me during a dark time in his life because of depression and severe work stress. We were going through a rough patch, I struggled with my own issues (alcoholism, depression, g.a.d, anxiety attacks), and we were physically apart and struggled emotionally to connect for months at a time. He chose a poor means of coping with his emotional distress, but he made his decision and there is no way either of us can change the past. He has since deleted all his messaging apps, apologized, admitted he was in the wrong, and shown remorse, as well as made the efforts to become a better husband by devoting all his free time and energy into our relationship.

That being said, I have such a hard time not thinking of what he did every time I look at him.

808,"So while my wife was single she dated a guy we will call Tom. She liked him but they eventually broke up. Some time passed and  one of Toms best friends (we’ll call him Sean) kind of swooped in and started to ask her out and hit on her. My wife was a bartender so he would just go into her bar. I don’t know why she thought it was a good idea but she started hanging out with him. Seemed like it was just for fun. Then she had feelings for him. But Sean never wanted Tom to find out. Eventually my wife was having a birthday party at a bar with friend and both Tom and Sean showed up and the whole truth came out. Sean broke it off with my wife. And Tom was pretty pissed at Sean but they remained friends. My wife stayed in friendly contact with Tom until I met her but never liked Sean even though I think both her and Sean were kind of scummy to do that to Tom. Fast forward a few years. My wife and I are at a bar. She sees Tom and introduces me and we make small talk then go back to our seats. Then my wife says she’ll be right back and goes back over to Tom to talk to him again for a good 10 minutes while I’m at the bar. Which bugged me and I still have no idea what they talked about. And whenever we always have blowout fights she always mentions Tom as the guy that should make me jealous. Fast forward a couple years. My wife tells me Tom keeps looking at her LinkedIn. It is what it is. So now, today, my wife’s old boss is trying to recruit her to a new company. This new company is where Sean works. Who is still friends with Tom. So she’s bound to see Sean who is bound to tell Tom (who would find out anyway by creepily checking her linkedin.) My gut is saying no way. But obviously I want to hear her reasons for wanting to work there. I know the salary is much much better. Right now she works from home and doesn’t have to travel which is great with having a toddler. The new job would be in office and I’m guessing there would be traveling here and there.

811,"So 3 weeks ago I got a birthday card for my best friend. I also put $100 in the card. I wrote out the mailing address properly and exactly what it said on the information he provided to me (He is in college right now). And I even attached the return address in the left corner if something went wrong. And I put one postage stamp in the right corner. I walked to the nearest mailbox. Put the card inside. And then left. I was thinking he would receive the card in 4 to 5 days. When it was 5 days, I messaged him telling him to check his mail to see if he got something from me. He checked, and there was no mail. A few days later I told him to check again. He checked, and still nothing. So then I told him what happened and he said that he would continue to check. And this went on for the next couple of weeks. And still he didn't receive my card. I have no idea what happened to the card. And I have no idea of how I can find it, or what I can do.

818,"The holidays are coming up and I know I’ll be seeing this friend (it’s really more of a friend of a friend situation. We don’t text or call each other, but we see each other at almost all social gatherings). This person is extremely self absorbed and she monopolizes basically every conversation. No matter whose around, or what the subject is, she will talk over you and talk incessantly. 

Before I really knew her I was “warned” about her and her talkativeness. I was told her partner had brought it up to her and that she had been made aware of this issue by multiple people. She’s mentioned it herself before in front of me that she tries to talk less, but she never does and at this point it’s clear she refuses, or can’t, change. 

Now, I’m polite...almost too polite. So I usually get stuck in conversations with her and by the end I feel like she completely drained my energy and ruined my night. To solve one of us getting stuck with her, my friends and I will sometimes cycle in and out of conversation with her so we can all have some freedom; however, I feel like I’m then not able to relax and enjoy the night with everyone as a group. 

At this point I’m dreading seeing her and being stuck in this situation around the holidays, but I don’t want to be too confrontational and ruin everyone’s time.

Ok, so I recently went on a date with a girl who I vibe super well with, we have so many interests in common, similar sense of humor and she’s extremely attractive. We decided to continue from where we left off next semester because we’re done semester 1 and we won’t see each other for a month. We’ve been talking every day since. 
When we were done with our date I felt like 10 million bucks walking back home. But now I’m just full of doubt and apprehension. I can’t stop thinking about everything that could possibly go wrong down the line. She’s really into me and keeps telling me how much she likes me, how happy I make her ect but all I can think about is how she’s probably going to find out something about me she doesn’t like and then leave me and then I’ll have wasted my time. Every bone in my body is screaming at me to sabotage this relationship before we get intimate, like I’ve done with other prior relationships. 
The thing is I’ve never felt so strongly about someone as I feel with her. I’m just so scared I’m going to fall short in her eyes and I don’t know if I can ever be vulnerable with someone. Can anyone please give me some advice as to how to get over my insecurity?",11Dec2019,1

So some backstory : This summer I ( 27M) dated a girl (25F) who had an abusive father , the guy was a POS but she still loves him. She told me she had a temper. I swear to god this girl hated men , told me numerous time that all men were pigs and cheated on their girl, but that she tought I was different . She sold everything she had to move with me a month into the relationship. She told me she'd never trust me whatever I do. She later accused me of cheating and talking to other girls . That whole nighmare lasted about 3 months when she wanted kids right then and there. I finally gave up and told her to get help.

Fast foward to about 2 months ago I met this girl online ( 19F ) , superb , sweet and shy and a month into our relationship she told me her step-father was violent. She understands the man is a POS and she knows not all men are like that. She's determined to not let that affect our relationship and she tod me she's just letting it go .

I don’t normally wear skirts but I did last night and half way through he kept pulling my skirt down bc it would ride up and show my thighs in the position I was sitting. I kept pulling it back to where it was to mess with him and he kept pulling it back to my knee. 

Halfway through the night I get a text from my other coworker B(19,m) asking what I was doing after the party and I said I wasn’t doing anything. He asked me if I was dtf and I was. So after the party he tells me to meet him next to the hotel. On the way there A asks me where I was going and I admitted I was going to go hookup with someone. He wanted to know who and didn’t believe me I hook up with people. I told him he didn’t need to believe me and I left the party. B showed up like fifteen minutes later and we went on our way. 

Like halfway to where we were going I got a text from A that said something like “I’m kind of drunk right now and I’m going to regret this and may sound creepy but fucking turn 18 already” needless to say, I was floored. I had a crush on A a long time ago but decided to focus on being friends instead bc he never seemed interested in me like that. I didn’t know how to respond so I just said it wasn’t creepy and he was fine. He texted me saying he was drunk but I was kinda busy having sex with B (i didn’t come if that matters). After I got dropped off home I texted A again just make sure he was okay. He was drinking whiteclaws with his friends and I jokingly said he should bring me one. He said it was worth the walk and he’d be there before 2am. He got to my house so I snuck out and got the whiteclaw (mango) and then he kissed me. I kissed him back and we end up against the wall. He then proceeded to give me his jacket (it was 40 out and I was in shorts and a light tank top). We ended just hugging for a while with his stroking my side where my shirt lifted up. I had to go back inside before my mom woke up again so I wished him goodnight. He said “wait.” And then kissed me again and I went inside and we texted until I fell asleep. 

Idk what to do there are two boys interested in me and I’ve made out with two of my coworkers at this point. I’m not really sure if A likes me or just wants to get in my pants and I know B just wanted to get in my pants (and succeeded). I feel kind of like a whore rn. Should I let both of them go?

I got off the phone with a repo guy and he thinks there's a decent chance he can get it back. He's going by tonight to look. The thing is these people also have a bunch of parts I gave them, some of which are hard to come by or I spent a lot of time rebuilding (car is a restoration project). They also have a $1,000 deposit. If I can get in touch with them and convince them to give me the car back I might get those things back too. The owner is in jail for a large criminal conspiracy case and it's possible the guy running it might work differently. 

So the question is, if the repo guy goes by and says he can get the car tonight, do I pull the trigger? It'll be a $5,000 loss and 50 hours of work. Some of the parts will take a long time to find. But the car is my baby.",11Dec2019,1

832,"  There are a lot of musicians out there that make amazing music. I was searching through soundcloud, and it startles me, to hear such good music... and to see that these people have very few plays on the song. In some cases I was the FIRST to listen to it! There are so many promotion companies trying to actually make money off of these people! **They approach these artists with promises of people hearing their music!** There is so much good music out there that the market has become saturated. Companies have realized that there is a lot of money to be made from these artists that want to be heard.

My goal is to create a community of people, that actually listen to each others music. Sure there is [r/ThisIsOurMusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic/) but check it out! There are so many posts with not a single comment or upvote. And the same reality is true for [r/soundcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/soundcloud/). People who promote themselves do just that! Then they leave! They have little/no interest in listening to other peoples music! If we could change that, we could make a powerful statement. **If self promoters acted as listeners as well, we would all listen to each others music**, instead of listening to the music someone paid a company to TELL us to listen to...

I created [r/IndieMusicFeedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/) for this purpose!

To put it simply, IMF is a community for musicians to give each other feedback! There is a 3 comment requirement before people are allowed to post their own music. **With the 3 comment - 1 song system, they will be 3 times more likely to get feedback there!!**

Having the opportunity to have their music listened to by a real person, is so valuable today, that artists could pay a promo company 100's of dollars, and they still might not have a real person listen. Just bots and fake comments! IMF on the other hand, provides real listeners, and all they have to do is give 3 other people their time!

&amp;#x200B;

Since creating the page, I have spent countless hours listening to music that is being promoted there. Well over 1,800 of them. Whenever I run into a song that blows me away, I am sure to add it to a playlist! I'd love to share the music that I have found with everyone here!

837,"My friend introduced her to our friend group 1 year ago. They started dating a few weeks later. She lives in a different state so she never met us irl. We are all adults.

The 3 of us have played video games together nearly every day.

My friend has always been rude to people and treats them like trash. He insults me, her, random people online. He also has a habit of making everyone uncomfortable by saying really creepy jokes to us.

I decided i needed a break from it a few weeks ago so i stopped talking to him for a while.

A couple days after that, she reached out to me asking to play some video games. Her and I started playing together and he sent her a bunch of messages telling her off because he was jealous.

She was also venting to me about him. She told me that she could probably stop talking to him right then since they haven't talked all that much recently anyway. She changed the subject after though.

A few days ago we were up until 4am just talking. She was telling me that she know he is toxic and that she is trying to ""steer"" him in the right direction because he is sweet sometimes.

I also told her that i have noticed him being very rude to her and i try to avoid saying anything that will make things worse because its not my place. She pretty much told me that if he is being rude to her, i don't have to stay quiet and can say something if i want. She also said she would appreciate it.

She also said that she is glad i actually laugh at her jokes unlike him.

She then apologized for ranting and said that she only does that around people she comfortable with so i did feel glad that she sees me as a friend.

She has messaged me a lot just venting about him. It doesn't bother me or anything like that.

However, i think recently i am starting to develop feelings for her.

Part of me thinks she might feel the same but i am not going to ask just in case. There are also things that tell me she isn't.

Mainly that she is still trying with him so she obviously likes him. Also, she told me a couple nights ago that he was accusing her of having feelings for me and i feel like if she did, she wouldn't have said that.

She still asks me for advice on what gifts he might like.

Idk. I feel so lost. I feel like a scumbag for liking her because i did try giving my friend another chance after he apologized and said he would stop being like that. He was fine for a few days but he is starting to go back to how he always was so i am getting ready to just stop being his friend.

What do i do? Does it seem like she feels the same or am i completely reading this wrong and she only sees me as a friend?",11Dec2019,1
838,"My friend, let's call her Anna, is the definition of clingy.

I can go for days without texting with my other friends, it just means that we don't have anything particularly noteworthy to talk about, but if I go a single day without texting Anna, she gets mad and says that I'm ignoring her.

She texts me literally 24/7, and more often than not completely random things like ""I ordered sushi"" or ""my parents had a fight"".

She wants to hang out every weekend, and sometimes I just don't want to and sometimes I have my own plans, but she won't take no for an answer and will pester me about it.

Me and her went through hell and back together...she was their for me during my hardest time. I'm gay and she was the only person who knew until I finally came out of the closet..well when I was 17, I meet a who had 2 kids. I feel in love with him and his kids very quickly...once he found out that I had a friend who I smoked weed with. He gave me a decision to make becuase he was really against weed at the time. He told me that if i continued hanging out with her and smoking weed then I could not be apart of his and his children's life. I asked my friend if she could stop being high and smoking weed around me..she said she would try but never did. I then decided that it would be best if I stopped being friends with her. 6 years later, I miss her soo much..she was my BEST friend..I've tried to reconnect with her a year ago but she seemed upset with me still..which is understandable, I was all she had and I left her.

844,"So I'm 23 years old and didn't end up going to college until 21 making this my 3rd year at my local community college. I've switched my major quite a few times  (IT --&gt; Computer Science --&gt; Nursing/Medical --&gt; General Studies) but have only been taking 2-3 classes a semester part-time.  If I stay on the pace I'm going I won't be graduating until minimum my 4th year, probably my 5th. I also have been living at home working part-time a grocery store when I'm not at school (about 30 hours a week).

Financial aid is currently covering everything so I don't have to worry about being in debt but I do realize that I'll have to transfer to a university to finish a bachelor's degree (I'll be upper-twenties by this point). And I am still undecided to this day on what I want to spend my life doing. 

Part of me wanted to learn computer stuff because it's a hobby of mine but I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend my life on it so I switched to the nursing/medical field to feel like I was making a difference. But after a short while I realized that I don't truly have the passion for the field most people do so I switched again to General Studies and have been taking core classes like English 112 and World History instead. This will obviously lead nowhere but I figured I can use it to transfer and boost me to a bachelor's at a university and eventually figure out what I want to do. 

But now, here I am....middle of my 3rd year for my associate's and feel like I'm at my lowest point. I hate the days I go to school. I have no friends and no true goal. I'm not even that smart, I average B's and C's (with 1 or 2 A's). I do NOT want to go into debt if I don't even know what I'm doing so eventually transferring to a university scares me. 

The one thing I'm considering is switching back to Information Technology for an Associate's and getting 1 of 2 certificates with it but idk if that's good enough for a career or if I'll even like sticking with it my whole life. I could continue onward with General Studies but I'm realizing I have no plan so that's probably not a good idea.

Or I can take a semester off/drop out but everyone I know would be so disappointed in me. They know I've been going to college and it would be hard to tell them. 

Although I don't hate my grocery store job....it's definitely not high-paying or fun. I mostly just like my co-workers and deal with the job like everyone else for a small paycheck. 

Anyways, sorry for the long rant. My hobbies are video games, reading stories, Netflix/YouTube, and listening to music. None of these are really good for a career but they're what I enjoy.

 I'm starting to feel like a little bit of a loser at my age for still living at home (although I pay bills) and being so incredibly undecided. Give me some advice.",11Dec2019,1

I'm an undergraduate student born in Europe and I'm a freshman at MIT! I come from one of the poorest countries in Europe and it's a great honour to be part of this amazing school. I also won a scholarship so I'm not struggling financially in general, my parents are pretty poor, but so far I've managed to take care of myself.  


I was initially supposed to fly back to Bulgaria yesterday. A flight from Boston to Istanbul and then a flight from Istanbul to Sofia. Unfortunately, I got my flight cancelled and I had to pick the next possible date for me, which is next Tuesday. But the new flight costs 450$ more than the cancelled one. Anyway, I managed to pay for my flight, but right now all I'm left with... are 17 cents. All of my friends already left to their hometowns and there is nobody in-campus that could help me out. As mentioned before, my parents are poor and they did their real best to make sure I'm comfortable here and I simply can't demand anything from them. I literally got no food and 6 days ahead of me. I've created this thread with the request to get a couple of dollars in order to buy some food and buy my family small gifts from Boston. I'll pay you back at the very first possible moment, I'm just going through a very hard situation right now. DM or comment if you're willing to help and I'll provide more details.

848,"A bit of background before I begin: my ex has a history of psychosis due to schizophrenia, I'm not using a cliche ""psychotic ex"" here. He is professionally diagnosed and supposedly medicated but has a history of non-compliance and abusive psychotic behaviour.

We have two children together. The oldest is 22 months old and the youngest is two days old. At the time of writing I am still in hospital after an emergency C-section due to both myself and the baby being medically at risk during labour.

For 22 months I have actively encouraged a relationship between my ex and our firstborn despite having to leave in the middle of the night with the baby when he was 7 weeks old, after my ex pinned me to the ground and physically assaulted me. We continued the relationship in separate homes until a few months ago when I finally said enough is enough after yet another abusive incident.

In those 22 months I have repeatedly tried to organise visits for him to see his son at his Mum's house so that there is another adult present. He has repeatedly negotiated dates and times and then cancelled because he is ""not up to it today"". I have also offered visits on the fly that he has repeatedly refused. At no point have I said ""no can do"" unless there is a prior arrangement (playgroup, pre-arranged visits with grandparents, etc).

That's the background we're working with.

#The Advice request

When I went into labour with son #2 I advised ex that labour had begun. I kept him updated and promised to let him know when the baby arrived.

Unfortunately we suddenly went downhill medically and were rushed into surgery. After the surgery it was chaos. I rang ex's Mum to let her know that baby was born healthy and ask her to let ex know I would ring when things were quiet and I could talk to him properly.

I thought all was well. I video called him a few hours later so he could see the baby but he cut it short on the grounds that he had a situation to deal with. Okay, I asked if he'd like some photos. He declined. I offered for him to come to the hospital and meet his son. He refused, stating he was busy. His choice.

Last night, however, he started accusing me of excluding him, he threatened to take me to court to ""invoke his parental rights"", he told me he was going to document all my denials of access in order to have me charged with ""contempt of court"", starting demanding that he gets to see his son and would no longer accept being forced into the outer...

I told him he was being irrational and said we'd talk when he was again being rational and all that did was trigger him to rant about how he was justified in being angry that I was excluding him, etc.

I already know he's psychotic at present because what he's ranting about is not based on reality, but what I need advice on is what my next move should be.

I'm not sure whether to get the courts involved at this point and seek supervised visitation for him with the kids, or to contact child services and report my concern about their welfare if exposed to his mental instability. Or is there another option I'm missing?

I don't want to stop him seeing them, I just want to make sure they're safe around him.",11Dec2019,1

I have an interest in joining the army sometime in the next 2 years, havent decided whether part or full time. in the meantime, I'm doing great things for myself such as participating in various youth camps that will provide me soft and hard skills, and overall experience in the outdoors. I am also in the process of joining the junior Canadian rangers  which impart community traditional skills, life skills and ranger skills. 

I am physically fit, have a gym pass and run in my free time, also have a personal trainer which she knows about me wanting to join the army

I've volunteered at the animal shelter numerous times because I really love animals, dogs especially. I have considered going to college for something in that field but I dont think that's something I would like to do for the rest of my life (animal groomer etc). I have considered becoming a working dog handler specifically, something I would love very much and is much more exciting. But I dont think they really have that in the Canadian army. 

I have considered taking police foundations (what my community college offers) even though I have zero interest in becoming a police officer. since I'm in highschool I take courses that help me on the path to becoming one, or something in criminal justice; psychology courses, law, youth in conflict with the law, community policing, criminology.. I've had true crime as an interest for three years and psychology as an interest for the longest time. I'm just wondering if I took police foundations and have no interest in becoming a police officer (nor military police) would it be a waste of time and money? (I'm aware that I wouldn't automatically become a police officer in the first place as a result of taking the course)

I also considered going to college for preservice firefighter, but I also don't want to because along with that I'd have to take paramedics, which I dont want to be a paramedic and am unable to (havent taken certain courses throughout HS that are required). I just like the idea of being a firefighter because of the fitness aspect, and how they have a strong purpose. 

I could also become a volunteer firefighter once I turn 18, but i would be required to do it for 4 years. I have also considered joining the army reserve at the same time, which I'd be required to serve 4 years, too.

I'm 20 yrs old and right now Im a college student and working at a job and I need help on how to change my life I guess you can say. In high school I used to be fat weighing at 280lbs as a freshman and right after I graduated high school I weighed 185lbs which was a huge accomplishment for me. After high school I didn't start off by going to college because I was just stupid I guess so instead I was just working at a job.

I was raped by my ""best"" friend and her other friend when I was 14. (parents don't know about this and in any case I am not planning to tell them)

Currectly I have understanding boyfriend, I am with him for 2 years almost. He was always optimistic and supportive. But I can see that my issues have hurt him alot, he got more sad and he even told me it's too much for him already. I did things when I was younger that I regret and I keep mentally self-harming myself (on purpose making myself sad and jealous and being passive agressive) even tho I don't want it. I get jealous easily, constantly think I am not making him happy and that I am not pretty at all, not good enough. That he would be better off without me.

So what I am gonna talk about happened before few time but lately this is common for me and almost everyday thing. I get so anxious and sad and every possible feeling of blame or regret, confusion, not being able to know what to do, reality seems so fake, that all of sudden when I am in middle of my ""break down"" I start biting myself hard into arm or fingers, kicking myself, punching hard in the head or stratching till I strach off bits of my skin or things around me. I cant control it. 

I have no control of my emotions and my thoughts keep screaming all negative stuff and no matter what I do I just can't ignore or stop it. I lost joy in think I used to do and I get jealous when someone has hobby because they are good at it and happy and I feel stupid and useless, worthless.

I've been told many times that this is normal. But if it is, if there's no explanation for it and I have to just keep living with it, I can't. I really rather just end it up. Even now I am going through such a pain, confusion, I have no idea what to do. No matter what I try it just not working. I am going insane over this. I just want to be happy. I want my boyfriend to be happy. I want to make people happy. I am so miserable that I can't. 

I told my mum about this many times but she has been through stuff too and she keeps repeating herself that she has it harder and that it's all because I am girl and teen or zodiac sign cancer. (I don't believe at all in zodiac signs) And whenever she sees me in this state, she says she will not let me go out with friends becauw she keeps blaming them for how I feel and what I do and I keep telling her it's me. Asked her many times to sign me up for psychologist even psychiatrist but she won't and I can't do anything because I am underraged. Tried called help line but they never helped me. I am so low and hopeless and sad. This has been going on for years and I feel like I am not gonna make it till adulthood.

I feel like no one cares and no one really listens to me. When I try to explain that I get answers as ""oh you have it hard but us without these issues we have it hard too just look on our POV"" I never tried to compare my issues with others. I believe even small issues matter, no matter who are you and what is it. If it's bothering you, it matters. I am very sad that people see me this way and my boyfriend kinda too. But I get their point and I understand well. 

What am I supposed to do?",11Dec2019,1
873,"TL,DR: I cheated on the perfect woman 4 times, this was our 3rd time together and our best time together. So many things are going bad at the same time, I feel like shit and human garbage, but I still love her and want her back. Do you think it's possible for someone to understand what happened and forgive the cheater? 

I've cheated on the perfect girl. She's smart, funny, sweet, beautiful, sexy, overall the best person I've ever met, and we had a good relationship, but she went abroad to study. While she was away I cheated on her 4 times.
We've know each other for over 3 years now. I was always a bit of an asshole emotionaly towards her, in a big way because of my own personal problems. 

This was our 3rd time together, we always seem to fall easily for each other. This time we were closer then ever, we learned a lot about each other, our ambitions, our problems, and our commitment to each other was really strong. Despite finally opening up to her, there were still some problems I didn't feel alright telling her, like an addiction to masturbation and how insecure I could be, however she was always there for me, to help me and try to understand me.

When she went abroad, I was in a bit of a bad place and started feeling a bit lonely again. I don't want to get much in to it, but I've had depression for most of life. Family, money, self worth, confidence and girl problems have always kept me down even while trying to get ahead in life and working on improving my self. So when I get some recognition and appreciation I can't help but want more, it makes me feel less trashy. 

After a while I couldn't keep it in anymore, and even though it felt like the hardest the thing I've ever done, I told her I cheated on her. But still, I couldn't bring my self to tell her the whole truth, the pain, the disappointment and the embarrassment was just to much, I could hardly breath. After a while I tried everything to get back to her, but I felt disgusting and like trash because I was still trying to move forward when she didn't know the whole truth. My idea was to tell her one we were back together, happily and I would have proven to her that nothing like that could ever happen again. 
It went bad, eventually it came out that I cheated more than once and with more tha one girl. 

Now, every single day feels like a month, on top of this I'm feeling stressed like never before because of uni and other projects, I've had sex with other woman, I feel like trash, like I'm not good enough for her because I can't seem to control my self and uphold my moral standards due to past traumas, I want to get her back and prove my worth but there are some many other problems in the way. I feel like I'm starting to fall apart and I don't know to do, except that I miss her and want her back. 

I can't bring my self to say I love her now because it feels hypocritical after all I've done, but I still love and want to be with her, make her smile again. 

I didn't every single detail because that would make this the length of a small book, but I still feel like there's a chance. 

I just want some advice from you guys. Do you think its possible she'll take me back? For a cheater to be forgiven and accepted back?",11Dec2019,1
874,"I’m from Peru and my family and I are applying to get a VISA together (we are not traveling to USA, we just want to have it).

I know they ask for some guarantees to know none of us will stay there illegally, heard some of them are that you are studying or working, having a house or something but I’m not sure if there are any other.

The thing is, I was studying when we started to apply for it but I’ve been retired from university due to bad grades and my family doesn’t know about this. I haven’t been asked for any proof of studies so far but I’m not sure if they will.

My interview has already been scheduled and it’s 3 days before I take my test to see if I can get in university again.

Does somebody know if they will ask me for a proof of studies since I’m applying for a familiar VISA?  Which are the other guarantees? How do they ask them and when? Do I have to take documents to the interview or just be there and answer?

875,"Backstory:
My (M30) ex-gf (F30) and I began dating a little over 5 years ago. When we got together I was aware of some issues she had which was mainly lots of anxiety, and an eating disorder stemming from some abuse she suffered as a result of a family member. She struggled with this immensely and would attempt to get some help occasionally, but more often than not she would attempt to fix these things on her own. 

About 2.5 years into the relationship it reached a breaking point where she felt like she could no longer be in a relationship and work on her issues at the same time, and said that she wanted to break up so she could focus on herself. I love her very much and although it really hurt to hear that she didn't think she could be in a relationship with me and work through her issues, I understood that this is what she needed and so we split.

We kept in contact for the next 3 months or so. It seemed at the time she had made some progress - she wasn't seeing a therapist, but it seemed that living with her mom and focusing on herself was making a difference. We agreed to get back together and she moved back in. 

Things were great for about 6 months, but she relapsed and went into a dark place. All of the recovery she had made disappeared. I repeatedly asked if there was anything I could be doing to help her through those difficult times and she would only reply ""No, this is just something I need to work through."" When I would suggest maybe therapy she said she could get through it herself. Eventually, it fell apart again. She moved out, we broke up, and by this time her mother had moved back to Europe. She decided to move there too.

For the last year or so we maintained very very little contact. She began seeing someone else, and I began dating as well. However recently we began speaking again, and we both admitted that despite the last year of almost no contact and seeing other people, we still loved each other very much and we really want to be with one another. She told me how she had been seeing a therapist for the last few months and how much of an improvement it has made in her mental health and her personal life. She expressed to me how wrong she was to run away when things got hard for her, and that instead of running away she should have been coming to me and letting me in for support. She admitted she should have been seeing a therapist the last time, and that she rushed into thinking she was better when it wasn't the case. She said that should I take her back that she will of course continue seeing a therapist, and that she would love for me to come with her so that the therapist can find ways for me to help her out if things get hard for her. After discussing a couple other disagreements we had, we both agreed on compromises and have made tentative plans for her to move back and for us to be together.

With that said, I have told her that I have some feelings of insecurity around us, and she completely understands why, and she wants to do whatever it takes to make those feelings go away. I desperately want to trust that she won't run away again, but right now it's hard. I want to work through these insecurities so that we can be the best and strongest couple we can be, but I feel like I don't know what it is exactly that will give me that relief. She has promised to bring me into her therapy sessions so that I can be a part of her recovery, and of course she is making a huge commitment to move back to be with me. In addition she has agreed that couples therapy when she is back would be great to hopefully work through all of this. I would think this would be enough, but is there something else that would help? Is it just time that is needed?

Any advice would be helpful - I want us to work and I know she does too, and I am optimistic we will, but I would also like to process and work through these feelings of insecurity I have at the moment. Thank you!",11Dec2019,1
876,"I recently graduated with a bachelor of science in mathematics with a wam of 87 and a GPA for 3.8/4 doing mostly pure math units (the most useless one for a job but I found other math, especially stats, very boring). I have applied and been accepted in a Masters of Teaching (Secondary) at the same university but I am getting cold feet mainly for a few reasons: 

1) It feels like I had nothing else to do with my degree except teaching 

2) Public perception and pretty much everyone telling me I could have done better or been something 'great' 

3) Sometimes I think about what it would be like to be a researcher, in ecology ( I loved studying ecology in university), doing field work, studying animals or researching drugs/ something that could make a difference in people's lives or going into climate change. Being an expert in my field. I got great marks for my lab reports and research papers than other students due to my math skills and my papers being very different to everyone's. I found them very fun to do and I got along with my professors very well.

4) There's so much on teacher burnout, the long hours and the mediocre pay  


However, there are definitely some reasons I want to be a teacher

1) I am good at it, I've been tutoring and mentoring for years. Some of my students have gone on to do amazing things (which consequently leaves me feeling left behind)

2) I can hopefully work closer to home without looking for work in the city (I hate commuting and I live far from the city)

3) Compared to say a researcher, once you land a job it can be fairly stable (I hope)

4) I love math and I remember how boring and dry it was in highschool which is something I want to change. Also coming from a low socio economic background, I want to help students in similar situations find their dream job and steer them on the right path as I was very, very close to getting on the wrong path

5) Recently, I found out there are some opportunities in teaching overseas, one thing I always said I'd love to do is work in another/other countries

6) I think this matches more with my personality, I don't think I could work for large corporations who only cares about money

I feel like I'm bi-polar, sometimes I can't wait to start teaching but sometimes I always have a feeling of emptiness, like I wish I had at least tried to make something greater of myself. Sometimes I feel like I want to compete in the real world, working endlessly solving problems and doing research. However I get tired quiet easily and have chronic fatigue syndrome. Ideally what I want is to want to do teaching and not think of anything else. I know this is 'grass is greener syndrome' but I don't know what to do. I think if teaching was seen as a good profession like a doctor then I wouldn't be having this problem but as I said, public perception has gotten to me and I hate it. By the way, I'm in Australia so I think unlike some teachers in America (I've read some teachers working holiday jobs and some on 30-40k a year), I can definitely make a decent living but I just want to be content with what I do without the feeling of 'wasted potential' vibe I get. I've had confidence issues ever since I could remember and never had this feeling until I finished university and realized maybe I can do what i set my mind to. I have good communication skills and can build relationships. I'm a good problem solver but suffer from impostor syndrome and knowledgeable about the world and current issues.

878,"So it’s about a girl (20f) who I (21m) study with. I’ve “known” her now for like 15 months but throughout our studies we never really interacted much but I still developed a crush on her. Most of the times we’re in our respective friend groups and our groups never really interact. And after the first few months there were few times we shared eye contact and she laughed at me (could’ve been coincidence for all i know) so I decided to text her. And so we texted for a bit but I noticed that she always took a few hours or even longer to answer me and sometimes she didn’t answer. And after a few weeks of texting I just couldn’t shake off the feeling that she is answering just try to be polite and not really wanted to text with me. So I stopped texting her not wanting to make her feel uncomfortable. And now 2 weeks ago she texted me asking me for help for her studies. And after helping her the first time I just left it at that and didn’t text anything . And now this Monday she asked me again so after helping her I decided to keep writing with her and everything is fine and the next day we randomly sit next to each other in class and have great time. So I continue from where left of the other day but I notice the same pattern as before (took long to answer). That’s why I’m asking if she’s doing this to be polite and not wanting to make me unhappy because she needs me to help her or if I’m just being paranoid and everything is fine. Or how can I tell if she’s interested in talking with me (not only through text but also in person)? Or how can I tell she is not ?

We live about 35-45 minutes a part right now. If we move we will be roughly 3 hours a part in different states. My mother and I have been through a lot which has made us close. I know it’s going to upset her to tell her we may move farther away. My mom has lived a very hard life and honestly I don’t want to leave her behind. I want to ask her to come with us but also don’t want to upset my wife. Now my wife has opened our home for her and made it clear that if she ever needs a place she’s welcome here but needing a place versus wanting her to come is different. I’m torn because I want to protect my mom and my family. I don’t want to be a part from either. Is it selfish of me to ask my mom to uproot her life for me?

885,"I'm a 24F full-time student. I've been diagnosed with depression, OCD, and GAD at the age of 15. I've had a long track record of mental health issues. My dad's dad died a couple months ago and it has put him in this extreme state of depression and loneliness. I live in a different state from him but my sister went to visit him and he would cry at the end of her bed at night before bed and beg her to talk in silent moments because ""the silence is rough"" and he mentions at night is when the ""dark thoughts come."" My dad is 60. When I went see him Thanksgiving break, he excessively was telling me he loved me to the point where it was just really concerning and abnormal. I asked him if he was suicidal and he answered ""I don't think so."" I was like ""you don't think so???"" That's not like my dad... My dad has always had a super rough exterior. The last time he became like this was when him and my mom got a divorce when I was like 10. When I was 10, he would come crying to me asking me to comfort him. I remember his exact words being ""hold me."" I was 10... I thought maybe over time he learned how wrong that was, but it's the same thing now almost. He is desperately seeking comfort from us like he is a child. He looks to us to take care of him almost. He wishes we lived back at home, but my sister and I need to start our own lives. He mentioned to my neighbor when I left his house to go back home, that if he had not of stripped my bedsheets, he would've slept in my bed that night because it reminded him of me. He started therapy but says he doesn't think it's helping. He has an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow, but he doesn't want to take anything ""long-term"" i.e. an antidepressant. I don't know what more I can do to help him. It's my finals time right now. I'm stressed out. I've been dealing with severe anxiety and depression this past semester and it's caused a drop in my grades, but I am trying to work through it. I feel like I am getting to a better spot.

890,"I live in a state of constant apathy, completely devoid of anyone or anything that gives me a genuine sense of joy or fulfillment or meaning. The days go by and I go through the motions without ever actually feeling like I'm living a life. Some days I manage to get the bare minimum that is expected of me done, but most days I don't even have the energy to get out of bed. I either sleep all day or escape into books, movies, or video games that are more interesting than my own life.

The worst part is that nobody would expect it. I take care of myself physically; I have a good diet, I exercise. I have a sense of humor. I smile and laugh and socialize. People like me and I have a large circle of friends. At the end of the day though I feel like it's meaningless. Partying and socializing are the only things that make me happy because I guess I'm good at it, but it still feels like a temporary and ultimately pointless escape. I never really remember anything all that well. When my friends recount a funny story or something like that I go along like I remember it but really don't. I feel like everybody else has their memories in HD, and I only get a paper transcript of mine, without the color and sounds and emotion that make a memory worth remembering in the first place.

I don't get stressed. I don't get anxiety. But I don't have dreams or aspirations either. I don't want anything better for myself. I don't really give a fuck about my life. I'm not suicidal, but I'm not afraid of dying either. This mindset has gotten me hurt in the past but nothing changes. I won't seek it out, but I still have no reservations about doing something dangerous.

For years I just accepted it. At first I told myself that this is just what happens to people as they get older. When I found out that wasn't the case I thought maybe this is just who I am.  I'm sure there are plenty of other people I know who think the way I do. But recently I've started to realize it's not normal to be this way. It's not normal to not give a fuck about where your life is headed or when it might end. I've tried sitting down my parents and asking for help. They don't believe me. They think I'm just a lazy kid coming up with excuses. I'm honest enough with myself to know this isn't the case. I desperately wish I had even a fraction of the motivation, energy, and desire to experience life as everybody else seems to have. I've talked to my friends about it, but I don't think any of them have the capacity to help me.

I don't have any help. I feel like I'm in this fight alone and I have no idea where to start. 

Do I start with traditional doctors? Is all of this a result of never having any energy because of some physiological problem I don't know about? Do I have some kind of deficiency or sleeping problem making my fatigue?

Do I start with a psychiatrist? Is my outlook on life shaped by the fact I've never really experienced stress because of some defect in my brain? I have a family history of ADHD and anxiety disorders, could I have some kind of chemical imbalance causing this?

Do I just start by seeing a therapist? Is all of this in my head, and my lack of energy and general apathy just a result of a poor mindset?

I'm not looking for a cure. I know you can't cure something like this. But I want to fight it at least. It just seems like it's all connected and I have no idea where I'm supposed to start untangling the wires.",11Dec2019,1

893,"To make this concise, I was prescribed *fluoxetine*, an SSRI antidepressant medication due to moderate to severe anxiety. It helped tremendously, but as with many medications, there were side effects and I experienced some of them. I gained weight, felt like a robot, and my libido became suppressed. I was concerned about these side effects because they were adversely impacting my quality of life. When I told my psychiatrist about this (sometime in November 2016), she told me that she understand my concerns, but felt that I should stay on the medication to mitigate a risk of relapse. So I accepted her advice and stayed on it for some more time. Eventually, I switched clinics and saw a new provider, a psychiatric physician's assistant who listened to my concerns about feeling flat and not like myself on the medication. So she started a taper in August of 2019 and ended about nine days ago (December 2nd 2019). 

Throughout my time on the antidepressant, I had a habit of Googling my side effects, my medication name, and other people's experiences on similar antidepressants and while some of the information was helpful, I saw some unpleasant horror stories that scared the living crap out of me. I told my primary care physician and PA about this and they told me that...

Some of the information you encounter online may be false, misleading, inaccurate, or out-of-date. As for personal experiences, assuming the individual is telling the truth (some people intentionally lie about their health experiences to fearmonger), information would be valid but anecdotal. Anecdotal evidence is reported accurately and truthfully is true but is unique to the individual and should not be used a gauge to determine exactly how your experience may be.* ***If you have any medical questions or concerns, the best thing to do is to consult a medical professional rather than seeking information from a search engine or social media site.***""

My PA added this...

&gt; ""One problem with searching for medical or health information on the web is that search engines and other sites may track your browsing habits in order to promote targeted or personalized advertisements. Some people may not like the idea of their sensitive information being used to display targeted ads. If you want to seek help for a medical issue and care about your privacy, then its best not to use the Web as a resource.""

I read an article from [*The Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/doctors-often-dont-tell-you-about-drug-side-effects-and-thats-a-problem/2017/07/28/830fbaf6-715c-11e7-8839-ec48ec4cae25_story.html) where one writer claimed that many people with health issues rely on online health forums for advice and support for their issues because the article alleges that many doctors fail to warn patients of side effects prior to starting treatment. However, my PA and PCP advised me that in my case, given that I tend to freak out over any negative information online (whether accurate or not), it is best that I avoid these health forums and medical resource sites ( *WebMD*, *Verywell*, *Mayo Clinic*, *Cleveland Clinic*, etc.) and just stick to seeing a medical professional in person to protect my privacy and avoid health anxiety.

What do you think of my situation? Are the medical professionals right? Can researching medical issues and medical side effects online make me unnecessarily distressed to the point where its just better to not use the Web for researching health topics? I just want things to go back to normal for me.",11Dec2019,1
894,"Today at work, I was thinking about something that was making me kind of mad at work. I think I kind accidentally made an angry face or visibly reacted to what I was thinking about because a coworker saw me do it right after she said something to me (had nothing to do with her or why i was angry. I would never give a coworker a shitty look like that). But I'm pretty sure it accidentally seemed like I made the face at her because it was right after she said something to me and I saw her turn her head to another coworker and angrily mouth something to her that I couldn't hear. I have no proof that what she mouthed was about me or that she definitely thought the face I made was at her, but it definitely seemed like it. I don't know what to do. If I bring it up and it turms out I was wrong about it, then it's super awkward. If I don't say anything, then she might continue to think I was rude to her and maybe even tell others. Me and this coworker have had run-ins with each other before so I really don't want to keep fucking things up with her. What should I do? I feel like shit.",11Dec2019,1

900,"TLDR I was feral now I’m a house cat, how do I make my life fun again?

I feel absolutely trapped and bored in my adult life (college, part time job, 4 year monogamous relationship, almost zero friends) when I was younger I was really crazy and untamed and I traded that for the stability of my current life. I did this because a few really messed up things happened and I cut myself off from a lot of my old friends. I spent a lot of time alone trying to gain stability. There’s things I like about my life now but I feel like I’m missing out on so much now knowing how things used to be. I don’t know if my current life is actually boring or if I just miss the constant feeling of adrenaline. To be fair I don’t want to go back to my old life completely. I encountered some kinda messed up people and I was always kinda scared and sick. I just miss the fun parts of it all.

to give you a comparison: A few years back around age 18-21 I had tons of friends, I went out all the time, partied in warehouses and strangers places, did crazy drugs, did dangerous stuff like jumping rooftop to rooftop on buildings, traveling across the country, sneaking into places I wasn’t meant to be, biked everywhere, I was in open relationships with a few people, I’d go off and stay in the woods for a few days with a friend with nothing but a tarp, hatchet, and a Tupperware with rice. I worked as a nude model/pelvic model and made mad cash, I also sold underwear, I’d give myself crazy haircuts and tattoos using a sewing needle and India ink. I’d just live my life constantly on a whim, doing whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted.

Now age 24: M-F I work and go to school. I’m tired when I get home so I watch a lot of TV and clean my house sometimes. I do more housework because my boyfriend pays more bills (his job pays significantly better) on the weekends I spend one day with my boyfriend and the other day I try to hang out with friends but it’s hard because everyone is tired or busy and I’ve burned a lot of bridges so there’s a lot of people I avoid. I sleep a lot or go to the park by myself and ID plants and animals. Shows and loud parties annoy me now. I rock climb with my boyfriend sometimes and that is probably the most interesting part of my life at the moment. I want to pick up and move and travel but he doesn’t want that and I don’t want to break up. I make a lot less money now that I have a normal job. (I had to leave my pelvic model job because it was too mentally and physically taxing) so I can’t afford to do some of the stuff that might make me less bored. I think I’m depressed or something.

903,"Hey guys and girls,

Soo because my last flatmate found the job of her dreams in another city, I had to search for a new one. 

After a few days I could narrow it down to two applicants and both of them were lovely, but I had to make a decision. Having made the decision, I contacted them and let them know, whom I chose. 

Now here comes the problem: The person I chose seemed to be very grateful and happy, but I still needed some documents from her. 
""Hey xy, I need these documents to set up the contract and inform the landlords. Can you send them to me? I'm glad to help if you have any questions!"" 
She didn't respond for a few hours and then told me about a study she needed to work on and that she would like to discuss this at the end of the week. 

Am I just a bit paranoid? I had to deal with a situation before, where a person was happy to move in, then barely communicated and bailed after a few days of no texts from both sides. 

My current flatmate leaves the flat at the first of january and I am a bit worried, because I can't pay the flat on my own. 
I am still in contact with the applicant, which was not my first choice, but it was a very close call! Both of them were really cool though! 

The flat is literally 20 metres away from her college and she still seems eager to move in, if the other applicant bails. 

I just think it is a bit rude to not respond, if there are so many things to clear up. If I want to have a room in a shared apartment, I should have 5-10 minutes of time in a day to quickly keep me updated right?

So Tl;dr: ""Ghosted"" by one applicant, second applicant still wants to move in. Should I just change my decision and let applicant 2 have the room? Or should I wait until the end of the week?",11Dec2019,1

905,"My husband and I (27) have been living with his parents and brothers for the last 3.5 years. We were young and couldn’t afford our own place so we stuck it out. His family is lovely and we have a great relationship but it’s getting really crowded.

My husband and I live in a small double bedroom with our 1 yr old daughter. 

I imagined we would move out in a year but unfortunately I became seriously ill and had to quit my job very early on. I’m better now after open-heart surgery, but we have decided that I would stay home to care for our daughter till she’s in nursery. 

The plan was that my husband would work and save up enough so we could buy our own house and move out. He recently got a really good job now and is earning £100k after tax and has saved up more than enough for a deposit on a small home that meets our current needs. 

He gets really excited about it one day and then the next he changes his mind and finds an excuse. 

Like: 

1. “Tbh I could live here for another few years till our daughter outgrows her cot”
2. “Let’s wait for another baby”
3. “I don’t want to lock all our money in a house and worry about a mortgage, wouldn’t it be better to invest somewhere else and live here a little longer?”

Some days it seems like he’s fed up with our living standards and suggests we rent a flat to gain our independence and save for the perfect house. 

He could save ~ 48k/year if we rented vs ~ 68k if we lived with his parents 

But then he’ll get cold feet again and say “is it really worth the extra 20-30k?”

I love his family and they’ve supported me through out my illness. But honestly I just want my independence now. I feel very depressed and stuck at times In this small space. I want to make my own home not live in someone else’s and forever be treated like a child. 

Also our daughter needs her own room. I buy very limited toys for her because there is nowhere to put them and she often wakes up from naps because of noise outside our bedroom. And don’t even get me started on our sex life. 

I feel like I can’t really put my foot down on this decision. Although we are married I just feel like he is the one who earned the money and should get to decide. He does know what I want but I don’t think he really understands how badly I want it and need it. 

Also I think part of him is scared to move out and have all the responsibility of providing on his shoulders

Husband has saved up enough to move out but is having a hard time leaving his parents. Don’t know how to convince him.",11Dec2019,1

907,"So, after school, my 6 year old daughter gets bussed to a local ""Boys and Girls Club"" (almost like the YMCA sort of). Well, today when we picked her up, she had a bright pink, glittery, Hello Kitty [shotglass](https://i.imgur.com/036Fht8.jpg). She didn't call it a shot glass, just said it was ""something she won"", but it's pretty undeniably a shot glass. Being that she's 6, my wife and I don't think she should really be playing with it, because it's, well....a shotglass.

However, the ""dad-wrapped-around-his-daughter's-finger"" part of me feels bad because you could just see her heart break when we took it away, because 1) she hates getting things taken, and 2) she won it.

908,"So I failed my first semester of my sophomore year after failing my first semester of my freshman year.

Last year my first semester was pretty bad. I failed all of my introductory classes. However, I did great my second semester! Mostly As and one D in my business class, but was still passing. My GPA was high above the requirement. I felt proud of myself and I felt like my efforts showed my school that I was just overwhelmed the first semester and that I actually could do it.

However I received a letter in the mail that summer break telling me that my financial aid was being revoked due to my low GPA in my first semester despite my overall GPA hitting the requirements. I think that was the mental turning point. I wasn’t kicked out but if I didn’t get financial aid back, I’d be forced to drop out.

I spent the next few weeks writing an appeal informing them about the learning disabilities that I have as well as the mental health issues that I struggle with. My doctor and mother wrote letters to back me up.
My appeal was accepted and my financial aid was returned. But I was on academic probation.

I felt confident going into this semester this year but I didn’t understand just how different it would be for me to retake my intro classes... at first it was fine, I was doing my work and going to class but something mentally just snapped for me and I don’t really know what happened. I became so depressed and just isolated myself from everything and everything, including college. I ran out of acceptable skips and that was that, I failed my classes early on in the year again before I could even dig myself out of the mental hole I was stuck in. Once I realized, I was terrified. I avoided everyone for the most part still and made up lies to everyone. No one knows besides school officials and none have bothered to reach out to me and I’ve been too scared to reach out to them. I’m scared of the reality I’ve put myself in and don’t think I can mentally take hearing them tell me how much I’ve messed up.

I keep lying to my parents and I feel so horrible about it, but I’m too scared to tell them now after I lead them to believe I was was doing well. They tell me they’re proud but in reality they don’t know that their daughter is actually just a huge failure.

I don’t even think I could attend community college at this point because I’m not book smart at all. I go to an art college. Here at art college they basically dumb things down and are more relaxed and personal than other colleges so students can focus on their art and I couldn’t even pass that. And I guarantee my college won’t let me continue this time and at this point I don’t even want to go here anymore. I don’t even think my art fits in to be able to work a company job anyway. It doesn’t fit in with what I want to do.

Would the other art college in the state accept me with a horrible GPA like this?... they accepted me out of high school but I chose the one I’m at currently at instead.

Today I woke up having a terrible anxiety attack due to the stress I’ve put on myself and couldn’t stop shaking. After that I have decided I need to figure out what to do from here. I don’t know much about the real world or even if I’m good at anything other than art. So I figured I’d reach out to others for advice. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",11Dec2019,1

Here it goes: I was asked to babysit my former co-workers child Saturday and Sunday all day.  I would consider my former co-worker and I to be pretty close. We do not talk as much as we used to it and not see each other as much either. It's actually been a good 6+ months since I've came over to hang out with her. My co-worker and her husband went out of town to a football game in Ohio to get away which I was more than happy to help babysit, watch the dogs and house. Their child is used to me along with the dogs and I've watched their house for them during vacations along with babysitting. However, this time I did not get paid. I did receive a weighted blanket that has been sitting in the closet for 2 years (what she said). Granted, it's a nice blanket, but I'm still bent out of shape about not even getting a 20 dollar bill. I just moved out of my dads, I'm going back to school in January which is going to cost me 4,000 out of pocket and it's the holidays. I do not want pity but I just feel hurt and walked over. I was thanked many times from them, but they have paid me in the past before. 

I am on the fence of just letting it go and being distant because I do not want to seem greedy.

&amp;#x200B;

I get some form of bad news every day.  

1. I moved away from an abusive household half a year ago.  I was constantly in psychological abuse to which I have seen a psychiatrist for but I cannot afford to see a doctor right now to continue my care.  I still have very bad social anxiety and general anxiety that really affects me from time to time.
2. Before that, I was expelled from college when I was 3 months away from graduating for something I honestly did not do.  I have 30k in student loans to pay off that I don't have a degree for.  All of the appeals were denied, they refused to investigate the problem.  Yes, it was a for profit school and yes I regret that decision.  I have applied to 5 different colleges, to which all state they will not take my credits meaning I will have to restart from scratch to obtain my degree.
3. I owe over 1k per month in bills to which I can barely afford.  I just applied for a loan hardship thing where they postpone my payments for a few months because I'm broke.
4. My guinea pig passed away last week that I've had for almost 4 years.  I just got another one because my other guinea pig was bereaving hard, to which they love each other but now it turns out she is very sick. 
5.  I have applied for over 10 jobs, went to over 5 interviews, landed 1 job only to get my offer rescinded because ""the referral date doesn't match up"" meaning I accidentally typed in 7/2016 instead of 9/2016.  I called HR but I haven't heard back from them, it was a simple and honest typo on my part.  
6. I have no family or friends, my parents want nothing to do with me.  I have tried to reach out to my uncles and cousins but they don't want to speak.  I tried getting back with highschool friends but after 3 attempts to hang out and they cancelled last minute I stopped trying.
7. I have a pinched nerve and bulging discs in my neck, a pelvic tint and a messed up knee that I am in pain everyday at the young age of 25.  As mentioned above, I have no insurance and I cannot afford to see a doctor for this issue so I am not only depressed from other reasons but also because of the pain.  I've literally had headaches for 9 years now that is relieved by medicine but the back pain that almost crippled me last week will not go away.
8. I was in the ER for viral gastroenteritis on Thanksgiving week and was in terrible shape, the worst sickness I've ever experienced in my life, and owe 3k.  Should have just suffered at home and prayed for the best.

There's probably more but I'm so down and stressed that I cannot think clearly.  I honestly don't know what to do anymore.  Every day it is bad news.  There is no good, my mother had 10 abortions before me, I say they are the lucky ones as bad as that sounds.

However I have noticed a recent trend that occurs almost every day. I am the butt of a good majority of my friends jokes. Sometimes I make gay jokes because my humor is stupid and immature, and now all day they joke about how gay I am and I am really just closeted and whenever I talk about a girl they say she is just a cover or something. I laugh along because I can take the jokes, but now they are just making them everything about me, my looks, my intelligence, my humor, why I am still single etc. I didn't mind too much at first but it is literally an every day occurence.

921,"Long story short, I dropped out of college to pursue real estate. I was majoring in criminology and realized that’s not what I wanted to anymore. I moved back home with my parents to do so. 

Since then I was evicted from my apartment I was previously living in, when I got here they told me I had to sell my motorcycle and I can’t bring my cat here, along with more things. These are things they never told me until I moved here. I’ve been here 3 months. No job. No car. No motorcycle. No transportation. Only me, my bipolar mom and old school dad. They were pretending like me being here was going to be different than what it was when I was in high school. Only differences I’ve seen is we’re older now. I’m 22. Lost. Confused. And suffocating back into my suicidal thoughts and depression. I had big plans of getting my real estate license. I’ve been studying for my state test. I failed two times and am studying to retake it again. But how can I be a realtor with no fucking vehicle? My parents scammed me by pretending everything would be fine. But here we are 3 months later with no belongings because I had to sell them. Including my fucking cat I’m about to have to sell who I love so much. 

And to make matters worse, my girlfriend broke up when me a month after living here. So about 2 months ago. I have nobody anymore. I went from being popular in college, in a fraternity... To a loaner piece of shit with nowhere to go.

the most realistic answer is to break up. but i really dont want to. i also dont think i could do a LDR. we haven't talked about it in detail yet. but i know what the outcome will probably be if we do. i dont know what to do. i dont have many friends and the ones i do have are internet friends/not close friends. if he leaves, i think i will have no one. and its selfish, i know. im never going to utter a word about being sad about this to him with the intention to guilt trip him. i want him to follow his dreams and be happy. i truly do. im just sad he has to leave. and i cant be a part of his future. he's truly the best thing that has happened to me. and it sounds so stupid and dramatic and i know, but my family life isn't good and i dont have many friends. i dont know. any advice/help is appreciated. thank you.",11Dec2019,1

Going into my second interview I was so desperate to do better as it means I might have a second chance. It was literally so much better than the first one that it made it feel like just a temporary bad dream.

They want to interview me again, but I'm meant to catch a flight on that day, for a trip that's already paid for. I don't know what my parents would want me to do but I feel that if I don't take this chance I'll regret it for the rest of my life, but I feel terrible that I'm even considering pulling out of the trip.

I've had my heart set on this place so long and I think that if I can ace the third interview like I did the second I actually have a chance. I didn't ever think I'd get this far and I'm trying to keep a brave face but I feel like I'm going to throw up every time I think about not getting in, or at least not going to the third interview.

We're looking for ideas for this year's present, and I thought I'd solicit reddit's advice (risky move). The gist is, the disguise must have a long straight pole section (clean minds, please) where we can hide the umbrella. Some ideas we have so far are:

* Stick pony
* Fake ficus tree
* Hat rack
* Gate/arbor
* Lawn mower
* weed whacker

930,"Hey guys.
Hopefully someone can offer some non judgemental advice and ready to read possibly long paragraphs. 

Here's the backstory. 
My mom is disabled so she's not able to work anymore. Shes been out of work since i was 6 or 7 and now i'm 20. 
I decided to continue school after going through a long phase of things I'm not proud of but I decided to get my life together and go to college pursuing business.
Right now me and my older sibling living with my mom. 
We are on a program called section 8. 
Which means we can't afford rent without help from government assistance. 
Between me, my older brother and what my mom gets from disability, we can pay part and government pays the remaining.
Non of us have jobs to pay the rent by itself plus other bills we have.
Only me and my older brother work.
I want to be a full time student and focus completely on school but if I do this I would have to leave my full-time job to find a part time.
I hate being on section 8 for a plethora of reasons but it's because my mom needs it and so do I.
I mean, I do live with her.
So heres the deal. 

My brother is full time now at his job.
I plan on leaving this job to pursue school.
I came across dropshipping about 2 years ago  and what turned from me selling little trinkets and clothes and toys i don't use
And making an extra 40$ turned to me selling stuff i brought online and making 300$ in one week alone. I found my selling niche I guess. 
I want to pursue it and I have told my mom I am doing this but she doesn't understand it.
She thinks I'm still selling the stuff from my room even though I told her I'm not. 
She's told me she would rather I pursue school instead of a full time job.
Our rent would go down BUT
I want to be completely off the program.
My brother does as well and so does my mom.
I think she's scared to leave in fear of being homeless. 
I am afraid as well but, i see my profits go up and this is something I want to work with.
I always wanted my own business, I used to deal drugs but I stopped. Being in the street like that taught me a little about business. 
Doing this gives me a rush and it just excites me.
She knows this but she just doesn't understand. 
She told me it can fail which I'm aware.
Shes told me about taxes which I'm also aware of.
She said she would rather I have a part time because this isn't ""real work"".

I want to show her how much I make so she can see how profitable this is.
I can sell even more but stopped because that's considered fraud if we haven't reported it yet.
I want to report it since my name is also in the contract with section 8 but not without my mom seeing this.
I want to show her I can take this somewhere and that I can contribute even more to rent and we dont have to keep living like this.
Our landlord has even agreed to lower the rent because he likes us and wants us to stay. 
I haven't talked to my brother yet but plan to as well. 
Im just scared she'll flip on me and i don't want her to feel like she's gonna be homeless without the program.
I feel we can take care of ourselves at this point.
How can I bring this to my mom or how should I?",11Dec2019,1
931,"Before saying anything I want to note that yes, I've posted this on r/relationship_advice but didn't really receive any help, so I figured I'd try here. 

I don't even really know where to start. I'm not really big on sharing all my issues with the world but I genuinely feel helpless...

This all started when her mom noticed a hickey that I gave her on the side of her neck. We didn't really think this would be a hug problem given her older sister (18 or 19) used to come home with hickeys all the time without too much repercussion from her parents. I don't know why but her mom just completely lost her shit. She took her phone for the entirety of Thanksgiving break and read through all of our messages. From these messages she learned a couple things:

1. I smoke weed sometimes, often to fall asleep easier (I'm very responsible with it and safe. I always make sure to do my homework before getting high, and never smoke in public/around friends who aren't comfortable with it)
2. I swear a lot. This just is because of my family... my parents are both from New England and have never really cared what I have said, as long as it's not offensive or anything along those lines.

Apparently her parents think hickey's are completely disrespectful and a sign of ""dominance"" over her by me. Obviously that's ridiculous, and everything done was 100% consensual. This is where everything took a turn for the worst. Every time my girlfriend asks to see me they shut it down. Sometimes they just yell at her, sometimes they make her cry, and sometimes they just say no with a refusal to explain why.

Now to everyone reading: you might be assuming this is probably because of the weed, and while that is a valid point I have my doubts... and here's why. My gf mentioned to her parents long before any of this shit happened that I am Jewish, and their immediate response was:

""Yah know (gf's name) you really have to consider how you'll be raising your kids if you end up marrying a Jew.""

She obviously thought it was strange given this is her first ever high school relationship, the idea of marriage, let alone kids never even popped into our minds. I immediately became a little suspicious though, as the remark came off as a tad bit anti-Semitic.

Once this whole situation began however I started to connect the dots. I explained what I thought to my girlfriend and she obviously said something along the lines of her parents not hating Jews... I don't think her parents hate Jews, but I mean who wants to admit your parents might be a tad anti-Semitic, so I kinda just played along.

A few days ago in a last ditch attempt to patch things up, my girlfriend drafted a little speech to give to her parents where she apologizes to them for lying about certain aspects of the relationship, and asks for forgiveness. I was pretty optimistic as to me it seemed like a really responsible thing to do, and I really couldn't imagine a parent responding too negatively to something like that. Boy was I wrong. Her mother shamed her, and by the end of the conversation my gf was in tears, and really just a complete wreck.

My girlfriend called me afterwards and naturally I was interested in how the conversation went so I asked for specifics. She said he mom mentioned how she doesn't love that I smoke weed and thinks that it's gross (fair, I know it's not for everyone). The conversation really took a turn though when my gf told me that her mom mentioned the whole ""Jewish thing"". I'm obviously paraphrasing a tad bit but here is what I was told was said.

""You know I don't have a problem with him being Jewish... but why would you waste your time dating someone who you literally can't marry? Why would you do that to yourself? It goes against all you believe in. You wouldn't want to raise Jewish kids."" etc etc.

I was livid. Still am. I know deep down her mom isn't really that concerned about her daughter's boyfriend smoking weed to fall asleep. Weed is just a fantastic excuse for her to not let her daughter date a Jew. The fact that she even mentioned it at all shows her true colors.

Before anyone suggests we just sneak out and hang out in private... we've tried. Her mom tracks her phone and knows where I live, so she immediately gets suspicious whenever she's even in my neighborhood. Not to mention she has started asking her to send pictures of the people she's with to make sure it's not me.

I need help from anyone who can possibly give me any. What do I do? I'm dealing with someone who simply doesn't like me because of who I am, without even taking the time to meet me. I feel incredibly helpless, not to mention it's starting to wear on my mental health. I keep thinking that I've done something wrong or that I'm just not good enough, even though I know those thoughts are completely irrational. Hopefully this is sorted out before next week, but if worst comes to worst then I'll meet them next week at my schools Christmas concert. I'm singing a Jewish solo in front of the whole choir, so there goes even attempting to be discrete. Though a part of me wants to wear a Yamaka, and Jewish star necklace and just walk up and say ""Shalom!"".",11Dec2019,1
932,"I'm 26 years old, living with my girlfriend and my childhood friend as roommates, being supported financially by my parents. I have no prospects for a future, I've literally squandered every opportunity I had by being a lazy piece of shit with no ambition. I was big into art when I was younger, and thought of myself as a creative person, so I tried studying to go into the game design industry. Ended up not taking it seriously and giving up after the second semester. I studied natural sciences almost 3 years , but folded towards the end when it started getting hard and I had to dedicate myself fully to write a semester long research project. This year, I started my second semester in a I.T. program. Shit was so easy, all I had to do to pass was literally show up to class, and listen. Guess what, I fucked that up to, ended up staying home sick for a week, and then never got back into a routine to get up early at 8, missed an entire fucking month of school for nothing, and now I fucked this up to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a serial failure, I don't believe in myself at all. At a certain point in my life I had a decent intelligence, but instead of nurturing it and improving as a person I pissed away my youth, the best years of my life getting high, playing video games, and working minimum wage jobs so I could support my 2 vices. 

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point in my life I've gotten a new low paying job which i'm supposed to start in a month, but have absolutely no desire to support myself, and I barely have the pre-requisites to work this job. I literally wish I could just not wake up one morning and pass away in my sleep. I have no motivation to work on myself, I'm a subhuman piece of trash, i'm a failure and i'm embarassed my parents still have to support me like the immature, lazy piece of shit man baby that I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't fucking know what to do anymore. I know it takes baby steps to set yourself on the right path, but I don't even care about myself enough to do that. At this point I want to keep going down this road of self destruction until everyone in my life resents me enough that I might get the motivation to kill myself.

So I'm buying all of my friends something for Christmas, when showing him something for our mutual friend and asking if he thought she'd like it, he asked me why I was buying her something.
I just told him, because she's my best friend so of course I was buying her something.
He seemed confused and I said I was buying everyone a gift and that I was also getting him something.
He told me that if I bought him anything he wasn't going to accept it and didn't want a anything, he didn't say this rudely or anything.
And while we were talking about it he said his Mum and family never really bought each other anything or celebrated Christmas much since he was a kid.
So now I just really want to buy him a gift and show him that he's appreciated and deserves a Christmas present too.
One friend suggested I give him something anonymously so he can't give it back or not accept it.
How should I handle this?

I want to stress how much I love my gf and want this to work. We’ve been together 6+ years and there’s no doubt in my mind I want to experience every part of life with her. We agree on practically everything but our communication sucks. And there are some red flags that have me wondering if I can deal with it for the rest of my life. 

My girlfriend who we will name M allows every thing in the world to bother her. Now-I understand having bad days where just everything makes you tick and your fuse is just short. That’s not the case here. 

M could go through the drive thru of Taco Bell and ask for a soft taco with sour cream. If TBell put the sour cream on the side she’s immediately aggravated and pissed. Like-yes it’s an inconvenience but imo it isn’t worth losing my mind over. This is just an example to show how the small things become major disruptions in her day. 

Now I’m no saint, and have absolutely dealt with a temper in the past. But I’m older now and I’ve learned to pick and choose what I allow to get to me and what doesn’t. It absolutely drives me up the wall that she can’t do the same. I’ve tried having conversations with her to get her to see that the things she’s upset over aren’t huge and everything becomes an argument. She just says that I don’t take her side in things and would rather tell her she’s wrong about everything. That’s not my intentions. All I want is for her to be happier and not so pissed off and mad all the time. Because I’m actually exhausted from having to comfort and calm her down 24/7. 

Anytime I disagree with her and tell her that maybe she’s wrong she says how I’m her person and she just comes to me to vent. But I have an opinion and listening to something that I strongly disagree with drives me crazy. Should I just bite my tongue and say nothing?

So my question is-am I the problem? Is my approach wrong? Do I just need to overlook this? Am I wrong for getting so frustrated with her? Or worst case are we just not compatible and this will be an issue until the end of time. 
Idk. I understand this is really surface level information but any advice is greatly appreciated.",11Dec2019,1

9.Encourages my friends to do it
10.Hits me 
11.Tells me to shut up

But I feel like I can’t do anything because i have known him for 12 years. His parents are best friends with mine and i see them as second parents and my parents see him as a third son, Im friends with his little brother and my closest friends all like him too. 

I feel like if i try to tell anyone they won’t believe me.The only person who actually knows anything about it is his brother but I don’t believe he will do anything because even though he is nice to me he still joins in on the bullying with encouragement.

when his little brother tried to let me in their house in the morning while they got ready so we could go to school one time, he stopped him as i heard him say to not let me in and i had to stand outside in the cold(it was -10).

Also I didn’t really wanna put this in but it does explain why I can’t do anything. I have autism and every time he does something like this i freeze up and don’t know what to do I just let it happen. That is why I’m so scared to tell people what is going on. Because I’m scared of how they will react.

938,"First of all, I appreciate teachers for their service and I know that they can be life changing. I also consider myself an exceptional student, I take APs and honors classes. I will remain unbiased, so if something seems extreme or unrealistic, please know that I am not exaggerating. 
But there is this one teacher that I have that students past and present complain about. He’s been teaching the same subject for 20+ years. You would think he’s pretty good but that is absolutely not the case. At least three times a week, he would teach something wrong and have to re-teach it. He doesn’t go over concepts, he just jumps right into a problem that we have no idea how to solve and introduces things to us that are needed to solve the problem but doesn’t explain why. This is the first class that I’ve gotten a C in, I go spend extra time in his classroom after class for help, but he doesn’t really help. Whenever I would go, there would be a full class of students waiting for him to help and we would openly express how annoyed he was because of the number of people. Well, it’s his job to help. When I finally caught him, he said “are you kidding me” and “I don’t understand why you’re not getting this”. I asked many questions in class that the beginning of the year and he just rolls his eyes and sighs while I ask. He does answer my problems, but not well, sometimes he doesn’t even know. Then I overheard another student asking a question and he essentially said to her that he has to deal with kids with “mental illnesses”.  It’s very discouraging stuff for me. I don’t want to be mistreated for merely not understanding something. In fact, it’s a teachers job to help kids understand. We also played a kahoot with a bunch of math problems and on every single question, at least half of the students always got the answer wrong, if not more. This was on the unit that he claimed was the easiest of the semester. I went to the principal and was told that either I could talk to him or suck it up. I was hoping for something more, but no.

I did not work for one entire year. I'm working now, but I need more money, so I'm doing applications and today I actually had an interview. I don't know how to address the gap in my employment, or what was the reason for my leaving my first job. I got the job I have now through a solid family connection. There was no talk to be had about why I worked somewhere for  a decade and then left to do nothing for a year. I don't think it's any coincidence that the only interview I've had out of all the applications I've submitted, was the first application I did not disclose my employment gap. The person met did ask me what happened with my first job, which was uncomfortable because I don't like to lie but I didn't want to completely sink myself either. I told him I had a drug problem.

940,"For some context: I moved across the country without a job or college degree in 2013 and after working hard and a lot of lucky breaks I was able to work my way up in a bigger company after being with them for 5 years and earning around 62k a year. This specific career isn't one I love but sort of fell into as all my experience has been in this particular field by virtue of working for this company. Unfortunately, in October my role was cut from the company and I was laid off but this didn't concern me as I felt like I had a lot of experience and be able to jump back into the work force with no issues. Now, I realize how wrong I was and without a college degree am really being stifled from getting any meaningful job in the field I worked in.  I also don't think it's a field I care for. The harder thing is I live with my girlfriend of two years and our dog and have made a life and friends for myself out here but cannot afford to live here without a job.

Option 1: I leave this city and go back to school in my hometown, as I am in my late 20's almost 30 this is probably the best time? My hometown is MUCH cheaper and I would be able to survive there.

Option 2: I stay here and tough it out until I catch a break and then possibly do school/work full time or just keep dredging in this field until I am able to shift into something I like.

He would refuse to help out with much of anything, he always tried to weasel his way out of paying child support. Him and his phyco bitch wife were always on holiday somewhere. 

I lived with him for like 6 months when i was 14 but he kicked me out because i was punching holes in the walls and breaking furniture because of his phyco bitch of a wife  kept screaming at me for tiny shit. He sent me to go live with an alcaholic in the shittiest neighborhood and paid them 100 bucks a week to have me. I have cut contact with my father now as he is useless for anything, even if i need money hes too stingy to give me any, when i ask my poor jobless right now mother she always gives me some. She helps me out every time i need it.

 I always get angry when i think about this shit how do i get over it? I just want to move on but i always get fucked off at it",11Dec2019,1
943,"I met my girlfriend on a dating app about a year ago and we have talked almost every day since. Always via LINE messenger and Skype. She is living in japan and is a permanent resident.

Just for clarity, she is not Japanese she is actually Filipina and I'm from America. As we spent time together chatting so often she eventually invited me to come to japan and be with her. We discussed it further and I eventually decided that yes I'm willing to come. We talked about the reality that if I live her in japan the only type of job I can get is teaching English.

I had no problem with that, and I was open minded to everything she told me. She is 45 and I am 29 years old by the way.

I eventually bought my ticket and got all my affairs in order and set out to meet her. Before coming here she mentioned that for us to be married she needed to request documents from the Philippines. Things like her birth certificate and proof of her being single. She told me this could take a little time so I was willing to wait at that time.

When I arrived here I found out that she has not been working for a few weeks. It was no big deal to me because it's easy for her to find jobs through a work agency here according to what she told me. 

Almost every week she would start a new job, and then quit after the first day. Blaming it on the workplace air-conditioner being too hot or cold.

Weeks turned into months as I notice that she constantly kept rejecting jobs for silly reasons.

About 2 months into my time in japan, I am still on a tourist visa and I ask her about her paperwork that is required for us to get married and she can't give me an answer.

Time continues to stretch on further and I find that she had been loaning money out to her other friends so they could pay for jewelry and God knows what else.

She admits that her money is low around month 4. Americans can only be in japan on a tourist visa for 90 days at one time but up to 6 months in a year.. so I left to Korea for one day and reintered back into japan to extend my time.

Now about month 5 she completely ran out of money so I have been paying for the expenses and draining my resources. She told me that the Philippines government is deliberately slow in issuing documents to force people to pay under the table for a ""fixer"".. To speed things up.

At this point I'm almost out of money myself and just this Monday she abandoned another job opportunity because it didn't pay enough. She would rather make no money than *some* money.

She said we could pay about 3000usd to a fixer in the Philippines to speed up her documents but they might scam us and we will lose the money.

So now I'm here in japan for all this time, and my girlfriend who has a visa and knowledge of how japan works refuses to work.

On top of that I am doubting that her marriage papers will ever arrive. Also she said she isn't sure if her family is really assisting her to request documents because she is not physically in the Philippines to do it herself.

One of my friends says that she is scamming me, but even if it's true... She could get much more money out of me by getting married and I'd be working at the same time.

I'm just asking for someone who can see this situation from the outside if I should let this go and return to America to try and salvage what I can? 

The emotional side of our relationship is really Rocky now and I do feel a resentment towards her.. When she tries to kiss me and be intimate I kind of withdraw because I feel like she's destroying our plan by not working. 

She has all the energy in the world for sex and arguing but when it's time to get up for work she has ""leg cramps""... And the pain always stops after she gets off the phone with the employer explaining why she can't come in... 

Is this doomed to fail?",11Dec2019,1
944,"I've been very close friends with this guy ever since 2015. We met in art school and instantly became really great friends. I've been involved in his life for a long time now. I constantly have been to his house many times.

Anyways, just recently I kind of noticed things were kind of weird. Well, one of the big things is he kind of stopped drawing and that has sort of been a weird thing. I feel like he was insecure about it and it made him feel bad maybe. I never brought it up or anything.

Like, two weeks ago he hit me up asking if I had any sticker paper and he was thinking of making stickers.

And around last week I texted him asking if he wanted to make some stickers tonight. No response. He is super shitty at texting and sometimes ignores me, whatever.

I then responded to one of his stories on instagram, and he just never responded.

And then I noticed just today that he wasn't following me anymore on his instagram. That's superrrr weird.

He still has pictures of me on his page. It's just...he doesn't follow me?

I try not to be too involved in his life, like I don't constantly text him or anything.

But lately I've been feeling like he doesn't like seeing me? Just about a month ago everything was fine and dandy and we were still friends..

And then just like, these past few weeks things felt kind of off.

He never responded to my text or insta message. Which is fine, that's how he is with texting.

And we are still friends on facebook.

But...he just unfollowed me? His girlfriend who I am friends with, still follows me.

So something...just feels really weird and not okay.

I don't want to cause drama.

I feel like...something is wrong in our friendship. But I don't know what it is.

Should I text him ""Hey is everything okay?"" or is that weird?

I just feel so lost and confused and don't know what to do...

I'm really sad he unfollowed me...so something must be wrong...I don't know what to do...I think messaging his girlfriend asking if he was mad at me might be a bad idea.

I don't know what to do.

Some of you may remember me from \[last year's front page post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/a997xn/our\_family\_has\_a\_35\_year\_tradition\_of\_disguising/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/a997xn/our_family_has_a_35_year_tradition_of_disguising/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x))  on Christmas Eve. My family has a tradition of disguising a golf  umbrella to look like something else and giving it to my grandfather as a  gift on Christmas. We're looking for ideas for this year's present, and  I thought I'd solicit reddit's advice (risky move). The gist is, the  disguise must have a long straight pole section (clean minds, please)  where we can hide the umbrella. Some ideas we have so far are:

* Stick pony
* Fake ficus tree
* Hat rack
* Gate/arbor
* Lawn mower
* weed whacker

Any other ideas?

“FOR ME” he says. What’s best for him. What about what’s best for me? I was on day 4 of no contact. Last Saturday I sent my last text. I had tried as much as a person could. I knew I had to do everything I could before I could give up. I’m okay. I’m not great. I still think of you. I still have a pain in my heart from you. But I was okay. And now there you are calling me late at night and early in the morning making sure that I was home safe. FUCK YOU! Is all I want to say to him. How can one treat a human like shit for the past month and tell them not to contact you ever again and then have the audacity to call me to make sure I’m okay? And then have the balls to say “Please don’t contact me.” Fuck what’s best for you. I want to text back and just say fuck you. But also at the same time I love this dumb motherfucker.

950,"My relationship with the person in question has always been solely through the internet. We met through an online game (minecraft) back in 2015 through a mutual friend. Since I've met them they've always been.. an odd character, to say the least. Their personality was built around their sense of humor, which is extremely edgy and dark in nature (joking about tragedies, deaths, etc.). Before I go any further I feel like its important to explain that they've had a tragic past, which is why they feel like they can get away with this type of humor (and more which I'll get to in a bit). They lost someone close to them at a young age and is a cancer survivor. I don't want to say any more in respect for their privacy. Anyways, because of their personality me and others in our friend group have always felt uncomfortable around them. They would constantly harass us, make sexually charged comments, and even encourage some people in our friend group to commit suicide when they'd mention feeling down. Over the years we've tried to break away from them *numerous* times. However, there's one thing that always makes us rope them back in. They threaten suicide, and despite all of the stuff that they've done, we always invite them back out of fear that they'll actually do it (due to their depressing past). This has been going on constantly since 2015 and I'm sick of it. Last month we cut them off permanently from our friend group because they did something *really* bad. I thought all was well until yesterday, when they DM'ed me saying that they were going to kill themselves and that they were a ""burden"" to us. I never blocked them because I felt bad, so stupidly I replied to them and invited them back thinking that maybe they had changed this time around. I was so, so wrong. They started complaining that we ""betrayed"" them and ""left them friendless"". This pissed me off because I realized: they'll never change. It's been 4 years and they're still the same - using suicide and depression as a tool to get what they want. That's why I'm writing this long post. I want to cut them off badly, but I feel like if I do I might be responsible for their ""suicide"". I'd appreciate any help, and sorry for the long post!

TL;DR: My online ""friend"" has constantly harassed everyone in our friend group since 2015, and whenever we try to cut them out they threaten suicide and guilt us into bringing them back. I want to end this cycle, but don't know how to do so without feeling ""responsible"" in the off-chance they *do* commit suicide.",11Dec2019,1
951,does anyone know how i can become emotionally numb to certain things so the things don’t hurt me time after time?,11Dec2019,1
952,"I'm still contemplating whether or not just to remain silent as I've been for years. Never talking nor shedding light on the situation, to anyone except my mum. And she understands. In more ways than I'd ever want her to. Anyway, I'm going off course. 

I'm 16 and homeschooled. A girl if that's relevant at all, though I highly doubt it. But of course you never know, haha! Before I  reveal my problem, let me explain my day to day routine, which will allow you to somewhat understand me, and my later actions:

I wake up at 6:30 am every morning, get up and automatically go to feed the animals (which I do daily and nightly). We have a dog, a cat and a couple fish. Then, I'll get some breakfast for myself, quickly finish and proceed to do the dishes (we're a big family, so lots of them haha). That'll bring the time up to about 7. Then I'll get dressed, brush my teeth and all that good care. I'll go back to do some laundry, which usually comes to two-three loads a day - when it's me. 

After all that is done, I will clean up downstairs entirely, since I live with a toddler so it's always messy the day after. Then, I'll go to empty both big bins, if needs be. And only after all this is done, will I go to get on with my online education. That'll round us up to about 9 am in total. Maybe 9:30 am, since I have this weird habit of walking in a circle for a long amount of time listening to music. Helps me take my mind off of the stress of home, also projects me into different worlds - which is bloody awesome! Though I probably sound like a twat for saying that haha. 

It's usually around 11am that my mum will ask me to help look after my sister (toddler) for a bit will she recuperates and sorts herself out. Mum has a bloody lot going on, so it's the least I could do. Apart from bringing her breakfast and making her a *shit* ton of tea lol! We brits huh.. 

So after all that, and then finishing my work, I then have the rest of the day to play around with, which is a good 7 hours. But that's always sliced and diced thanks to siblings. Nonetheless, I'm thankful for how ever long I get. There's nothing left to do the rest of the day anyway, except focus on my art. 

Now, my step dad works from 7 to 5. Manual labour. So I usually wait until he's gone in the morning to then do my bit. He'll go to the shops and grab tea after work, then return home. 

He never has to do any dishes, or feed the animals. Except for the rare occasions. He'll do the laundry, but he shrinks *everything*. 

My mum is going through enough, so I took on the role as house keep every single day for the past couple years to help her maintain sanity. So please do not presume she does nothing. 

Now that you know all these random, messy bits of info, I'll get into the important stuff:

Despite all that I do, it's never good enough for him. He'll come back every night and find something to complain about. If I haven't done enough laundry that day, he'll talk about how lazy I am. How I sit on my fat arse every day doing ""sod all"". How, because I do ""a bit of house work"" I think I've done ""everything"". How he's the heart for this family because he works everyday (except Saturdays n Sundays). He'll chunter as I walk past, snark remarks about my appearance or my lack of personality that seems to be attitude. Apparently I've just got a resting bitch face, which is sadly something I can't change. 
He's called me practically every name in the book, save for whore and slut. The sexually degrading ones we haven't gotten to yet, but how things are going now it wouldn't surprise me. The thing is, he'll act all happy when he first comes in, but as soon as you do something he doesn't like it's kill on sight. And as soon as he comes in, he'll wait ten minutes before sitting on his own bum and browsing Facebook for 45 minutes or so. If you so much as tell him how much you've accomplished, he'll brush it off with, ""but how long has your face been in that phone"" ""deadhead"" ""try coming to my work"". 

Then comes the alcohol. It's only amplified then, ruthless, even since the scrap of remorse is gone.

He'll tell me to get a real job. I'm 16, live in such a dead area that it'll be fatuous to try and catch and bus, thus wasting money trying to work small hours for small change. 

He doesn't have to do anything home wise. I don't get it. I do everything that needs to be done. What else does he want me to do? There's nothing I can possibly work on except looking after my siblings and/or personal interests. 

If I'm up past 11,which is usually daily since I help my mum, then it's a plateful more verbal slander. 

I do that routine everyday. Everyday, for the past five years. It has already taken its toll. I'm just taking each day as it comes. 

I know I have the absolute fortune of learning and staying at home, but when you're in a tiny two bedroom house with a family that exceeds that limit, sharing a tiny room with your sister - it takes a toll. I'm thankful for the roof over my head, though. I don't take it for granted at all.

This post is a mess, but I don't know how to properly explain how i feel. Believe me when I say this is not even the tip of the iceberg, I just want to know if I'm being a lard arse.

I want to know what I'm doing wrong. How I could go about it. I'm not a martyr, nor do I want to be or come across as one. That's one of my biggest fears, to come across as a sympathy leech. 

Don't talk about my mum, though. Please respect my wishes to keep her out of this.

If anyone can make sense out of this, I applaud you and I am ever grateful. I might delete this later as even though I don't think he has a reddit, it would be an arguement I'd like to avoid if he found out I was talking about this. Even in anonymity, he can sniff out like a bloodhound.

Many thanks x",11Dec2019,1

I'm having a lot of trouble being able to motivate myself to continue writing my books.

I could use some advice... anything, please.",11Dec2019,1
954,"Posted this over on r/relationships, but was told to head here.

I’m a young girl in dire need of sound advice and support, or maybe just a listening ear. I’m sorry if this all sounds overdramatic, but it’s been keeping me awake for many a night and, quite frankly, sapping the life out of me. I’ve also got pretty close to no one to turn to about this. Many, if not all, of my close friends know my sister intimately, and broaching the subject would be horribly awkward. My family on the other hand would definitely overreact and exacerbate the problem...

I was born as part of set of triplets. Since birth, we’ve been constantly held as yardsticks to each other, compared and contrasted, but only in recent years has the ugly inferiority and jealousy reared its head.  Especially in the direction of my older sister, whom I have always been very close to.

First there are the niggling, incessant thoughts of myself as somehow lesser than her. I’ve always had decent self-esteem, but every second of every day, I think about how my sister is an improved version of myself. About how others say she’s prettier, smarter, kinder, gentler, funnier, nicer, etc.  About how boys gravitate naturally to her.  About how my parents, my friends, favour her. About how significantly more attention is always paid to her. And then, involuntarily, I consider how she would be anyone’s first choice. 

Although I know it’s wrong, my brain wretchedly turns every small scenario into a competition in which she has ousted me at every turn. My heart sinks when she ‘beats’ me in the most insignificant aspects, roars its perceived injustice when she gets it better than me, even the tiniest reward, despite not working as hard. I’m insecure, calculating, and joyless. 

Sadly, regretfully, I now find it hard to feel happy for her victories. Instead I feel an endless sense of defeat. Cowed and inferior, unwanted and unloved, beside her. 

Then there’s the terrible jealousy. Sometimes I hate my lovely sister irrationally. I get mad at her for having what I don’t. It turns me into an irritable, hateful person. I absolutely hate that version of myself — petty and dejected at the same time. 

This nasty comparative habit has always lain underneath the surface, but there are two things which have amplified it immensely leading it to snowball into intense self-hatred.

The first, my bad shoulder injury which removed me as captain of my beloved sport, volleyball, and rendered me useless and idle, while my sister excelled. 

The second, my ex [17M]. He was my first love — we dated for a year. We broke up almost 2 years ago because he moved to another country and I was a complete dick. (In my defense, I was 13) But I don’t think I ever got over him and it sounds ridiculous, but I don’t think I ever will. He’s been staying over temporarily at my house for a week now (he’s a best friend of my brother’s), and I took the opportunity to try and make amends and confess my feelings. He rejected me harshly, which I could, albeit painfully, accept, but he proceeded to hit unabashedly on my sister for the rest of his stay while pointedly ignoring me. Now he doesn’t try to meet my gaze, addresses questions only to my sister and flirts with her right in front of me. It really, really hurts. What’s more is that I now feel completely undesirable next to my sister. The jealousy and inferiority kills me more than ever. And, to my horror, I despise her for not rejecting his advances immediately. I know this is irrational. I can’t help it. 

Please help me, internet strangers. I know I am fucked up. I know I am likely overreacting. I know that it sounds miniscule compared to the serious issues this sub deals with. I know teenagers can dramatise everything. But I feel so, so depressed about this. 

How do I stop comparing myself to and hating someone that I spend all the hours of my life with? How do I get over these feelings of inferiority, delete these ideas which fuck me up? Finally, advice on how to get over a first love (which replaced you with your sibling) would also be gratefully appreciated.  

TL:DR - I, a high school student, constantly, involuntarily, see myself as lesser than my triplet sister which triggers feelings of hatred, dejection and jealousy. Please tell me, how do I stop succumbing to these thoughts?

So i get along with these guys, get confortable, we joke around, all fun and games. And then i screwed up.
Me and half of the group went into a restaurant and the other half went into another because of the smell. Now, i know the restaurants owner, and am quite friendly with them so, when i entered, they greeted me. Something among the lines of ""oh, long time no see! you barely come around anymore."". AND LIKE AN IDIOT I SAID ""oh, i wished. but sadly a friend of mine doesnt like the smell""...
Before anyone judges me... i got nothin. I acted outta line and my mouth was faster than my brain.
After lunch, that friend was informed about this and flipped out while also keeping is cool.
Now, he hates my guts. He keeps talking to me, and im grateful for it, but i can feel the change in attittude. Hell, i KNOW i deserved it. Thats why, everytime he says something among the lines of ""Now go tell X person about what we said"" i just get quiet.

Even her toys last forever because she never destroys them. 

Things went really well with us living together so we signed a 2 year lease for a new house, this time one with a big fenced in backyard. Given that we would have a fenced in yard at our new place, my roommate decided to get a dog (a golden retriever). We talked about it and I agreed since she has experience as a dog owner (from family with a lot of dogs) and since she was working from home free lance at the time and would have plenty of time to be home with the new puppy. She got the dog maybe 6 months ago? Things went well for the most part at first since she was home to potty train him and walk him. 

However, he’s grown up now and has started to show traits that really just drive me crazy- primarily being destructive and being noisy. He chews up EVERYTHING he gets a hold of. Before anyone asks, yes, I keep my things out of the way and don’t leave things lying around where they shouldn’t be. However, he goes out of his way to get things apparently by taking things off of surfaces like tables and countertops. What really sent me over the edge is finding that he chewed up the remote control to my tv and my roommate never even mentioned it. It doesn’t work now. I’m also starting to find it extremely annoying that she just allows him to destroy my dog’s toys. I get that they are toys, but I didn’t buy them so her dog can just tear them apart. I am annoyed that she just seems to let him destroy toys and chew things up without checking to be sure what he has is actually chewing on is a chew toy. 

Secondly, he barks ALL THE TIME and it drives me nuts and also makes me feel like our neighbors almost certainly hate us. Recently, my roommate picked up a full-time job and is no longer at home with him during the day, so she leaves him in the yard with my dog. (As a side- they get along very very well. Not an issue). Again, my dog never ever barks and is fine with being alone while I’m at work. I’m certain of this. Her dog, however, just will not stop barking from the moment he goes outside. He’ll wake me up almost every morning when he goes outside and starts barking, and on the days that I’m home for some reason. I notice he barks pretty much nonstop all day. I cannot stand a barking dog and it is ridiculous. Things realllllllly hit a tipping point when she had a guy friend visit one weekend and just completely ignored her dog to spend time with the guy. She just left him outside despite him barking. I finally let him jn when I couldn’t take it anymore at like 11pm and then when he was inside she still didn’t get him so he kept pacing around the house barking and whining since her bedroom was closed. This was on a work night!! Ridiculous and disrespectful. 

What do I do and how do I address these issues? I do not think I’m being unreasonable by expecting better from her as a dog owner and from her dog. It’s disrespectful for her to let him destroy things that do not belong to her and it’s disrespectful to me and everyone within a two mile radius to just let him bark nonstop at all hours of the day.",11Dec2019,1
959,"I want to do a masters in cyber security but I've realised we get basically peanuts towards funding masters degrees and that I've left it very late to apply for postgraduate jobs. My end goal is to teach maths but I don't want to go into teaching yet because I feel like once I've achieved that goal there'll be nothing for me afterwards and I'll feel like I'm in a dead end job. A cyber security masters would give me a way out in case I ever decided to take a break or switch careers, but if I can't even afford to take one then I'll be stuck with no way out.

960,"So, I ordered my girlfriends Christmas present from a large jewellery store. A few days after, I noticed that the money had gone back into my account - so I contacted them. I assumed that the order had been cancelled and DID notify them that the money had gone back into my bank account. But, in the reply they didn't acknowledge this and just said that the order was being processed. I just got my confirmation email of it being dispatched. So, what do I do? Do I email them again about the money, or?",11Dec2019,1
961,"So like two weeks ago, I was sitting on my bed at about 1 AM. I had my lights turned off, and was on my laptop. I was wearing a light pink tank top, it wasn't super tight or anything, and it definitely covered everything (except my shoulders lol). While its pink and I am white, I suppose in the dark with minimal lighting it could have appeared to cover less than it actually did. Anyways, I (think, I might not have) also had my comforter up around my shoulders. I had my window open, and the light from my laptop kinda illuminated me I guess.  
I live in a college town. Right outside my window, about 10-15 feet away is a sidewalk. A group of guys walked by and judging from the average age of residents and the fact that this is, indeed, a college town, I'm assuming they were all within a few years of my own age.  
One of them apparently looked into my window, saw me, and immediately announced 'Guys, look at her tits!' (My window was open so I could hear them \[My cat likes to have it open when its nice outside\]). I flipped them off in front of my chest, where my hand was illuminated by the screen, and they kept walking.  
There has now been several times since where they have walked by talking about it, and telling each other to always check to see if I was there. Whenever they see me, they ask to see again. When I say no, they walk away laughing, and it's all 'Okay, next time, then, you'll show us eventually', stuff like that.

I feel like I need to wear like a parka or something that leaves literally everything to the imagination, and I feel absolutely disgusting every time I hear them.

Can I go to the police? Can I threaten them with the police? I feel like this should count as sexual harassment, right? They're asking me to strip in my own home, that can't be right.

964,"For the purposes of anonymity I have to leave some details out as they aren't mine to share. 

I have a friend, she's an amazing human being. She's a single parent on disability (became disabled after her kid was born), doesn't receive child support, and she's taking care of one of her parents. They just got hit with a rent increase that puts their two bedroom apartment out of their affordability bracket. There's nothing cheaper in our city, and they're looking at moving quite far away. Unfortunately, where they're hoping to move to has no rentals available. A few houses for sale, but rentals are few and far between. 

I'm tired of seeing her struggling. I'm tired of going over to her house and seeing her look at the food but not eat a bite because she's making sure her kid has enough. 

Would I be overstepping if I started a GoFundMe to buy them a house? Or helped them set one up? Or is it not my place to help her with something like this?",11Dec2019,1

966,"I babysit on occasion, and my mum will usually come to me and ask if I could babysit for her friends. I haven't moved out yet and don't have a job due to living arrangements. On the occasions that I do, I end up getting very little (mostly due to living situations). Once I got around $80 dollars over a week during the summer for around 4 full schooldays (around 6.5 hours here). 

I've tried to bring this up with my mum before, but it was always excused due to her friend's financial situation (which she probably assumes I'm doing it because I'm ""a good person"" and ""know her well"". Slightly irrelevant, but the lady makes me a bit uncomfortable). I have another one with a different friend of hers coming up and I'm afraid I'll get too little for a school day of work.

969,So in two days I'm leaving the U.S and I've discovered that my first of three flights was cancelled. It's not a massive deal as it's a short one and me and my friends have rented a car to get to Charlotte airport. Only downside is we were meant to get our first flight early on the 14th but now because of how things have aligned we'll have to go the Charlotte about 20 hours before the flight on the 13th. While my friends are getting a hotel I'm broke after four months here and can't really pay that expense. I'm considering staying in the airport for the night on the landside and then checking in the next morning after meeting back up.

971,"I literally just showed up in my dad’s and sister’s life irrationally after being estranged for 10 years (long story has to do with divorce). My dad willingly took me in after being abused by step dad and mom. I can tell my step mom doesn’t truly like me as time goes on since I been here for 8 months and I can see her and my dad’s marriage crumbling. I only met my step mom the first time I moved here and came back to my dad’s life. I can tell she favors my sister because they’re both alternative into tattoos and piercings where it’s just not my thing. There is awkward tension whenever my sister visits my dad, step mom, and I. She doesn’t engaged in conversation with me unless I say something first and I truly can’t help but want to be in my shell and exclude myself from them. I do feel bad for just showing up and changing their life but I’m my dad’s daughter too. My step mom never wanted kids so I’m sure she’s annoyed that I’m here which makes me uncomfortable. I really try to please her and such..I think my dad is too passive to speak up but I feel tension...more and more that I’m here. I know my dad sees me as a very sensitive person so it’s hard to talk to him as well but it’s still better than dealing with my mom and step dad 100% but I still feel lonely in a lot of ways. I don’t feel like I belong in my family...I can’t help but to distance myself even if I don’t want to because no one wants to be alone and even if I had a significant other I don’t want to drain them with me venting how I feel.

I feel trapped in my head, with only phone screens or TV’s to look at, because I’m too drained to do anything else.
