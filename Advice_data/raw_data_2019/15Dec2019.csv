But in the past 2-3 years, I have lost motivation to do anything really, I have resprted to drug addictions (just smoking, vaping) not hard drugs but drugs nonetheless. I am quite over weight and I have been trying to lose weight but its hard. College life + family + friends, its hard to get any time, by the time I get home im too exhausted to do anything.
For the past month I have been trying to eat right and lost 4 pounds. But I dont know how long I can keep this. Im 19 and already feel like like is meaningless.

2,"Okay so, there is this girl I have a crush on who worked at the same place I do. We talked from time to time about work and school related stuff. I am like 100% sure she does not like me and additionally I am just insecure about myself. Right now I am talking to her through Instagram and I suspect this may be the last time we will ever talk.

I would even want to just chill, however I suspects she just sees me as an 'ex-colleague'.

Any advice?",15Dec2019,1

5,"I was recently told that my cousin(Ash) has anorexia. I her parents found out 3 months ago and I was just told. I usually didn’t hang out with her because she was a few years older and hung out with my male cousins at family gatherings. I realized how awesome and cool she is and I talked with her more. I invited her over and we made cream puffs. She was being distant and cold and I thought she thought I was a stupid little nuisance and I was bothering her, so I stopped trying to hang out with her and we didn’t really talk. Last time I saw her was some time before Halloween and I am visiting her tomorrow, I think it’s going to be weird and I don’t know what to say.",15Dec2019,1
6,"I was just on my lunch break earlier and this lady just comes up to my car crying and panicking. I roll down my window and she asks if I could “give her a ride a couple blocks to her car because her boyfriend and her dad just beat her up”. 

Obviously my first thought “yeah of course get in”, but I hesitated for the simple fact that where I work isn’t the safest or drug-free place in the world. I wanted to let her in but didn’t wanna be on the wrong end of a setup. 
 
I asked her why cant she just call the police, honestly they would be alot more help than I would and the boyfriend and dad she mentioned were nowhere in sight so it wasn’t really a “critical “ situation. Also I don’t understand why her car was parked a couple blocks away when where she came from was across the street.

She said “its not in my nature “ which is a pretty odd reply to me , if two people just jumped you and you afraid they’ll come after you. Five seconds after that she said whatever, mumbled something and walked away. 

This all took place in a span of like 30 seconds and although I really wanted to help her, I just felt like I picked up on so many warnings signs. Or maybe Im wrong and she did have a good reason for not calling the cops, either way I made my decision and my question is, WWYD?",15Dec2019,1

**Quick Intro :**  
So I was in an LDR with this girl. She was my first girlfriend as I've only dated boys before (I'm a bisexual girl). We're 22 and 24 (I was 21 when we first got together if that's of any relevance). We're both from the same country but I live abroad for school. We first started talking in February this year, then met a month after that in March and went on a couple of dates, then I had to leave back for uni and in May we decided to make things official and started an ldr. I used to say I'll never date someone who lives so far away, but I was so infatuated with this girl in a way that I've never felt before so it all just made sense. Things were amazing at first, albeit quite lonely. Fast forward to September, I was visiting home so we finally got to meet again. It went well and we were so in love. October comes and I have to leave again and we're back to long distance.

**LDR sucks :**  
Here's the thing, after leaving the second time, I spent more days feeling sad than happy, and I started realizing that distance sucks more than I thought and I just wanted to be around her again. I'm a very affectionate person and I always need the kind of attention one can only give in person. Not to mention she's always busy with school and projects so she's not always around, and calls were very rare, we mainly just texted but I couldn't do anything about it. I just tried my best to be supportive and not show how lonely I was. At some point, I started to feel like I wasn't on her list of priorities, which she always denied so I thought that was probably just me being needy and insecure. But I also felt like I was giving more love than I was receiving. I sent her letter, gifts, made her playlists, wrote her poems, all those hopeless romantic things. But she wasn't much into big love gestures and never did any of that. She doesn't use pet names and even found sending heart emojis too cheesy. I mentioned a couple of times that I wanted her to be more expressive and affectionate because if I can't see or hear her, I at least needed to find some reassurance in her words. That's all I asked for, but she still found it hard to deliver.

**The breakup :**  
So a month goes by and I try to hide these feelings, until one day mid-November we have a small argument and things escalated and I started pouring my heart out and said that I felt dissatisfied with the relationship, amongst many other things. Upon hearing that, she said it shocked her because she had no idea I felt that way about the relationship. (I take the blame for my poor communication skills.) Anyway, things got ugly: she felt like I'm trying to change her and that she'll never be enough for me the way things are, and we argued about it for three days straight until she decided to call it quits, claiming it's for the best. For a while, I was in disbelief that she chose to leave me instead of trying to work it out. But when she was breaking up with me, she said it's a break and that she wants to be with me one day when we're both ready for it and hopefully closer geographically. So there I was, a couple of days after out 6th Monthaversay, single again.  
An important thing to mention is that she had plans to move to the country I live in since before she even met me, and she's actually working on it and planning to after she graduates. That helped me be patient because I knew that one day she'd be here and we'd no longer have to be apart and we'd be happy and things would be perfect. Fantasy stuff, I know. But I spent the whole relationship dreaming about that perfect future, spent every day waiting for the time to come, but the relationship ended before any of that ever came true.

**Post-breakup :**  
It's been a month now and I feel like I went through all the stages. The mourning, the depression, the sadness, the numbness, the hatred, the missing, everything. It all comes and goes like waves and I feel like every day is a literal rollercoaster of emotions. I don't even know what I'm feeling anymore. One second I'm hating her with all my guts, the next I'm bawling my eyes out wishing she was here to hold me. Pretty basic breakup stuff, probably, but I wouldn't know because I've never been dumped before. I think about her all the time, and I know it's unhealthy but I can't stop.  
And I tried pretty much all I could to cope with it, I write about it almost every day, I'm binging on food and Netflix. I tried to hang out with people as much as I can so I'm not left alone with my pain but that only worked for the first couple of weeks then I subconsciously started isolating myself and now I feel too lonely to function. My social and school life are suffering because of this. Most days I barely make it out of bed. The pain is significantly less but now I just feel stuck in a haze. I'm avoiding all interaction with people around me(I don't have many friends to begin with), some days I feel like I don't belong in my own body like it's just doing its thing on auto-pilot while I observe from afar. I'm not sure if I'm clinically depressed or if these are all just breakup symptoms. I'm terrified this will go on for much longer because it's unbearable. I thought I would be better after a month goes by and yet I'm obviously not. I guess the main problem is my loneliness. My closest friends also live far away, and while they do their best to help, there's only so much that texts and calls can do. I just wish someone would hug me and never stop. (Luckily though I'm flying back home soon for Christmas break. I hope that being around my family and loved ones would finally get me out of this rut).

**Some of the reasons why I can't let go :**  
I feel like the reason most people feel broken after a relationship ends is that they have to let go of all the memories and time they've shared with this person. In my case, I feel broken because I mourn the times I kept looking forward to having and the perfect future I kept imagining but that never came. I feel like the relationship ended before it even started. And that makes it very hard to let go because there are so many things I was sure we were going to experience together at some point, but that time just never came.  
She still reaches out almost every other day to catch up. We obviously don't talk as much as we used to, but we still do. At some point, I heard about the no contact thing and told her to stop talking to me. But I felt so horrible and initiated contact again within a couple of days. I feel better knowing that we're not turning into enemies or strangers, so I think this works for me. What bothers me is that I see her posting and interacting on social media and she seems to be doing so well. She always looks like she's having fun, while I spend my days crying under my sheets wishing I was already dead. And she's making significant work progress, while I don't even have the energy to go to class to class these days. It sucks to know that this is affecting me way more than it is affecting her and that she gets to be so happy despite not having me.  
Also, the fact that she insists it's a ""break"" makes it impossible to want to move on because in the back of my mind I'm holding on to the hope that one day we'll be together again, and that I shouldn't date anyone so that I don't fall in love with someone else and lose her in the process.

**TL;DR :** Ldr gf of 6 months broke up with me because I was feeling dissatisfied and she felt like she wasn't enough. She claims it's a break and that she wants to be with me one day when we're both in a better place.

**Request** : I would like to get an honest opinion on this. Does she seem in the wrong or is it really me? Do you think the relationship is doomed or should I keep hope? Also, any general advice about how to let go etc is more than welcome. And honestly, I'd appreciate any kind of feedback/opinion/advice.",15Dec2019,1

10,"Also, I do not have a crush on my cousin. Never ever. This is what I did because I wanted to be closer to her, and at the same time what I've done to cause her to remove me on Snapchat, as well as block me on Instagram:

1.I've asked my cousin 2-3 times when she's going to upload another photo to Instagram (last time was July).

2.I've told my cousin's boyfriend that I miss my cousin several times, and when I do that he says she misses me too, but I honestly am sure that's complete bullshit.

3.Because my cousin's boyfriend had stopped responding to my messages (previously he answered almost every time), and I wanted to see if he was actually seeing the messages I sent to him, I sent him a picture of my hip which I had beat until it became red, and I did it because I was incredibly sad that I think my cousin hates me and wants me to die. When I told him why I did it, he told me to stop and that my cousin likes me and cares about me. Again, this is probably complete bullshit, and is actually the opposite.

4.I probably made my cousin irritated when I told her she's the best football player in the world (she plays football in a football team), because I wanted her to feel nice. 

5.Few months ago, when I was at my aunt's 50th anniversary party, I tried to impress my cousin by drinking beer even though I'm not allowed to, and it backfired because she became mad at me and took away the beer, probably just because she just wanted to feel good for herself that she stopped a crime, not because she wanted to care about her little cousin.

6.At the same party, me, my cousin and her boyfriend were going to go outside to take a walk with our dogs, but it was late at night so it was really cold and my cousin became mad at me for not putting on extra clothes, so I couldn't go with them until I put on a jacket. I had told her when I walked outside without a jacket that she wants me to get a cold, and that that was the reason why I did it.

7.I once got a picture of my cousin from my cousin's boyfriend, and I told him to tell her I think she looks good, then he told me she says I look good too. This was probably just a lie though to make me feel good. 

8.I once washed my cousin's plate, bowl and glass after she was done with her midnight snack, but she didn't thank me, which has to be because I’m awful and can't understand anything. I probably shouldn't have expected a thanks, as I'm just a stupid kid.

9.I got really nervous when I met them once, because I was playing guitar and my cousin asked me if I was practising trying to play a song, and well I just said uuuuh um for like five seconds, because I didn't want to say the wrong answer. 

This is why I really wanted to become friends with her:

1.She called me cute once when I described what the letters in her name meant.

2.She offered me a ride to the store to buy candy.

3.She offered me her used Coke Zero one time, and although I didn't like it before when I had tried, I drank it because it was my cousin who offered me the drink, and just because I tasted my cousin's used Coke Zero I now drink it instead of regular Coke. That's good I guess? 

4.My cousin made me food once late at night.

5.My cousin let me choose the music we were going to listen to from her phone when we were in the car.

6.She has recommended me several good TV shows.

7.She accepts all my hugs, unlike my most of my friends.

8.She let me excercise with her for one day, even though I don't actually excercise most of the time.

9.She is always so sweet compared to girls in my class.

ALSO, just a few hours ago, I saw that my aunt had posted a picture of my cousin's diploma she had gotten for being extremely talented at her job. I posted a comment on it saying ""Congratulations hard working [my cousin's name]"", then like a few seconds afterwards she liked my comment and she also posted heart emojis, not sure if it was a reply towards me specifically (I seriously seriously doubt it), but who knows. So I guess she doesn't hate me 100%? It's probably a misunderstanding though

11,"I've noticed this a bit over the years. I'll have a friend (someone I went to school with, used to work with, etc.) and we'll be texting just fine...as in they are replying, talking, answering questions, etc. and all is going fine. Then bam, one day they just stop replying...even though I can see they read the message they never reply again. When I follow up and asked what happened...they again read it but never reply. 

Nearly every single time this happens...it's a female. Why is this? Why can't women act like adults and simply tell you they are tired of talking to you or they feel you did something wrong or whatever? Why do women so often disappear and ignore you rather then simply telling you why they aren't going to talk to you again?",15Dec2019,1

13,"Recently I've been thinking that I'm was fine but I've started to realise that that's not the case. There are alot of things that I've been bottling up and it's start to weigh on me.  I also don't have anyone to talk to about this so that's why I'm here.

One of those things is that I don't feel very loved. I have my parents and I know they love me very much but apart from that no one really shows me they love me that much. I think this feeling also has to do with the fact that I had alot of toxic friends in the past who were pretty terrible to me and with the fact that my first girlfriend (I'm a lesbian btw), who I loved very much, never loved me back and one day just dumped me.

I think these things have made me think I'm not worth much which is probably why I'm constantly looking for a girl to validate me. I've tried dating apps but that really hasn't been working out. I heard this girl who I kinda like kissed with some random girl at a party. That's fine but I just I wish I was that girl, I wish someone would show me that I'm worth loving. It's why I keep looking for love or even just someone to make-out with, anything to forget the loneliness.

Anyone know how to deal with this? Is there a way to find someone who will show me I matter",15Dec2019,1

15,"(Writing this on behalf of a friend) Our company has had a temp admin for a few months while looking for someone permanent. They were a recommendation from our HR director as they’re neighbors. She’s been getting worse and worse in terms of both attitude and performance. She will yell at people, refuse to help with basic duties, and will be openly aggressive if she doesn’t like you. These complaints fall on deaf ears because the person who should be taking care of it is the one who put her up for the job. 

Here’s the issue, Friday we had our company holiday party. My friend and coworker has also been having issues with this girl and it has been getting worse as my friend has stopped reacting. At 3:30am, my friend received a text from this girl saying she should know that on Monday she is going to confront her (friend) and will be getting to the bottom of what her  problem is.

16,"Sorry if the title sounds dramatic.  I need some honest advice right now and I need all the insight I can get.

I am a D1 athlete and am currently attending my hometown's university.  I just finished my second season here.  I was a starter, played every minute until I got injured, and decided to transfer to bigger school 20 hours away from home.  I had a full scholarship at my local school and will have a full scholarship at the new school.  I signed my financial agreement (scholarship) and I am supposed to leave next month.

Like I said, I got injured.  It's my second time getting this injury and it required surgery both times. The new school still wants me.  My local school's head coach just got fired, so there's a new coach in town that already started recruiting transfers.  I haven't met the new coach as I wasn't planning on staying, obviously.

However, things have been taking a turn in my life and I'm so conflicted with what I should do.

I just got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and have been dealing with it for years unmedicated.  I start medication this week and have been in therapy for the past two weeks.  I am in the middle of the worst depressive episode I have ever had.  I don't know if it's because I got injured, because I'm leaving everything I know, because I'm afraid, I don't know.  I just don't know what to do or how to feel.

I do not think I am mentally healthy to leave my hometown and my support system.  I was closer to suicide than I ever have been this past week.  I had a plan, I picked out a day, everything.  The only reason I didn't do it was because one of my friends begged me for the last of my alcohol, which is what I was going to use to assist in my overdose.

I decided to tell my parents about how I was feeling last night.  They just want me to be happy.  But they also believe I should honor my commitment to the new school.  I do too.  But I also feel like I might end up dead as a result.  I just can't see myself getting through this alive.  There's so much going on in my life right now. 

I doubt I would even be able to get my scholarship back from my original school but I don't even care at this point.  I feel like I would rather get a job and have to walk back onto the team than leave.  But I don't know if that's my situation clouding reality or not.

I originally wanted to leave this school because I wanted to play pro.  But after mapping out the logistics, I wouldn't make enough money out of school to support my dream.  And even then, I don't know if it's my dream anymore.  I feel like I have been playing for the wrong reasons.  I just want to finish out my last two years and have fun with them, then go to grad school.  I think that's what I want, but I don't know.  I just don't know anymore.

I'm so conflicted. I don't know if I can get out of the financial contract (I'm pretty sure those are made to protect me, not them), I don't know if I can get my original scholarship back or if the coach would even want me. I don't know.

Please give me your insight.  I just want to be happy.",15Dec2019,1
17,"I’ll keep it short because usually I get carried away, but basically last month I weighed 99.8kg and suddenly this motivation just bolted towards me with a goal to get far away from 100kg as soon as possible.  It was honestly the best thing ever.

My weight started from just being lazy, not so much what I was eating. I would game for hours and not go to the gym or do any type of physical activity except take my doggo for a walk in the morning and afternoon. The eating wasn’t exactly the healthiest foods, but I would only eat in the morning and at night. My diet was probably, cereal, toast, sugary drinks, water, meat dishes and rice, salad and veggies, etc. 

When this motivation struck me I actually managed to lose a whole 9kg from going to the gym, and eating nothing but veggies and fruit with occasional meat dishes. I took out rice, bread, everything else. 

This past week that motivation just ran back to wherever the heck it was living. I can’t be bothered to go to the gym anymore, my eating is not frequent but turning to snacky foods which I hadn’t eaten in agesss. I feel stuck again and honestly if my body was allowed to stay in bed all day it just would. 

I don’t know what to do :( Please give me some advice.",15Dec2019,1
18,"I didn't really know where to ask a question and get responses. So, I chose here.

I am British, I was born in England, my whole family was, and moved to America when I was 6 years old.

My older brother was 9. We went to a British American Elementary school, which included having an English curriculum and English teachers. Through this, I spoke with an English accent to my teachers and at home with family, and learned the American accent through my classmates and friends. I am still this way, I have two accents, I don't know how to describe how that works. My brother never got the American accent, as he was quite older than me. I have a younger sister who was born 8 years after me, in the U.S and doesn't have an English accent at all, of course.

Anyway, I am now 21, and in my last year of college. We visit home at least once a year, and I always love it. My brother, 24, is planning on moving back to the UK. My parents also have a long-term plan for building a house in the UK, so we can visit more frequently and for long periods at a time.

My question is to those that are British-American, and moved back home- how was the adjustment?

I am 50/50 on whether moving back home would be something I would be able to do. I do feel closely connected to home. Even though I am very 'Americanized' now, there is a strong culture disconnect, where I do not feel ""American"". but, on the other hand, I feel like it would be hard to adjust. I would have to relearn how to drive, how to get around, culture differences, and etc. Obviously, it wouldn't be as hard for me, since all of my family live there, and that is my home. But, I feel like I have been here for so long. I just need others' opinions and advice on what to do with the situation. My ideal life would be having a job where I can live partly in America, and partly in England. Though, that would be tricky finding out that would allow those conditions. I want to have British children, so they can call me mum :)

19,"Hey Reddit.  This is obviously anonymous, but my mom is trying to kill my dad and I...or I believe she is.

My dad is on death’s door anyways.  He has type two diabetes and has had a quadruple bypass.  I’m a healthy, young kid, but now that I’ve come out as trans, we’ve had no issues.

I went through my first semester of college and now I’m home for Christmas.  She has been drinking a lot (she just got out of rehab this past summer and missed my graduation because of it) and feeding my dad nothing but sugar.  Coke, candy, cakes, and everything that isn’t sugar has been fried.  We both know this will kill him but she won’t let me cook.

I had a gastric sleeve a long time ago and I can no longer eat a bunch of things.  She refuses to feed me what I can eat that doesn’t make me sick (like she forced me to eat five pieces of pizza—which I don’t have the capacity or capability to do) and will beat me if I don’t.

I’ve always been a little bit paranoid, but this time I think she’s trying to kill us.  She won’t allow me to leave the house to go shopping and she’ll beat the shit out of me when I do that, so leaving or buying my own groceries isn’t an option.  My grandma and grandpa won’t let me call the police, and I respect them too much.  They believe that I don’t have a valid reason to need help.

The smell is just WOW ridiculously bad. Worse than anything I’ve picked up from the moldiest of thrift stores. And on top of that, it has some relatively noticeable stains on it that weren’t shown in pictures or in the description. They almost look like bleach stains? The seller was being incredibly nice to me and sadly I think I know why... this jacket is kind of worse than what was shown. I hate getting into eBay drama especially because our interactions were so nice and I asked a lot of questions about the sizing (don’t want them to think I’m just trying to get a refund bc it won’t fit or whatever) but also bc it’s so close to Christmas at this point, and I’m panicking a little because that was my budget for her for Christmas but I don’t think I can give that smelly thing to her with a good conscience.

I have like 3 girls that I can hang out with minimal questioning, but even then, the usual answer to “Can I go to the mall with blah and blah?” is “Why? Who are you meeting there? (literally no one) Why does she always wanna go to the mall? I was a kid, I know all your tricks. If you’re doing something it’s better to just tell us now.” I would get it if I had history of sneaking out, or doing drugs, or anything bad, but NO. I have never touched drugs or alcohol, never kissed anyone, never done anything stupid or dangerous, never stole. They know this because they’ve asked and I’ve told them, and they think I’m lying. I basically only hang out with girls, but now I’m making more male friends, and I literally am not allowed to hang out with them. Their reason is that boys are still boys and since you’re a pretty girl, they have motives. They’re good friends, and I was inviting other girls, but still no. Why don’t they trust me? I tell them exactly where I’m going (usually the nearby mall/plaza), who with, what we’re doing, and what time and that isn’t enough to get rid of their suspicion. I get great grades, I’m a really good artist, I play piano, I’m respectful and the ONLY arguments me and my parents really get into are over this issue. What I’m saying is I could be doing so much worse, but they don’t think I’m good enough to be trusted. I rarely bring it up because they’re so hard to talk to. Always some form of raising their voice or threatening me with taking things away or used to be hitting me for having an attitude. At the same time they tell me “You can tell us anything, we want to be part of your life.” I never know when the nice side or mean side is there, so I have to wait until they’re in a good mood, which is rare. I’ve had to miss out on so many group hangouts and events over this dumbness. I’ve been invited to my crush’s house and to hang out with him in a group BY HIM. I had to make up some random excuse, and I hope he doesn’t think I’m not interested. He literally likes me back and I know it’s just a crush, but I feel like I’ll never make those high school memories or have any fun, because I can’t. I am just so suffocated and sick of staying inside when I’m invited to things all the time and am forced to say no. People are starting to stop inviting me because they know I can never go. I hate it so much. There’s no good reason for it either, it’s either “because we are your parents/ because I said so” or “you’re too young (I’m a freshman), people could kidnap you.” I don’t know what to do.",15Dec2019,1
25,"Any tips on how to get back on track? Felt like I had a great streak where I was very happy with my mental health. Had some great habits going and was just very happy where my life was heading.

After some time I felt like it started going downhill in summer for some unknown reason. It got worse from day to day and I could feel the downward slope. The thing is I don't know how to stop it.

Right now I stopped going to school and the doc diagnosed me with heavy depression again. Tested blood and it's all good. Suicidal thoughts have returned and I hate my life and also I feel like I am surrounding myself with the wrong people, even though they're not bad people.

Is it just returning depression? Is it the cold weather? Even thinking about just moving somewhere else but I can't just stop my education. Don't know if I have the energy though and a clear enough head for that. Like the post yesterday, self care is officially over we're doing drugs again. Stopped doing my workout for a month.

27,"I had to put my cat down 3 weeks ago today, it was a traumatizing and heartbreaking experience that I feel as though I’ll never get over. There is so much guilt and regret built up inside me about the whole thing, but I don’t really want to go into detail.

About a week after his death I adopted a kitten, and ever since I’ve had extreme anxiety about her. When I brought her home to my dogs, who originally I would trust with my own life with them being genuine sweethearts, I couldn’t help but get super anxious when they got close to her and Id pick her up and take her away. I’m a lot better about it now, and she’s okay with having the dogs around as am I.

However, I’ve refrained from leaving my house at night and going out with friends because I feel as though I have some type of separation anxiety towards this kitten. I’m always worried she’s in some type of danger or that she’s gonna hurt herself, or that I’m not caring for her properly. I even get on my boyfriend sometimes for the way he treats her, and he tells me i’m overreacting. I think it has something to do with the loss of my first cat, but I’m not really sure.

30,"I’m currently in high school and am surrounded by fake ass boring people. A few years ago, I was friends with many great, supportive, and awesome people but unfortunately they all left. This wasn’t really a major deal until recently. A lot of my current friends only talk to me when they have to and prioritize a lot of other people over me. Some don’t really give a shit about me too. I can’t just “make new friends” because these guys are really all I have left. All the other people in my school are annoying and even more toxic. I have been going through a lot recently, and this has really been getting in my head. I have noticed that I’ve became more vulnerable, insecure, and lonelier recently. I’ve been overthinking everything about me, especially my personality (maybe it’s my change in personality [if there is one] that’s causing them to be fake to me?). I also started feeling unwanted and I feel that people really never cared to talk to me anymore than before. Any advice for this?

31,"I am the youngest child with an elder sister and i recently moved away from my parents house to go to college. My mom used to work a couple years ago but my parents recently moved away from home and so, my mom has nothing to do now. Also, now that my parents have moved, they have very few friends. I am really worried about my mom, as i dont want her life to be as empty as it is right now. She is extremely smart and educated, but cant seem to find a job for months. Of course, my family is financially stable due to my dads job, but im worried, that my mom has no sense of purpose left. she is home alone for most of the day until my dad gets back from work. Luckily, i am only a 2hour train from my parents, so i can visit them.

36,"Background: Ever since I was a kid I have dreamed of going to an Ivy League college(MIT). Because of this I have worked hard in school and gotten A and B grades. I also during the school year have taken college classes to raise my GPA to the 3.95 it is right now. These college classes have allowed me to graduate early at the age of 17. For my senior year(actually junior) I decided to take 3 APs to help raise me to a 4.0. 

I have tried everything but physics for me is just not clicking. My other APs I have As in so these types of classes are not the problem. I have always had bad anxiety which I take medicine for but physics has caused my anxiety to be even worse. I have had so many breakdowns over this class this year and it is starting to affect my other classes. I currently have a 70 in the class but I know that I am not going to pass the midterm. I cannot allow my GPA to lower. My parents don’t care and are fine with this since they know my grades are usually good. I just can’t let myself go down to a 3.75. I have sacrificed hobby’s, interests, friends, and genuine relationships all for my grades. I don’t even know what I’m truly I interested in because all I have focused on is school. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I am just drifting through life. I don’t even know what I want to study in college because I have not experimented with anything. I constantly buy new things for new hobby’s every week trying to find something that will make me happy in life. My family life is ok but I don’t feel as if I truly connect with anyone. I have had thoughts of suicide since sixth grade. I feel as if my only option now is to end my life. A major part of this is because of my GPA lowering but another part is because I’m not happy.",15Dec2019,1
37,"This is pretty long but I desperately need help. Please read. I  was around 7 when my Dad started complaining about feeling little pains around his his chest and abdomen. We didn’t think much of it, as he has HHT (Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, he also takes Tegretol for his seizures which he hasn’t had in 20 years) we assumed it was just another one of his symptoms. Around this same time he said that my mother would scratch him in his sleep, he claimed to see her do it, he also says that she would cry out for his help in her sleep, followed by a loud growling sound, and that a pug would bark outside the window of their bedroom at 3am every night. When I was around 10 - 11 years old he began to associate his pains with my mother, saying she had laser eyes. My mother continued to endure this in relative silence. Then a year later he claimed to see my mothers eyes turn green and lizard- like or just plain white, that when he saw her blink too much or when she would yawn or scratch her nose she was causing him harm. He hagan calling her a “lagartija” the Spanish word for lizard or just animal , and called the pains he felt biopsias, chispas, picoteasos, rayos, ataques morrales injections. He also bagan accusing my siblings and I. Especially my mother and I however. He also began accusing coworkers of being lagartijas and eventually random people in public, or people driving. He claims that whenever car lights change because of bumps in the road, it’s actually because the lagartija is using the lights to attack him. Now I’m 15 and a year ago He began making “shields”  out of aluminum foil, mirrors and wires. He believes that they reflect the rays He carries multiple on his person at all times. Even wearing an entire aluminum metal plate vest under his construction worker vest (keep in mind he’s an electrician) He’s constantly looking for another lagartija, always moving his mirrors and Shields  My family in general are very devout catholics. In church he’s constantly looking over his shoulder and adjusting himself to stop their attacks. He believes that his pains and what he sees, is a gift from God. That he’s been chosen to rid the world of lagartijas. Which is basically everyone at this point. He’s found obscure bible verses and uses them to justify himself, his coworkers feed him more horseshit to just tease him , saying stuff like “ I’m an octopus, I’m a Scorpion and we attack differently blah blah blah” Only feeding his persecution, he believes that he’s one of the only real humans left. That everyone is possessed by that lagartija, which has just become a euphemism for the devil. He repeats constant phrases about how we need to free ourselves from this possession. How everyone is a lagartija and they all attack him because he’s the most saintly pure person. Anything we say to convince him otherwise he takes as just the lagartija defending itself. He’s begun accusing our dog, he says that he would love to kill every lagartija he sees, saying that they harm him so he should just defend himself. My siblings and I have been forced to ride in the back of our SUV because the backseat is now occupied by 5 body sized mirrors lying parallel to each other, designed to stop the lagartijas while he’s driving . My mother after bottling up her emotions since before this all began 9 years ago has been going through her own mid-life crisis, and is now yelling at him in her defense, saying he’s sick and he needs to stop accusing her.  Everyday the same argument occurs, multiple times, the same yells, the same accusations, it repeats with no end. We took him to his doctor and spoke with her privately about the situation she prescribed some antidepressants, which he refused to take because they would cause drowsiness, and he needs to be alert on the job site. He says he’s open to speaking with a priest, but gets angry whenever we get close to arranging a visit with one. 4 years ago my grandmother died, and it only worsened him. My grandmother was very superstitious, and also very religious. She also would complain about pains, but she was old after all, why wouldn’t she? Regardless my dad is now fully convinced that it was the lagartijas that killed her, he now vows revenge of some sort. This has all been really stressful for my mother, and for the rest of my family. I dread going home to hear him accuse me or my mother, I try to avoid him as much as I can, and I can’t look at him directly anymore, out of fear he’ll accuse me again. He can’t go 10 minutes without feeling something or seeing something, and then proceeding to complain, and accuse people, this causes my mother to yell back, and the cycle continues. I hate it. I can’t live like this anymore, I love my father and I don’t know what to do, the situation is just unbearable. I want to help him, I just don’t know how, I’ve tried being patient, but earlier this year I snapped and yelled at him. I feel horrible, I apologized profusely. But I still feel guilty. That doesn’t matter, what matters is somehow getting him help. Anything would be of some good really. I’m willing to answer any questions.",15Dec2019,1
38,"So this post is about my sister, obviously. All my life, she’s been spoiled crazy even though we’re not rich or anything, so she gets to do whatever she wants around the house because my parents let her do that. A few years ago, they stopped spoiling her and instead decided to let her do whatever she wanted. But I don’t like that and always try to make sure she can’t have her way when it puts me or my parents in a bad situation. Because of this, we get into fights but since she’s my sister I don’t want to hurt her. She doesn’t have this problem and because of that, I have multiple scratches on my body from her. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should contact the police or not, because she’s over 18 now and I don’t want her to get into any serious trouble. But at the same time I can’t keep living like this, where every time she does something unfair, I can’t do anything about it because she takes it personally and lashes out. Only reason that I’m writing this now is because we just had a fight like this where she broke something important to me and I wanted her to pay but she was saying that she didn’t have to. I just told her to back off because she was trying to break it even more, since she apparently didn’t break it according to her. When I tried to push her away from my stuff, she swung her arm and left nail slashes on my neck and on my chest. I really need advice on what to do because I can’t keep living like this.",15Dec2019,1
39,"My family don't own a home so we mostly move around a lot based on how long our rent contract thing is and while we have we've noticed a few odd things like clothes going missing, nothing major. At my old house while I was at a friend's house my brother called up my parents really really panicked because he was supposed to be home alone and could hear a man breathing and walking around outside. He hid in his closet and was called a liar because we couldn't find any evidence of this man so we brushed it off as him trying to troll us like he commonly does. This was the house that clothes would commonly go missing however, they would just vanish when we all went out to work/school from the clothes line. I think maybe this guy was taking them.

That isn't the only time stuff like this has happened though. One time while me and my mother were driving home I realised she started taking wrong turns and when I questioned her about it she said that the car behind her had been trailing us for nearly the entire twenty minute drive from where she picked me up all the way out into where we live now which is essentially pretty new, being mostly country side that people are building on now. This is weird because the way we had gone there was litterally nothing but road and it was the longest route to turn around and go back to our house. Everyone who lives here knows to just take the shorter road, but this car kept following us until we finally managed to shake it with a few quick turns.

I feel like whoever was following us had probably waited at where my mother works and wanted to find out where we live again, but I also think the next time they tried we didn't notice it.

Just last night our fire alarm went off three times in the span of forty minutes at midnight. We pulled the battery out because we needed to rest and there was definitely no fire or any electrical equipment on. However my mother who sleeps in a bedroom with a direct view of the road heard a truck come up around 2 am, parking right outside our house. Note that we are the first house on the street, there are no lights, the other side is a swamp/forest kind of mix and the rest of the houses are next to use but there drive ways kind of wrap further up the road. There is no one else but us here. She looked out the window and saw a white truck with a man pointing something electronic at our house, it didn't look like a camera or anything according to her but I don't know because I didn't see it personally. As soon as the man saw my mother peeking out her window he drove off.

My main concern is just how often is a truck pulling up outside our house at two am because if it weren't for that fire alarm we would not have seen him. 

I'm not really sure what we should do in this situation, so any suggestions would be nice.",15Dec2019,1

43,"I’m a 22 year old female. My sister is 10. My parents divorced when I was younger and my dad had a child with another woman and married her a year after. Then she got pregnant and had my sister. I have had a very poor relationship with my dads wife. She’s very immature, entitled and rude. 
Recently I’ve been trying to make amends with her because I’m just honestly tired of arguing and stupid comments/glares at the holidays.
 I’ve personally gotten over what my step mom and I have been through but she hasn’t (even tho it was literally never that bad..) so things have been going great and I’m seeing my little sister more.
 Well... being around her is a little hard and frustrating for me. Like I know she’s a kid, she’s 10. I know that. I don’t see her often at all... a few times per year? But now that things are getting better I see her a lot more often and I got pretty excited. I bought her a nice Christmas gift and I also promised her that once she got back from vacation (my parents and her are going somewhere for Christmas for 2 weeks so we are celebrating Christmas early) my boyfriend, my brother and I would take her to a movie, dinner and then to build a bear. I love stuffies even tho I’m older and I love build a bear. I thought it would be really fun if I took her there and got us matching stuffed animals. 
Well... now I’m not so sure. 
She’s always been kinda... rude and a little spoiled. Way more spoiled than my brother and I were. In my opinion anyways. 
She is 10, she has a phone, a laptop, and a million toys that she abuses. I know they’re just toys but today at dinner she threw a bunch of her stuffed animals around the room for “fun.” 
I asked her if she ever played with her toys or cuddled her stuffed animals and she said not really so I was like oh well maybe you won’t like if we went to build a bear and she complained and said she wants to go still. 
She was rude to my bf and pointed out his acne, she also stared at me and criticized my makeup because I wear colourful makeup (I wanna be a makeup artist and I get creative this time of year.) she told me that it was “too much” and I told her that’s it’s okay that she has her own opinion but it’s my face and my body so I can do what I like as long as I like it. 
The past 2 times I’ve been there she has been (in my opinion) really inappropriately dressed and it makes me really uncomfortable. She wears a skirt that doesn’t cover her butt all the way and she literally flashed me all night and bent over all the time and I was like wtf?? Why doesn’t my step mom or dad say anything because I KNOW if I ever dressed like that when I was her age I’d be in trouble. And she was wearing knee high socks the last time I was there with the same skirt that I could see her butt. My dad literally called me a whore when I was a child for wearing a shirt that has a tiny bit of cleavage and I was like 15.  She’s 10 and flashing all her relatives and no one said a thing?? My bf and brother both were uncomfortable along with me but no one else said a word. 
Anyways, I feel really hesitant to take her to build a bear now because I worry she won’t appreciate it at all and I’ll be spending 40$ on something she’s just gonna throw against her wall and forget about. Idk if I’m overreacting cause she’s just a kid but I felt a little hurt. She also opened her present I gave her and threw it around the room seeing if it would “break open”... I also bought her some headbands cause she’s in every sport possible and it would be helpful and she looked at me and said “yeah I’ll never wear these” like oh okay..?

49," I (22F) just graduated from a top university program with the highest honours. All my life, I have been a great student, excelling everyone's expectations. Everyone around be, parents, relatives and teachers, thought I would be a doctor. When everyone in your life tells you ever since you were a child about what you should do, you start believing it and pursuing it and defining your identity around it. That is what I did.

But in my final years of college, I started have doubts, questioning everything I was doing. I didn't feel happy in any of my classes and was just doing things other pre-med students were doing, half-heartedly and purpose-lessly. I was depressed, not taking care of myself, spending days in bed with no motivation. But no one knew cuz I didn't want them to know. I am good at faking it and keeping my emotions bottled. So I did what was expected, in my final year before graduation, I applied to medical school thinking I have come this far and this is what is expected of me. I didn't get in and after that, my depression has worsened.

I didn't attend my own graduation even though I had one of th highest GPAs in my class. I was ashamed, not because I didnt get into medical school when everyone else did, but because I was at a point in my life where I didn't know who I was and who I wanted to be. I am constantly surrounded by those who know where they are going and at least have a plan. For me, when all my life I have worked toward becoming one thing and now I am realizing that one thing isn't for me,I FEEL LOST, HOPELESS, like a failure, DEJECTED, not good enough and the list goes on.

Now, my parents keep asking that I should apply to med again but I know in my heart that is not what I want in my life. It has been a while since I have been feeling it but only recently I came to terms with it. My parents aren't the forcing type but they want answers about what I want to do if not med. And I DON'T have those answers. I don't know anymore. I am not motivated to do anything. Even my own family doctor expected me to be a doctor lol so I have disappointed her too and I cant even talk to her about my depression because I know first thing she would ask me when I go to her is why I am not applying again and try to convince me to apply again. It sucks when you don't feel a safe space with your own doctor cuz she says what my parents say.

I am only 22 but my parents think I am getting old and need to get my life together, settle down. And at this point, I don't even think life is worth living when all I have done so far is disappoint everyone around me and will continue to disappoint as I don't know where to go next. I just need a reason to live and to go one because everyday its hard to get myself up and do things. I want to live a fulfilling life, do something that makes me happy, but right now, I just need a will to live and to move forward and I don't have any of that.

50,"I’m going to be blunt: As I get older, I realize that I’m not as great of a person as I’d like to be. In fact, I’m very far from it. There is so much that I find I dislike about myself that I feel like I’m drowning in terms of trying to find ways to be better. 

I am at the age now that I understand that I cannot purely blame my upbringing on why I act and think the way that I do. But I find that some of the traits that I’ve adopted from my parents are extremely hard to improve in myself without getting some sort of feedback, I guess:

My father has always been hypercritical, so I feel that it has most likely stemmed from that. I find myself judging people for such stupid, minute things: “she is so loud all of the time,” or “they’re a try-hard.” I find flaws in most everyone I meet despite knowing that I, too, have so many flaws. This overall has made me such a negative person in almost every aspect of my life and I hate it. When I make a judgement like this in my head, I immediately remind myself that I’m just as flawed, but in my own ways. That is not how I want to be. And also, different upbringings=different normalized behavior. For example, my dad always hated when things would get loud and “crazy,” but my mom is naturally a loud person because of the way she was raised. So I have one parent that despises a behavior, and another one who normalized it. It puts me at a crossroad almost all of the time, and I’m left not knowing what to think.

-i am not very motivated. 
This goes along with what I said in the last paragraph. My parents’ outlook on life in general is pretty bleak. My parents almost make it seem like they have no control over what happens in life. They’re both pretty unhappy with their lives at this point. My mother is constantly in my ear about how I need to work hard for what I want, but she never practices that. My mom’s whole life has revolved around pushing off responsibilities and doing things “dirty,” so to say, rather than actually just working hard. It almost feels unnatural, in a way, to work hard for things when I see how life has turned out for my mom. I want to be proud of what I have and what I do in the future. I know I have potential, but I don’t know what for.

-I feel as though I don’t have a personality. 
Neither of my parents have hobbies and they don’t go out with friends or anything. Literally an all work, no play situation. I feel stupid typing this, but I didn’t realize until I was 17 that people actually did things purely because they enjoyed them. For example, I have a friend that plays basketball. At the end of his senior season, he said “I really, truly, am going to miss it so much. I wish it wasn’t over.” It shocked me to hear because I honestly thought that people really only did these things for college and transcripts and stuff like that. I feel as though I’ve missed out on so much time that I could’ve spent doing things I’m passionate about. Instead, when I did do things, I did them because I knew they’d help me for college or because they looked good. I never actually enjoyed them. On top of that, I fear there is someone as judgemental as myself out there that would see me trying something new possibly make fun of me for it. I don’t have any passions or really many interests and it makes me so unhappy since I’ve realized. 

I am not asking for sympathy in posting this, just advice. I know I wrote about a lot, so there could be a million different things you could respond to here. Anything helps. I really, genuinely just want to live a happier life and be a better person to myself and others. I know that posting on reddit won’t make me one, but I don’t have anyone that I could talk to about this issue that I’m having and I know that since everyone on here is a stranger to me, what you tell me won’t be sugar-coated.",15Dec2019,1
51,"Hi! I’m 19F and I’m currently talking to this really sweet girl. We met through a mutual friend. But there’s one problem... She lives in Missouri &amp; I’m in California.

Anyways, we’ve been talking for around a month or so technically but recently things have been kicking up. Like I’m talking constant throughout the day status. She takes a while to respond but usually always does eventually.

I’ve called her cute a few times and she seems to really appreciate it. And has even called me cute back heh but yeah.

I guess my main issue here is that the last time I talked to her was 2 days ago and she hasn’t responded since but has been active. Our last convo was literally about how much we liked talking to each other and *ironically* how she appreciates the fact that I give her time to respond and don’t pester her like others have.

But like idk. It’s been a while... do you think she likes me? I can’t tell. We also might FaceTime soon bc it’s break but idk. She’s really pretty and sweet and I don’t want to mess this up but at the same time I feel like she’s not interested? Anyone have any advice?

Ps sorry for the long story lol",15Dec2019,1

56,"Hello Reddit world!

Long story short 2 weeks in my 3-month internship (casual position), I receive a great offer from a different company that wants me to start in 4 weeks. I would like to seek advice on how to leave my current position in good wills. However, I am afraid that if I tell my current manager too early, at worst he would terminate my position immediately, or simply stop providing me with any rewarding and learning experience.   


A little about my background, I am a 4th year engineering student (I still have one year left in my degree) and I aim to maximise my industry experience. My current position is with a government-owned utility corporation so my early departure would not be a great cost to a business.   


My current contract is a paid casual position which means they can terminate me anytime while I am working with no expectation of continuous work. Also, there is no minimum period of time to hand in my notice.",15Dec2019,1
57,"A few years ago I got a pet bearded dragon, this caused my sister-in-law to get one for her daughter. Now that I live close to them and have visited their house, I have noticed how severely mistreated and neglected it is. The poor thing is forced to live in his own filth, his enclosure empty of any decorations, and I'm not even sure if it's fed properly. They never interact with the poor thing at all, and bearded dragons are incredibly social creatures. It looks extremely skinny, and I'm scared that it'll die soon. 

This is not the only pet they have. They also have an old cat, who is so obese she can barely get around. She has bald spots on her legs from her pulling her own fur out from stress. I have also heard that her litter box has never been cleaned from someone who stayed in there house for a week or so. They said that her litterbox is covered in sludge.

I want to so something about these poor animals, but I don't know who to call, and I'm scared I'll get my sister-in-law and her daughter upset at me.",15Dec2019,1
58,"Hi all, so I need some advice or questions answered. So I live in the apartments at my college and ive lived here for the last quarter already (which has been decent, a lot of broken stuff, o a lot of work orders have been needed to be made). The apartments come pre furnished and have most the things you need besides your own personal stuff (clothes, supplies, toiletries, etc). The apartment is supposed to take care of all maintenance, you are just supposed to put in a work order and what not. Its very similar to dorms in many ways.

My new friend and I decided that we wanted to transfer into a different apartment in the same complex. We moved in yesterday (12/13/19) and it stank like mildew or some sort of musty smell. I didnt think much of it, and just kinda hoped I would get used to the smell. The carpet is ripped in my room, there is mold on the shower curtains, the dining room table is in shambles, the chair that came with the desk in my room was stained black where people had sat in it, there are dents and holes EVERYWHERE, the carpets are stained black, the blinds in my room are broken. Just a whole ton of problems and some health concerns with this new apartment. 

So my question is; Do the people that keep up with the apartment have any obligations or standards they must follow or did I just make a really sh*tty mistake? Im not really sure what to do about it and im moving back home for Christmas so ill have 2 weeks to decide what im gonna say to the main office. 

They arent HUGE problems, so I CAN live with them, I just dont want to if I dont have to. Any advice would help, thanks for your time :).",15Dec2019,1

63,"Last year I(22F) went to South Korea with 3 friends. I am the youngest one with my friends (ages ranging from 25-30 all female). I usually never complain and kinda just go with the flow. But recently they brought up taking a trip back there again.  I dont know how to tell them I dont feel confortable going with them again. We were there a full month. There was a total of 3 times they all left me while we were out drinking. Never answering there phone/texts. Getting me caught in a situation where a group of guys were pulling me away (thankfully security helped me) they didnt even apologized and didnt even want to listen when I was telling them what happened to me. And then two nights later they left me in a different area then where we stayed. It took me 40 min to get home from subway.(plus I'm new to subways/busses. They dont have them where I live). The last time they left me again and I had made it home but right as I made it home one of them text me asking for help since she was to drunk to get home. I went back to get her but by the time I got there she didnt want to leave. I got home around 9am. Since I didnt want to leave her there alone. 

Another thing I'm uncomfortable about is the fact that they make sure I'm well aware I'm white. To the point where while we were drinking they even made me cry because of this. Two of them are Native American and the other Mexican. We do make little jokes about ethnicity sometimes but my jokes are more towards my ethnicity since I never want to offend anyone. I do dye my hair blonde and have for more than 7 years. People would want to take pictures with me when I was wearing the traditional hanbok and when we would go out people would talk to me more. While we were there they joked saying it's because I smile all the time and they have resting bitch faces.(someone even told me I look crazy because smiling all the time isnt normal in Korea) But recently when we were talking about going they brought up that they had talked about it and decided to do a experiment. They told me I need to dye my hair black and then see if I get as much attention as when its blonde. I felt hurt but also I felt bad.(I even thought of dying my hair) 

I recently got into a LTR, him being in Korea and I want to see him. They got upset that I have a BF saying I'm going to be leaving them for him. But when we were there they would meet up with guys and since I'm a strong believer of buddy system I would be stuck at our place the whole day. Plus one of them wants to bring all their family(parents, nephews, cousins, ect). Now that I have friends and a BF who will take me out and show me knew things. They say that it's not nice and greedy. 

It all makes me uncomfortable, I dont want to make anyone upset or come off as rude but I think what happened should be acknowledged. Any advice?",15Dec2019,1

66,"(long back story, tl;dr at the bottom) So, less than a month ago, I broke up with a boyfriend I've been dating for more than a year. the break up was tame, the reason being that he felt like in a sense, it was only a friendship instead of an actual relationship, but he still wanted to be friends and still talk with me. I agreed, but a few days later realized that it was so much harder to see him than I thought. I was having panic attacks after getting out of his car because of how emotionally distraught I was. So we agreed that we would wait until we were both emotionally ok before we would try to be friends. 

After this, not even a week later, I visit his house and notice he has hickies all over his neck, and a friend telling me that he's had some sort of relationship with a girl (i dont know her name) and honestly it broke my heart harder than the break up. I felt confused and betrayed, like, why would you do that and expect me to want to be friends still? Me and him haven't talked about this yet.

I've discovered I have an interest in one of his friends however, because during this entire thing he's been so supportive and there for me whenever I've asked. He's helping me with my car, and honestly, the first person I've know that doesn't treat me like a child all the time, and is understanding. We both like each other more than friends, and I want to be in a relationship with him, but he says he doesn't know what to do because he still has respect for his friend (my ex) and doesn't know if a relationship could happen. I've been feeling so broken and I just want to be ok for once, and this guy makes me feel ok. What do I do? Do I move on? Do I try and talk to him? I'm just confused and I'd really like some advice.

72,"I am pretty introverted and sucked at communication for a long time. Then I switched to a different university where being (or pretending to be) extroverted was pretty much a requirement and exposed myself to new situations. I thought I had adapted quite well, but recently I've noticed that this may have been in my mind only. 

All the people I've met here are generally very motivated and to some degree interested in technical and economic issues. Even with different interests you can easily have conversations for hours about such things. When I met my extended family yesterday though, I noticed how I could only really take part in the conversation when the topic was anything related to economics, tech or otherwise academic, but as soon as it switched to everyday life or social issues I was just kind of sitting there, not having any idea what to say. 

I have a hard time feeling emotions about events that are distant to me, but I do know very well what others feel. As an example, part of my family suffered quite a lot during WW2 and when they talk about it, I do understand how they feel about it and how it affects them, but I'm just kind of sitting there like the ""ok"" Saitama meme, feeling literally nothing.

84,"I (20F) keep running into trouble with offending my peers in college with my language. I grew up in the south, and moved to NYC for college. 

When I lived back on the other side of America, I was considered a sensitive snowflake surrounded by a bunch of MAGA people. Now I live up north and am considered very insensitive, and the fact that I’m from the south doesn’t help because I’ve basically been labeled as problematic because of my southern identity. 

I try to be as considerate as possible. I will never intentionally try to hurt anyone’s feelings. It’s never extreme circumstances, it’s very small things that add up, like passing comments about triggering subjects I simply just don’t realize can hurt people, and even if that’s not my intentions, they still to hurt those around me here. 

Back home people would literally say the N word without flinching, laugh at #metoo victims on social media, actively be homophobic and transphobic publicly... these are things I’m actively against, but inherently because I was raised there and heard these things regularly...I’m just not as sensitive to these subjects, even if I don’t agree with them. 

Here in NY, the scale of what is considered offensive is a whole different level. I basically feel like I’m having to unlearn a lot of what I considered to be “not that offensive” and rethink so much about my choice of words.

86,"[also posted this on r/offmychest but haven’t had any luck yet] 

Hello r/advice I am facing a huge dilemma I can't seem to solve.  Despite being only 29 years old I have the following health issues: osteoarthritis in my hands, diagnosed depression/anxiety, and increasingly painful lower back and knee pains.  The previous four years I was suffering from severe fatigue (diagnosed idiopathic hypersomnia) from my SSRI pills I was on.  I am now currently trying an SNRI that \*so far\* hasn't made me fatigued.

My ailments have severely impacted how much I am able to work (I work part time) and I have begun to fall behind financially (I'm losing money every month, debt has added up, and I've got probably a year and a half before I'm totally bankrupt).  Further compounding this, I absolutely cannot stand my job.  I was lost in college, didn't know what to go for, and picked something that it turns out brings me zero satisfaction.

I have the option to move back in with one of my parents 2,000 miles back Northeast (I would not have a vehicle though--I'm upside down on my current one and would need to sell it).  On paper this would seem to be a good idea: I go back home, see some familiar faces (although I don't really have any friends there), work on my mental and physical health in therapy, eventually return to work or school.  

However, about 5 months ago, I fell in love.  I've met an absolutely wonderful woman whom I'm also physically attracted to (this has rarely happened for me in life).  I feel that if I move back home I may lose the relationship (I don't really see how me going back and ""working on myself"" would take any less than one year, and even then, I haven't found a passion in life that makes me think I can move back out on my own ever again...and my health hasn't ever allowed me to work full time as well).  I'm struggling every day with this decision and notice that I'm becoming incredibly depressed.  I haven't even gone to see a counselor since being hospitalized a month ago because I'm worried about taking on more debt (its $50/a session).  

Please, if you all would be so kind, lend me some advice/thoughts.  If it wasn't for this relationship I think I would've already packed up and left back to my home city.  Thank you.

P.S.: I'm too embarassed to post this on my regular account, so yes I made a separate account just for this post.  I hope that is understood and not frowned upon.",15Dec2019,1

91,"My life feels really unstable right now. So in the past year or so, all my struggles in my life combined essentially screwed me over; I've been on academic probation for two academic terms at the college I'm attending. I really did try to do whatever I could to save my grades; went to office hours, tutoring, and study workshops (they weren't sufficient). I decided to try if healthcare professionals knew what was going on; turns out, I sadly have ADHD and a separate learning disability (along with high levels of depression and anxiety). 

I'm working on getting meds from a psychiatrist for the ADHD. I've already tried some behavioral therapy for the ADHD; it helps but it's clearly not enough. Healthcare is really slow, so I have to wait awhile until I finally get my meds and find the best course of treatment. However, my parents/family is turning into a problem. You see, I haven't been fully honest with my parents about the academic situation nor the health situation, but there's good reason for that. My family really really values the career of a physician/dentist and is extremely devoted to me being a physician/dentist. Sadly, however, I screwed up certain pre-med prerequisites such as ochem and when I told my mom how I failed ochem (I didn't say I failed other classes too), she essentially treated that as not a big deal. My parents were trying to be optimistic, which is good, but clearly they didn't understand the extent of my issues nor knew what to do about them. In addition, when I first started to go to a lot of healthcare professionals and told my parents about that, they were extremely pissed off and there was a lot of intense yelling (let's just say my parents don't trust/like the use of healthcare). Thus, going to the present, I've been lying to my family for over a year about my grades and use of healthcare professionals. This is getting emotionally painful, and it's getting more impractical to keep lying about stuff like this.

Winter break is coming up and my mom keeps telling me to study the MCAT, which I would be okay spending some part of my break doing so, but obviously, due to my circumstances, it's a really bad idea. She also wants me to graduate in 4 years, which has like a 0.001% chance of happening, if I even manage to graduate with a bachelor's degree. This is emotionally/mentally painful and becoming more difficult to do so as more lies need to be said; what should I do until I finally get my ADHD meds?",15Dec2019,1
92,"I've known this coworker for about two weeks, he has smelled like this the whole time. He is a really sweet person and I don't want to hurt his feelings but he smells like really stinky feet. They smell is noticable to the point I can be around 10 feet away from him and still smell him. I'm not sure what to do but I know if I smelled I would like to know, but at the same time he can't change it until later on when he goes home. 

I also don't know if it is something he can change maybe he has a medical condition and I look like a bad person for stating something he can't change. We are around alot of other people because we are cashiers and no one has said anything about it. He always comes up to me to talk and sit with me on breaks and I consider him a friend at this point but I've left early from lunch today because the smell made me feel nauseated. I told him they gave me lunch early and I have to go back.

93,"(compared to some other posts on this sub-Reddit, this one's very tame and doesn't hold a lot of existential weight)

Some context: My high school has a GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) that I'm a part of. This was the first year I've joined and actually participated in anything this forward, but I felt like it was needed since I wanted this year to be a year of finally letting myself be who I am AROUND other people (also for context, I'm a 16 year-old gay male), but that's another story. Anyway, our school was a part of this convention that got LGBTQ+ students from around the surrounding schools to partake in different activities (most of which were about the history of the GSA, which while important, was *DRY*) meet others their age. As soon as I stepped through the door, I realized what I had suspected, that this was now a singles convention.

(For some information, I love in a very small province in Canada that's about a half-step backwards from a societal standpoint. The LGBTQ+ population is low and laughed at in my hometown, so this was everybody's only chance to meet somebody.)

At the end of the first day there was a dance (and a drag show which was amazing, but that's besides the point). I had made it through not only 15 minutes and I was approached by someone. The gist was that they were the friend of somebody who thought I was cute and was wondering if I was a) gay, b) available, and c) wanted to be in a relationship. The first two were true, but I was so afraid to say no the third that I said I was interested in pursuing a relationship and they gave me the persons contact info. Because I'm VERY low on self-esteem and have always though of myself equivalent to a sewer rat, I was in such a shock that I walked away from the dance floor and into a quiet room that they had to clear my head. Once I took a breath and start to leave the room, I get approached by ANOTHER GUY! This guy personally asked for my number and said he wanted to chat more if we could. We talked for an awkward ten minutes, most of which involved him asking the questions and me quickly answering while I quietly had an internal panic attack. Finally my friend pulled me away and I spent the night in the corner while I disassociated. When I got home, I added them both on my phone and both messaged me I said ""Hey!"" to both of them and to this day I've never spoken to them again (this was in the beginning on November BTW).

Looking back, I could have handled it a LOT better if I had any sort of spine, but I only made what would have been a completely normal situation into two very awkward ones. I'm *EXTREMELY* flatted that I was approached by two guys when I originally thought I was going to be approached by -1 guy. I've been thinking about this a lot lately because I'm not the sort of person who would do something like this and I've been hating myself for it (and some other reasons). I don't know if I should try and text one of them again and try to spark things up, or just let it all file into my repressed memories.

He wouldn’t make time for me, he would wake up if he had to go to work and then go home and sleep. There was a weekend where he slept 35 hours in total.

102,"Ok so I (27 M) am in a bit of a difficult situation.

Basically I've been developing feelings for this girl. We've known each other for a long time but over the past few months we've become a lot closer because we've both had personal issues and kind of ended up supporting each other.

I don't know if she likes me but I kind of think she does.

The issue is that the whole reason I know her is that my best friend who I've known basically my entire life used to be REALLY into her.

Like we used to sit up and talk when we were young and awkward and he'd be constantly upset that she didn't like him in the same way.

More than once we'd get drunk and he'd cry about how much he liked her, looking back it was dumb but basically she was his first proper crush.

I know 'friend zone' is a pretty shitty concept but it was basically that, and to this guy's credit he has remained friends with the girl so he clearly does appreciate her as a friend. Long after I had heard my friend talking about how much he liked her I was introduced to this girl too. We didn't really talk or hang out, just had a lot of the same friends, until the last few months.

Anyway, my best friend is in a relationship of two years so he's not romantically interested in the girl I'm talking about.

But I still feel it would cross some kind of line if anything happened between me and this girl.

I know how he felt about her, even if it was a long time ago, and I only know the girl because she became friends with my best friend.

We've only really gotten to know each other in the past few months and I feel like there's a connection there - and some of our other friends have asked ""is there something going in with you two?""

So could anything happen between the two of us? Or would that be a shitty thing to do to my best friend?

(I'm not saying he has some sort of ""claim"" on her or any misoginistic shit like that just because he had unreciprocated feelings in High School it's just I know how into her he was back then and it seems like it'd be weird to then date her, since I first knew her as ""that girl my friend is really into"")

105,"I guess I know in my heart I'm not,but I sugger from depression anyway so Im now thinking I should've kept my mouth zipped and its my fault.

So, I have a 9yr old bonusdaughter (took full custody in 2017 due to abuse from birth mother). We have struggled this year following BM repeatedly trying to stop our disability and child benefits. Because of that we are not doing presents for the kids (9 and her 6yr old brother). Instead weve explained to them the best we could and instead we are making the most of visiting Sanat and Christmas markets and going around local areas to see the christmas lights.
So,
Today we went to a local Christmas market, where the staff were dressed as elves and the even had reindeer (6 says it was Dasher and Rudolf!).
Stood near the reindeer pen, 9 was getting close to the fencing and putting her arms through. Now, Id explained the danger of their sharp antlers etc but she has no danger awareness,the reindeer werent near to the fence, and she was giggling. Now thats a rare thing for our girl.
A man with his wife child and mother were stood next to us. He shouted to 9 to get away from the fence if she used her brain. He then told me im a shx% parent for letting her be so close. 
I tried to explained that 9 isnt aware of the dangers and she was fine anyway. But again he said im an effin sh$$ parent then! He walked off I said to the elderly lady (his mother?)that it would be helpful to consider some children have disabilities. She went off and told him and he came up to my face shouting what did i say to her!so i repeated it. His reply was 'I went to a special school'.
I wandered off with the kids towards the food stalls and was stood there texting my Husband. This man and his family came walking over yelling why was I taking pictures of him??(clue-i wasnt). Me trying to explain I had no interest in taking photos of them. I also called him out on the fact it was a fun family event day and was he proud of himself for calling people crap parents instead of keeping his nose out. I also said i hope he does have a special needs child and have their day ruined.
He then yelled again about me being a 'you know what P word' as apparently I had taken photos of his child lol and demanded my phone. He then grabbed my arm and grabbed around my chest to get my phone. He was twisting me and yanking and my arm.
Meanwhile my kids are screaming (luckily another lady consoled them) and I was shouting to get off me and for someone to get him off me. Bear in mind im 4ft 10 with crutches and he was at least 6ft. Nobody came to help, not even the 2 male stall holders stood right by us. People were stood there watching ME shouting and crying like a loon while he just walked away. 
A random lady then came over demanding to see my photographs to prove I wasnt taking them of that man, which I declined. She then took her phome out taking pictures of me and saying she would post my crying snotty face on the internet.

I have made a police report and the centre has CCTV. Doubt anything will get done.
My worry is now, since we got home, both kids are petrified to go out again. I wanted to call into the local shop and they screamed as they thought something bad would happenin there. They cried themselves to sleep worried this man will come looking for us. 9 struggled going out sometimes as it was.

So Im now thinking i shouldve let it go. It wouldnt have added more trauma to my babies minds if I had. We are now stuck in until Christmas as the list of markets and other free places we were going to visit,  is out the window. Plus with no gifts, I really do feel like IATA for causing all this and ruining the small bit of Christmas magic i could give the children.

115,"So to preface I did want to ask this on r/relationshipadvice but it seems my scenario would have been against the rules there. This sub seems more lax but if there's one better suited for me I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction, thank you.

I, M19, have been friends with the person in question, F19, since freshman year of high school and now we're in our second year of college. We're great friends and she's actually the person I talk to the most, send the most tweets to, it's a good time. We've had our ups and downs but it's a solid friendship, a close one. Now I've never really entertained the fact that I might have feelings for her, partially because I truly believe we're incompatible, but also because that was never on my mind, they were just a friend. This past semester, however, that changed. I found myself wanting to spend time with her more and more; after we'd go our separate ways after hanging out I felt kind of empty, like I wanted more. Naturally like everyone else I know I repressed these feelings haha.
And then I got to thinking, maybe these feelings are purely sexual. And it made sense for a while, I really did want to hookup with her. Anytime I was with her alone I thought about it but I could never get myself to initiate anything simply because it was the smart thing to do. But that made me feel gross. They're my friend, I don't want to feel this way, yet it persists. I hate to say it but it goes deeper than just a desire for a hookup, as I spent half the day with them today yet I miss them. But they deserve better, they deserve a friend who doesn't have any other motives or intentions, not someone who feels something for them. 

I want to tell her as I feel it's the right thing to do but I know it's not mutual so I don't think it's a good call. I don't want these feelings either, they're just there. What should I do?

TL;DR: I have feelings for longtime friend, I don't want them, but they're there. Honesty is good but will telling them hurt the friendship?

For example I have one runner who was a crazy recruited from his instincts, good grades and overall athleticism but he was injured most of the season and now it’s like he is a shell of his former self, he used to yell with excitement at practice now he is quietly an unknown person. I know he has that anger and emotion that drove him but it not lit. All my runners have something going on especially after a nearby school had a shooting and a team rival passed away. I love this team and the potential is unbelievable but how can I get a spark from them all to break out? Thanks for all help I can get!",15Dec2019,1
122,"Hello,

So my 30th birthday is on 8 Feb and I wasn’t sure when should I send out the Facebook invite to my friends. If I send now, prior christmas , is this too early (8 weeks in advance) and people may not know their plan? If I send out in early Jan, is everyone going to be on the trip and may not rsvp? If I send right after Christmas or people are still busy with holidays? 

It is kind of a big deal to me so I would like to send at the time where everyone can rsvp and get the most responses. 

Thanks everyone in advance!",15Dec2019,1
123,"Looking for some advice! After a night out at a club me and my friends decided to get a taxi home. Waiting in line my friend was talking to a homeless man who was offering money to share a taxi with us. 

At this taxi rank it’s quite common to share with someone else if you are going to the same town as everything is pretty local. We were all pretty intoxicated and then I realise the man is in the taxi with us. I ask my friend (who is very caring and just looking to help but very drunk) where we are dropping this man off as he is homeless, and although the intentions to “drop him home” were meant in good faith, we weren’t doing the man any favours.

I ask him where he is going and he had no idea. We decide it is best to drop him at a local McDonald’s (24 hours) as it is a cold night, there are people around and he could go in and get some food and a drink.  I also didn’t want to be left in a taxi with a man I did not know as I was last to be dropped off and I wasn’t leaving the poor guy in the middle of nowhere. 

Should I report this issue to the police? It’s a cold night tonight and the guy was not 100% there. I’m just not sure what to do and if I should do anything. This was over an hour ago.",15Dec2019,1
124,"My family ordered a MacBook online from Costco around Thanksgiving, and we received our order last Monday. We quickly realized that two MacBooks had been delivered instead one like we ordered. We immediately checked to make sure we hadn't been double charged, and we hadn't. Both of them were under the same order number, but they had different tracking numbers though.

We called them, telling them what happened and asking for an invoice of the order, to see what the error was. They told us it was apparently against company policy and they couldn't provide us with an invoice. I should note that the representative we talked to was also quite condescending and talked as though they couldn't quite believe us. It was almost in a way where we were being suspicious and made out as the bad guy. 

Today, my mother went to Costco by herself to return the extra MacBook. She was told that there was no record of a missing product in their inventory. The guy she was talking to said something along the lines of ""okay, I'll take it."" According to her, he sounded pretty sketchy, so she asked for proper documentation that she had returned it and to speak to a supervisor. By this time, a handful of staff members had gathered around to see what was going on. They took the MacBoom and was given a handwritten note that said, 

""____(her first name)____ returned an unpurchased IPad on 12/14/29""

and was told they couldn't do anything else

There are a few things that don't seem right with this. One, it doesn't say her full name, only her first name. Two, it says IPad instead of MacBook. Three, the way it says unpurchased doesn't seem specific enough to situation and could be manipulated in a malicious way. And four, there is no official seal or logo on it, not even a signature from any of the staff. They could easily claim it was forged. 

Everyone in my family agrees that the whole affair was very suspicious and it was a mistake to just hand over the MacBook without appropriate documentation of the return. However, what's done is done and we can't change it. We are writing an email to Costco right now describing what's happening. 

We are worried if this could have potential consequences in the future. What should our next step be?",15Dec2019,1

129,"Okay, so my dad has shown favoritism over my younger sister strongly since when I moved out to go to college. I've also lived across the country briefly, came back, went on a 3 month hike, came back, and then moved out officially.  I have always been one to be independent and to take every day as it comes and to not turn down things I may regret later in life. Completely opposite me is my father. He is a conservative Christian who believes the typical Christian values. 
My father has yelled at me in the past for being selfish and just doing whatever I want without a care for my family, how I just go on a hike at a moment's notice or drive across state to see a friend or go to bars to watch bands. 
So I try to include my dad in outings with my bf and I, I invite him over to our apartment, out to shop, out to eat, etc. He declines every time or just leaves me on read, choosing to stay home alone instead. When my family goes out they never invite me, choosing to show me they are out via Snapchat.
He has yelled at my bf of 3 years for being a mooch (when he didn't have a job. He has one now!) And told him how needs to go ahead and marry me because I was raised better than this. At this point I said I didn't want to get married, which my father ignored. 
Recently he has yelled at me about how I think I'm better than my family and that I'm selfish etc. 

For my bf's bday my family did nothing even though they agreed  we could go out and celebrate.  My family went to Disney instead (they're passholders). Today is my sister's bf's bday and they all went to celebrate at Disney together!!  I was doing okay with this for awhile but now I'm all upset again and don't know what to do or how to not care as much as I am about this. 

Is there any advice out there for me?? Confronting my father is never a good idea bc he literally either bulldozes over me and yells at me for something I did years ago, or completely ignores me.

130,"TLDR: My bf's sister K2 (F20) is going through a very delayed teenage rebel phase. Their mom thinks K's bf R (M20) is a bad influence and wants me to step in and talk to her. 

BACKGROUND: My bf K1(M22) has been discussing some of the things his sister K2 (F20) has been doing lately with her bf. As far as I know, she used to be a sweet girl and her attitude has become worse ever since she met R. They live in a bubble because of their upbringing: nice house, church family, good parents, all of that. The family is going through a rough patch right now and their mom would like me to intervene. The youngest sister K3 (F18) was born with the most wit in the family and carries herself a lot more mature than K2. K3 also agrees that K2 needs help.

K2 and R met at the same college and do not know anything of R's background. He was emancipated as a minor and wasn't very upfront about what he does for work. I've met him before with the family but he gave off cholo (Hispanic gangbanger) vibes. K2 has been lying about going to school or working when the truth is she's hanging out with R. She's been the the ER a few times already to treat her UTI. I don't think she properly learned any sex-ed. Apparently she's gotten a tattoo with him recently but don't know what it is or where it's located.

This is where I come in. I'm only a year younger than my bf but I can relate to what she's doing because I live in a pretty run-down part of Los Angeles, have dated a gang member myself, and experienced a lot of trauma along the way. Me and K1 discussed this awhile ago and was given permission by their mom to take K2 out to have a girl-to-girl talk to I guess you can say set her straight. I don't want to force her to go out with me if she feels uncomfortable but I just want to offer her advice or give my own two-cent about the entire ordeal. I don't know if this part is relevant but I'm a psychology major and I do enjoy helping people out with their troubles. The family has done a lot for me and I care for them so I'm doing this out of good intentions. I'm pretty openminded about some topics so it's not my place to judge.

What are some advice anyone can give me to help her out? I've already texted her but I haven't gotten a reply yet. There's a lot on my mind that I would like to tell her by using my own experience but I don't know if I'll be able to convey it properly since I can be really crass about it.",15Dec2019,1

We have plenty of mutual friends going out and was wondering why could they not just go to one their house but instead has invited some here. They turned up the music plenty of times and are pretty much screaming a frick ton.

I have not lost my cool, I've gone out there numerous times to get them to quiet down without success since it just starts up shortly after. This is now my 3rd year of university and my 3rd time having to deal with this noise during my exams.

133,"My (23M) girlfriend (21F) and I have previously agreed that I would move closer to her area this upcoming January.

As the time came closer we talked about what scenarios would work best. For instance, her perfect scenario would be that I rent a sublet for half a year so she could “feel it out” me being closer and then we would live together in the summer.

I don’t exactly like that plan. In the past for a time period she lived in my area and we basically lived together everyday, I was rarely at my own home. I also believe it would be a waste of money renting a sublet that I know already I would barely live in.

She’s strong about not wanting to live together so soon because she doesn’t know how her roommate would take it (I know her roommate and my bet is she would be okay with it) and her family would think it’s weird.

Okay fair enough.

I suggested the idea that I live in my car. I have absolutely no problem living in my car and I think it would be a fun experience. She rejected that idea right away because she would feel sorry for me and doesn’t want her family to see me like that.

Ok whatever.

Here’s another scenario. I stay here in my town for the next 6 months and live with my best friend. I paused my career because I thought moving down to her would be for sure but now I could continue my career. 

Frankly, I don’t know what to do.  I would love to be near her, I really do , it kinda sucks not being around her , but with these restrictions it’s made me rethink if I should move there for the time being.

Since then I haven’t had a long term relationship, I’ve just dated but whenever a guy has wanted to take things further or has shown genuine interest in me I freak out and end things. It’s been easier for me to just casually hook up with a guy than to be emotionally intimate. But I recently met a guy who I like and who likes me and we’ve gone on two dates. I was honest with him about my fears which helped a little. But I’m still freaking out a lot, and I just have the urge to end it and “run away”.

Giving one to family seems like a good option. This particular book, too, has more than doubled in value and will probably only appreciate as time goes on. I have a few hesitations though:

1. This girl is definitely going to get a lot of Eloise books in her lifetime. 
2. The book is signed to me by name. I'm thinking of writing an inscription and note to her, but it's still signed to me and I can't change that

So basically I asked him originally as a practice round before I was about to ask my true crush for his snap/number, to increase my courage and step out my comfort zone. However I didn’t ask my crush and after a day the guy I asked, (let’s call him John) friended me back. I messaged him and we started chatting a bit. I vibed with him and I went into “yeah I wanna make out with this guy” mindset to put it lightly. So we talked some more, sent some nsfw pics but not full nudes. Still nothing and now we stopped talking. I think my mistake was being too sexual at first and not getting to know him more. I feel soooo stupid and embarrassed. People on the internet make guys seem so simple “they only want sex and food etc” but there’s still lots of men that exist who only want to have sex with a committed partner. 


People of reddit, be truly honest. Can this ever be redeemable?

157,"TL;DR: mom took me out of school in 7th grade, never learned anything. We’re poor, mom neglects me and won’t help get my life started. No way to get a job, car, or education. Do I just sit and wait till she decides to help or move in with my alcoholic father 3 hours away and see if my situation there would be any better?

Gonna try and make this as short as possible.

my mother’s job was to prepare me for the world and she failed miserably. She took me out of school at 7th grade and tried homeschooling me which did not work at all and now I’m 18 with a 7th grade education.

This wouldn’t be so bad if she’d own up to her mistakes and work with me to get my GED but she literally doesn’t care. She honestly gives 0 shits about how I end up.

Whenever I bring up a way to get a job or make money she stops listening because it means she’d actually have to help with something. 

She can’t keep food in the refrigerator and gets angry at me when I say I’m hungry. She made terrible financial decisions earlier this year and as a result we’ve been poor this whole year. She had multiple boyfriends sending her money but still claims to be broke.

I live in the middle of nowhere and the local places aren’t hiring. I’m broke so I can’t get a ged or any higher education. I have no transportation. No friends. No nothing. All I can do is sit here and hope this bitch gets up and does something.

I’ve tried every method to get a job nothing worked. I simply don’t have the basic requirements. I’ve considered selling nudes or sexual favors and maybe brewing drugs and selling them because I don’t see any other way I’m making it as an adult.

I have an alcoholic father that tries but also failed. Anyways my mom kicked him out and he has his own place 3 hours away from here.

I’m thinking about moving in with him and leaving this place but I’m scared I’d be trading a lazy, neglectful mother for a lazy, alcoholic father.

But I also have really bad anxiety, and the thought of being back in a classroom also freaks me out a bit, especially because I don't have anyone to go to the class with. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to learn a second language, maybe some good study habits to get into?",15Dec2019,1
159,"Hey lovely people. 

I’m in a bit of a sitch at the moment and it kinda sucks. Out of all of my friends, regardless of which group they are in or school they go to, everyone treats me as their counsellor. I love being there for my friends but it’s gotten to the stage where all but two people ask me about me. On of my friends will only talk about her ex, another about her relationship problems, another with home issues. This is what they exclusively talk to me about. I’m starting to find no one actually cares about me or knows anything about my life. 

I have an abusive home life, a lot of tendencies that line up with obsessive and compulsive disorders that I’m seeing a counsellor about, my brother had been kicked out of school on “suspension” for the entire term and scares the shit out of me to the point where I don’t feel safe in my own home, I’m dealing with a lot of on my mind and am very close to relapsing ever day. It’s really hard to be the supportive and advice giving friend when I have so much going on that I don’t even know how to get through. 

It’s all taking quite a toll on me at the minute and I don’t know how to go about it. If I ever talk about something to these people that does not directly concern their life story or issues, they ignore it or change the topic right back to them. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like the only worth I have is to be the vent for everyone and it’s really hard to carry everyone else’s burdens, as well as your own. Any advice would be greatly appreciated ❤️",15Dec2019,1
160,"Alright, my roommate has a dog. 
Their pup is one and a half years old, they adopted the puppy a year ago. I love dogs, I'm a dog person through and through, I used to assist in training service dogs during high school and I worked at what was pretty much a Whole Foods for pets about two years back.

I love his dog.

But I hate how he refuses to train the pup. 

The dog barks at every little noise, nonstop, you can leave the room for two minutes then return and the dog is yapping. All hours of the day, nonstop. 

The dog isn't properly potty trained.
Instead of taking the dog out on walks, he instead bought one of those reusable puppy pee grass patches (?) and leaves it out on the back porch..
...right next to our big ass backyard ???
And he changes the thing once a month.
So our back patio smells like piss.
Constantly.

Also, the dog is constantly crapping inside, and he'll see that there's crap but walk by and not do anything about it 'till my other roommate and I mention something.
And even then it's a 50/50 chance he'll actually do something.

The dog tears everything up, and has a problem with biting. You can't leave anything out, not shoes, not chargers, not cellphones (??!), nothing, the dog will get to it, and she knows how to open doors now too. And when she does decide to bite, they hurt like hell.. deep purple bruises and blood spilt. 

I've tried to train the dog, we've had roommate meetings but nothing is getting through to my roommate.

I've tried to teach the pup ""Quiet"" and ""Down"" and it works for a short period of time, but my roommate never keeps up with it so it's pointless. 

My issue isn't with the puppy, it's my roommate. 

What should I do?",15Dec2019,1
161,"I genuinely need advice here, as absurd as this sounds, I'm losing my mind and don't know how to handle this. Please bear with me even if this appears petty.

I moved to the city my brother lives in, and am staying with him in his one bedroom apartment. We share a loft space which has a bedroom, walk-in closet, a full bathroom, and a downstairs living room with a kitchen. He has been incredibly generous in letting me stay with him rent free while I get my bearings, and I have silently made sacrifices in order to maintain a balance in terms of what's given and taken. This is his space and ultimately I want to respect that. However I am beginning to question where the line gets drawn, and here's where I feel (and I cannot convey the severity enough) I am genuinely suffering. 

He will not. . . He will not stop whistling. It isn't pretty melodic whistling. It isn't one song per day. It is sporadic, shrill, nonstop from the early hours of waking, until late at night whistling. When I say nonstop I *MEAN NONSTOP.* I'm lucky if within a period of **six hours** he stops for longer than **forty five seconds**. . .There is NO silence here. . .I am not trying to be funny with an intense setup and then a ""teehee the problem is WHISTLING lol my post is so quirky"". 

*This is seriously taking a toll on my sanity.* It has gotten so bad I am incapable of thinking straight anytime I am around him. It disturbs and invades my every waking thought. I cannot stress enough how serious I am. I have been living here for four weeks, and it's arriving to the point where I would rather sleep out on the streets in the frigid cold. I am not exaggerating, and seriously considering doing so. 

I have thought of ways to confront the situation, but something to add about my brother is that he's very controlling and stubborn. I am almost guaranteed that any attempt to address it will be met with a hostile response. I believe that his obsessive whistling is an appendage of his greater underlying psychological issues. His need to be constantly in control of everything in his environment including the very sound in the air. 

I do not want to be homeless. I do not want to be subjected to this whistling anymore. I really need help.",15Dec2019,1
162,"I don't mean to sound like a materialistic bitch, I'm not, but I'm Autistic so not fantastic when it comes to social etiquette or lying. Also there are times when it's perhaps more of an issue...

I dated my boyfriend over a decade ago, I put a lot of effort into a Christmas gift for him but his gift for me was a fraction of the effort - also wrapped it in loads of wrapping to make it look bigger as a 'joke' - it was *very awkward*. 

This scenario is back again: his birthday is a week before Xmas so I'm basically giving him two gifts, both I made a lot of effort with, so him giving me a half-assed gift would be a big contrast. 

I see gifts as being an indication of how someone perceives your relationship and worth to them, so if he gets me a half-assed gift my disappointment isn't about being a materialistic ungrateful bitch but rather my feeling like he's not that into me.

I'm getting really anxious about exchanging gifts because of this, I don't know how to act if his gift to me turns out to be much less effort than my gifts to him...especially as I'll be staying with him for Christmas so it'll be the elephant in the room.",15Dec2019,1
163,"My colleague is retiring next week and he has invited me to come to the park with just him to feed the animals on his last day. Is he interested in me?

For background, we have both worked in the same organisation but slightly different but connected departments for 5+ years now. We don't see each other that much during work hours, though we chat quite a bit on the work instant messenger, but we have definitely gotten closer on work nights out.

When we all go out drinking (which isn't that often) he and I are often the last 2 standing, and we chat about quite intimate things though it has never tipped over into anything explicitly sexual. He has always acted appropriately with me in and outside work and has never been creepy. But he has definitely made an effort to start conversations with me, but I do also think he is like this with a lot of people.

He has made a few comments in the past that suggest he finds me attractive but nothing explicit and my self-esteem isn't great so I find it really hard to recognise if someone is interested. Am I crazy for thinking that he might be?",15Dec2019,1
164,"Just some background: I’m an 18 year old and I’ve known this friend of mine since kindergarten. 

We have been strong friends since the start. He and I are opposites, I’m a lot more introverted and he’s very extroverted. The relationship was perfect for me because he really made me push my boundaries and meet new people. He’s a nice guy, but very very cocky at times and can be overly mean or judgmental to me without knowing it. He’s not one to apologize a lot or admit wrongs, and can be aggressive or a bit physical if you don’t give him the answer he wants. I always feel like I have to tailor my words or tip toe in conversations otherwise I say something that pisses him off. Or I just try to praise him as much as possible so he’s in a good mood and won’t be a douche for the moment we hang out. 

My friend has been good to me a lot, but I can tell a lot of the time that he doesn’t take much pride in being friends with me either. I can tell because he doesn’t bring me around any of his “popular” friends or really puts me on his social media. (I know what that sounds like, I’m not really obsessed with social media status at all, but its a pretty bad look when he is constantly recording all of his friends and never me. And I’m his closest friend).  

He doesn’t support me in a lot of the things I’d like to do either. I have a feeling that he doesn’t want me to be better than him in anything. And when it’s clear that I am finally successful in something he doesn’t really address it. 

These are just all the problems I have with our relationship. They never became noticeable until I actually started making other friends myself and realizing how bad I’ve been treated by him. I started to realize that he’s sort of a jerk sometimes to be honest and is kinda against everything I want in a friend. 

Nowadays he’s gotten a lot better. He’s still the same for the most part, but I just don’t see any benefit in staying friends. I’ve been seeing him less and less now because I just don’t really feel motivated to hang out with him anymore. But he wants to hang out more often and thinks something is up with our relationship (which something is). 

Honestly. I don’t want to be friends anymore. He’s a nice guy, but I don’t want him to be asking me to hang out anymore. I have other friends who treat me how friends are supposed to treat each other.  

My question is how do I cut him off? He still wants to be friends. I don’t. I don’t want him out my life completely. I just don’t want to be bothered by him to hang out and what not.",15Dec2019,1

I stopped talking to my old friend recently because of how he talks to me, her and everyone else

She has been messaging me a lot recently venting about him. From what she told me, she told him that she didn't know if she loved him anymore.

Now, i talked to them both literally every day for the past year(him even longer because i have known him for about 6 years), and i could tell that she is not very happy with him.

Anyway, after she told him, he literally guilt tripped her and manipulated her into staying with him and i don't think she noticed. 

Here is what he always does. He will talk to you like dirt and when you call him out on it, he gets mad at you and acts like you're the bad guy. When that doesn't work, he will talk about how he will change and be better. I have known him for years and it has always been the same. 

He will actually be nice for about a week or so, and then when things become ""normal"" again, he goes back to how he was. Its the same cycle.

I didn't tell her this because its not really my place. She has been telling me today how sweet he is being, and that she needs to be more open with him.

 I can't help but feel bad for her because she is being manipulated. It seems like she thinks it is her fault too...

173," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me.

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

Anyway, he's always been very physical, punching you or attacking you if you're being 'shit'. We all do it sometimes a little, but I feel like he does it more than the rest of us. I know that I'm actually scared of angering him knowing that he'll probably burst out at me and physically hurt me. He's also shut down any of my ideas and has generally been a jerk to me for a long time.

Over the past month or so, he's been hitting me every time I say the word 'yeet'. Yesterday we had an argument over Discord about everything. It only occurred to me that this is an actual problem and, potentially, assault/abuse yesterday during the argument.

School is tomorrow. We've sort of agreed to have a face-to-face conversation, but nothing is concrete. My mother has said to go straight to my YLC (Year Level Coordinator) at the start of the day to set up a mediation thingy.

199,"so you’re probably wondering what the title means and that’ll be explained.

so i finished high school 2 years ago and ever since then i’ve been at an apprenticeship which has turned into a full time job. my friends also left high school at the same time, went to college and are now all at uni.

this is gonna focus on one of my friends. he(19M) has basically reinvented himself. we spoke for the first time in 2 years back in halloween and shit it’s kinda made me jealous. before he left high school he had anxiety disorder and had depression. i won’t go into any details as to what caused them but he’s seemingly dealt with them. in high school everyone knew him but he was a quiet kid, the unpopular popular kid if you will. 

so before halloween comes up i ask him what he’s been up to and he said nothing really and then we made plans for halloween. he looks completely different now, different sense of style, had a major glow up i could barely recognise him, more confident in his stature etc. so we talk and turns out he’s been living life. he’s been out and about getting with girls etc. and now most girls our age(16-19) in our county(no exaggeration) fancy him. on top of him becoming super popular and well liked he’s also taking life seriously, starting a production company, he’s in a startup with his mates in uni. 

my question is, how can i turn my life around like him? he’s gone from a loner to a local celebrity",15Dec2019,1

201,"Hi all,

So this has actually really been on my mind lately so I thought I'd seek some advice from some more experienced people.

I'm a pretty good looking guy. I'm lucky in that respect, lol. So, I've been seeing this girl for the past month roughly. I really like her personality - she's funny, sweet, loyal, and loves God. But she's not the best looking girl out there. I say the God part because I am a Christian and it is important to me that my future wife shares the same faith as me, which (unfortunately -.-) takes a lot of girls out of the dating pool for me. I have no trouble getting a date, and I say that with a high degree of thankfulness. But, it's a double edged sword of course. I've dated some girls with some GREAT bodies, and that has almost come back to bite me in a weird way, because we all know that having a great body does not guarantee a great personality. HA xD 

I am almost battling with my biology, I think...  once you've been with someone with a super great body, it's really hard to kind of 'go back' from that. At this point, you might be thinking, ""wow, what a douche. He's dated super pretty girls and he's COMPLAINING??"" Or, ""wow, he's so superficial!"" But, that's biology, unfortunately... I hate it too ha.

Here's my situation. I'm 27, work hard to maintain my looks (showering, moisturizing my dry face, keeping my acne at bay, eating super healthy, and lifting weights... that stuff), and I'm at the point where I want to get married. I know enough not to go after a woman JUST for her looks, but I also know that settling would be a bad thing for a potential marriage.

I am kind of making this post just for conversation's sake, because I know ultimately it's up to me and the Lord showing me things to figure this out ha, but... what advice do you have to give? A guy in his 50's whom I really respect a lot gave me the awesome advice of ""it's good that you've waited, because the girl you're going to meet later will be a lot better for you than the girl who you meet when you're 22..."" I thought that was good, although I know some GREAT marriages that start at 22 but it was pretty solid overall.

I guess my ask is for people who have been with really, really cute girls in the past and now they're married. How can I deal with that thought of ""settling"" but not ""settling"" ?? Like, the idea that someone is good enough but no one is perfect? Because Lord knows I'm not. Sorry if this comes across wrong. I just don't know what to do :/ so please be kind in that I am actually looking for wise advice in this situation. Thanks!",15Dec2019,1
202,"So, a little backstory.

We were originally getting a dog before we got the cat. Basically one of my moms friends was like “oh hey I’m fostering this cat do you want it?” And she agreed. This was VERY spontaneous which is something she’s never done before (well at least with animals to my knowledge). It was probably due to the fact that he (the cat) was most likely abused as the person who found him said he was thrown out of a moving vehicle at ~60mph. So she stopped her car and took him to my moms friend and he agreed to foster the cat for a while.

Fast forward a few days and we now have a kitten and a puppy. They seem to be great friends (though not for long as the puppy is a giant breed and soon her nibbles started to hurt). This time is basically the most peaceful moments as the kitten is still a fairly timid baby and he is only secure around me. Soon he gets used to us and by this time we’ve moved to a new house and the two animals are a bit older now. This is where the problems begin.

He keeps climbing up on the counters and stealing food even if there is a fresh bowl of kibble right on the floor. On more than one occasion he has even stolen food from our plates while we’re not looking. My mom is getting sick and tired of his behaviour, because not only does he do that he also attacks our senior cats (as in playing and biting). My mom claims that he has “wild eyes” and only uses us for food and warmth which I think is bullshit. 

Sure he is a piece of shit but he really does love us. Today he knocked over a bowl of food while trying to steal it and that was the final straw for my mom. She gave him a month to change is behaviour or she’ll put him up for adoption. I’m really scared she will actually follow through with this as she has done what she’s threatened to do before.  He is still a sweetheart no matter what but my mom doesn’t care. I want him to stop doing what he does but I don’t know how. Any help?",15Dec2019,1
203,"I just need pointers on where to go to make myself seen in public. I'm an 18 y/o guy, and I like long term relationships. The shortest one I've been in lasted 6 months. I'm comfortable talking to strangers and in a public speaking environment, but when it comes to one on one situations with stuff like this I get very bashful.

I like the hipster look, but I don't really think that I'm the type of guy that goes against the norm just because it's the norm. I'm pretty low maintenance, and I like my privacy, but when it comes to a girl I'm completely comfortable with her. People think I smoke pot because of the way I act... but ironically both my parents are cops and I don't feel right being around it.

I don't know what my type is. I always go for the girls that are batshit crazy and it breaks my heart knowing I can't change them, but every time it ends they always openly admit to me and everyone else that they feel like shit for what they did to me. Idk if it's just a reassurance to themselves that they still have a heart, or they genuinely mean it. Either way it feels good.

Binaural beats- sounds at specific frequencies to shift your mind and body into a relaxed state, focused state, meditative state or happy state by promoting the serotonin in your brain.

Law of attraction- It means like attractions like. If you align yourself with your goals and whatever you wish to manifest it will come to you. Vibrate at the frequency of what you want it your life.

Witchcraft- self explanatory 

Affirmations- Short phrases you repeat to yourself to change your beliefs about yourself and gain confidence, self love and happiness. 

All of these things can work together to create a happier reality when put to use.

I'm (18M) and my teacher is (24F) I met her when I was 15 years old and since then I had a kind of platonic crush on her, however things escalated pretty quickly this year.



To keep it short she lives a few minutes away from my house, and last year, when she noticed, she offered to pick me up in her car in the mornings to go to school, and from school to my house. At first I was going to refuse however after I told my parents they were glad because that meant that they wouldn't need to pay for Bus service, needless to say I also had that crush on her so at the end I accepted.

School is like 40 minutes away from my house, therefore I always spent 80 minutes a day with her, we became really close, we had same taste in music, sense of humor, food... Well a lot of stuff, either way you could say that out of school we were even friends. After a few weeks we sometimes had these stops after school to eat something, or sometimes I'd even help her out with some chores. During this time I still had a crush on her and as days went on I stopped thinking it was only a platonic thing, I genuinely wanted to be with her. This kept getting worse (or better I guess) with time, we even met multiple times during summer so I didn't have any time to rest from those feelings.



Last Friday she was really mad when she went to pick me up, apparently she have had a fight with her father the day before. After school she asked me if I could talk with her for a bit, so after school we stayed on her car and to my surprise she started drinking, I thought it was fine if that would make her forget a bit about her problem, obviously I hid the car keys after noticing she was getting drunk. During her drunk state she started talking nonsense, most importantly about how the problem she had with her dad was all about the fact that she didn't want to meet someone that her dad introduced to her, and between those lines she said something that hit me like a rock ""If only you were graduated from school I would have a good reason to reject the guy."" I may have misunderstood her, however for me, that meant that she also had some type of attraction for me. After a while she fell asleep and I had to stay there for about 7-8 hours waiting for her to wake up, I called my parents and told them I went out with some friends so I would be late, she waked up and she apologized and asked if she said something weird because apparently, she didn't remember. However she started acting pretty weird from that point on which makes me believe she was perfectly conscious of what she said. 


Yesterday I decided to talk to her about it, we did and I confessed to her after that, I asked her out and... she accepted, and I still can't believe it but she accepted and I couldn't be happier! But right now I'm scared as hell, I want to go out with her, I want to have dates, meet her family, be a real couple but I don't know how to proceed, if someone from school finds out she'll probably be fired, I'm sure my parents will understand but I'm not sure about her's and if they don't agree with it I fear they will let the school know.

I graduated from a good university in September (took summer classes) with a very desirable STEM degree. I don't think I was ready for the course load and as a result I was barely able to graduate with a 2.1 GPA. I haven't taken any extracurriculars or internships because I was too busy studying as much as I could and was barely able to scrape by with a C- in most of my classes.

I was intending to apply to grad school this past fall but my low GPA immediately disqualifies me from any programs, and I'm currently working at a math tutoring agency for children and teens. I don't hate it but at the same time I feel somewhat overqualified and would like to somehow start with an actual career. 

From what I can see, most internship opportunities are given to college students with high GPA's and so I don't see how it's even really possible to get my foot in the door anywhere. I guess I'm just a little frustrated because for the last few years people have been telling me how easy it will be to find a job in my field with this degree but I don't think anyone will hire a college graduate with a low GPA and no experience.

I've only had sexual experiences with women, and only women, including this girl. I can't imagine myself being romantically interested in a man. Granted this is the only girl I've gone as far as to try to date, usually with other girls it never goes anywhere and I do feel that it's at least a little bit because of this problem every time. And on top of that I've never really felt super romantically attracted to anyone, ever. Like I've had crushes but it was all mostly physical or admiration. I don't want to say I'm something like ""aromantic"" because nope. But I do feel a little bit ""not right"" because I've never even felt wanting to love someone. I've come close, and I liked the feeling so I know I'm capable of it, but I've never been even close to head over heals even in my teenage years

And I don't usually have anxiety in most situations. Like at work or school I do fine. I'm usually quiet and don't interact with people very much but I can do it just fine if I have to. Just with girls that I know are looking for something more I just can't... It feels like I'm just trying extra hard to be polite, and when I even imagine putting on the moves with a girl I feel like I look stupid idk.",15Dec2019,1
239,"I have been self harming for 13 years. I have all different types of scars pretty much all over my body. My scars are old but they were severe so some are pretty dark and certain areas have 30-50 scars.

241,"​As long as I can remember, since I was in kindergarten - and I'm in my 4th decade now, I've always felt like an interloper. When I have friends, I'm the one calling them, I'm the one dropping by their place. Very few people have taken the initiative to keep in touch with me.  I am told I'm pretty personable and outgoing, but I remain uncomfortable in social situations with more than just a few people. It's kind of like I became so disgusted at the endless, often useless, divisiveness of a lot of human behavior and interaction, I'd rather just keep to myself, hang out with my better half, our pets.  I've moved from a major city in the most populated area with an office I went to every day to telecommuting from a very rural area ​with only a dozen neighbors and twenty five minutes to the nearest anything. I remain socially awkward, and it's no different with my new neighbors.   I just don't care what stories other people have to share, what non-sense babble they want to share.  And there isn't much that I want to share, either.  And that's fine.  But I still want to show that we'll help with anything if we can when someone needs help or something.  I wish I wasn't so socially uncomfortable, obviously awkward.  I've read over symptoms of adult mild autism, and seem to fit many of the symptoms. Avoid social situations. I think I might have some 'alexithymia' - I can't read my own or other people's social cues easily. Can't keep conversation going. Hate small talk. Anyone have suggestions how I can learn to be less socially awkward, and how to stop saying the worst thing at the worst time - stick foot in mouth syndrome?",15Dec2019,1

Today this girl came in who I had seen before. We flirted n stuff. She starts asking me about what I do outside the restaurant and if I have any long term goals. In my head I’m like wtf, pretty focused on work regardless. Tells me she knows a bunch of people in the area and has a lot of connections. Pulls out her phone and asks for my number, she’s like “Maybe there’s something I can do for you” 

Texts me a few after she leaves saying it was nice to meet and that gonna talk to somebody tomorrow and call me about it??? 

I’m super confused. Like I got a lot of money and I don’t need her shit. But she was cute and we were definitely flirting so I’m wondering if she’s really tryna fork me out some work opps or she just wanted my number

245,"Before you read this, imagine what it would be like to suddenly remember a 3 year gap in your life and find out it didn’t go that well. 

I developed a neurological condition when I was 18. I had poor mental health (saw things and heard voices) and poor physical health (terrible pain, slurring,  difficulty standing, convulsions). It was a mess but all the physical symptoms came and went. I was drugged to hell during those years. Benzos, opiates, muscle relaxants, antipsychotics all taken together 3x a day. It was palliative. I did a lot of things out of character during this time and finally the memories are coming back.

Among the things I’m remembering: I repeatedly slept in a van with a married man in his 50s who treated me badly(despite me being a gay female... there are still many holes in those memories). I started about a dozen conversations with people I haven’t seen since I was a kid. I overshared a bunch of embarrassing things. I tried to kill myself 3 times. I was careless with the feelings of strangers I was sleeping with (during a time when the mental illness was at its worst and the physical illness was at its best). 3 of my family members have called the cops on me when they thought I was dead but was really just hung over. I liras about everything. I smoked and sold weed to addicts behind the residential psychiatric facility I was staying at. It’s all so out of character. I was a convulsing, sad mess. Remembering it all freaks me out. I have a great therapist I’m talking about it with but this is all so overwhelming. I don’t want to talk about it anymore. 

I have texts and things documenting this stuff. I know it’s real and it’s freaky. It’s all from 1-3 years ago. I don’t know how to move on. There are so many people I either hurt or I’ve damaged their opinions of me. Even my feelings are kinda hurt by me...like I’m disappointed to find out I’ve done these things. What do I do now? Iva already changed how I live and my meds. I’ve considered writing apology letters, posting a fb status (I post to fb like once a year), trying to ignore it... help?",15Dec2019,1

Over the past 4 years I’ve been having trouble with life, i have been diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes and Subglottic Stenosis. I have started being accused for theft whenever anything goes missing around the house which started from my siblings i assume now it has caught on to the whole family so i’m constantly getting in trouble, grounded and all my possessions get conviscated.

I have a little brother which is 4 years old and he has 2 iPads, PLENTY of toys and is extremely spoilt and i try to take care of him by making sure he does not damage his iPads or plays them to much or stopping him from doing things he isnt supposed to be doing and i get into trouble cause im being “bossy” and he picks up on things easily and is always lying to get me into trouble like when he bent his neck he said i flipped him and there has been plenty of other times like that.

I have felt very depressed and i no longer have any energy throughout the day, i just sit in my room either sleeping or listening to music trying to make things better, my mum picked up on my attitude and took me to therapy without talking to me herself.

I always hated asking them for money, so much that I rarely go out with friends (once every five or so months, not kidding) and when I do I spend only the necessary.

However, they told me I don't need a job as they will support me financially until I graduate, that I must focus on getting good grades and that's it.

They don't seem to understand that I'm not comfortable with this at all, not even after I let them know the reasons I want to get a job. Specially because they control what I spend the money on.

So I’m atheist, have been for a few years now. I don’t really talk about religion unless it’s brought up or if someone I know doesn’t mind having a friendly debate. My GF isn’t that religious but still calls herself a Christian. Her and I barely talk about it, mainly because we both just agreed we have different views and look past it.
Her parents never really like me that much but didn’t really have issue with me either until a few months ago when it was brought up between gf and gf’s mom that I don’t believe in supernatural stuff, or religion (I wasn’t around so not sure how or why it was brought up).  Suddenly when we would visit her mom’s place there’s always this tension in the air, and she would also talk shit about me behind my back. 
Today it was brought to her fathers attention (my gf isn’t sure who told him or why). Well now he wants to threaten the cops over the little bit of weed I usually have to teach me a lesson. And just saying some hateful stuff about me now to my gf. I’m not worried about cops around here, they have better shit to deal with. 
Just to clarify, gf and I have our own place, and her parents are divorced and hardly talk to one another.

257,"I tried. I really tried. I don't think I can do this.

So, I have talked about my loneliness on reddit before. You may have even read about me. I'm that 23 year old who hasn't had a single meaningful friendship since elementary school. I am still a virgin who has never been on a date or kissed a girl. I have never even asked a girl out because I have never flirted and am socially inept. I have even have an imaginary girlfriend as a coping mechanism for how bad I feel about myself when lonely in my studio every weekend night. I have had thoughts if ending it all before (before I found purpose in this new job I recently started that I deeply enjoy). 

Well...I tried ""just putting myself out there"". Since I recently started this nes job I was living in a completely new city, so I was hoping that maybe I could have a fresh start. Well...it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. 

So one of my co-workers (who has been working there for some time and has lived in Pittsburgh for a while so he has a good social life) said that he and his wife are having a party at his place and anyone from my company was invited to go. So, I decided to just give it a try and just ""come out of my shell"". I was even feeling some confidence in me. I dressed better than I usually do, and went. 

I was the only person from my company that went. Everyone else were either old friends of the co worker or friends of his wife from medical school. I tried making small talk but to absolutely no avail, and every failure made feel more shitty about myself. Nothing I said sounded interesting. None of my jokes are funny. Just like in my college days, my high school days, my middle school days, and even for the most part my elementary school days...I was a nobody when it came to socializing. I was that awkward kid in the corner. There were many ladies there, but i wasn't even trying to hit on any of them. I just wanted to try and make a friend maybe (guy or girl) but maybe I was asking too much for myself.

Also I had a hard time relating to all the stories. They were talking about how they had friends that did this or a girlfriend that does that or a date that went like this or a honeymoon that went like that. I mean I don't blame them. It's not like they I know I am basically a zygote when it comes to a social or romantic life. And if they knew, they would want to get away from me. 

Also physically I felt insignificant. I am 5'8 and pretty much everyone was taller than me (some of them were in great shape). Even the women were taller than me. So yeah, I'm a total manlet too (when will I ever learn hahaha). 

So yeah, in some ways a social setting made feel like even more of a loser than I do when alone (at least when I am alone I can distract myself from those thoughts with stuff I like). I tend to look forward to working, because my job is the one thing that gives my life meaning because it's in an industry I love (space robotics....not NASA but they give us funding) and it had for the most part ended my thoughts of ending it all...but unfortunately not entirely, because outside of work I have nothing to do that keeps me feeling purposeful. Noone outside my kin really cares about me, and in order to grow as a person I have to grow outside of my kin obviously. 

So yeah. Here I am. I don't know what to do about it. And I am deeply ashamed to say it, but it does tear me up the more I realize this about myself. I feel like my ship has sailed. I feel like I am destined for this.

Sorry for getting melodramatic.

So I want to know how to stop restricting myself and be more outgoing. I think the reason I restrict my language near people is because I'm worried of what people might think of me.

260,"I'm a recipient of a scholarship in one the global firms in my country. Upon graduation, I am expected to service my bond with the firm. While realistically the bond should be tied to the local firm that provided the scholarship, there were/are other scholars who has serviced their bond abroad, thus a precedence. The salary abroad is 4x the amount of what would be paid here locally, and logically so, the more attractive alternative. 

As part of the contract, I was able to do my internship abroad (last year). Based on my performance reviews and feedback from my manager, I did a pretty good job (I got a 2 in a scale of 10, 1 being ""excellent"") and they were expecting me to rejoin the firm. I even got a supporting letter from my manager that ""looked forward to my application"".

However, the issue lies with the HR in my country (and the HR abroad too, I suspect). As scholars, honorably, we would have to provide our application to the local HR and express our interest in the choice of department and (surprisingly) country to start with, which was really nice of them(or so I thought). Thus, I continued with my studies and in May, expressed my interest to join the firm abroad in November, after my graduation. 

Believing the email reply that they have forwarded my application, I naively focused on my remaining exams but did not get a reply, until when I asked them about my application on September. By then, the local HR informed me that ""The vacancy abroad has been filled up and would need to wait until September 2020"", which they also said was ""too long, and advise that you start locally first"". 

I was mad, but kept my cool, and tried negotiating if I could service locally but be guaranteed a transfer abroad by September 2020 (I would have suggested this either way: as a sign of gratitude, but also to preserve personal interests and career goals). The initial knee jerk reply was ""It's not possible"" and I would have to service the full 3 years locally, and choose to reapply thereafter. But after a little convincing, they talked to management and agreed that I can start locally and transfer on September but again, with a clause that ""It is no guarantee"".

3 years may not seem like a long period, but honestly a lot would have change by then. I have talked to my manager about it, and while they still want me back and wrote another supporting letter to them, the hiring decisions still lies with the HR. It seems that the HR abroad too, did not want to get stuck in the middle of this. As much as I want to be grateful for my local firm, I can't help but feel manipulated.

264,"I have a military background with 2 degrees, and even so, I chose to be a stay at home mom for 9 years. 

I recently went back to work, and I’m now a lunch lady. The schedule is great, and I get off work at 2pm so I still have time to do school pick up, homework, dinner. No daycare because I am off during all school breaks too. 

It’s not a bad job, but it can be hard. 

In my state, we are required by law to get two 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch. 

We never get any breaks, and our ‘lunch’ is 8-10 minutes on most days. Never has it ever gone past 15 minutes. 

While that sucks, I don’t know how they can fix it. But it contributes to the tension at work. 

We have 6 people in the kitchen, and 2 of them are so slow. We have the manager and assistant manager, me and another coworker, and then we have the turtles. 

They have no sense of urgency, no work ethic, and it’s so frustrating that our manager, who is young and not very experienced, cannot seem to put two and two together. 

He helps the 2 slower people so much. Gives them easier tasks, and just doesn’t hold them to the same standard as he does everyone else. Which would be fine if I got paid more to do more, but we all make minimum wage. It’s sucks. 

It all came to a head on Friday when he asked for feedback and I got emotional. I didn’t yell, but I was upset and I didn’t hide it. After I pointed out several things the 2 slow people have done, they turned around and said I didn’t clean the bathroom. It was my task all week, and let me tell you...I cleaned that freaking bathroom!!

Another coworker said the same things that I was saying, that these two slow people weren’t pulling their weight, and he dismissed her and said that he’s been hearing it from both sides. 

We were taken aback, like....what??

These two turtles actually think that the rest of us are the ones who aren’t working hard?

I texted the manager (and I say text because there is literally no time to talk or chat at work, we are always constantly running) apologizing for becoming emotional, but that it’s very frustrating. 

He wrote back some generic lines about working as a team or something. But he just doesn’t get it. 

On Monday I want to ask him what was being said about me and the other coworkers from the turtles. But I’m not sure how to word it. I’d like to know what/how they think I’m slacking. I just got my 60 day evaluation and I did great on it. I always get good feedback from the manager and supervisors...so I’d like to know what the turtles are saying about me so that I can try and see where they are coming from. 

I think they just don’t see all that everyone does. 

The manager can’t see it either if he actually believes them. I don’t know if he does, but just saying that he’s been hearing it from both sides ticked us off. 

That’s where the frustration comes from. 

Like, who does he think is accomplishing all of these tasks? Why are the dishes piled up to the ceiling when it’s the turtles’ turn to do them? I can go on and on with examples. 

Can’t he really not see this??

There is also a language barrier. The rest of us try and talk to them, but they are just so grumpy and their entire demeanor changes when they interact with us versus the manager.

Sorry for rambling...I’m just so frustrated and I want to transfer schools. They won’t let me, because it’s hard to retain people at this school and when I asked before if I would I be able to, they told me not to jump ship just yet. We are on manager and assistant manager number 3 since August. That’s how bad/hard this school is to work at. 

What can I do?

I’ve tried being kind, I’ve tried ignoring them, I’ve tried to see things from their point of view but on Friday when they tried to say I didn’t clean the bathroom all week....I was just...wow. They didn’t see me clean it, so to them, I didn’t do it?

What do I do?

I want to set up a meeting with the manager, but I don’t know how to ask him, or what to even say when we sit down to talk. 

I can list out everything, but it won’t matter. He will just view it as an ‘Us versus Them’ type do thing and say team work!

After 6 months (also the time when my lease would be up) quit both jobs and move back to parents house (like a home base, they're super chill). Don't pay off the student debt and keep making $500/month payments. Then...  


First: Take online Music Production Course I've been eyeing for months. (Summer)

*Subplan A-1:* With the money saved from working my butt off for 6 months, go to California (in the fall) for 1-3 months to learn dance (dream of mine). Afterwards: Unknown  
*Subplan A-2:* With saved up money, go on a study abroad program to Korea (in the fall) to increase my language skills. Afterwards: Unknown

  
**\*\*\*Notes Before Plan B, etc..**.  
\&gt;&gt;Jobs: Pros and Cons&lt;&lt;  
Job 1 (Morning Job): Pros

1. Chill environment
2. GM is the sweetest
3. Not too mentally or physically demanding
4. Can always leave on time
5. Don't really have any friends here

Cons

1. Warehouse manager talks too much in the morning and I don't think knows how deodorant works.
2. Can get lots of box cuts on hands and arms if not wearing gloves
3. The store is always trashed and almost impossible to clean all the way up since we have to push new freight before anything else
4. Always understaffed but somehow over hours.
5. Can't work full time (over 29 hours)
6. Retail.

Job 2 (Evening Job): Pros

1. Have a lot of friends here
2. Not too much going on here at night unless there is an event (or for some godly weird reason a full moon (I swear we get those full time soccer mom part time sorceress kind of people... anyway..))
3. It's a food place so we can just occasionally nom on things (yeah free food, drinks too)
4. Making fun of customers (don't be mad, it happens everywhere, especially drivethu)
5. Not too physically demanding
6. Closing shift so we can take leftovers from the bakery (bagels, cookies, cake, etc)
7. Managers are all pretty chill (except one)

Cons:

1. Can go from Heaven to Hell Hole in seconds if multiple orders hit the screen
2. Since we are night shift we tend to run out of ingredients for things, sometimes customers get huffy
3. Can be stressful if mid shift didn't stock well
4. Has that one manager that always has panties in a wad
5. The kitchen has an open bar part so sometimes customers stare in (very annoying)
6. Almost never leave on time
7. Food Service.  


\&gt;&gt; **Plan B:** Quit Job 1 (Morning Job) and open up more free time in my morning / enable me to be able to stay up late.  
Pros:

1. Don't have to wake up early (omg sleep)
2. Have more time in my day for my hobbies(dreams)
3. Can stay up late and talk with Korean friends. (That time difference x.x)
4. Don't have to deal with annoying manager who talks too much in the morning (yay)

Cons:

1. I always feel like I get more done when I wake up early so if nothing is forcing me to get up I wont
2. Could develop a really strange sleeping pattern by staying up too late or sleeping in too late
3. If Job 2 gets too stressful, won't have Job 1 to fall back on
4. **I will hardly be able to save any money month to month since the total income from one job will be tight for my budget**

\&gt;&gt; **Plan C:** Quit Job 2 (Evening Job) and open up my whole afternoon.  
Pros: 

1. Wake up early and only have to work 4-5 hours a day
2. Have a ton of free time to pursue hobbies(dreams) in the afternoon evening
3. Don't have to deal with food smell on clothes
4. No more roller coaster environment

Cons: 

1. **Doesn't make enough money for my budget** (I'd have to keep Job 2 a few days or get another job)
2. Lose most of my friend contact
3. Don't get free food  


&amp;#x200B;

I was originally just going to go with the original plan (OG Plan), but then I thought about working so hard to save up all that money then just giving it to the school and it made me feel sick. So that's when I thought of plan A. Since the payments are already set and scheduled (unless I request to change it) it will just be constant.

If I work for 6 months on this crazy schedule (if I can keep my sanity), I can stop working for 6-7 months before I run out of money (if I did nothing). Or I could work crazy schedule for 6 months, stop working, focus completely on my dreams and goals (and maybe one of the Subplans) for 6-7 months and maybe I will have found a career with one of them and have a job I enjoy.

However, if I just worked one job, say Job 2, I would have more free time for my dreams but also barely be able to save any money month to month with just one job. So even though I could work on some of my dreams like Piano, Drawing, and studying Korean more. I wouldn't be able to consider going to California for dance or doing a study abroad in Korea.

273,"If you don't know what Canvas is, its basically a platform similar to Google Classroom that my college uses. There's a chick in my Stats class I wanted to ask out all semester, but I didn't have the confidence to do it. However by the time I did have the confidence, I couldn't approach her because she'd always leave with a group of her friends, something she hadn't done till recently cuz she'd always leave a bit later. So basically I had the confidence but by that point not the opportunity. So I never got her number, her snap, her IG, anything. So, I can't DM slide through any traditional means. And we have no mutual friends so idk if I'll even ever be able to find it, and if I do it'll probably be weird. However one thing I have is her Canvas, since you can message anyone on Canvas if you have a class with them. So my question is, would it be weird if I hit her up through Canvas? If the consensus is that it's weird I won't do it. If it's not weird tho, I'd love to do it cuz I think she's really cute and I think I caught her checking me out one time towards the end.

And no, I can't just approach her in person because the semester is over. We no longer have that class.

I never spoke to her in person except one very brief conversation about a show we've both watched. And by brief I mean, her saying ""Hey, you like that show!? I like that show too!!"" followed by me saying ""Oh cool"" and walking away like a fucking dumbass...",15Dec2019,1

275,"So I've been in and out of depression since last February, which is when my ex broke up with me (on Valentine's Day, no less).

It's almost been a year since we broke up. I still think about her. Hell, I even have nightmares about her. I don't know how to STOP thinking about her. Like, I try. I'm trying to move on here, but it's like I can't.

I feel pathetic here. I mean, I know she probably isn't thinking about me since she moved on like three months after we broke up.

So any suggestions? I've tried dating, but my luck is frankly horrible with women. I hadn't been able to go out with someone. I've tried going to the gym, and that brings me temporary happiness, but it's more like a high and my mood is low the next day.

Despite that, he was always a great friend and there for me more than my own supposed boyfriend after he explained what was going on with him. I still feel guilty about this situation because I should have been more patient instead of taking the distance after a fun night together personally. I also loathed being alone after the breakup and the ex wanted me back, so back I went. We broke up three months later, though. 

M32 and I, I don't really know what to say here without sounding childish about it. My feelings for him just blossomed naturally over time, I guess. I absolutely love spending time with him. No words can describe the joy that I feel whenever I hear the sound of his voice or see his name drop down onto my screen, interrupting whatever I'm doing. We often talk about anything and everything from until the early morning or afternoon sometimes and then he just passes out on me and I just want to call him right back because he has such a beautiful, interesting mind and a rich internal life.

She had an idea suggesting that one of us wears sneakers with socks and the other wears sandals without socks, so that when we are asked to remove our shoes we can compare how the floors and carpets feel on socks versus bare feet. I am onboard. She said that she will likely wear sandals and me sneakers as we often do. This morning at home, because she was already wearing socks while I still had bare feet, she suggested that she wear sneakers while I wear sandals when we leave the house to go there. I am onboard and we did. When we arrived at the open house and the realtor asked us to remove our shoes when we enter and we were talking to the realtor outside. When we were talking about everything we seek in the house, it got brought up and my wife mentioned to the realtor that she was wearing sneakers and I was wearing sandals specifically so we can compare the feel of floors and carpets on her socks to my bare feet.

288,"So maybe a year ago my friend asked me to help her with her business, but only after I dropped $260 on her product. The product is amazing don’t get me wrong but I feel like she only asked me that because she sees that when it comes to money I’m pretty responsible(she’s horrible with money) and that she wants me to pay for certain parts. The reason I declined is because I know we wouldn’t be able to work together. She is veryyy stubborn, the reason I say that is because everytime she asks my opinion on anything, I tell her what I think. she immediately shuts it down or says something to combat my statement. I usually say okay whatever you think is right.  After a couple weeks she brings up whatever topic we were talking about and says the exact same thing I told her but in different words like she thought of that already.

Fast forward to now...

I’ve been thinking about starting my own business and it’s along the lines of hers and I told her that I was thinking about this and literally she looked at me and said nothing then changed the subject completely like I didn’t say anything.

291,"I’m just gonna get right into it, when my friend was like 7 or 8 he got held hostage by some guy with a knife at his school (I’m not sure if this matters, but I think it might). When he was young he also had to tell his parents everything he did or even felt mildly guilty of or else it would tear him apart and he couldn’t sleep.

Fast forward to today, he’s now 15 years old. He’s also quite muscular and works out regularly. He has this crush on a girl and has had it for the past year and a half and ever since I found out about it, it’s seemed to have gotten  worse. 

Whenever he’s in a The discord call all he talks about is this girl, he’s only talked about her for the past month or so as if he doesn’t have his own life. Their relationship definitely hasn’t gotten better. She likes someone else and avoids conversation with him. The only time he really kind of interacts with her is on Snapchat or in socials class when another guy and her completely hit it off, my friend just stares blankly at the two.

Now, I think he has ocd and maybe was a result of the hostage thing, but I don’t know I’m not a therapist and haven’t done research. I asked him if he thought of going to a therapist or something to at least see if he could be diagnosed, but he flatly said no. He thinks all it has done for him has given him discipline to make him work out and be muscular, while that may be true and good, he seems to be headed down a deep dark path and is turning into somewhat of an incel.

299,"I (f) learned two days ago that one of my close friends (m) raped somebody about a year ago. Both of them were various levels of blackout drunk for the entire night, so he didn't even realize what he did until she told him (also two days ago). He couldn't remember all the details when he woke up the morning after, so he just assumed that it was a bad hookup and left.

The event ruined her life. I won't go into details because it's not my place, but some pretty terrible stuff happened to her as a result of her trauma. She decided that she didn't want to press charges though, because she didn't feel like he had malicious intent when it happened.

Ever since he found out what he did to her he's been feeling extremely guilty (as he should). It's a massive weight on him, and he's doing everything he can to be honest to the relevant people and to apologize to the girl in question. He signed up for counseling the day he found out what he did because he wants to make sure he never does it to anyone ever again. There is no doubt in my mind that he feels awful and wants to repent for what he did.

He told me that (since I'm a girl) he understands if I don't feel comfortable around him anymore, and that I don't need to talk to him if I can't forgive him. Nearly everyone in my life who knows has already forgiven him, but I just don't know if I should. 

Before this happened, he was always extremely respectful to me and a really good friend. I know he feels bad and that he didn't really mean to do it. But he raped someone. I don't think that he would ever sexually assault me, but how can I know? He's apparently capable of it. I want to help him so badly, but I am so disgusted by what he did.

In the past I always said that I could never be friends with a rapist, but I honestly don't think he meant to hurt her. But at the same time I feel like his intent doesn't matter! I'm scared that I'm making excuses. Overall I just feel betrayed, and I feel guilty and selfish for feeling like this is in any way about me.

It will be hard for me to avoid him completely if I choose to do so, since he's part of so many of my social circles and almost all of our mutual friends don't know what he did (the few who do have already forgiven him, as I said before).

Am I a bad person if I forgive him, or am I a bad person if don't? Is it worse to be friends with a rapist, or to abandon a close friend who is going through hard times and is honestly trying to fix what they did? Please help, I don't know what to do.",15Dec2019,1

307,"The best and simplest example I can think of for my problem is the following: I was playing Fortnite with my friend who is better at the game than I am. After I died at some point they said, ""Can I offer you some advice regarding situations like that?"" And I wanted to know what they had to say, and I do want to be as good as them, so I said ""sure,"" but as soon as they started talking I just felt inferior and like a failure. I felt like I was a horrible player and that my friend was mad at me for doing something so dumb.

Another general example would be something along the lines of peers/peer mentors at college giving me criticisms on, say, a project I did or an essay I wrote. I do want to do better on things like that, but when people criticize me it just makes me realize how dumb and inferior I am to them in that area/field.

And when I get in these moods, it's like a big trigger for my anxious/depressed tendencies (I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety or depression but I do get symptoms/behaviors of both relatively often).

I feel like if I admit I need help or something along those lines, I look weak and dumb to the person I am asking or the person who is criticizing me.

Should I just kinda walk up to people cold turkey in the richer areas, and ask about them what they do, and do it like that? They don't have to be rich.

312,"So lads, ill start this off with a bit of background to the issue. I am a DM for a D&amp;D group of people that I met at my last job, we are all very good friends and have been hanging out for a long time even after most of us left that business. This is only important because one of my players wanted to introduce his friend to the game, and asked if I would take one more on. I like having people enjoy my games, so I said yes, turns out the new player was both female, and someone that I would soon start to have feelings for. 

I had previously been in instances where I thought I was in love with someone, but after meeting my current girlfriend, it seems like the difference between a candle and a bonfire in terms of how much emotion I have in relation to them. Sorry for the cheesy metaphor, I just cant think of anything else.

Point is, im in love with her, weve been dating for about a year now and have had a (I think) mostly amazing time with each other.

Cue tonight.
I just finished a campaign a week ago and so I decided to host a game night (ps2 and wii and pool etc) at my house. After everyone else leaves, the two of us normally spend some time talking and cuddling. This time, she was very quiet, and when I went to touch her she almost yelled in the most agressive tone ive ever heard her use, ""Dont touch me!"". So, im wondering why the hell shes having this reaction, and it apparently boils down to, she hasnt felt good about herself, and she doesnt even know why. I tried to get her to open up a bit with me, as she has previously had issues with being open in terms of her emotions, and she once again brick walled me.

The rest of the conversation went about as you would expect, I tried to ask her what was wrong and offer my support, she told me not to worry and that shed fix it on here own. (This is just three weeks after we made an agreement not to do this very thing). She left 20 minutes ago, and I now feel like shit, some of the things she said almost sounded the exact same as some of the thing I said 2 years ago when I almost commited gun face. That scares me a bit. I dont know if anyone can help or if any of you care, but I hate being unable to do anything, and she wont even let me try.

317,"TL;DR: I (14F) have something of an “mutually abusive” friendship (14M), but I genuinely think that I can change this and make it into a functional one. My question is whether this is even possible, and if so, how do I go about doing it? 

So here’s where the story begins. 

 I’m typing this at 1:00 in the morning so please forgive any spelling or grammar mistakes.

I’ve known this guy for about two years now. I’m hesitant to describe us as friends, but I guess that’s the best way to describe our relationship. Both of us are in ninth grade (14 years old) so I’ve known him since seventh grade (12 years old). I’m female and he’s male.

Our ""friendship"" is very complicated and honestly weird. It's definitely at least partially because we're hormonal teenagers; that's pretty obvious to me. The best way I can describe it is as one of those abusive relationships you'll see on TV, where the guy and the girl hate each other but are still dating. Except we're not dating.

An important thing to note is that he *did* like me in the seventh grade. Why is this important? Because my ""best friend"" brings this up a lot and I think that's it's part of the reason that our relationship is problematic. It's something we'd both rather put in the past.

Anyway, my ""friend"" has had a history of being immature and childish. He acts up in class and antagonizes teachers, despite being a really smart kid. On a personal level, he insults my intelligence and looks constantly. From an outsider's point of view, maybe this can be taken as a sort of friendly insults sort of thing. I can tell you that it's not. For example, there was about a two-week period within this past month, during which he kept calling me ""fat"". (I don't have anything against overweight people. It's just that we both know that I am not.) 

His immaturity extends beyond me, unfortunately. He's also hurt a few of my closest friends. The details of that aren't important.

I'm not going to blame this entirely on him, however. I am at fault as well, which is why this is a ""mutually abusive"" friendship.

Obviously I reciprocate the insults, though not on the same level as he does. But I think the worst thing that I do is how one day I'll literally despise him, and the next day it'll be like nothing ever happened. Kind of like leading him on, in a way. Even I don't know why I do that. It's a serious problem.

For example, in response to him calling me ""fat"" and some other things he's done, I made the decision that I would literally cut of all contact with him. That was about a week ago. Unfortunately I've already failed at that, because we're talking again. And I don't know why I do this.

Now I've told you the bad things about our ""friendship"". But it's not all bad, otherwise I wouldn't be making this post.

For instance, he's always there when I ask for advice. Maybe this can be taken as a bad thing; in a way, I'm using him, right? I don't know. 

Also whenever he wants to rant, I'll listen to him too. And trust me, this kid has a lot to rant about.

Not to mention how (and I'd *never* admit this to him) I genuinely enjoy our conversations more than I enjoy some of the conversations with my real, close friends. I don't want to sound like I'm from r/notliketheothergirls but sometimes I just *don't* want to hear about my friends' infinite drama.

Ultimately, I know that the insults and literal ""love-hate"" relationship between us kind of make our friendship. It's possible that I'm just here for the drama, because I *know* that he makes my life more interesting. But you guys aren't here to make a judgment about me. So here are the questions I need answered:

1. Can I ""fix"" this relationship or should I actually, truly try to cut him off?

2. What would you do in my situation?

I know this is a very quick, very vague overview, so if you have any questions I'll answer them. I just might not be able to right away because right now I should really be going to sleep. Thank you!",15Dec2019,1
318,"I talked to him for a bit and tried to give him advice and make him feel better but I doubt it did much. I asked him if he's ever considered rehab and he said yes (I should have asked him if he would consider doing it, although I doubt I'd know what to say what he said ""eh idk, maybe I'll do it."" Because I know he wouldn't unless forced probably. 

He's also addicted to weed which I feel it is a huge problem for him because he does it all day every day, and he literally can't be sober. I don't know what kind of issues he's running away from but I know he needs to be sober off of everything so he can confront them. So although heroin is of course the most dangerous drug, I know weed and the other lesser drug are also majorly contributing to the problem.

Since most of our relatives live fairly close, we usually have family meetups or just generally hang out at my house. It's usually fine, my family's a little loud, but other than being obnoxious, everything goes down smooth. I have this one aunt, for easier purposes I'll just call her entitled aunt. She's recently had a kid (yayy) and she is around 3 months old, with an older kid round 10. She's been constantly leaving her kids at my house, making us babysit while she goes on dates and screws around. And I know that's normal but to a certain degree and for the stuff she goes out and does, it just doesn't add up. She did the same thing with her older kid, who is just a sweetheart that wants to spend time with her mom (EA gets her on weekends plus some weekdays) so when she finally has custody over the weekend, she gets to sit at my house in tears, not understanding why. EA did the same thing when the older girl was very very young. And now she's repeating the same thing! It started off slow, going on a few dates here and there, which is totally understandable, but now, it's gotten up to the point where the baby stays DAYS (highest being 4) before finally getting picked up.

We absolutely adore the baby, but sometimes, especially as a student trying to graduate early, time isn't necessarily something I have. And now more than ever, we're afraid of them to come over because our whole house is sick with something. She comes in unannounced most times and drops them off.

So how do I live you might ask?  
1 bedroom shared with 3 colocs. I managed to register to welfare not to long ago so I do have revenue.  
Incredibly indebted too, paying back my CC 200$ every month is basically cutting my food revenue, and don't get me started on my student loans I have to fill a form to tell them I am broke and their website is worst than a junior web developer (In other words, absolutely unusable).   
Food banks, soup kitchen, donation is mostly how I come by nowadays.   


Before I left my parents, I was in college in Computer Science. I dropped out not because of degeneracy but because I was getting so depressed in back then (reasons are diverse). Anyway one day I was getting ready to do my exams and this is where I realized I was so depressed I forgot to edit my agenda with the new exam dates and missed them. all of them.  


Back to now though. Student loans, Credit Card, Rent, Food, Amenities,  stuff. Lots of money required and barely enough revenue to make it work 

How do I fix this? Should I go back to school (at the risk of accumulating more debts) or go look for a job. Note that by job I don't mean McDonald or Tims, I want a real job. Reason is because of my welfare, the second I get a job they will cut me for anything over 200$ I make at that job, rendering the idea pointless UNLESS I got a job that payed more than my welfare (making quitting it for my job that much more realistic).",15Dec2019,1

328,"Hi all, so I got the job I've wanted since a kid. Well, sort of. I got a job at a hotel *by* my favorite place in the world. It's a huge tourist spot in my state and I've loved going there since a kid, so when I saw that they were hiring I jumped on and applied. I didn't think I'd actually get the job but I did. I was ecstatic. I had to move ten hours from my hometown and I got my first apartment. My job is at a hotel restaurant that I used to go with my family with every time we visited. The past few weeks have been a surreal dream. 

Cut to today and I'm confused and miserable as leave my fifth day on the job. I've been training all week and I thought it was great until I started to notice some things. My trainer and our shift leader were talking behind my back today. They laughed at me and when I looked at them they immediately went serious. It was obvious. Then I noticed my trainer later went out of her way to avoid sitting by me over my lunch and then when I came back she asked where I'd been as if she didn't know. Other coworkers just plain ignore me. 

I know that not everyone's going to like me and there's some nice coworkers. But I can't help but be bothered by how I'm treated only on my fifth day on the job. I could try for transferring into a different area of the hotel but most times they only allow transfers after four months with working with them. I'm not sure if it's possible this early. 

I was just wondering what I should do, if anything. Should I stay and try to work here longer and hope it gets better? Or should I try for transferring? The job itself is nice but overwhelming and honestly it fuels my anxiety. I think I'd be better suited in another area.

331,"Hey guys. I (23 F) have come to the realization recently that I may be having troubles with disassociation. I am not a therapist and dont know what I am talking about so any thoughts or info would be helpful.

Now, I've always known this is something I will do in extreme stress. And so far in my life I've always thought of disassociating as a good thing. To be completely honest and frank, it has helped me get through some bad sexual situations relatively unscathed. It has also helped me deal with emotional and mental abuse as well. It has helped me deal with people who are bigger than me being threatening and it has just in general helped me survive some tough situations.

The thing is that I've recently realized that the obvious times where this will happen (where it's out of body/doesn't feel real/your almost kind of numb/maybe even forget parts of what happened/off in a fantasy, ect..) may not be the only times I do this. 
In fact, I'm starting to think that a lot of my carelessness and stupidity is linked to disassociating too often. 

In times of stress I often find myself losing chunks of time. And that's not just like not being able to recall things after the fact. Sometimes I cant remember what's going on while it's going on. for example while I am angry and arguing with someone, I often find myself forgetting what is happening as it is happening. Like, I cant even understand sentence to sentence what i am saying. I am talking, and people are listening, but I cant follow myself and after I am done talking I cant remember what I've said at all. Even as I'm talking I dont understand my words, but everyone else seems to. It makes it very hard to keep up a conversation. I dont understand their responses because I dont understand what we are talking about. 

On a similar note apparently I sometimes will start sentences and not finish them, and when people ask me what I'm talking about I dont know what they are talking about? This is something that has been pointed out to me. Or starting sentences in the middle of a sentence and then still not finishing.  

Or I find myself taking longer to learn things if they are even a little stressful because I will just stare off and my mind will just freeze completely. It's not like daydreaming. It's like my mind will shut down and not accept what's going on around me so I just stare off or look down and dont move even if I need to. If i didnt shut down like this, I could learn how to handle these situations easier. (Easy situations, like using tools or finding my way around a building.. none of this stuff should be stressful enouph to cause this reaction)

Although I do daydream a lot too. Almost constantly. More of my day is spent daydreaming than not. Its enouph where it stops me from doing things I need to do. I daydream at least once every waking hour. And they arent always pleasant daydreams. In fact they are rarely pleasant. Usually in them I am in danger or being hurt in some way. They really suck me in. I'll lie in bed for 5+ hours.

Anyways if anyone has any thoughts let me know. Does this stuff sound like disassociating? Or is there maybe something else going on? 
Thank you!

TL:DR I think I may be disassociating often but I'm not sure.",15Dec2019,1

But still, I've never had this happen before. I party a lot and I've had a lot of messy sex but I've never had a guy not be able to cum. Is it something I'm doing or maybe he has a problem? One night we also had been doing coke so maybe stim dick but ffs 3 times in a row I feel bad for the guy.

341,"One month ago my sister[21F] came home extremely drunk. She was held at gunpoint, robbed, &amp; beaten up by 3 men so bad to the point of a brain bleed (massive bump sticking out of her head that night. Pretty fucking scary.) 

She’s an alcoholic so we’re pretty used to her coming home trashed, but seeing her like this was pretty awful. After an ambulance and police showed up [around 3am], and practically begged her to go the hospital because of her current state, she refused, signed some papers and they left. 

Around 5am, after trying to still convince her to go to the hospital bc of her brain bleed, she said no, however she wanted to talk to me [15F] outside.

We sat outside and I could barely look at her, there was something sticking out of her head, and her eyes were swollen shut and it was bad. Anyway, she said her psychiatrist of 4 years (note: she’s very private, so even me, the person closest to her never even knew she’s even been seeing one) recommended she opens up to a trusted person in her life.

Very drunk, she told me while she was away for uni, and 19, she got raped by a stranger at a party. And that was how she “lost her virginity”.

She got up and left.

I have never mentioned it to this day and I really tried to forget about it.

For a couple of weeks, it worked. 

It hit me today my own sister has gotten raped and it hurts to think she’s a victim of sexual abuse. No, I haven’t talked to her about it because she doesn’t have memory of that night/morning prior to getting assaulted. So in her perspective shes never told me, and the conversation doesn’t exist.

Although it’s very real to me and I don’t know how to cope. Sounds selfish I’m me this about me. Ugh. 

I didn’t really have time to react that day btw, or talk about it when she woke up because 

A. Wouldn’t feel comfortable to her about something so sensitive she told me drunk and doesn’t recall. I don’t want to invade her privacy.

B. When she sobered up at the hospital she realized where she was then refused to take CT tests and did the same thing she did at home — signed papers and left. 

I spent the next 48 hours waking her up after every time she napped to make sure she’s still conscious and alive! :) apparently if she slept too long she could die. Or making sure she still has memory. So it was a pretty shitty week for me and now I just want to erase my memory. 

Never told anyone this not my friends (don’t tell them personal things anyway) or my family (it’s not my right to discuss her business.)

345,"I just need to rant about this and we want some advice too. Please help me.

So a week ago, my partner (of one and a half years) and I were having sex and I got really into it and ended up finishing pretty quickly and onto her back. Some things to note: 1) I was wearing a condom. 2) I pulled out before I ejaculated, meaning I'm pretty sure none of it shot into the condom. 3) I took 5 seconds after pulling out and before ejaculating on her back. When I finished, though, she was pretty freaked out because it landed on her lower back. I made sure to check the condom for tears by filling it with water (no leaks), and she showered immediately.

Some background: we met in the freshman year of college and started dating immediately. We love each other very much but because she comes from a conservative family, she's always been worried about her parents finding out about us not only dating but also having sex. Since we're younger and since her parents want her to focus on her studies, she wants to keep it a secret until we've got college stuff, getting an internship, and future prospects to the point where they wouldn't doubt that being in a relationship would either ruin her studies or her future. So far, our fundamental plan is working and we've both maintained good GPAs and have already secured internships for the summer as sophomores. However, my greatest fear is that our she would end up pregnant from our sex and I'd completely wreck our plan for coming out to her parents as a responsible adult.

More background: sometime after the first month of our dating, we both had sex for the first time together (we were both virgins), and I being a complete idiot finished inside her. We had a condom, but I had no idea that it could rip and we never ended up checking it. I ran to the CVS 2 miles away at 3AM to get the plan B. That was probably the worst week of our lives, but I'd also say that we got really close because both of us became were very open about our families and our feelings during that time. Also important, she told me that her family back at home would be very disappointed and in her culture, she'd be treated differently by all of her relatives if they knew anything like this would happen.

Now let me explain the timing:

1. She had her period starting November 9th
2. We have sex twice in those two weeks till Thanksgiving break (nothing happened both of those times, I didn't ejaculate until a minute after pulling out as a precaution, we checked the condom regularly)
3. Thanksgiving break (Nov 22nd-Nov 29th) happens, she's stressing and studying for 6 exams
4. The week after Thanksgiving break, she takes 3 of her exams (she stays up late the nights before each of those)
5. Before her 2nd and 3rd exam on Thursday, she stays up really late studying with a lot of coffee, wakes up and drinks a monster/coke, doesn't eat anything except sugary stuff before her tests, and after dinner she throws up because of how sick she felt
6. Friday, Saturday, she's really busy with her studying/club
7. Sunday, we have our incident I describe in the second paragraph
8. Monday night she stays up for an exam cramming and is really stressed about it. 
9. Tuesday she finishes her tests, but at this point I have an exam on Friday
10. We get drunk on the last night and she gets really hungover and throws up a lot
11. Now, we're separate again for Winter break, and she still hasn't had her period (today is Dec. 15)

I will note that she felt completely fine during her Thanksgiving break. I didn't get a pregnancy test between taking my last exam and driving down to my hometown and being separated, but now I really regret it.

Here are some reasons I don't think I should be worried about pregnancy:

* None of the times we had sex did anything seriously big happen that involved finishing right inside her, except for that last time
* She's been really stressed with exams and her club
* She's been eating really badly because of how little time we've had to make real food. We have both gained a lot of weight this semester.
* Some of the food we've been eating (lots of fast food, sugary snacks, caffeine, alcohol \[only once\], skipping meals) have caused her to throw up in the evenings
* She's not exhibiting any symptoms of pregnancy, except her late period

Here are some reasons I think I have to be worried about pregnancy:

* She's late to her period by a week. She used to always be a week late to her period, but over the summer, she's had them on time. Not sure about now though.

We've talked together about how rationally, we don't have much to worry about because we know we've been careful recently with sex. But with such a late period, we're extremely worried that maybe she is pregnant. We do know that bad diet/high stress from finals can lead to later periods, but her period hasn't been this late in a while now since she had been eating well during the Summer/early school year.

Best case, she gets her period really soon and all of this will blow over...

She's also going to her mom's home country for a month tomorrow. We think that my gf can hold off on giving away any pregnancy signs while she is there with her mom and relatives (signs don't show in a month), but her mom is pretty in tune with her periods. She's worried that if her period is delayed and delayed, her mom will take her to the clinic to get her health checked out and find out she's pregnant. She wants to say that she isn't expecting and that it was probably high stress from exams just a week before.

Worst case: our plan for when she gets back is to visit the nearest abortion clinic and try to resolve this quietly (we'll pay our own money from my job and her job savings), but neither of us are looking forward to that. Absolute worst case: both of our parents find out and shit goes down.

So I want to know what you guys think about the chances of pregnancy are, and what we should plan to do if her period doesn't come. I've thought about a bunch of doomsday predictions from her getting disowned, me getting disowned, or both. We've talked about it and we've promised each other we would stick together and have each other's backs if anything happens.

I just want some certainty for the situation because I'm having a hard time sleeping with how guilty I feel for this whole thing.

347,"My brother is 28 years old. Lives with my mom, my sister, her kids, and I. 

He does not seek out help, says he’s “too fucked up to fix it”. He is paranoid, has serious anger issues, suicidal (at least used to be), a big big chronic LIAR (forgot the term for it), painkillers are his choice of drug and he has a couple other problems. 


He only works 2 days a week, mooches off my mom, is a HUGE chronic complainer.  Beat his father up with a golf club years ago because he said he had no more weed for them to smoke. My mother is SCARED of him, everyone is and I feel he feeds off of it.

348,"First time poster here.

Over a year ago, I befriended a coworker (Yvette) around my age (early-mid 20s). We worked closely together and became very close as friends after our job ended (we work long-term freelance jobs). Over the course of our friendship, Yvette began trying to incorporate me into her larger friend group from college. At the helm of this friend group, and Yvette's best friend, is Katie. 

Although I've been cordial with Katie, I've never clicked with her. I will admit, I was wary of her before I met her, having heard several stories that clouded my judgment. However, I'm a generally friendly person and would like to think I didn't let that show through when we've hung out. 

In the time I've been friends with Yvette, there have been a few things that have given me pause. Although the majority of the friend group is welcoming to me, anytime Katie is hosting something at her apartment, I get left out. The first time it happened, I was invited out to a 70s night at a local club with the group. When I asked if anyone had plans before or would like to get ready together, everyone avoided my question. I found out on Instagram the next day that they had all gotten together at Katie's house. No one told me before the event happened or even at the event. Everyone we knew that came had been invited to the pregame except for me. Yvette apologized to me later and explained that Katie has anxiety and doesn't like having a lot of people in her space. Although I don't necessarily understand, I respected her choice and didn't raise issue. 

So onto the current issue I need advice on: 

Another member of the friend group (Christy) is having a holiday party tomorrow. Although she is now part of the group, she was originally Katie's friend and they are close. I was invited to this holiday party later than everyone else, but brushed it off, since we aren't that close. 

However, tonight I'm seeing on Instagram that once again, the entire group was invited over to Katie's house for a party, but not me. Christy is there. Yvette is there. And in addition to the core friend group, there are several other people in attendance as well. I would say there's around 25+ people at the party. 

In all honesty, it's put a really bad taste in my mouth and now I don't want to go to Christy's holiday party tomorrow. I've told her I'd come (I know it's going to be small since a lot of our friend group couldn't make tomorrow work) and I've made a dessert for everyone. I also know that my main issue seems to be with Katie but.. I don't know. I know Katie will be there and I know 3/4 of the people in attendance will have been at the party I wasn't invited to.

Am I being too insecure? Would I be taking it out on the wrong person if I don't go?

349,"Sorry this is a ramble!

Back in high school (HS) I was a different person to now, and to how I was as a child. I had moved to a new area in my city when I started HS so I could “rebrand” myself, and I put myself out there and made lot of friends. Since starting uni, at the end of my first year I had a very jarring experience and it changed my whole outlook on life. I found most of those friends from hs became people I didn’t want myself surrounded by (not motivated by anything or ambitious, into hard drugs and excessive drinking, into how they presented themselves on social media. I know these are all common young adult traits but it’s just not me) and slowly those friends have been dwindling off - by a choice of my own. I completely understand this is normal as people grow apart but everyone seems to be growing together but me. I’m now going into my final year of uni in 2020 and I feel so lonely. The 2 people I remained close with from HS have their own other uni friends and that’s fine but now it’s summer and I have nothing social to do. 

I’ve always been naturally introverted but over the year since the jarring experience my shyness and introversion has reverted back to how I was as a young child, and I seem to be stuck in it. I made uni 1 friend, I was very close with him (definitely one of my closest friends) but I guess my insecurities of being boring and bland and shy had taken over because I haven’t been talking to him as much over the past few months. He has since become very close with one of the 2 people I remained close with from HS - which again is totally fine, I introduced them to one another, but I feel like I’m doing something wrong. 

Something which may have attributed to this is my partner, who I’ve been with since around mid 2018 - We naturally spend a lot of time together so it feels like its us vs. the whole world, but now he’s back in his hometown for the summer and I just feel so lonely. 

I just want some advice on how to put myself out there again. I scroll through social media and see all my old friends hanging out together, and with their new friends, doing stuff (although it is stuff I personally would rather not do) and it makes me feel as if there is something wrong with me as I haven’t been able to stick around with my HS friends or make new friends.

356,"I'm honestly not sure where to begin with this. I've been going to college since summer of 2016, and I don't have an AA yet. I had a good start, 2016 was a great year for me. Then 2017 was a terrible year for me, I failed a handful of classes that year. I still maintained my GPA and it didn't get lower than a 2.0. 2018 was the year I rebounded. I improved in classes as well as my GPA, and the Spring of 2019 was a good semester too, I only failed Chemistry 2, but passed it when I retook it next summer. But the next summer is when shit started to go downhill from here. I took a calculus course and I failed, it was hard, but I'm being honest, I failed because I was caught cheating on a test, I own up to it now and attended a seminar for redemption, but I also didn't do too well in my biology 2 lab, it was too fast paced, and I experienced a lot of difficulties in getting my lab report done in time, I'm a very slow writer. Anyways, the following semester, I retook those two classes, without any cheating, and I didn't pass. Every time I take a test, my mind draws a blank, which is why I've had temptations of cheating, but obviously didn't want to go through the same thing over again. Every semester, I'm always stressed because my sadness would often yell at me and threaten to kick me out of the house if I dont pass my classes, I honestly was not planning on having this happe to me. I'm freaking out because that's was my second attempt at taking those classes meaning that the third attempt, I have to pay out of state tuition, which is no big deal because there should be a fee waiver I'm able to submit. But what I'm freaking out about the oat was that I was placed on financial aid warning because in the semester, I had a higher fail pass ratio, I failed more classes than I passed. They paid for my fall semester, but since I blew it, I'm panicking. I don't know how my future will be. Ive definitely learned from my mistakes am doing feel like I'll do better next time but still, I failed, so I don't know if there  will be a next time. I feel pretty lost right now.

But I still need to get my AA in order to transfer schools and get my bachelors. Basically, because of this screw up and my situation, Im considering suicide, because I'm too scared to show my parents my grade, they always punish my in the worst ways. And in some cases, Ive even came close to getting kicked out. It's  not my fault I suck at math. Trigonometry was easy, but calculus is a nightmare. And biology is super boring for me.

I never liked him or saw him as someone I would ever be with and it was the same way around (I think). He would tell me and show me the numerous girls he would fuck EACH WEEK and he even told me when he first liked his girlfriend but later he eventually ended up cheating on her. Then he lied to get her back you know the typical cheating man and I felt bad but I let him be I mean he was like my best friend. At this point I knew he had issues. Yet I continued to be his friend because this wasn’t all what our friendship consisted of we often spoke about obviously how our day went or memes. Fast forward, we fucked and I went ghost because i realized how emotionally fucked up this dude was. I mean looking back I think he may have been a bit of a sociopath . I don’t mean to diagnose in any way, but look 1. he was very dominant ex : ask for my passwords , subtly ask who I was with then bash the perosn I was with 2. after having sex he felt entitled for more (I did indeed tell him to back off) 3. I was usually the one telling him about myself while I never realized I knew nothing much about him or his past (he would tell me stuff but obviously unimportant stuff like the girls) 4. Everyone thinks he’s sweet and kind and great but I caught him one day lying to this girl saying he’s a college basketball player??? He lied so much and I mean it could’ve been a joke, but I doubt it he often put on this fake persona for others and I saw right through it tbh. 5. When I tried to talk to him about deep things he would change the subject and make it a joke 6. He often never took blame and turned the tables a lot 7. He was selfish and had a big ego I always called him out on hit he didn’t think much. Ok you get the point and I alway connected this hurting of woman to him mom he never talked about her and I just know they have a rough relationship but my question is. Who was I? Just another girl he was trying to play?

362,"Well it’s that time of the year, and it’s safe to say that it’s not going well. My grades right now are looking like D,D,C,A, for the 4 classes I’m taking this semester. Up until this point my college gpa was a 3.55 and i didn’t really try but still got good grades. Now it’s just sophomore year and I figured out that I can’t do the same things I was doing before, and it’s kind of like a wake up call.

I’m not even planning to tell my parents unless they ask me, and then they’re going ask why, and like I could tell them that there where days when I would just go to school but skip class and sit in my car, or how I would feel like killing myself and wouldn’t want to do anything other than smoke weed, or the breakdowns that I’ve had just over the course of the semester where I felt empty and soulless to the point of a zombie, but I don’t have a close relationship with them and could never trust them.

It literally feels like my world is crumbling down and nothing even matters anymore. Like it’s absolutely crazy like I’m in survival mode and I haven’t eaten all for the past 2 weeks, and have lost 5 pounds, I haven’t been able to sleep bc of the sheer anxiety and dread, and it’s just a constant battle with the negativity that I bring to myself which makes me just want to do nothing and just sulk in my feelings. This whole semester I’ve been too busy sulking in my feeling and just feeling sorry for myself.

I’m just way over my head and even though I know it sounds childish, but I think this is my rock bottom. I have never felt worse in my life and I look around me and I don’t even feel like I belong in society. 

I’m gonna going to be spending a few weeks off the grid in the country and I’m not going to have access to weed or anything, and it’s just going to be mostly me and my thoughts. I don’t even know what I’m asking but like how do I even move forward from this? It’s like I’m in such a mess and I know it’s going to take forever to untangle myself from this one, and I just don’t know if I’m going to have the guts to continue with anything really.",15Dec2019,1

“Doing right gets results, doing wrong gets consequences.” \~ **Amit Kalantri**

Are you aware of the outcomes you are going to face in the future after whatever you are doing right now? If not then ask this same question to yourself until you got the answer. And if you are not getting the answer then call your parents, your so-called friends and share whatever you are feeling with them and if you get the answer then leave this page right now. Else hook up with it...

“if something’s important enough you should try. Even if the probable outcome is a failure.”\~ Elon Musk

Outcomes, literally I was not aware of it until I was moved by a situation in my life. I am not kidding I had the same thing that you are having so don’t take it like it is happening to me and I am the only one who is facing it. If you are having this then literally do meditation and try to enjoy the present. No past No future just lives the present moment. Don’t fucking care about the outcomes right now. Have some chill and try to have great talks with your family members, your friends, and your loved ones. And if you don’t have those then you can talk to me. I will be so grateful for it.

And now the final thing comes, after having the chill now try to focus on what you want to achieve and do everything you can do to make it yours. Think about it, literally go out and hunt. Hunt your dreams and live every moment of your life. People will say a lot of stuff about you but don’t give a fuck to them. And aware of the outcomes as soon as possible you can.",15Dec2019,1

He’s had more than enough time to find a job, and just now started working recently. I feel like he’s pushed having a job off for a while or maybe really  did struggle for months to find one. Im Not sure , but at this point I’m frustrated. I’m really not sure at this point, we don’t ask anything from him really. He doesn’t pay rent,  I cook meals for everyone to eat, He doesn’t have a room since we Live in a one bedroom apartment. So he stays on the couch, which is fine however the couch is kinda ruined now , stained and it just smells. That’s not even the point I don’t care I truly just want my  privacy back. I really just stay in my room when my BF is not around because I feel awkward. We are going on move into a 2 bedroom home soon and my bfs wants too find a basement so he could stay there. I don’t want him living with us when the baby arrives! I want privacy in my own home. I don’t want to have to clean up after another grown adult and feed another grown adult while trying to take care of a new baby. I feel like I sound crazy or rude! I need advice please I’ve talked to my bf about it and he immediately got offended and said he wants to move. But actions speak louder than words. I’ve been hearing that for months but I’m seriously over this and want privacy in my home. I don’t want to be rude about this but i just wish my bf would understand! Please any advice or what do you think? And I being over dramatic about this? Anything would be great!?

370,"I haven't seen my Mum for 2 and a half years now. We have never had a good relationship. She was abusive to me throughout my childhood and teenage years and continued to be abusive until I moved out at 20. Her boyfriend was also abusive. It was horrific.

She's not a nice person, she's a narcissist and very manipulative. She's also an alcoholic.

I grew up hating her, I hated her with everything I had, I couldn't wait to grow up so I could move out and get away from her. It got so bad that at the age of 10 I would make up plans on how I could murder her and get away with it, just so I could escape her abuse. (I obviously never acted on any of this). 

I eventually moved out and I haven't seen her a lot since, probably two or three times a year, if that (I'm almost 29 now). I cut her out completely 2 and a half years ago when she left me a random voicemail saying I'm no daughter of hers and I'd be better off dead. I gave up trying after that. 

She's in hospital right now and they aren't treating her anymore, they are just making her comfortable. She has days left to live. I haven't been to see her. 

I am extremely upset, I can't stop crying and when I imagine her actually gone I break down. I don't understand why I feel this way at all, because she's never been a mother to me. I guess what I'm asking is can anyone help me make sense of why I'm so upset? I feel like I'm losing my mind. Why am I upset? 

I've thought about this day lots if times and I've never felt upset, I don't feel any love for her. I feel angry at her, I feel pity for her, I resent her... but I don't love her. I just don't understand it.

371,"Just for reference: I am in my late-20s and my dad is in his mid-60s. I am an only child. 

My dad is leaving to go back home after visiting for a week with me and my husband. I don't get to see him often because he lives fairly far away and the airfare is expensive. I see him about once every three years. 

This last visit has been really emotional for me. I can see my dad slowing down and aging and it is bothering me immensely. The idea of my parents' mortality hit me hard this week. So here is my question: I want to write a letter to my dad because I want nothing to go unsaid. I would love to tell him everything in person, but I am an extremely emotional person who is very attached to my parents. Meaning that I wouldn't be able to say everything I want without sounding like a babbling idiot.

I want to tell him how watching him age has made me appreciate life and not take any time for granted with him. I want to thank him for always being the rock in my life, whether I need sage advice or an opinion or being there when I need to talk to someone. I want to let him know that I look up to him and aspire to be more like him every day. I want to ask him what he still wants to do in his life that he hasn't yet and what would be the greatest joy in his point of view for me. 

Is this too raw and over the top? I want to be careful in wording the letter. I don't want him to think that I am worrying about him every second and that he is incapable and old. Would it be okay to do this? Would you be like wtf?! if your kid give a letter like this to you when you were older? My dad has gotten quite open and soft natured in his old age that I think he would reciprocate to the letter well, but I don't want him to worry about his age either. I am also deciding if I want to send the letter home with him, or let my emotions settle down and write it for his birthday in a month.",15Dec2019,1

374,"I just finished my exams in the first semester of my sophomore year of college. I go to university in a smaller city than where I grew up, so there is not that much to do and there aren't a whole lot of people compared to what I am used to. I have just recently started trying more seriously to deal with my depression, OCD, and anxiety, but I still have a long way to go. This semester was particularly challenging for me too because there was a lot of drama with me liking a girl, on top of the school work for my engineering major. I've been much more socially involved this semester compared to my freshman year, but despite this I still feel extremely lonely. I came to this university for the scholarships, but also largely because three of my high school friends were going there and we could all be roommates (suite style dorms, we all have our own room). However, recently I have been drifting away from them because the one that I was closest to got a girlfriend at the beginning of the semester so I don't see him near as much as I used to. It's been really difficult for me to adjust to not doing everything with him like I used to, and my other two roommates have kind of been doing their own thing while I third wheel with my roommate and his girlfriend. I have always felt like a drone going through the same motions everyday, even when I try new things like I did this semester such as making new friends and trying to reach out to people first to hang out. When I am hanging out with my new friends, I find it very difficult to have fun because my OCD gives me intrusive thoughts that make me think that they don't like me, and make me jealous of them seemingly being very happy with where they are in life (more friends, girlfriends, better grades, etc.). I know that people can appear to have everything under control on the outside, but still have their own problems to deal with behind closed doors, but my roommate that got a girlfriend this semester said that he is happy with where he is now. I am completely lost right now; I'm lonely, depressed, and I feel like I am taking everything for granted. I personally think that I am very self aware regarding my mental illnesses, and I recognize that what I am going through is a relatively normal thing for people to experience, but I can't help but feel alone in my struggles despite knowing the contrary. Since this summer, I have been trying therapy, antidepressants and anxiety meds, better sleep habits, and positive thinking, but I still feel like shit almost everyday. I know I have to be patient with trial and error to find the right antidepressant for me (tried sertraline for about 2 years, and switched to prozac 2 months ago), but I've been dealing with these problems for my whole life and I just never felt motivated enough to try to do anything about it, so I'm honestly just tired of it.

The hook ups ranged with people from 17-36. Recently I’ve met a boy, no not a boy man, his name is Robert[31]. I’ve snuck out for a few times for guys. I did so for Robert and we went back to his house and smoked a blunt. We went in his house and I literally have had the best sex I’ve ever had in the entirety of my life.

I asked him what was wrong and he told me “I didn’t expect you to be this funny, amazing and good at sex”. We laughed and looked at each other.

My sister slept with my boyfriend a few years ago, when I stopped talking to her she went psychotic stalking me and writing a letter blaming me. We ended up reconciling and she kept saying bf and I were on a break, and it was consensual etc. She finally stopped but we got into another huge fight last year and reconciled again in February..... She then started saying bf raped and sexually assaulted her and wanted him to apologize. (I am still with bf as trashy as it is.... I mean it when I say it was completely out of character and he has received help and we are much stronger and happier people). After a few years of me being a pushover (letting her say all this shit and not stopping it) I put my foot down and told her that I would not have bf apologize when she has never apologized to me. THE VICTIM.  I sent a long text after radio silence saying either she drops it completely, admits it wasnt rape (which regardless I have an email where she said it was consensual) and we try and build a healthier relationship than previous attempts or we can sever ties... I never got a response back.... So after all the victim blaming, general terror, manipulation etc I now feel abandoned. 


I know it's not my fault but I feel like I did something wrong and I don't want to feel this way.

382,"So I've always been on the chubbier side, but after I entered college I gained a few extra pounds. As far back as I can remember I've been insecure about my body.

384,"Note: Apologies, I'm venting a bit while talking, because most happened recently, and I'm still trying to process things. 



I've (m19) been knowing my best friend (f17), let's call her Jill, for about 1,5 years now. Since we've only known each other virtually, we decided that I should visit her. That was yesterday. It was the first time we ever met physically. 
Her boyfriend (m18) whom we call Eric, with whom she's been together with for about 3 months, came along.

I have to admit, I'm a socially awkward and anxious person, but still tried to make the best out of it, even though I'd have wished secretly to only meet her and have dinner with her.
We hardly talked with each other. Idk if that was due to me wearing my headphones and surfing the web on my phone (I don't like loud places so I donwear them) or because they rather kept talking to each other. 
I tried to initialize a conversation once or twice, but it didn't work. And I think her bf and I don't get all too well together. 

We didn't talk much, I excused myself after only 1 hour, gave her the money, and left.

What was that money for?, you ask?

It's been a plan of Jill and mine for a long time now that we two would visit Japan together after she graduates next year, in the summer. We've both been trying to save some money here and there, having little to no luck usually. As I started a part time job next to studying, I was able to save about 1/6 th of the money needed, and gave it to her yesterday.

Anyway, before getting sidetracked...

Now, here's the thing: After Jill told me she got together with Eric, I felt....devastaed. I know this sounds stupid, and you're not supposed to catch feelings so suddenly for your bf, or so I think, but... I felt and still do feel jealous. First I thought I was just jealous of their luck and lovely relationship.
But even after I got together with Mary, my roommate (it's more like friendship with benefits plus lots of empotional caring for each other), I still felt that jealousy. Before yesterday, Mary had repeatedly told me I had fallen for Jill, which I dismissed. 
But I think last night I realized Mary was right.

Jill and I often joked about how much both I and her bf want to spend time with her and are afraid of losing her, calling her a ""drug"" you can hardly resist. Well, now I'm sure I've become a junkie.

Sorry, got sidetracked again. Anyway. After Jill told me they were together, I tried to make the best out of it despite my emotions and thought it'd be a great idea to invite him along to Japan. My dimbass even offered to help him pay for his ticket, if necessary.
Jill and Eric both thought it was a great idea, and Eric has been trying to save some money since then.

The thing I desperately need your advice for is: Should I...can I tell Jill I don't or rather wouldn't want Eric to come along with us to Japan for the arranged 10 days anymore? You could definitely argue I'm doing this only to make Eric jealous or to have Jill all for myself, but it's also true Eric and I hardly talk with each other. Jill likes to talk to both of us, I guess. However, during a 10 day long trip, spending the time with a couple with us hardly sling anything wholeheartedly together doesn't also sound like fun.

I don't know, maybe I'm just the asshole in this scenario. Or maybe just heartbroken. Or stupid. Or all three of them.

Hell, if it's necessary, I won't fly to Tokyo and let Jill go there with Eric and pay for Jill's ticket. Because she wants to go there so much more than anyone else of us. It's her dream destination.
But I also selfishly want to be there with her, just the two of us. 

What should I do? I'm confused. Please tell me what to do. Or at least if I should wait a little before making any decisions, because I'm so tempted to just tell her everything right away rn...

387,"Hi, this year has been a very tough and confusing period of my life. I made compromises on my career, social life, and moved to another country to live with my ex-partner of 4 years. I was happy with it as I really enjoy this country. However, the pressure of a bad job, visa issues, and a whole lot of relationship troubles led to a brutal and ugly break up that threw me into clinical depression. It has been 3 months now and even though I am still affected by the end of my long term relationship, I do not qualify for clinical depression anymore (i.e. I'm sad sometimes, but not all the time or mentally ill from the grief).

I have secured myself a new visa (last one depended on my partner), got a raise at work in line with my expectations, job got less stressful. I am seeing a new therapist to keep my relationship grieving in check.

Now that I'm simmering back down to my baseline, living alone in a new place, secure in my job and my visa, I'm really struggling to decide if I don't just want to go back to my home country. I REALLY wanted to 3 months ago but mostly as a reaction to the ugly break up, so I did not act on it and worked for a new visa and job position instead.

The one thing I really feel I lack here is a social circle. I finally made two reliable friends from work, but we are very different and one of them is moving away in March next year anyway. I'm 28, I don't really mesh with the people I meet in my current hobbies, and it's super hard to make new friends. I'm in contact every day and spend time online every weekend with my close friends I left back in my home country, but with the time difference and distance, I really miss them. I could go on holiday trips with them, here I don't have that kind of relationship.

I feel I sacrificed A LOT to make my relationship work, which most likely was part of the reasons it failed, and now that my plans for a future together with my ex are long gone, I feel the only thing making me stay is the commitment to at least being granted permanent residency. I have been fighting for 3 years to be a permanent resident, mostly so I could live and make my life with my ex (but I also love the country itself).

Is it even worth it though? it would probably take me another 2 years to get it through my job, which I would definitely rather leave sometime next year. All the while I feel unsatisfied with my social circle, and my love life is going to be non existant for however long it takes me to move on from my ex.

What do you think are good reasons for moving to/back the other side of the world and starting a new life, AGAIN?

Career wise, I would get much better job prospects at home where I am a citizen with no limitations, and where my experience abroad would be seen as valuable. However that would mean job hunting again. 

Quality of Life wise, I don't think I want to make my life in my home city, quality of life is quite bad compared to where I am now. However, not everything is great for me here as I'm an immigrant without access to healthcare, voting, higher taxes... And I just got my own place, I don't have a car yet... but moving back home is also moving to a new place, again. 

Family wise, all my family is back home. I'm ok with it except I realised I could have really used their support when going through my relationship breakdown and depression. I ultimately reached out to them and they did help me, but had they been in my proximity they would have realised I was depressed and things werent going well with my ex, that kind of external support and feedback would have saved me a lot of pain.

Friends wise, I dont have any real friends here. There are two persons I get on pretty well with, but one is moving away soon, and the other is still very different and much much younger than me. I have tons of very close life long friends back home, I'm in contact with them almost everyday and I do miss them a lot.

Mentally, I am confused with my mind both feeling that moving back home is a failure and basically giving up, and staying in the new country is hanging to a failed new life that relied a lot on being with my ex. I feel that both choices suck.

Also, if I move back home before I get permanent residency, I probably never will move to the other country again, I just won't have any legal pathways. So there is this pressure of, I can't just go back home to see and have a feel then decide to move again if I feel it was a mistake. 
I'm at a loss on every aspects of what would make my life more enjoyable : stalemate at work (have to keep that job for my visa), no social circle and having no success building one, no romantic relationships for a long time as my heart is in shatters, quality of life ok but it feels bland without the rest. 

Does anyone have a similar life experience? Has anyone have any advice to give when it seems that no matter how much I list the pros and cons, I'm still dissatisfied by either choices? Of course I'm not asking you to decide for me, but reading similar experiences and new perspectives might help me get unstuck and come up with a plan.",15Dec2019,1
388,"So some background

Whenever I wanted to masturbate, I never have any real struggles getting it up and it goes fine, but for the past 1.5 years I've been trying to do the sexy times with my gf aswell, with little success. I've had struggles with this since the very first time, so i dont think its an STD

My current running theory is that when the first time i tried to have sex I was preetty drunk and simply had a case of whisky dick, but that now I just get nervous and think about getting it up instead of enjoying the moment (and when you think about it, it obviously wont happen)

The entire situation really does dig into my confidence, especially when im arouns friends and we talk abiut sex and the things around it.My gf is truly sweet about it and is very understanding and aupporting for it, but i can tell she does not like it either and is kind annoyed by it.

I’ve had asthma for about 7 years now give or take and 6 months ago I went to the same clinic, sobbing because I couldn’t breathe and hadn’t slept for days. Nvm the smaller asthma attacks I kept getting at school. The doctor send me home with an allergy pill... I was hospitalized the same night because it got worse, my dad had to drive me to the emergency thing.

Now I went in a couple of weeks ago because I had the flu or something like it. But I kept coughing and coughing, like I would barely walk and talk without almost dying. She listened to my back for about 3 seconds, said “yeah I can hear a little whistle in your lungs” and prescribed me some pills. She barely tried. Well it’s been a week and the coughing is now so bad that I’ve given up exercising, even walking in a fast pace, I vomit every time I cough and I honestly joke about having tuberculosis. 

Should I try and get my hands on some asthma medicine that’s easier to get down than my current and hope that helps? Since I’ll get more medicine into my system? Do I call the doctors office or make a new appointment? I’m honestly terrified they’ll send me home with an allergy pill or tell me I’m lying, so I would rather try and find a solution myself.

I could ask my dad to drive me to the hospital but it’s not exactly an emergency and I’m afraid the doctors there will scold me",15Dec2019,1

396,"I (19M) got suspended for a semester from the university I attended Bc of student conduct violations last school year. This was Bc I got arrested last year and got a few charges. All were misdemeanors and have been handled. My parents are divorced and I lived with my dad and he took care of college related things before I moved out last year. I went to him for help when I got in legal trouble and he helped. I kept all the charges a secret from my mom as well as me getting suspended Bc she’s had a rough couple of years and I’m terrified of making it worse by telling her. I kept one charge a secret from my dad. 
At the start of of this school year I moved back to the town the university is located in, into an apartment with some friends. I planned on working the whole semester so I could pay off rent then go back to school next semester when my suspension was over. I struggled to find work initially and got a credit card so I could pay some of my rent. I finally got a job and things were going well until they dug deeper into my background and didn’t like the misdemeanors I had gotten. They basically gave me the option to take a severe pay cut or leave. I felt somewhat betrayed and left. I then sold my car (which I’ve only told my dad about) so I could pay rent and the rest of my lawyer fees Bc I was without a job. I’ve since got another job but it’s only part time and doesn’t pay very good. I’m constantly applying for full time entry level jobs, and I have a good resume and references for someone my age IMO. It’s been a month or two and I haven’t even gotten an interview. 
Basically, the money from selling my car has run out and I am a month behind on rent and just got an eviction notice. My mom is the guarantor for the apartment, and I have to go home soon for Christmas.

397," I am the mother of two girls aged 13 and 18. My elder daughter is greatly pampered at home, mainly because she is extremely beautiful and is adept at sports as well as in academics. My younger daughter, however, is only interested in sports.She idolizes her older sister and follows her like a shadow. They hang together through thick and thin and often share the same bed.

Although my older daughter is five years older, I have noticed that she **always loses** to her younger sister whenever they play chess or badminton. A year ago, they joined the same academy for grappling (no gi and bjj ). They have been assigned separate batches and never compete with each other in tournaments. At home, though, they frequently grapple and the younger girl habitually emerges victorious.

Yesterday, I actually witnessed one of their bouts. The 13 year old held her older sister in such a position where she could barely breathe. She released her only after she tapped her on the shoulder. Despite all this, the older girl gave her a hug and congratulatory kiss on the cheek.

I am certain that my 18 year old old is not letting her sister win, because she considers it unethical to lose on purpose.She keeps telling me that her younger sister is much stronger and fights like a man. What on earth could that mean? Why ""man"" and not ""girl""?

My younger daughter has in fact nicknamed her sister ""the loser"" and my daughter never protests. Is she suffering from some kind of identity crisis? Is she confusing gender roles or something?",15Dec2019,1

I appreciate and think it's great that they are passionate of current world issues but I feel it is inappropriate to talk about excessively in the work environment and it's making me extremely uncomfortable.

408,"I have posted about this many times but deleted the posts many times as I never really got any response. But hey, I’m gonna try again. I’m 16F. I only just recently came out to my parents as a lesbian, I have been in the closet for 4 years now. Anyways, I got introduced to a girl the other day 19F. My friend told me that we sort of have the same vibe. I have been single for a while, I have never really had any feelings for anyone. I had things with girls but it never really meant anything &amp; we would end up ghosting eachother after a few days. I never actually really catch feelings, it sort of upset me so I gave up looking for love. 

When my friend introduced me to this girl, I had a little look through her instagram and was pretty attracted! Nothing unusual, just thought she was very attractive. My friend decided to text her and tell her that I had a thing for her ( which was rude as I just thought she was attractive &amp; even if I did ; it isn’t her place to tell. ) Anyways, she wrote back and said ‘No.. That’s crazy, she’s so hot.’ I guess it was a good response so I decided to message her. 

I have only had one conversation with her. One conversation. She’s really into astrology &amp; tarot, which I absolutley love &amp; that really pulled me in a bit more. She was asking questions about me ; my zodiac signs etc. She then ended the conversation with ‘anyways, i’m going to be seeing you soon, right?’ as my friend wanted us all to hang out. I told her yes if I could even get to the place as we live pretty far from eachother. The conversation sort of ended there, she didn’t open the message or reply. 

I seriously feel a strong connection to this girl &amp; I hardly know her. As I said, it’s extremely hard for me to catch feelings and this is driving me mad. I don’t even know much about her but I feel so connected to her &amp; I can definitley see a strong potential. We both have the same interests, the same music taste, the same vibe etc. It’s crazy. I litteraly cannot get her off my mind &amp; we have only had one conversation a few days ago. 

Now, my advice is... How do i maybe bring a new conversation up? I have extremley bad anxiety, I hate starting conversations &amp; being the first to text but I am really into this girl that I’m not going to wait and hope that she texts me randomly. I don’t know how to start this conversation or even carry it, I don’t know what to do. Normally, it’s pretty easy for me, but this girl has really got me in the feels &amp; I overthink everything I do. This is totally not normal for me as I have never really experienced this feeling.

TL;DR! It’s my first time having some sort of feelings for someone, I don’t know how to talk to her or do anything. She’s a very kind person but I’m just so worried I’m going to mess up. How should I even approach her?",15Dec2019,1

so yesterday i felt good with myself and took a few pictures in wichs i'm covering my chest with my arm and you can only see my back and waist. it's more like an artistic photo, i like taking that kind of pictures, and i also edited it and painted some flowers above it so you can barely see anything that could be """"inappropiate"""".

i really liked one of the pictures and felt really good about it, so i decided to share it on my insta stories. the thing is that since that i'm half happy 'cause i think it look really cool, but the other half is like ""everyone can see me half naked"". i don' t know. i'm in high school so it's really common to people (who would see it 'cause i just have like 30 followers on that account) make kinda fun of everything without thinking that would probably hurt someone, but at the same time i don' t understand why would anyone laught at that, and less if are mostly my friends and people i know for years, and some of them share similar photos sometimes. 

why do i feel like that? is conpletely unnecesary and annoying. i mean, i feel good about my body, that's one of the main reasons why i decided to take the picture and upload it. but i feel like i'm going to be judged or people are going to make fun.
 and why as a person with breast i have to hide it? i would like to show my body how it is, be proud of it and share that feeling without regretting it 5 minutes after.

417,"I have a pretty scuffed relationship with my parents, my father drank the right to see me away when I was 13 and my mother... it's not like she's evil or something, she's just never had the energy to raise a child. I've never been able to talk to her about anything, everytime I'd try to talk she'd just keep saying ""I can't do anything"" until I'd go away.

Thing is that I don't like going by a name that they chose for and I've wanted to change it for about a year or two. Pretty much all of my friends are aware I don't have a particularly good relationship with my parents, I'm not as worried what they're going to think. But legally changing my name just seems like a big deal.

In half a year I'm finishing college and moving on to something else, so that seems like the best time time to do it. But I'm kinda worried someone from my biological family is gonna hear about it. My mother doesn't know I don't like her, she's not very ""bright"" so she just haven't realised it yet, and she's fragile AF so I'd rather just let her have the ""fantasy"" that she's been a good mom. But if someone from my family finds out, they're gonna tell my mother, and then I know she's is gonna at least text me or something and what am I then gonna say?

And what if I run into an old friend or something, I mean I guess I could just pretend I haven't changed my name around them, but I know that'd feel like ass to do that, just because I'm scared to tell them I've changed it.

Or what if someone I'm gonna meet in the future finds out that I changed my name and get's angry or something because of it? I know a lot of people hold the opinion that you're supposed to love your parents no matter what (at least in my experience a lot of people seem to think that way) so how am I gonna explain it to them?

418,"So I love him very deeply, and I know for sure he somehow has similar feelings for me too.
But he never, unlike me, said something like “I love you” so I’m also questioning how much he really likes me. We never had something, not even a kiss, just hello and goodbye hugs. Recently we exchanged some nudes (what also makes everything more complicated than it already is)
I don’t want him to end his relationship, but I’m also struggling much with my feelings for him.
The worst part (for me) is that we make each other feel so understood and loved, we care about each other like no one does, this bond was there before I developed my feelings for him.
So neither of us want this all to end (I’m also sure he don’t want this to end) but I can’t really go along with this situation much longer.

I had people telling me I should just take the step, ask him what he wants, telling him what I want so that he needs to decide. But I’m not feeling comfortable pushing him to this decision, since he really cares for me so much and it’s not his fault that we’re stuck in this situation.

He even refused to get nudes from me because he would rather have this comforting and lovely relationship with me then anything else. 
I also realize I’m very lucky here...and I shouldn’t be complaining.

421,"I not very articulate so I apologize if I seem to ""jump"" around. 

I first felt suicidal in middle school. Later it turned into a deep and persistent depression that I still feel today. As a result I never cared to develop hobbies or social skill because why would I? I never expected to be here. I expected to be dead. I graduated highschool in 2015.  I applied to college and got into a known but rather mediocre college, Georgia Southern University. During my time there I attempted to improve. I met some people, I went to social events, and I did average in terms of grades. I was majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the time. But my mental state degraded more and more. eventually my desire to improve dissipated, I began to lose social connections and my grades slumped. Come the second semester of my Sophomore year(2017) and I needed to take a medical withdrawal. I came back home for a semester in order to try and get better. During my time at home I enrolled at West Georgia University and took 3 extremely easy classes because I was so so afraid of falling behind academically. It was a stupid thing to do but I wasn't being very rational at this time. I went back to GSU fall semester of 2018 and the depression hit the hardest it has ever hit just a few weeks in. Near the end of the semester I began to self harm,drink heavily, and get high almost every night (22 at this point btw) and when I told my psychologist she rightfully had me committed to a psych hospital. I spent 9 days there where I was diagnosed as Bipolar. Initially I felt hopeful. I finally had a solid diagnosis that I could get professional help for. After I got out I came back home yet again. I am now 23 and turning 24 in July. a few months ago I was admitted to another psych hospital(this time voluntarily) and spent 8 days there. After I got out I spent 2 months in a intensive outpatient program that the hospital ran. I came to the facility at 8:30 am and left at 3:00pm everyday for 2 months and I have never felt more alone in my life than before. There were about 30 other people around my age that were going through the same things that I was and they were/are sill more productive and successful than I am. To give you an idea as to how socially incompetent I am the doctors tested me for autism. I'm not autistic according to the doctors I'm just  socially awkward. presently I am enrolled at KSU. I have failed 2 of my 3 classes for this semester. I will have to switch majors. I'm thinking of going into software development but I don't know. I am living in the basement of my parents house and I am unemployed because I just cant handle a job right now. At 23 I am already this much of a fucking failure.  I have been seriously considering suicide  but if I do decide to do it I will do it after Christmas.  I just don't see any hope for me. I am too far gone.  I don't even feel like a person at all. I don't know what to do and its tearing me apart. I'm so so tired. I'm tired of being a failure. I'm tired of being a disappointment. I'm tired of being this apathetic husk of a human being.

On Thursday my niece called me to pick her up from school and told me that she didn’t feel well and wanted to go home it was almost the end of the school day so I told her to tough it out because I would be there in 30 mins to pick her up anyway, she snapped at me and hung up. I called the school back and they connected me with the nurse who told me that my niece had started her period but had asked not to tell me because she’s embarrassed. The nurse told me she gave my niece enough supplies to get through her first period. So I picked up my niece and nephew and my niece didn’t talk to me all day. I’ve been keeping up with the lie that I don’t know that she started her period because it seems like she’s not ready for me to know or doesn’t want to talk with me, a grown man, who’s never gone through this to know. I feel like a jack ass because I never thought about this happening until it happened.  The nurse at her school reprimanded me for not having an extra pair of underwear and pants in her backpack incase this happened, but I didn’t know girls start this young so it never even crossed my mind to prepare for this. So I’m worried because I’m going to need to buy her pads and tampons and help her keep track of knowing when it’s going to happen so she won’t have an accident at school, but I don’t know how to do this without her finding out that I know. So what should I do? Should I tell her that I know? I had the idea of buying a few different kinds of products and hiding them in the bathroom and asking my girlfriend to show my niece where they are and telling her that they are there just incase. What else should I do at this point? Thanks.",15Dec2019,1
425,"Okay so I started working at a hotel around August 2019 I've been here for almost 6 months and I work night audit after about 3 months of working on it from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. I asked my boss if a day shift happens to open if I could be switched to that shift she says that's fine there are no day-shift currently available so I continue to work night audit and I come into work tonight and they just hired a new girl working 3 to 11 the day shift I wanted and my boss knew I wanted. Now with that being said I told them months ago that I was going to be looking for another job to work day shift they told me that they did not want me to quit they really hoped that I would stay. my question is , is it fair that I've been working here for almost 6 months and I'm still in night audit and they give the shift that I want to a brand new employee ? what should I do?",15Dec2019,1
426,"Hi, apologies in advanced. I really might find it hard to not come across as whiney or rude, and this whole post will be messy in terms of structure.

To put it simply, over the last couple of months I feel like I've become less and less important to people and more irrelevant in general. Not being invited to most parties or gatherings is the best example of this. I dont want to get into the nitty gritty but there's a house party coming up, around 50 people coming which includes all my friends, but i didnt get invited. I spoke to the host and she said ""So so sorry but i just have too many numbers and parents would be mad :("".

Normally I can move on and accept this as I used to have this ""Oh well, nothing i can really do about it i guess"" sort of thinking. But after missing out on the past 3 or more social events im starting to really sink into a self-destrcutive depressive state and im really worried for my mental health. I know for a fact that if i could just come to this party i would instantly feel better. One of my friends who was going tried his best to plead for me to come (considering every single one of my mates are already invited) but she kind of played it passive and said ""Ill see what i can do""

I feel like that is basically just a delayed rejection. What can i do to get her to say yes? I mean i just cant see how ONE more is at all a big deal in the grand scheme. Plus how is it fair for me to just constantly put up with not being invited and suffer emotionally? At worse her parents get cross cause she added one more, its not fucking fair. Im just concerned for my future in terms of mental health if this sort of stuff keeps going on.",15Dec2019,1

I'm married to someone who I love very much. Unfortunately, we both suffers with depression and anxiety, which means that most of the time, I feel like I can't express my feelings because what he's going through seems worse, more dramatic somehow. If I mention that I'm feeling low, it appears that his mood lowers, meaning that I have to try even harder to not be down and hide my feelings so that I can help him.

I don't have anyone else in my life. My parents both passed recently and I don't have any friends. Even if I did, I find it so hard to open up about what I'm feeling that I just tell people I'm fine anyway. The only reason I can post here is because it's anonymous. I tried seeing a therapist (15 or so sessions), but they stopped seeing me because they didn't think I was ready to commit to therapy. For now, I can't afford to find another and even if I could, I'm afraid of being rejected again. 

I'm a very introverted person and since I've become depressed, I've become even more insular. Every friend I've had in the past sort of used me as a dumping ground for their emotions because I'm a good listener but never seemed to ask me about my life.

So, I dance, and today we had repetitions. And my friend is in that group too. So during the break we were playing around, she started playfully hitting me, and then she slapped me. I know she didn't do it to hurt me, but I kind of hurt. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was the little feeling I had in my cheek after she slapped me. It reminded me of my abusive father and the way he slapped me (among other things). I started tearing up, but I didn't want to cry there. Usually when I'm like this I don't talk because I can't control the crying afterwards. I told her not to touch me but she did, so I stayed quiet. My friend kept on talking to me. I didn't say a thing. She then got upset and started telling me that she has reasons to be upset with me too and she can be too if she wanted. I told her to do what she wants and that I wasn't feeling well. She told me I was selfish and only my emotions mattered to me. I told her I wasn't feeling well again, then I went to the bathroom and cried. When I came back I went to her and told her I wasn't mad at her. She interrupted me saying I was selfish again. I told her that she was selfish to assume all my problems were about her. She told me she was tired of toxic people in her life and that I only cared about myself. I left her alone and I went to hang out with my other friends. I figured she would come around, especially because we had to meet with another girl. (this has been planned for a week). She didn't.

440,"I [17F] just started working at a certain, popular coffeehouse chain as a barista, and I have a super duper major crush on my supervisor [28M] (not really my boss boss but he’s still my superior).

He’s a decade older than me, but he lookin fine as ever bby lemme just tell you hun he got the prettiest goddam eyes I have every seen yes god,the killer smile (rare, but he seems to smile a lot when my dumbass is around) mmhmmmmm, and the freshest goddam hair ooh yes lawrd. It’s smooth and dark and styled like he’s from the 20s and boutta personally crash the stock market with his devilish good looks. 
Did I mention he’s a fucking Italian. 
HIS NAME. Oh god his name it’s so cute. It’s so old fashioned but I’d totally use it to name a baby or two. I can’t pronounce his last name though. Floopin Italians.

So enough of the fangirl shit, I started liking him a few days into training. He wasn’t my main trainer, but he was definitely my second go to guy (and obviously my favorite). I actually always tried finding an excuse to go to him for help if my main trainer looked the slightest bit occupied with something else. And lemme just say he’s the nicest person I have ever met. Like honestly top 3 behind Jesus and Moses (my landscapers). He’s so sweet and polite he’s just a gentleman. He doesn’t speak too much and he seems to be the listener type. He’s so popular with the girls (not coworkers I don’t think...hopefully or ima boutta slice some aprons...jk ;3). So many young girl customers love him and seem to go to our specific store just to see him. I get jealous :( but mostly sad about myself.

So here’s the problem. It’s like having a crush on your teacher. This won’t end well, will it? He’s my boss, I’m his trainee, he’s a DECADE older than me, I’m a minor, he’s popular with the girls, I’m a solid 6/10. It’s too early for this shit. I’ve only known him for a couple of weeks, but I literally can’t help but have a chonker of a crush on him. I rarely really like people and when I do I usually keep silent about it and cry for weeks after they get a girlfriend or if I decide they’re going to reject me (stupid I know but I fear rejection). This crush is going to be a double edged sword for work. I’ll love going to work when he’s working just because I get to see and talk to him, but when this crush gets too big I’ll get flustered more easily or get more jealous when he interacts with cute wamen. And when this crush crashes and explodes into auto or actual rejection, work will be hell and I’d probably quit.

There's this girl who im now going to refer to as A. I met A last year and we are both part of a big group of close friends. This year I started catching feelings for her and we ended up making out during our september vacations. At first we said that we were'nt going to go any further than that.

So I started dating another girl but then I realized that I still had feelings for A, so I broke up with this other girl. After that I started talking and flirting with A a lot more, and we ended up kissing again and hanging out. We then started dating for a few weeks. That went well until she messages me and says that she wants to stop dating because she came out of a 4 year relationship and still feels like she needs some time on her own.

So we stopped dating, but a couple of days ago we were at a friends house watching a movie, and the subject came when i mentioned it, I said that i missed her and she said thay she'd be up to date again once she figures her stuff out, but that she did'nt want to promise anything.

So now I don't know how to proceed, because I really like her and wanna be with her, but I don't wanna be too pushy or annoying with her. I also don't know how high should I keep my hopes of coming back together, and also that we we're really close friends before and I don't want that to be compromised.

But I see it every day. Slowly. People littering, smoking, car exhaust, petrol pumped into millions of cars every second, uncontrolled bushfires across the globe, a rapidly shifting North Pole, plastic wrapped everything on grocery shelves and endless supplies of food-like-products, emissions climbing higher, the diminishing ozone layer, smog, the fact humanity is now reliant on endless tech devices just to carry out basic jobs and lives without being called a hippy or a weirdo, materials on materials of products being produced just to be bought and thrown into a hole in the earth that continues to poison the earth and atmosphere. 

And much more.

I feel so small, hopeless, insignificant. Humanity will most likely be obsolete on earth in the next couple hundred years. Either a select elite jetting off into nothingness in a hopes for a second chance, or complete extinction.

Our history wiped. Completely. The aztecs, Egyptians, myans, the Roman Empire, the Qing Dynasty, the Australian Aboriginies, the Native Americans, our monkey ancestors for god sakes. Dinosaurs. Literal Dinosaurs existed. Was that all for nothing? We know what happened billions of years ago and we could lose all this knowledge we have to our own stupidity.

What is the point? We understand so much. We have so much potential. We heal and create and cure and fix and discover and understand. But we continue to prioritise an arbitrary currency *we created* above our very own existence. Let alone without much thought to the millions of other species that depend on the earth we are destroying.

452,"To preface I'm a freshman in my first semester and currently majoring in marketing.

College was something I looked forward to, an opportunity to meet new likeminded people and develop meaningful friendships within a major I feel passionate about. Well... 

Almost a semester in and I'm disappointed, lonely and really hating this experience. 

I'm one of the very youngest in class by 3-4 years. My classmates remotely pay attention during class and they're the type to go to clubs and get drunk during weekends, in other words they're not exactly my type and I can't fit in among people I don't feel comfortable with. 

I considered changing my major as well. Apprenticeship comes with it and in theory this is a great idea, after all this is the main reason why I chose this specific college. But the vacancies offered aren't that interesting or in line with what career I'm aiming for. Plus, Summer, Easter AND Christmas holidays are pretty much non-existent as we'll be working for an employer throughout the whole year while studying.

I fantasized with dropping out of college entirely and working part-time while discovering and working on my real interests and hopefully establishing a business online, but it doesn't feel like a viable option and I'm equally discouraged about that idea as I am having to tolerate feeling like a number in an environment I don't belong or feel content being in.",15Dec2019,1

454,"Hello Reddit,   


I don't have many friends to open up too so I'm hoping the community of Reddit can help me. I currently have two jobs and I'm trying to decide if i should keep both jobs or if should drop one as I'm exhausted from my first job but I'm not in the greatest financial situation. 

I'm a  graduate, and I'm in my second year of working with my company. I'm under a fixed salary of 46,000 AUD and I average 50 + hours of work at office every week Monday - Friday. Lately I've been taking work home lately as well because i haven't been able to keep up with new responsibilities that were handed to me in my second year of working. My work isn't physically demanding but can be mentally draining and stressful if I'm not up to date or if I'm not working project to get reconsigned by upper management. It may sound like I'm complaining but overall I enjoy my work, and i think my work input will be advantageous later on in my career.   


On Saturday I work in a warehouse, usually early in the mornings so I can still have time to enjoy the rest of the day but i generally stay at home resting or completing errands. The benefit of working on the weekends is that i get penalty rates so i make a decent amount after tax. I generally would make $75 for 4 hours of work. This doesn't seem like a lot but it basically pays for my food and fuel for the week.   


On Sundays, I allow this time to sleep in and complete my weekly errands e.g. Cleaning, laundry and groceries and of course a nice little sleep in. this would generally consume the majority of my day.    


Overall I am able to manage both jobs into my lifestyle, but my two jobs and my errands are the only things in my life right now. I hardly see my friends, I've stopped all my hobbies and I'm not sure if I'm wasting my 20's working constantly. But I am currently $14,000 in debt from a loan I was required to take to help pay for medical bills for my relative / family overseas. If I work my second job I am able to make additional payments and reduce the length of loan (One benefit of this is that my credit scored has improved greatly). This is probably my main reason of my second job. 

  
Lately I've been extremely exhausted, and I wish I was participating in activities and hobbies that aren't work related. It would be nice to dedicate my time that I would enjoy / look forward too. I haven't found much happiness in anything lately and I wish there was someone i could talk too. I know this may come off as first world problems and a lot of other people have it harder than me, but I don't know who to talk to and I don't really have any mentor / role model figures in my life.   


If you were in my situation what would you do, Would you stick it out as see it as necessary grind? Or am I wasting my youth and not being able to experience different things, not finding my interests and myself. I feel like either decision have equal benefits but hopefully I can have some guidance or a second opinion. Thanks you all for your time reading this lengthy post, and thank you in advance for your contributions to this post. :)

We met in high school and we instantly clicked. Long story short I have some of the best and worst (which are somewhat good as well) experiences and stories with her. We’ve been through thick and thin but we survived it all, however these scenarios impacted our relationship at some point. We used to hang out all the time, going out etc. However during the last year of High School our relationship went kinda downhill.. we didn’t text that much because she was always busy. We lived 30km away from each other so there was no way of hanging out outside the city in which we attended school but after the class she always said she is tired or whatever. We met during the summer once or twice. Recently I moved to London for Univeristy. It’s been 4 months since and she FaceTimed me once... even when I told her that I would love to see her and discuss some thing since I had some thought times here. Yet she is still with her boyfriend and I know she is just lying in her bed all day and ignoring me. Im very disappointed in her yet I know if I would try to tell her, her response would be “you are making it up in your mind” or smth like this. On the other hand we know each other for nearly 5 years and I’m not sure if throwing the relationship out of the window is a good direction. It makes me hurt because I genuinely love her but I came to conclusion that it would be good to cut her off my life. Make her feel the misery I do. I feel like she occasionally texts me just because she is afraid of being left alone in case she breaks up with her boyfriend.

So we're on a college vacation as of right now.
And its not been going smoothly and theirs quite a few frustrations going around. The trip organisation isn't that good.

So, today we're in a small bus. 16 people. Our group consists of 8 people. The other 8 people included the driver and one of our professors.

So my best friend is a real talkative person. And she likes to blabber on and on... And she likes to be really social... 

Since its a long journey, she had entrusted her snack bag to us. And due to unfortunate circumstances, she was shifted to a different car/vehicle. 

So we kinda snacked on some of her stuff. She doesn't have a problem with it tbh. She loves to pamper us..

But as i said, shes social. And today when she found out we had emptied quite a handful of her stuff she started to tease us in front of everyone.

Saying that *oh my god how can you do something like this! You could've asked me! This food was for everyone! How can you eat everything all by yourselves you bunch of thieves!* And stuff. In front of everyone. All the while, she was taking it rather with a chill. Like laughing and having fun while saying this. Ofcourse she didn't mean any of that. 

But my other friends took it seriously. And now they're really pissed at her. Two of them especially were in a pissy mood when this happened, and that kinda elevated the situation. 

So they're like *I'm not gonna eat anything that she gives.* Or *I'm never eating anything she cooks*., Etc etc.

I dont know if they're really serious about this.. cause as i said, shes a sweetheart. But having quite a show like this just for the sake of social interaction made them a little pissy..

I really dont want her to get isolated. Or a target. Cause we've had to deal with enough shit in our college life...

I really dont know if i can reason with them. And i dont know if i should tell this to my bestie. What should i do?

461," **I'm heartbroken,I need help. Yesterday I found out that my gf can't handle the distance between us anymore. She needed someone to love her and needed someone to give her affection . I gave her anything for 5 years we managed to stay together to go through a lot of things together to love each other. I started college 3 years ago and somehow we managed to support each other ,she was very very sad , she cryed every single day for months and then somehow the situation got a bit better but this time is different. This year she also went to college to another city than me,we talked every single day,we stayed together every single week-end and loved each other but she needed more affection,more love and someone to be with her every single day .She handled the situation for a month and then someone saw her crying,saw her really sad and started to be stay around her. She liked it really much that someone is there to help because i was not there. After two weeks she told me about everything,she wants affection and she can't be with me but she wants to help me trough this. She still loves me and I still love her but she needs more love. The one sad thing which is hurting me a lot is that she didn't want to tell this person what she still feel for me because she is afraid that she then will become depressed again and without someone to give her affection. I really want to tell this man what she fells for me and what I still feel for here but Idk who he is. HELP ME!**",15Dec2019,1
467,"Hey, i had a few annoying experiences with nerd people around me. 

I am struggling with depression and anxiety and i am not as friendly as i used to be. I was short tempered person but now i don't even have temper. I have two best friends and we generally spend time as a trio. (they don't know about my problems because i avoid talking about it but they know something is going on, they just don't push me) And there are two nerds who are trying to join our group (I will call them A and B). They help about homeworks etc. they really helped me so many times and i helped them about English. We used to spend good time all together but they started to make me annoyed as fuck. While we are talking about special things they interrupt us, they drag my best friend and talk special(!) only with her, planning studying days without inviting me etc. Most of the time they started spending time together, without me. We three sitting and they are coming and i am leaving. I always hate socializing more than 2 people, i hate group chatting so i leave because it makes me uncomfortable. One of my best friend said she is also bothered by them but when they are coming to talk with us, she is looking like having fun. Also both of my best friends are generally happy because that fucking nerds are helping about lessons to them.

A bitch is talking to me only for English lessons. Normally, even when i had panick attack and crying hysterically she didn't give a fuck to me. Without even saying hi she is asking for my help to her English homework. I acted like i read her idiotic paragraph and gave it to her without saying anything. She seems annoyed. Also about another time, i was trying to solve a question but my mind was at a totally different place. I just couldn't solve a multiplication and asked to my friend because i was so bored and she said '' u can't even do this? ''

And B is very very good person but i hate her nerd personality. She really helped me more than my ''best'' friends about my depression and she was there when i had all my panick attacks in school. I have a sketchbook and i use it as a diary of my mental problems. She even spent so many times looking at my drawings and trying to understand what is going on about me because i didn't tell anyone. After seeing her effort for me, i decided to talk with her a little bit. While we were talking about the thing i never talked with someone, she saw our biology teacher and she told me '' wait. '' then went to class, took her question book and went with biology teacher to ask her questions. I was there, cursing myself. I should've know. I regretted because i should've understand she didn't cared also. It was a time which was so important to me but at that time, she was actually giving no fuck. I thought somebody cared and it is my stupidity. 

I think about talking to my best friends seriously, i will say i don't want them anymore with us and if they continue to being involved with them i won't be there. But also i know i have no right to push them something like this, i know that two fucking nerds are helpful for them. Also they are sticking to us so even though if i talk with them, they will continue to come with us. My best friends are my only way to forget what is going on in my head and laugh at school, if i lose them i will seriously end up going crazy. Advice please.",15Dec2019,1
468,"As the title reads, I was fired on Friday from a job that I honestly should've worked my hardest at.

I'm a college dropout, not old enough to rent a car, yet I had a solid job with great health insurance, stock in the company, and really flexible location and hours (work from home, get x amount of work done, show up for online meetings). I got this job through a recommendation. 

I live very well off in a nice apartment in a nice area, and the only debt I have is a student loan and the rest of my lease.

I have enough money to pay bills and rent for the next two months, so ideally I'd get a job by the end of January the absolute latest. But, that's where I'm having trouble.

I have a lot of random skills. I can program, use video/photo software, use a camera and do basic production, understand hardware/networking, make basic music, I have some level of creativity, as well as a bunch of other random skills and knowledge.

However, I am not proficient at any one thing. I am a junior or less in each field. But, besides actual skill, the main reason I feel worthless is my work ethic.

Unless I'm explicitly told to do something constantly, it's difficult for me to actually follow through. It's how I've been my whole life. I do what I'm asked, and if I really don't want to do it, I'm given the easy way out, all the time.

At this job that I was just fired from, I effectively no-showed for over a month's worth of work days. They gave me too many opportunities to fix my shit, and they paid me for it while I slacked off.

I understood the gravity of my situation, and I knew I needed to work, but I couldn't bring myself to actually do the work. I always got distracted and was always procrastinating.

Even right now, I understand how shitty my life will be in a month or two if I don't get a job, but I just don't care. I want to care so desparately, but what's the point?

I've always been given the easy way out, and whenever I would make someone upset, I'd just say, ""Sorry,"" but not know how to make it up to them. I've worked 4 jobs, and only 1 of them I left on decent terms. 

I've pushed away a lot of friends because I can't act like a normal human being. I'm convinced I have some sort of mental disorder but my parents and doctors say I'm fine. People have only been nice to me, and I try to be a nice person back, but I've never actually had a close friend because I always put people at a distance. 

Its easy for me to put on a facade and not face how I feel. There's been very few times when I actually honestly was showing emotion. Every other time was some general facade that I can't control. It's almost like dissasociation, but I can remember random things that aren't relevant.

A month or so ago my brother called the non emergency line to check on me because I hadn't talked to anybody in a week. They came to my apartment and I broke down, so they asked me if I wanted them to take me to a hospital, so I said yes.

I was diagnosed with depression, and even in the diagnosis, I partially lied in that I wasn't having any suicidal thoughts because I knew they would detain me for a while and it would make my situation harder to handle.

They sent me home with a bunch of therapy recommendations, but I haven't tried to look into any of them. My Dad told me he'd talk to me on the phone everyday and try to get me to see a therapist, but that only lasted a week and now we don't talk.

Basically, I guess what I'm trying to ask here,  what can I do besides rot away? I literally have no  motivation to do anything. I know I need to go to a therapist and get a job, I know, but I literally don't have the motivation to do anything besides indulge in escapism. I feel like Shinji from Evangelion, but worse. 

I've also done a lot of shitty things to other people that I really shouldn't have, but I did them anyways because I felt invincible and that I could get what I wanted. I indulged in shitty behavior because I had nothing else going for me.

As much as I know I've done good things for people and created things or helped, it was mostly because I felt inclined to to keep relationships open or because I was told to. And as much as I know I've done bad things to people, it was not my intention and just my mind being erratic and doing its own thing. 

I'm a useless human being, I guess.",15Dec2019,1

473,"This is a friend's situation, and I have already asked her permission to ask about this on reddit to see other people's opinion about it.

Background:
A is a female, and B is a male. They are both my closest friends (we treat each other like siblings). A is a virgin, but has a history of molestation. Both B and I know about this.

Earlier this year, they had something going on between them (it's only that they both admitted they had feelings for each other, but decided to stay friends because of some personal conflicts and reasons). However, last February, all three of us got drunk at my place, and A told me a few days later that B and her made out that night, (which I had no knowledge about until she told me), and that when they decided to go home, they stopped over at B's house and continued making out there (which *almost* led to sex, but since A is a virgin, she was hesitant and it ended up with A going home to her place). After that incident, they talked things over and decided to just stay friends.

Around April, A met someone, but it was a complicated relationship, so she ended up having her heart broken.

Fast forward to B having a girlfriend last June. B introduced C to A and I on August, and the four of us have been hanging out a lot since then.

This month, A was still hung up on the person she dated and was having some troubles, and she decided to have drinks with B. (I couldn't join them that time for some reasons. As for B's girlfriend, I also don't know where she was that time).

*A told me how things went*. Whilst being drunk, they both got to talking about how things could've been between them if they chose to date instead of stay friends. After a couple of vomiting, B kissed A and they ended up making out, which led to B stripping A naked on the waist down. B tried to put it in, but he had a hard time because A was hurting (A said it hurt because she wasn't wet, given that she wasn't in the mood and didn't like what was happening). (And before you comment about rape, I asked her if she tried to stop him when he was trying to get her pants off, she said she didn't.) They eventually stopped trying and when A was a little sober to go home, she took the chance and went home immediately. B texted A shortly after to not text him anything about what happened since his girlfriend could accidentally read it and that they would talk in person maybe on Monday.

The next day, when A was taking a shower, she found blood when she was cleaning her private parts. She said they were sort of like a spotting, plus her private parts kind of stung. It's only been less than two days since it happened, and she says it sometimes stings when she walks or sits down.

Until both of them are able to talk about it, I'm holding off from confronting B for what he did. Also, B's girlfriend does not know about this.

Now A is asking me if she should stop being friends with B or not? I told her I'm not in the position to say, that it's complicated. I asked her back with ""Do you feel like you want to cut him off from your life totally or not?"" And she said she doesn't know.

What are your opinions on the matter?",15Dec2019,1

477,"Due to a sudden change in needing contracted orders to be worked the week before Christmas, my boss sent an email the other day saying that if we were PTO this week and the 23rd, to please reconsider - and - that she encourages us to work weekends and stay up super late every day in order to meet deadline... our company has paid holiday Christmas break from 12/24-1/2 and now she’s saying that we need to be on standby during that break in case anything happens...

Ok I’m all for loving my job and all that - but I’ve never had leadership tell me to reconsider PTO and encouraging work DURING the holidays. I honestly feel like this company and leadership doesn’t value their employees and wants us to put our jobs first - in all situations.

She never really does this and only hangs out with them scarcely, so I don't know if this was some sort of let loose thing because of our baby or not.


She made it safe but the possibilities that could have happened have me messed up. My daughter and I could have lost her, or she could have caused someone else's family pain. Or even an OWI which would fuck up our insurance and many other things.


So how can I go about talking to her about this? Does anyone have experience with this? I want her to be able to go out with friends if she wants to but not like this, at least not driving.",15Dec2019,1

I just finished a course which took four months. Nothing fancy, 3 times a week for a whole day. I'm looking to work in the field I studied.  
The thing is, I was unemployed throughout it and fairly worried about job interviews. I don't know what to reply if i'm asked what I did during the course other than the the course itself, since I still had the evenings and 2 mornings free.  
I actually just stayed home and did house stuff, worked on some hobbies and personal projects - but that's not what you'd like to hear from an inexperienced candidate looking to work for you. make me seem like i'm not a ""get things done"" type of person - which is a highly valued trait in this field.

481,"Me (M23) and my girlfriend (f21) have been struggling to see eye to eye recently on me questioning my gender. 

She was supportive at the beginning helping me out with getting a few girls bits etc and answering questions that I might have to do with being a girl. 

However as I've been getting stronger feelings towards crossdressing over the last year that I feel it may be something deeper then crossdressing (but still unsure) she has been struggling to support me, loss of attraction towards me and finds me even talking about it very uncomfortable. 

Obviously the best thing to do would be for me to stop but she even said herself that she doesn't want me to stop because it'll make me unhappy. But I feel to really question myself I need to be a girl more often and find out who I really am. Maybe I wont like it as much as I think but I dont know unless a try?

But trying to be a girl more often will hurt our relationship even more and we both really WANT this relationship to work! I want to in an ideal world going shopping with her (dressed as a guy, not at public girl level) and be more of a girl best mate and get involved but she finds it very uncomfortable and doesn't find me attractive doing that understandably. In an ideal world I'd love it if shed help me do my makeup etc but I know that's asking too much lol.

How can we meet in the middle so we both are as happy as we can be? She saids she wants to be more supportive but she STRUGGLES alot! But I need be a man more often so atleast she stays attracted to me, although she saids the whole me being a girl thing is a huge turn off for her. Even if I'm not talking about it etc.

Me and my girlfriend will be reading the comments if anybody would be really supportive and reply. (I need to get therapist but I'm not in a financial situation where I can do so, that's why we came here for some advice).

My mother keeps destroying my brain, I was forced to go away living on my own one year ago, I run away with the help of my boyfriend and friends from a bad episode o violence and psychological abuse, I have also reported them to the police (in the same time I graduated and worked really hard), now because of paperworks I have to stay home with her and my family again. And I will be forced to stay here until some crap about inheritance will be fixed.
(i am not living in US by the way, here law are different about hereditary succession).
My brother hates me, he said that I am dead for him, I not allowed to go in common spaces at home with him otherwise he is calling bad words ""you are a whore"" ""you suck""...
My mother instead tell me that no one could ever love me like she did, that I will see in the future how my boyfriend or my friends will abandon me, she also told me that ""I am killing her"" and that she has cancer. They made me feel like a criminal because I dared to report them at police that time.
My father is an useless man that never defend me, he is just scared of my mother and brother I suppose or maybe he is not giving a shit about me, don't know.
I have serious problems with my boyfriend too, our relationship goes to the wreck because of this story, sometimes I think that we are not really meant to each others, I feel like he is not really understanding about me and maybe I am not understanding about him.
I am also scared that I could become like my mother. 
I am not satisfied about my friends too, I am constantly feeling alone also in the middle of people, I am feeling disconnected from anyone and anything.
I graduated with the best grades couple of months ago but I have now no motivation no reasons and no strength to find a job in my field, I don't even like the things that I studied so hard.

I lived a childhood and a teenage completely alone because of my parents believes, than I started university trying to be happy so hard, I made friends, I found a boyfriend, I rebelled to my parents psyco strict rules because I don't want to be disconnected from the world anymore, but now I feel just like a loser, I not only feel disconnected from others around me I am also feeling disconnected from myself, that is strange but it is like I am a robot, I am able to do my routine in order to stay alive but I feel nothing, just despair and loneliness sometimes. I also cry very often about the smallest things.
The only one knowing partially my inner emotional state is my boyfriend but this is scaring and upsetting him, he is also depressed but for other reasons.

485,"My best friend (28m) is an extremely tall, mostly great guy. Most of our friends would describe him as a ""gentle giant"". We've been friends for about a decade. My family is also quite fond of him and he's basically a part of it. 

I'm basically the only one of our friends that knows the true extent of his anger issues. There have been instances within the last decade where Ive seen it first hand, and this year I finally got him to do an intensive ten-day silent meditation retreat. I myself have done 3 of these and I'm pretty dedicated to the practice. 

After the retreat I could tell that he had changed. He was way calmer and things didn't seem to bother him like they used to. However, he hasn't continued to practice which is required to be able to sustain the effects!

Last Monday I made a startling discovery. I was on Hinge (a dating app) and found his GF of 5 years (24f). I felt as his friend that if he were in the same position that I'd hope he'd tell me what he'd found. So I told him on Wednesday and he became a little sad and upset and went home immediately to talk to her about it. 

The next day he told me she told him she got the app because of an incident 3 weeks ago where he physically abused her pretty badly. He said he back handed her and punched her in the arm and threw a folding chair at her. She said she didn't feel validated, so she was seeking that validation through the dating app. 

Now, this behavior has probably happened more than once. And it seemed like he thought I would still be on his side after telling me this, but I told him as gently as I could that it's not fucking cool to do that and the severity of getting the dating app pales in comparison to what he did. 

It's like he doesn't fully understand. Although he says he feels embarrassed and that he doesn't want to behave this way. He did a ten day silent retreat partially in effort to get this under control. 

I told him that I see a therapist and it really helps me and should he choose, I would give him her contact info. And he asked for it, and I did. 


But I can't abide this behavior forever. Him and I have been through a lot together and I know that this doesn't totally define him as a person. I actually don't have that many close friends. I really have the urge to tell his GF to GTFO of there! 

I'm trying to live a more peaceful life and cause the least amount of suffering to others and myself as I can manage. I can't continue to be his friend if he continues to do this, but I don't want to give up on him.

Can anyone speak to a similar situation? When will enough be enough?? Is there any other way to help him?

Thank you.",15Dec2019,1
486,"TL:DR- 25(M) Got out of an abusive relationship 3 years ago. Lost all social skills. Managed my depression. Still, cannot seem to get myself to be back in the dating life and I don’t know how it all works anymore.


Long version: 
I’ll be 26(m) in 2 months. I survived and escaped a scary abusive relationship almost 3 years ago. This caused me to drop out of a really great college, move countries and change the course of my life. I spent the first year locked in, in severe depression, gained some weight, lost whatever friends I had left. Since then I’ve gotten back to grad school and slowly trying to work on my studies and skills. I’ve been alone for most of these years because I have very little motivation to make friends (also don’t remember how anymore). Even so, there have been a few people I’ve gotten to know and some girls/women I came to be fond of. However, I have been unable to anything about it. I wanted to ask someone out but I sabotaged it so quick. My trust issues have been keeping me away from making any deep connections and being bad at small talk I’ve slowly become more reclusive. I’m absolutely okay with being alone, but sometimes when I’m actually happy and excited, I find that I have no one to share this happiness with. I really want to feel connected again. 

Anyone been through anything similar? And can suggest some ways I can get over this strange fear of being vulnerable (which I did not have before the abusive relationship) and be more confident? Or even some ways I can take risks and not dwell on my abusive relationship as the ultimatum of my life?",15Dec2019,1

Lately, I’ve begun to see that she’s becoming a little toxic for me, and I’ll admit that I can be quite toxic as well since I have my different opinions on the choices she decides to make sometimes. I’m a community college transfer, so I was applying to different schools and decided on the school that would’ve been the best for me academically. She gave me so much shit about it when it doesn’t affect her life in any way to begin with, and she made me feel really shitty about it when she didn’t even want to hear about why I chose the school. I ultimately decided to go to the same school she goes to because of different reasons not influenced by her, but now she’s been changing so dramatically that I’m not even sure if I want to stay friends with her anymore. We’ve been getting into fights because of lack of communication when one of us doesn’t always fully explain ourselves, and she’s always been a super vocal person who doesn’t have any filter whatsoever. Because we have such strong opinions and stubbornly stick with our individual opinions, I know she’s been avoiding telling me things because she doesn’t want to start another argument. 

She’s also been dabbling with some drugs that her roommate does, and I’d like to think that I’m ok with someone doing drugs, but I can see the possibility of her getting deeper with the hardcore drugs even though it might only be weed and acid for now because “I just wanted to try it and see what it’s like.” I’ve been holding off on telling her my opinion of her lifestyle since it’s her life to live, but I don’t know who to talk to about this issue. My other friends don’t like her because she’s so unfiltered and makes comments that may seem like a joke to her but hurts others’ feelings.

We weren’t really together but we did fool around with each other and to me I got so attached to him that I did consider him my “man.” He wasn’t the same tho, from when we were in a relationship. He didn’t show a lot of affection and he only talked to me sometimes. It was hard on me and I also had people constantly coming up to me telling me that he was trying to ask this other girl out. every time I would confront him abt it he would say that it wasn’t true and he didn’t like anyone at the moment. I was suspicious but I believed it. Last week, I lost my virginity to him and he told me “Im never leaving you.” Well guess what. that girl he told me he didn’t like turns out he likes her. And he’s not “feeling it with me” im so confused because two days ago we had such an open conversation with each other and he told me that he would be jealous if he saw me with someone else and that he had to think abt his feelings abt me and the other girl. I was like oh okay. And then today he said he likes her. i can’t help but feel played and being his second choice. I don’t know how I should react, or how to feel abt it. I just feel blank because I did love him",15Dec2019,1

496,I went to my wife’s Christmas party and there was an open bar. Needless to say things got crazy. I was about 12 drinks in at the after party and everyone was dancing. I don’t normally ever dance but I was havin such a good time that I decided to give it a try so I asked my wife to dance with me. Well I saw this other guy dancin with another girl and it seemed so did my wife cause while she was also drunk she said we should get her to dance with us. I thought that was weird but I tried. I kinda touched her hips scissor I was seein how other guys were doin it and she danced with me. But that was only for a min. I didn’t really care about her although she was admittedly attractive. But at the end of the night I wanted to dance with my wife.  Now she’s extremely mad at me for good reason. How bad did I fuck up here?,15Dec2019,1

501,"So there’s this guy I’ve been talking to for about 3 months. We never established any intentions about what would happen but I’m really into him and he keeps giving me mixed signals. He’ll be flirty, talks to me everyday, kissed me in front of all his coworkers, blah blah blah. We have the sort of relationship where we’re mean to each other as a joke so I try not to take anything he says seriously as a result but yesterday I made a comment like “well it’s because I like you”, he opened the message, didn’t respond so as a joke I sent another and said “nvm I take it back” instantly he replies “ok good”. I just don’t know if it’s worth being honest about how I feel or if I should stop talking to him altogether. I can see myself really liking him and it felt like he liked me a lot too so I’m super confused. I know he’s “afraid of falling in love” but I don’t wanna be conceited or delusional and think that he’s holding back cause he doesn’t wanna fall in love with me - it’s just the only thing I can think of because HE initiates mostly everything so if he didn’t like me he doesn’t have to do those things yanno",15Dec2019,1
502,"I changed school in September and after like two weeks i noticed this tall guy. He had blond hair,a  slender figure and was dressed in a cute aesthetic. In a few words he was pretty (he's like 3 years older than me).  I got his name and started following him on Instagram, and i discovered we had TONS of things in common, like music  taste , tv series ecc.  At first he didn't follow me back (probably because he only follows people he know since he had little following) but after i commented on a pic of his he followed me. Once he posted a pic of a book, so i asked him what was the name since i tought it was interesting. Instead of replying to my comment, he directly dm me with a pic of the book. I thanked him and it ended there. Later i discovered that we were in the same english class, so i tried to get a sit close to him. We did end up kinda close and the teacher told the class to discuss a topic with a group, so we had the opportunity to talk a bit. But like the book episode, it ended there. One day i didn't go to the course, and since he was the only one of which i knew the name, i asked him, but like all of the last times it ended there. He never was the first to speak to me, but it's probably because he's very introverted, kinda like me. There are also rumours around saying that he's gay, since no one had seen him with a girlfriend, has only female friends, walks in a kinda feminine way etc (i'm not homophobic just saying). 

So,going to the top question, How should i confess to him?

We don't know each other well. Should i send him a funny valentine card via dms? Should i give him a chocolate in person? Should i find a way to give him a letter? Should i send a poem or something? It's my first time of confessing my feelings to someone i don't know, so sorry for all the stupid suggestions and bad english.

510,"hi everyone,

this will most probably be a long story but as i feel like i\`ve just be hit by a truck (emotionally).

&amp;#x200B;

the story brings me back to 1998.

at the time me and my younger brother were living in The Netherlands with our mother.

we were originally from the UK.

my mother fell in love with her nephew while on vacation in Canada (messed up but had nothing to say as a child at the time).

he moved in with us in Holland back in 96 i think.

very weird dude and pretty aggressive towards us and our mother.

we saw our father every other weekend.

my mother hated everything about my father (will not go in too that)

this just made the relationship very tense and weird.

&amp;#x200B;

i think it was the year 97 when when my brother and I went on a vacation with my dad and his girlfriend.

it was a lovely vacation and my brother and i were spoiled (benefits of my dad only having to look after us for 1 weekend)

but as a child it all seemed nice (but behind everything nice hides a truth children don\`t see until later)

when we got back from the airport with my dad and his girlfriend we saw in his letterbox a letter which was sent by my mother.

this moment defined everything.

&amp;#x200B;

in the letter it was stating my mother and her partner (nephew) we moving back to the UK with my brother and I.

this came as an absolute shock.

I was 11 years old my younger brother 8 or 9.

after tears were shed my brother and I knew we didn't want to move to the UK.

we were already following school and grew up learning the language and everything.

&amp;#x200B;

skipping ahead a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

after a hefty legal battle we moved in with our father and his girlfriend in 98.

my mother moved to the UK in 99 if I\`m correct.

our relationship was very rocky back then because our father didn't want us anywhere near her.

but she was our mother and i still felt very affectionate towards her.

contact was very rough and we didn't see each other almost at all till this day in 2019.

last time i saw her was 2005 or 2006 (that was only a few hours) my girlfriend and i visited her in secret behind my dads wisdom.

as we lived with my dad we had to obey to his rules or be threatened to be kicked out of HIS house.

My dad was very manipulative and used drugs and a heavy drinker.

contact with my mother was almost forbidden because he always said i didn't pay so many thousands of euros in legal battle just to have us go see her.

&amp;#x200B;

but FFS this is our mother and that wouldn't change.

&amp;#x200B;

in all those years till now i\`ve tried multiple times to reestablish contact with my mother.

it always ran dry. 

emails stating i wanted contact and that she was very important to my and my brother.

every time nothing really came from it.

just the occasional hi how are you?

for me it was heartbreaking and needed to put it aside because it was going nowhere.

now back to my brothers situation.

3 years ago he had his first lovely child.

he didn't have any contact with our mom at all (maybe 1 since being apart)

and on Christmas 4 years ago i was at my aunts place (my mum\`s sister)

my aunt would call my mother up and surprise her with my on the phone.

i was nervous and very emotional and told her she was becoming a Grandmother.

all i got was '' Oh that\`s nice''

it felt very unemotional like she didn't care.

on the phone i could tell she must have moved on and didn't really want to speak to me.

it broke me because i was so emotional telling her she was becoming a grandmother.

I left it at that till this year when it was mothers day.

i sent her a 2 page email stating my feelings still for her and that it means so much for me and my brother to be in contact again with each other.

i said we could come visit (she live now in New Zealand)

i never got  a reply.

&amp;#x200B;

now my aunt and uncle are visiting my brother in Munich.

because he just had his second child.

this is where my advice question really comes.

&amp;#x200B;

i got a whats app message from my aunt if i could get off work on the 25th of January till the 2 second of Feb 2020.

because she wanted to surprise visit my mother on her 60th birthday.

and that my brothers wife was trying to plan this for my brother.

this  came as a huge shock to me because i only have 1 month to plan this.

so i check flight times seeing it costs over 1300 euros and travel times are 36 hours of flight.

this is ridiculous and utterly impossible for me .

i would arrive 3 days later with time difference.

but all in all my mother doesn't even know about this.

I\`m under the impression she doesn't even want this as she has moved on.

and i\`m not willing to pay that amount just to be unwanted. 

it would kill me emotionally to have gone all that way for nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

what is hate is the fact I was never apart of this plan by my brother and my aunt  at all.

it hurts me so bad that it seems they have planned this and i had no say in it at all.

just because my brother has children now he wants to reestablish contact with her makes all my efforts feel like nothing.

i confronted my aunt and said this was not thought through at all.

that this was to much of a risk of being disappointed having spent all that money and flight time.

i said a month time is too short for going to New Zealand.

If this was a thing I would at least wanted 3 weeks there because if it went south i could still explore New Zealand.

we are talking of 1 week there 3 days or just travel time.

but it seems they are planning it anyway.

this leaves me feeling betrayed by my closest family.

i put in so much effort trying to reestablish contact with my mother.

my aunt and brother know this.

now i feel left out of such a huge step and can not make it.

what should i do?",15Dec2019,1
511,"This would be a weird request for an advice. I promise you, there's nothing fishy about it even though it might appear to be. So...

I have GAD and SAD. I have two meds that I was prescribed, and was recommended to take at the onset of an anxiety attack if I felt one was coming. And, I've been using it as stated above, and it works wonders.

Only problem is, I don't want to be noticed as a ""pill-popper"". I mean, yeah, I shouldn't be ashamed of my mental disorders, but I just don't want the stigma associated with it to hurt my career or personal life.

So, how do I always have these two pills on me, in an inconspicuous manner to take in case of emergencies?

528,"So my boyfriend (22M) and I (20F) have been together for about 6 months now, and over the course I have gotten to know his two best friends (let’s call them Carl and Zack). Due to thinking that Carl was a nice person, I set him up on a date with one of my absolute best friends. On the date, there was inappropriate touching and comments that left her feeling extremely uncomfortable. She isn’t even willing to go on dates anymore due to how freaked out she is.

It took a few weeks of debating how to go about the situation, but finally I talked to my boyfriend I’m great lengths about it and we decided to talk to Zack (his other best friend) since he knows Carl better than anyone. We thought that he could be helpful in understanding how to proceed due to the closer relationship, his ability to comprehend confrontation, and his experience with Carl in the past. When talking to him, we discovered that Carl had been creepy for years, to the point where Zack doesn’t even let him be around his sister/nieces. I was, of course, mad, but I let him talk to Zack first. After they talked, Zack acted like it was just Carl, it would be what it would be, and that it was over. 

I was not having it. I felt like Zack just didn’t take it that seriously, as he had basically just lightly scolded Carl for the date and still had the attitude of “he won’t change, so whatever”. Carl called my boyfriend and asked to talk, and I said I would. He came over, I chewed him out, but I refrained from screaming too much and tried to kept my composure. I was still livid, of course, but I was trying to be mature. After that, I felt like an agreement was made. My boyfriend and I didn’t want to be around Carl, but we were more than open to hanging out with Zack.

Then my boyfriend got a call. Zack basically told him that he wasn’t loyal enough to Carl and that he was just siding with me due to being my boyfriend. He was very upset with him. Carl said that I had been more rude than I should have been, and that my boyfriend “turned his back on Carl”. Then last night, my boyfriend and Zack were supposed to hang out and potentially work things out. Apparently, Zack is using a light conversation I had with his girlfriend a couple weeks ago as an example of discrepancies in my friend’s story about the date, despite the fact that I told him that at the time I still didn’t have all of the details about it. He claimed that my boyfriend was a traitor, and said that he would only move forward if he could talk to my friend. That being said, I had already made it VERY clear that that was not going to be happening. She has a lot on her plate now, even excluding the date, and she doesn’t want some man that she doesn’t know coming and drilling her about the facts of the date. He said that, because we won’t let him talk to her, we are all 3 snakes and toxic. He claims that my friend is lying/exaggerating, that I am toxically loyal, and that my boyfriend “sold out”. Zack is still friends with Carl, but has already blocked both me and my boyfriend. 

I am left with whiplash and a lot of anger, and I don’t know how to proceed. My boyfriend is livid and really hurt, as these are people he has been close to since he was 12, but he is trying to simply move forward. I plan to do the same, I just wanted to hear what other people thought of this whole mess. If it seems as though my boyfriend and I are wrong, feel free to lay out why you feel that way.

TLDR Because my boyfriend confronted Carl about being sexually creepy towards one of my friends, his other best friend is claiming he is toxic and not loyal. He claims that I am toxic for being too loyal to my friend and is made that we won’t let him talk to her. Any thoughts on this whole thing would be appreciated.

529,"So my mom got diagnosed with bipolar disorder shortly before school started, and I’ve been trying to avoid thinking about it, yet alone bringing it up.

I’ve been trying to do some research on it in my free time, but for the most part, it’s just such a big thing to think about, so I’ve avoided it.

My mom has been struggling a lot with depression since my dad and her divorced. Depression is something I know she’s had all her life, but it got really bad during that time, and she even resorted to alcohol (as she’s an alcoholic, my definition of an alcoholic being someone who’s addicted to alcohol, but doesn’t necessarily fulfill that urge). She hadn’t drunk too much in years but during that time she was a mess and she drank a lot.

Then things seemed to turn up a bit more when she got a boyfriend. For the purpose of making my life easier, I’ll be calling him “Dirtbag”.

Dirtbag was really nice until he moved in with us. He had two twin daughters about my sister’s age (9, but 8 at the time) and a son a few years younger, as well as a dog he kept in a crate 24/7 and didn’t do shit to take care of.

He leeched off my mother and really fucked her up. My mom finally got the courage to kick him out, and we gave his dog away to a better family when he didn’t bother to come pick him up. (Also gave away his two turtles, who are also now in a much better home).

My mom has been struggling a lot and had to be hospitalized twice for fear she might be a danger to herself. She had been required to take therapy secessions in the past and has made both good and bad friends out of them.

One such bad friend was some guy I’ll call Joe. Joe got kicked out of his homeless shelter for drinking and turned up in our backyard drinking and sleeping. My little brother (12) was really freaked out by this because his room was right by the backyard (we live in a townhouse), and he found empty whiskey bottles or something of that sort in his room everywhere.

My mom had to call the police on him and he was arrested. Apparently there was already a warrant out for his arrest for a DUI.

I feel like my mom has been a lot better lately but I’ve still been worried sick about her. I spend a week at my dad’s and then a week at my mom’s, and I really worry about her while I’m away.

If anyone knows anything about bipolar disorder or could give me any other information or advice about what I should do going forward in regards to my mom, I’d really appreciate it.

I want to help her but I’m not sure what I can do. I’m just sixteen, and I’ve got a lot of my own struggles with mental illness to deal with. But I hate just standing by doing nothing.",15Dec2019,1

531,"Hello I have been struggling since the last 20 years very badly. And just in 2017 I came to know about Dignitas a Swiss organisation that allows assisted suicide. And this year just 2-3 months ago I applied to them however they say I don not clear for their program as I have not got sufficient medical record.

At this point I have been struggling already since the last 20 years and I don not want to take medical help for another 5-10 years in order to get enough medical record to clear for their program.

Especially since I do not want to spend the rest of my remaining years getting medical help and therapy especially since I do not even like getting medical help and therapy to begin with.

I don't know about the laws for voluntary suicide anywhere though and the only program I know is this one in Switzerland. I would like to get some help and advice",15Dec2019,1

He was in one of my classes and I thought he was pretty cute. He lives in my neighborhood, and we ended up walking home together and becoming friends pretty quick. He would be my third boyfriend. So yesterday (the day he asked me out) I felt like he was taking it way too quickly, as he has said I love you and all that and I wasn’t feeling comfortable with it. I told him upfront that I had wanted to take it slow, and he said he wanted me to trust him, but I have trouble putting trust in people at all. He seemed pretty understanding of my situation, but I’ve been feeling so so anxious and nervous about the whole thing, and I can’t figure out why. I’ve been trying to go over things in my head and figure out why I’ve been so nervous, but I can’t figure it out. Everyone has said it’s pretty normal and stuff, but I was so nervous all last night that I felt like I had to throw up, and I had freaked out a little bit.

533,"Hi I’ve been suffering with and sometimes enjoying being without a place for a while now. I’ve gotten pretty good at it I have some amazing friends across the country and I’m pretty grateful for the life I got to live but I made the decision to reenter society and settle down in Massachusetts because of the work available and my son lives in this state. Since coming here in October I was able to save up plus bought a truck but I haven’t been able to find an apartment. I rescued this bulldog and he lives in my truck with me so I’m under a lot of pressure to find a place to live before it gets really cold and I’ll be forced to drive south or bring the dog to a shelter. I’m not entirely convinced he will have a good life no matter how good of a home I find him, plus my son and I love him.

I guess my problem is my situation in the last couple weeks has eroded my ability to make decent decisions and I’m not very experienced at renting, I only lived in a formal apartment once and I just happened to find the guy on Craigslist and sign a lease that time. I looked at two places but one wanted $3,800 to move in.

I have 3 jobs, 2 trucks, tools and computers and photography equipment as well as 3D printers for a business that I am only marginally able to run and I have $2,000 in cash and good credit. I don’t have a driving license. My friends offered me free rent in PA and FL but I would rather stay in Mass, I can’t find anyone to watch the dog or even to crate him so I can go to work.

My girlfriend who I moved to small town with for her broke up with me and now I'm in the process of dealing with lawyers to get her off the title. So I got lawyer fees, trying to split the stuff and all that other stuff and she hasn't officially moved out and the lawyer papers haven't been signed yet so that is always on my mind.

I need to buy a used car do to my current ciecumstances and I gotta dish out some savings to make the monthly payments low enough. I had plans to use that money to fix things on my house  but I need a car. So now I'm going to be set back about half a year. 

I started going out again to try and meet new people in a new city and started seeing this one girl for almost a month then I went to bar to meet her and i left for to the washroom then her ex boyfriend showed up and they were talking and now they are back together. This happened like yesterday so I'm like still pretty emotional about this shit.

This other girl I like just straight ignores the shit out of me over text but then all of sudden when she drinks she messages me. I cooked her steak dinner and went out to the bar after and then we kissed and split up after that  cause we had work the next day. I sent her a message saying morning how was your sleep then she ignored me.

Then on friday both the girl I was seeing for the past month and the girl I went on date with were at the same bar and got stupid anxiety.  Just to be clear the girl I was seeing for the past month still technically labelled ourselves as single so it was fair game. This is when the ex boyfriend showed up and the other girl got blackout wasted and then told me to fuck off.

My mom is going to the hospital cause there are some serious health related issues.

My parents split up when I was a kid and then my dad didnt want anything to do with me so my mom and I had to live at grandmas for a bit till my mom could afford a place for us to stay. Dad was also an abusive alcoholic...

My entire family like uncles and aunts and everyone dont talk to each other anymore and pretty hate each other over inheritance that pretty much was all lost after lawyer fees. So now it's just me myself and my bro.b

536,"To make a long story short my husbands Father passed away February, 2019. He was a great man and had been married to my MIL for 31 years. She’s always been annoying, but I’ve tolerated it and showed her nothing but love and kindness for my husbands sake.  When his dad died he was sick but it happened really fast and was unexpected. Then After his passing my MIL decided to move to Arizona where her other daughter and family lives, from Nevada. Well since she’s moved in September she’s been back 3 times. First time she stayed at our house for two weeks because her daughter in Arizona couldn’t stand having her at her house any longer, because she had already stayed there 3 weeks waiting for her house to be done, so they alienated and left her out. I nicely offered for her to come stay with us, so she flew back in. First week was fine, she helped cook, contribute and was respectful, but as the second week approached she started getting too comfortable. Changing my thermostat, telling me if I was hot I could crack open a window cause she was cold and had to turn my air conditioning off, insisting on sleeping on our living room couch because the air mattress we provided was not comfortable enough, ate all my food, didn’t replace it, had a comment for everything, went in my bathroom to borrow my blow dryer when the doors were shut and I was gone, etc. By the time she left I was ready!! We also let her borrow our 2005 Toyota Tacoma. Well then a few weeks later her mom passed away, so she flew back in and thankfully stayed at her Father house, same town, but asked to borrow our truck. Now here’s the point of contingency, my husband is a Trooper so he gets his own patrol car. I have a car and he has a truck, in which I use every winter because it has four wheel drive. Well I didn’t feel comfortable letting her borrow it, tired of feeling used, but it caused a huge fight with my husband. He said the truck just sits there and needs to be used, I should be nice to her cause she’s going through a lot, so she got her way and drove our truck around for two weeks. She never brings it back with a full tank and barely says thank you, and we pay for the servicing and if anything happens to it. When she flies back Arizona, I breath a sigh of relief and get our truck back. Winter is coming so I buy a booster seat for my daughter, new tires and set it up for me to drive with my daughter for weather. Well literally less than four weeks later her sister dies unexpectedly and she immediately flies back in. Luckily she stays with her dad, but she asks again if she can use the truck because she doesn’t like her Dads car, it smells like smoke and she wants to get around town, and my husband says of course! I tell him that’s my truck for the winter and he says well she can borrow your car then, and you can drive the truck! It’s driving me nuts! First off he never has my back when it comes to his mother and second off I’m tired of every time she comes to town she uses our truck, doesn’t even bother putting a full tank of gas or anything and has grown to expect it. I’m tired of it. Would you be upset? Advice please....",15Dec2019,1

540,"Long story short I met my beautiful girlfriend when I was about to graduate college. Lost my virginity to her and did not have any real experience before her. (not including relationship that lasted a week haha) More into the relationship I found out her sexual desires are out the roof (which is completely fine), but its becoming difficult for me. I never knew but my family has low testosterone level problems leading to lowered sex drive. How unfortunate for her to get with someone like me with such low drive. We communicate a lot so we never have too much issues but we fight because of it here and there. I can tell she gets sexually frustrated, and annoyed which is expected if she cannot get what she needs and want. Shes been very understanding and I have been as well but I want to be able to give her what she deserves. I am not going to lie, it gets me upset when she wants to have sex 90% of the day. I want to go out for dinner with her, watch movies, play games, talk, etc, but it seems to get in the way too much. If i could turn myself into desire king or something and satisfy her I'd gladly do it. What I want is to at least be able to do way more and make her sexually satisfied at least more than half of what she wants. 

I need real advice and tips from those out there who maybe knows solution to these. 

Before you answer here are few things I've tried

\-supplements  
\-testosterone shots  
\-exercise  
\-using toys on her  
\-I make her orgasm at least once a day through oral or sex

She does not want anyone else getting involved in our sex. No threesome and anything related.

I need some good advice :( I really want to make her happy and even have the greatest sexual desire than anybody else had for her.

Hey, so I really don’t know what to do about this. 

I’ve had debts building up for a long time which puts a big strain on my situation. I’m an experienced waiter who has had a hard time finding a job recently. But here’s the main situation:

I have 2 places currently we’ll call them 1 and 2 

I’ve lived in 1 for 4 years. It’s a hostile household and is in a very hard place to commute to without a car etc and with 200 rent (low I know but I don’t have a job either way) 

My mother who I have to follow met a new partner across the country(2)And she said about moving there. Which when I heard that I started looking for waiter roles up there, which I found a place that were willing to hire me ASAP. 

A few days later my mother and her partner broke up so heyo I’m back to being stuck in 1. So I switch my job search back to 1 and I find a job that I loved so much. It was exactly the environment that I wanted and I was really enjoying it. 

2 days later my mother tells me how her and her partner are back on and that we’ll be moving up there the next day. So as I can’t stay in place 1 without my mother I have to leave my job and go to place 2.


Now. A grand total of 3 days later they’ve broken up again. And now I’m back to having no job and no idea what I’m going to do.

Any advice?",15Dec2019,1

I just recently lost my job due to the fact I had a lot of family deaths that I had to either leave early for or take the day for. I'd worked there for 5 months and only missed 3 maybe 4 days due to funerals and such. They let me go on payday(this is important later) we received paper checks. Before I left, I asked if I could collect my last paycheck so I could afford rent, gas, general day to day life things. They said that it was protocol to mail the final check out. Okay, not a big deal. But, its been 9 days since I've been let go and I have no gas to get to my new job, no money for food, and my depression has been taking a major hit because of this. 

My girlfriend has been as supportive as possible during this whole process and I appreciate her for it. I just feel bad because I haven't been acting like myself lately since I've been so stressed out just trying to get through day to day life.

On top of all this though, I've been trying to find a new place to live because of some issues I'd rather not get into. I can't move back home with my mom and her bf because he hates me for some reason, and the only option I really have left is to move somewhere that's about a 90 minute drive from my new job that I start Monday.

We kept each other good company. Joked that we would be the next Bonnie and Clyde. Everything was going really well until a couple weeks ago. After I left his apartment, he had sent me this long paragraph saying how he was going to go to Vegas and kill himself. (A lot of his depression is due to the fact that his dad killed himself a while back outside a Vegas casino) In the message he told me that he liked me a lot and that he would be thinking about me when he dies. He just can’t keep pretending like everything was okay. I can’t tell you how hard I cried the moment I saw this message. I begged him to stay. He didn’t respond until I said “please don’t go yet, I’m coming” and he said okay. His apartment is 30 minutes from my house and I got there in 20. 
I spent the next couple days just trying to convince him to stay, but also trying to find my boundaries so I don’t push him away. He decided to go on a road trip by himself to think and he came back after a couple hours on the road and was okay. He’s been okay since, as far as I can see.. started drinking again though.

We both really like each other and spend a lot of time together and together with friends and what not and its always a good time, except for that one time. But anyway, we met at college and were both home for winter break, she lives about an hour and forty five minutes away from me.

I noticed pretty early on her scars on her wrists and legs but never felt comfortable asking her about it and she never brought it up, I figured it was an old thing and didn't really think about it any further, until last night.

At about 3am we were texting because we both couldn't fall asleep and she has been really depressed since shes gotten home, she has depressive episodes and stuff so I try to be as present as I can be, which is much easier when she is a 5 minute walk down the road rather than an hour and 45 minutes away, but I digress; she told me it was nights like tonight that she really wanted to hurt herself.

I was of course immediately shocked, I wanted to cry. I like her so much and to think shes alone in her room at her parents house hurting herself is a really sad image.

We talked the rest of the night and she fell asleep a little while ago I think, but she just seems so insecure and I am worried about her a lot, and I think some of it has to do with me based on what she was saying. She was saying she ""gets jealous"" about me sometimes because she thinks all guys are always looking for other girls, and how shes worried about her future and wants me to be in it, but is afraid of saying anything because she doesn't want me to think she's clingy or ""crazy"" for lack of better terms, none of which are true.

So let's set the scene, 6 Months ago I separated from my spouse at their request. I left a lot of things behind that day, including a child, a brand new car, our home, and financial security as they were the breadwinner of the household (We're talking 6 digit salary against my measly 44k/yearly). On top of all this my spouse and I had an agreement in place to fund their retirement account due to the fact that they will retire sooner.

Since then I've purchased a beater car, lived out of it for a few weeks, leased an apartment (furnished and accommodating the legal requirements to spend time with child at my place), had to fight for custody with lawyer fees.

Fast forward to today, Lawyers are no longer being used as I no longer have the funds to move forward, credit card debit has 3+ months of late fees, Leased apartment is eating 2/3 of my monthly paycheck, and I've exhausted a 401(k) loan of a few grand.

The custody battle is not going well, spouse only wants to allow 2 days a month for parenting time, legal counselors of the state's judiciary  (volunteer independent lawyers) stated that my buyout rate (marital assets/alimony/retirement accounts) for the divorce is hovering around 40k mark towards me.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, all I have is \~$150 per bi-weekly paycheck for food. Family doesn't exist for me on this continent to ask for personal loans, I already work a full time job, of which I'm not performing at my best abilities due to stress and emotional health (I've pretty much accepted that I won't be a parent after all of this is done).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few skills to market towards friends and internet people mainly tech, but I've started off in construction. Unfortunately my social media posts have been used against me in court documents (hence the Throw away username) so I have deactivated all platforms in a sense to avoid any further delays in legal process. I honestly just want to be able to pay off my credit card fees as my score has went from a nice 790 -&gt; 525.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been keeping a good head on my shoulders through this whole thing and I came here asking for advice on my scenario, I wish there was a specific topic of advice I could lean into for help request, but after 6+ Mo, a lot of paperwork to file as a pro se lawyer, and daily grind of being isolated from former friends and working day job, I'm just lost and don't know what to ask advice on - I guess survival is about money now.

TL;DR What do I do now that I have no money, no family, and no way to reach out for support?",15Dec2019,1
559,"so I’ve had the same username for maybe 10 years, across multiple platforms; twitter, tumblr, youtube, instagram, reddit (not this account of course). I’m an artist so its become a little bit if a brand, though i’m by no means popular. 

recently however i wanted to make an online shop on a popular selling app and i’ve come to find my username is already in use. thats not something id usually get bent out of shape about. But i was curious who had the username, so i looked it up and its one of my friends from college. 

if it was some random person i wouldn’t care, but she KNOWS me and knows thats the username i use everywhere..  she’s an artist too so she understands the importance of keeping the same username to make it easy for people to look your art up.

562,"So college.

I'm almost near the end of my senior high school and I'll be off to college. I know the course that I am going to take, the university I'm going to etc. The problem is.. I am not ready.

I'm not ready for college. And I am someone who tends to just overthink about every single minute detail and somehow I don't know, I'm not ready to leave the place that I am in right now. The place where I just don't have to worry about my future and careers and all of the what ifs that will unfortunately come my way.

Yeah failure and stress is a part of growing up yada yada... I'm just afraid that I won't be able to cope. I don't have any mental problems.. its just that I'm unstable most of the time and I'm not exactly an expert in controlling my emotions.

I just feel this pressure. About you know, living up to my standards, giving my best to make my fam proud and all these things are just giving me a headache.

He just says  you’re just being a bitch but I realize that how can I be a bitch if you always going around saying those bad things about me  when you got your own problems and you know that I’m going to depression I just need some advice on if I really should cut him and also talk to him and tell him how I feel or just flat out ignore him because I’m getting really sick and tired of his attitude because he knows I’m too nice and can’t  stay stand up for myself cause I don’t wanna hurt anyone.so he thinks he can go around and not give me respect that I deserve even though he’s a junior and I’m a senior,15Dec2019,1
564,"Hi so I’m a senior in high school who sits with a group of 4 other people during lunch and we talk about a wide range of things including college applications. 3 out of the 5 (including me) are finished with our applications and have received our acceptances from our first choice college. One is taking a gap year,moving to Louisiana so he can receive instate tuition once he decides to go to college.

My other friend however, hasn’t really started their applications. She’s the type of person who wants to go out of state with absolutely no back up plan. My friends and I don’t want to push her but she has an SAT score of the 900s,wants to attend an art school as a film major yet hasn’t started putting together her portfolio. This is the school: (https://www.uncsa.edu)

Before my friends and I tried to help her  to apply to a state school that has the major she is looking for as a back up, but she waited on last minute and then “didn’t have enough time to apply” even though she never does her homework and just plays video games. The school has even extended the deadline until January and yet she isn’t taking the time to fill out any applications to “lower schools” because they aren’t considered prestigious enough.

Another thing about the SATs, she took the most recent one which was her last chance to take the test yet didn’t study at all. Right when she got out she told us that she was crying throughout the entire thing and guessed on a bunch of questions. Even after my friends and I helped her, now she’s complaining that she’ll end up going to a community college which I responded that it’s easier there because she’ll have her general requirements and then she’ll be able to transfer.

Last thing I’m worried about is that she ONLY applied to out of state schools. If she did go to those schools, it would be unbelievably hard to pay the tuition because her mom just lost her job which is how they have insurance. I know there’s financial aid but there’s only so much that can cover.

My other friend says that we shouldn’t talk to her about applications except when she brings it up so that is what I am doing for the time being. I’m really worried for her.


TLDR; My friend who has a low SAT score and lack of motivation to apply to colleges, wants to only apply to out of state schools yet complains that she would most likely end up at community college which I don’t think that’s the worst idea.",15Dec2019,1

569,"This is long, I apologize. I feel like I have to be really detailed for someone to understand where I’m coming from. There’s a TLDR at the bottom. 

I have a lot of issues, specifically BPD. I don’t deny it. I tend to push people away, and get really defensive and confrontational. I also have been diagnosed with anxiety, and depression at a young age. After 6 years of not being on psychiatric meds for my moods, bpd, depression, I finally just started last week. 

I’m not a good person though, or at least I don’t feel that way. I genuinely don’t have any friends, and the small ones I do don’t treat me like a friend, because how I behaved in the past. I would get jealous and easily hurt. Now, most of them did hurt me in ways I didn’t hurt them (lied to me, made fun of me, told my secrets to people, even one and her friend tried to “catfish” me, stole from me) and I’ve always been the most consistent friend. I would do anything for my friends/family no matter what, and when they wouldn’t do anything for me I would get deeply hurt and lash out. I’ve literally had to change schools for defending my friends being bullied and stuff. 

I can’t really use social media because I fucking fight with everyone in the world. I’m so defensive and confrontational. There’s so many people that despise me, especially online, because I defend myself/other people. I wouldn’t call myself a bully, because I don’t seek out people to attack or ridicule. If I see something gross (people ganging up on someone, making fun of someone, men talking to girls) I will say something, and sometimes it comes back to bite because I make so many enemies. I’ve even had someone dox me &amp; send my nudes to my parents, because someone else was making homophobic remarks, so I retaliated and insulted her. I also have a girl for the past year stalk all of my social media, and even got my number, and texting me to kill myself/I’m ugly/fat/etc because I hung out with her boyfriend ONCE, despite not knowing he had a girlfriend. But if I were to say anything back then I’m just a bitch. 

One time, my ex boyfriend told me that so many people don’t like me because I “tell them the truth”. Which is true, I don’t hold back for anyone, I say how I feel when I feel it. And I will defend myself (or anyone I give a shit about) to the death. But I also don’t watch my mouth and say dumb shit so people hate me &amp; criticize me which infuriates me. 

Also have no relationship with most of my family. I’m the black sheep (drug addict, got kicked out at 17, fought with most of my family, got hospitalized and sent to rehabs). I hold a lot of anger towards my parents and my sister for my upbringing, my parents both emotionally and mentally tortured me at a young age during their divorce, a lot of my character flaws come from my parents, I felt I always have to defend myself still, despite being an adult now, and somewhat successful for my age, and I did it all by myself with no help from the family, despite what I went through. I’m labeled the dysfunctional one because I stand up for myself when they try to put me down, or talk shit, yet any time they’ve needed something I was the kid that was there. 

I’m really spiritual. I pray a lot to shut the fuck up. Some days I watch my mouth, some days I don’t. I hope that my quickness to defend myself &amp; be confrontational comes from my impulsivity due to mental illness, because it causes me to do and say a lot of things without thinking. I try so hard to be mindful, but it feels like once I open my mouth, I can’t stop. And I say things that I know will hurt people so they’ll leave me alone so they can’t hurt me anymore, or until I feel I defended myself and I’m justified. 

I always think.. is this the rest of my life? Ill never have a relationship because I do the same shit to men. I don’t have any friends right now, not even really internet friends, because how much shit I talk and the dumb shit I say. I feel like I’ve ruined myself, and I’ll never amount to anything, because of how much people have me because of how I act. 

TL;DR I don’t watch how I talk, because I’m impulsive. I try to be a good person through my actions, but my mouth is so horrible when I’m hurt or mad that it ruins relationships (family/friends) and I have a lot of people in the world that hate me. If you hurt me, I will beat any hope of salvaging a relationship so you can’t hurt me again, which is usually me personally attacking you. How do I stop?",15Dec2019,1
570,"So I met this girl, when I met her she told me she was single. I we talked for hours and hung out a lot.

Since she got back with her ex we still hung out and do ""stuff"". She always be coming over talking about how her ex doesn't treat her right and all that , then things escalate. I ask her why she stays with him she says ""they been together 5 years and she doesn't want to start over"". The worse part is that she lives in the same building as me and as I'm typing this she's with him &amp; I can hear them talking &amp; laughing.

573,"Last Thursday night after going to a club me (18m) and a girl I’ve been seeing for like 2 and a half months (18) came back to mine. We were both sober and so we started talking about us. We both said we really liked each other and agreed to go exclusive from now on.

I haven’t been with any other girl since I’ve been seeing her. She told me she’s been with other guys up until pretty recently, even saying she was with another guy on a day when we had a dinner date and she ended up going out a couple hours later. 
I know we weren’t exclusive but I can’t help feeling kind of shitty about it. 

On Friday she said she was gonna head out again (just finished first year college exams). One of our mutual friends invited us both to her pre drinks and she told me that day she was gonna go. I arrive there only knowing 1 person with a bunch of strangers and I send her a snapchat asking her if she’s coming by. She leaves me on open. Later on that night when we get into taxi I text her asking if she’s going to the same club. 

She said maybe and that she’d let me know. Another hour goes by and I haven’t gotten anything so I send her a message saying that I’m heading back cause I’ve got work in the morning and that I’ll see her on Sunday. She says ok no problem see you then. 

Today I sent her a message asking if she wanted to meet for a while in the afternoon. Turns out she went back to her family home (she lives in accommodation) for the rest of the holidays where she had previously said she was going back Tuesday next week. 

It’s all a bit demoralising, we weren’t exclusive so technically she’s done nothing wrong, it doesn’t stop me from feeling shit about it. And the past 2 days have been a shit show where she doesn’t respond to my messages and despite previously having said she was gonna do one thing doing another without letting me know. I wanted to see her a little bit more this weekend because I knew we wouldn’t see each other for like 2 months. 

Now I don’t know what to do because I’ve committed to being exclusive when I don’t think we’re at that stage and we’re not gonna see each other for the next while. I don’t know if I should talk to her about some of this or not. I’m gonna see her tomorrow so I don’t know if I should say something or not.",15Dec2019,1

575,"Long story, I'm the only daughter of 4 children, my dad has always been my best friend and the number 1 man in my life. However in October he was rushed into hospital with heart failure, kidney failure and other complications, there was days where I honestly thought it would be his last.
Being the only girl 2 of 3 brothers leaned on me with only one brother holding my hand and letting me cry, I was strong for my mum when she broke down. I went to work and that's where I would be able to cry freely without guilt, my colleagues are the best kind of people always supporting each other and having each others backs.
Anyways my dad had dialysis and there was 1 day thats always haunted me, I went to see him on my own feeling brave I sat there whilst he slept and held him when he cried. I didn't mind as much as it broke my heart I wanted to hold onto him. He's my dad.
When he came out of hospital in November it started off well, until it went bad. My dad has type 2 diabetes I stupidly hoped he would sort himself out. He had to come off some meds for his diabetes for his kidneys and his blood sugars rose to 30.0 (your bloods are supposed to be between 3 and 8?) he had to stop working until he has a pacemaker in. My mentality is that when you get ill you fight to get better. However his seems to be sitting in front of the TV every day and eating rubbish! I can't be in the same room as him anymore I get snappy whenever I see food in his hands, I get snappy when I see him sitting on the sofa doing nothing yet complaining his legs are sore. I get snappy by him just talking (57 years old stuck in his ways kinda man)
Any advice on how I can just tell him to stop? Some days as awful as it sounds I feel like I wasted time on going seeing him and listening to him say he's gonna sort himself out. I understand when you go through trauma you struggle to get better but why does it feel like he isn't bothered if he lives or not? Every day it's getting worse and I genuinely can't be around him anymore.

I try to talk to her as much as i can everyday and tell her how important she is and how much everyone appreciates her but have a very heavy schedule and can't text or call but for an hour or two a day. This morning she texted me  telling me that she had attempted suicide again  last night but had thrown up the three days worth of painkillers earlier this morning. Her mother has a general understanding of her depression, her psychiatrist suggested she goes to a hospital ward just last week for her own safety and her other friends dont understand the seriousness of her depression and that she remains a risk to herself. I don't know what to do in this situation. Do I try harder than i already have to console and speak to her even though its been unsuccessful up until now?

579,"TL;DR at the bottom.

So some back story. 28M, was put on Autism spectrum (high functioning) as a kid (important). Tried moving out after college, got into all kinds of trouble and came back to constant screaming.

Highschool sucked for me. Was a joke to everyone. Constantly being mocked for my disability, didn't have friends. College was no better but got a 2 year degree out of it. 

In middleschool, because of diagnosis, mom helped me with homework I knew how to do or simply did it for me. Because of that I cannot do simple multiplication or division in my head without a calculator. 7 * 9? No clue. 

Between college and now I've tried ending it twice. I'm better, I've seen a therapist and haven't gotten that low. The day I was admitted my mom called me insane and Dad doesn't believe in therapy at all. He's a suck it up and smile kinda guy. Mom's a teacher with control issues. Both have PhD's.


I've made plenty of mistakes, both personal and financial. I was in $18k of debt, parents bailed me out. Had to move back home, couldn't afford an apartment. 

Got into more debt, bailed myself out with a high interest loan (all I could get) to pay everything off including my car. My credit score is not that bad (650-720). 

It's been at least a year since all that went down, and my parents are trying to ""get into"" every aspect of my life, including my relationship with my girlfriend. And now (within a few months) I've found I have psoriasis and need to medicate. Was on a pill/topical mix for 3 months, didn't work. Dermatologist says I need to go to a biological (injections), Dad freaks out and starts screaming bloody murder saying I'm not taking the meds (very slight infectivity/cancer risk) and begins listing everything I've done wrong in my 28 years of life. 

Meds would be a lifelong endeavor, as there is no cure for psoriasis.

Mom goes off on a tangent basically saying I'm stupid and hints that I still need to have my hand held for any decisions in the future. 

I've concluded I'm a disappointment to them.

I'm currently trying to move out to get away from it all before I do something stupid again.

This is a constant sit-down conversation every Saturday in our house. It's become a running joke.

I don't know what to do at this point.

580,"So I [M20] just recently matched with a girl [F20] at my university. We’re in a pretty small club together where we’ve gotten along well, and while I probably wouldn’t have gotten the nerve to ask her out otherwise, I decided to because of the match. Our winter break is in a few days, so I asked if she’d want to get lunch sometime when we get back.

She said yes, but it didn’t seem like she was super excited or anything. When I first brought up the idea of getting together she said that she did have a lot of fun when she was hanging out with me and my friends one time. Anyway, I went to a party last night that she happened to be at. I didn’t talk to her much there beyond a couple fun hello’s, but she did talk to another person who I know.

This guy she talked to is a guy who I’ve worked with in other clubs, and he’s great. He also tried to get with this girl and make things work, but it did not happen, and it crushed him. He almost left the party because she was there, but at one point in the night they ended up talking and he found out that I had asked her out.

He told me that she said she wasn’t sure what to make of it, but from what he said, it sounds like she isn’t interested. At this point I honestly don’t know what to do. I trust that this guy is telling the truth, but there’s definitely some bias since he *really* liked her too. I almost drunk texted her last night to not worry about what I said on Tinder, but I’m not sure if that’s the right move. It’s not like she has told me anything yet.

It’s just frustrating since we matched and she said yes. If she wasn’t interested, I would have preferred for her to make it clear, because then at least I wouldn’t be confused. What should I do?

Last time I had any contact with her was when we met last, which was a month ago. 

Yesterday my aunt posted on Facebook a picture of my cousin's diploma she had gotten for being so hard working at her job, and I commented basically saying ""Congratulations [my cousin's name], you're so talented/ambitious!"". A few seconds afterwards my cousin liked my comment and even commented heart emojis (don't think it was to me though), so maybe she doesn't completely hate me despite the piece of shit I've been to her these last few months? 

Next time I'm seeing my cousin is in a week.

TL;DR Should I show my cousin a song that I wrote for her because she had mononucleosis (she is currently recovering)? I'm afraid I will just make her more mad at me because I've been an asshole to her in recent months.",15Dec2019,1

588,"I posted this here a couple days ago but just wanted some more options.  This is a long post but I'm just trying to give as much detail as I can.

Background: 

To make a long story short, I started hanging out and talking to this girl I met from the internet.  We hung out a couple of times at our college campus then went on a ""real"" date.  We ended up making out a couple of times on the date. We left my car after making out; she was being flirty with me so I touch her butt.  She said in a joking/flirty voice ""Haha anon stop"" and I did it again.  She then said ""Anon I really mean it stop"" which I realized she wasn't joking and I apologized on the spot.  She proceeded to hold my hand and we went about our date.  On the date she even asked me to keep my hand on her inner thigh to ""keep it warm.""  She made out again before I dropped her off and she even joked how she needed to ""teach me how to kiss.""  Her and I texted for a couple of days after the date, but I personally didn't see myself dating her due to her personality (e.g., rude, immature, didn't take school seriously, etc.).  

One day I innocently ""liked"" one her friend's pictures on Instagram.  A few minutes later I received a text from her asking why I didn't like her selfie.  The girl then proceeded to say how she let me ""kept touching her butt"" when she said no; almost seeming like she was trying to gaslight me for not wanting to talk to her/give her attention.  A couple of days later she texted me about hanging out again, but I gave an excuse that I was busy due to school.  For the next couple of months the girl would still ""like"" posts on mine on social media and text me random ""memes"" usually with the caption ""This reminded me of you.""  

One day I was on Twitter and saw that this girl screenshotted a tweet of mine with the caption ""This is funny coming from a guy who kept grabbing my ass when I repeatedly said no.""  I texted her asking about it and she said that ""someone had to call me out"" and started gaslighting me saying that other girls had a similar experience with me (?) which is not true.  Before she made that tweet she tweeted something to the likes of ""You're so cringey why did I ever go on a date with you."" The following day she proceeded to start liking my posts on social media like nothing ever happened and even contacted me about buying my car that I was selling.  The social media posts (e.g., sending messages of things that reminder her of me, liking my posts, etc.) kept on for a few months until I decided to finally unfollow her on everything.  Once she realized I unfollowed her she sent the message ""I'll miss you.""  

Now:

I realized that this girl has some mutual friends with myself and my girlfriend.  Part of me is worried that this girl may make another ""call out"" post about me.  

1.  How do I go about telling my girlfriend about this whole situation?  This was something I have never told her before; I saw a similar thread in the past where people recommended that the guy shouldn't bring it up as it was in the past.  Part of me is worried that she would break up with me over this, but I hope that she would realize how I have respected and treated her along with this girl's character would help her decided who to believe.  Also, I feel like I should wait until after Christmas to do it?
2. Do you guys agree that it is weird that this girl still tried to interact with me following the date?  I feel like if I really did do something to violate her she would have cut me off ASAP.  To me it seems like she was just annoyed that I didn't want to talk to her anymore after we hung out and wanted to ""get back"" at me.

590,"So the problem is that she scratches the corners of her crate and barks often. It's really irritating and I sometimes lose sleep over it. This problem has been going on for like 7 months now and I'm at my wits end. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shes a german shepherd mix and I got her when she was a little puppy (3-ish weeks). Shes a bit over 1 year old now. Since she was a baby she spends most of the day in her crate. She comes out for about 2 hours to play everyday (about 1 hour early in the day and 1 hour later in the day), 3 if shes a good girl. I also take her out to go to the bathroom like 3 or 4 times a day. Shes a very hyper dog and she loves to play. I swear she has ADHD. When she comes out she aggressively plays with my black lab who is bigger than her but younger by a few months. When I say aggressive I mean there is snarling and whimpering from both but they never draw blood and it looks like they are wrestling. They don't have their hackles up so I doubt they are genuinely fighting. It just looks like some playful, albeit aggressive, wrestling. They always wrestle and they almost never stop. Thats why she has to go into the crate these days. It's obnoxious to hear them play because the shepherd never stops. Shes like an energizer bunny. I can only handle so much. Every now and then the two will relax and lay down but those times are far and few apart.

What should I do? I want her to stop barking and scratching at her crate. I could giver her away but I dont want to because I love her too much.",15Dec2019,1

So me (21M) and a girl (19F) Ive known for a while (2 months) went out for the third time last night. 
This girl is quite shy and pretty insecure, she was into me for quite a while before we went out, and she didnt really show it at all. She’s said she never takes the initiative and doesnt know how to flirt/kiss. I’m her first experience ever..


First we went on a super long walk which was okay, almost no awkward silences in 2 hours of walking, but no flirting, then we got back to her place. She cooked dinner and we were just standing in the kitchen chatting. We’re always having laughs and good conversation though, but we didnt get physical yet. 

 Then we get in her bed and watch a movie for a while, after a while we start cuddling. At this point I thought the ”date” didnt go so well and we were just spooning.

At this point I told her to turn around and that I wanted to ask her something, so she turned around and I said ”I don’t get you, you’re so unclear”. Followed up with something like ”This thing we’re doing, it’s something you wanna keep doing?” (Last times we met we’ve kissed a bunch and just been spooning) I asked this because she really doesn’t show any interest whatsoever in person, and I just wanted to know whats going through her mind.

She said something like ”Yes, Im always having a really nice time with you.. (something else)..” then she said that she needs time and asked if I could ”take more time with her”. 
Not sure what she meant entirely but I told her that I want to, and that I’m already taking it slower because she’s so inexperienced and I take that into consideration and don’t wanna come on too strong. 

After this we were just laying and talking for hours until we started making out, it was a little awkward and I’m not sure if she enjoyed it because she isn’t really a good kisser. But I tried my limits and she let me touch and rub her panties.
 Then we went back to talking and holding each other, these hours were the best in my opinion and she said numorous times it was really cozy, I suggested we’d meet next thursday but she had plans. And she suggested next wednesday instead. 

So I’ll see her again and I’m gonna do my best to make sure next time becomes a little more enjoyable. But I don’t know I’m so uncertain. It feels like I’ve messed things up? Something feels off and I don’t like it. What do you think, maybe I shouldn’t have asked those things or put any pressure?",15Dec2019,1

593,"My Girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) have had a relationship for the last 3 months. Not a long time, granted. However, I thought it was all okay and that our relationship could continue into the future. Nothing crazy, just that we were stable. I open SnapChat today and I've been expecting a friend request from one of my online friends. I come to find a old friend request sent to me from some random person who I don't recognize their name. 

They had sent said request about a month ago, I accepted it and there was already a message. I open it. It's one of my GF's friends and it talks about how she feels uncomfortable with me. She doesn't want to be around me, she doesn't want to go out with me. Just general discomfort with me. 

I don't think this is a jealous friend, or someone who wants me gone. People in her friend group aren't like that, from what I can tell. 

I sent a screenshot of the chat to her and then I've blocked all of her communication back. I want her to think about it and not try to lie to me again. 

I have a fear of lying. Rejection I have learned to handle, and I would have been fine if she had just come up to me and told me that she was uncomfortable with me. Having an honest and open dialogue is all that I strive for. 

I believe that she was trying to conceal her true feelings because she didn't want to hurt me. 

I'm not sure how to respond to this. If she has lied once about her feelings, then what is stopping her from lying again? And while I accept that there is a reasonable tolerance for lying, you should lie about your own feelings. Especially when it relates to someone else.",15Dec2019,1
594,"I am a 22 year old woman who is dating a 22 year old man. We've been dating for less than a year and have been fighting for a while.

He recently took a job where I live and moved in with me, bringing money issues (that he'd been lying about/hiding) with him. I had been doubting our relationship before he moved in, but thought that him moving in would show for sure if we'd be able to make it long term. I realize that this was not a good idea now, please do not point out that this was a bad idea. 

Since moving in, he's been caught in multiple lies concerning ex-girlfriends and money. I no longer want to be with him and do not see our relationship moving forward, BUT..

He relies on me financially. I pay all rent/utilities/groceries, and provide a much closer drive to work. Where he was living before was about an hour and a half from work, and he argues that he took the job that he did because it was closer to me. I had told him to not take the job if it did not pay enough for him to handle his bills AND have fun/throw-away money. He didn't listen.

If I break up with him, he will go under financially. 

He's a sweet guy, I just have no more romantic feelings towards him. I don't want him to go under and I don't want him to fail. I'd even be willing to let him stay til he's back on his feet, but I've found in the past that letting ex-boyfriends live with you doesn't usually end well.

608,"Marked NSFW for abuse triggering. Please, stay safe.

I am a minor - 14 in a month. For my entire life, both mine and my older brother's, (now 20 yrs. old) - my father has been abusive. Mostly verbal, but it would easily stretch into physical. He never really targeted me. I was always the ""good quiet child"" who never stood up for himself, so I was never abused. It was my mother and sibling. He would torment them both. He would constantly scream and verbally abuse my brother, as well as go into his room and tear up everything he had, and throw it on the side of the road. This happened more than once - many more times than once. Him being a good 6'2 and extremely strong, my mother being 5'2, me of course, a smaller child, and my brother, if tried to defend, beaten or verbally abused more.

I feel obligated to defend my father, as he was abused as a child. But he has caused me so much emotional suffering. He has caused me the development of severe anxiety disorders, my mother, a victim of him, bipolar disorder, and my brother, permanent trauma. I've struggled with that anxiety since I was nine, and I feel so ruined. Although it's being treated now by a therapist and medicine, as well as my mother's bipolar. 

My father tempted my mother into drinking, which turned into a habit like my father's- (think 12+ beers a night for *years*, and still continuing as of now). That hella triggered my memories and I would be in so much pain when she did drink. I eventually got so fed up that I stood up and convinced her to stop for good. She did, thankfully, but my father, never did. 

Now, at age 13, my brother moved out, the abuse stopped, I decided to try to forgive and let go. So I did; I genuinely did. I tried my hardest and did it. I tried to spend more time with him when he was sober, and appreciated him more. It worked, until we got a call from my brother. His girlfriend, traumatised from her mother's death and ill, kicked him out while she has a psychotic episode. He is here now.

My father comes home from work and immediately begins to verbally abuse my brother.
Me, being now a lot stronger than before and somewhat mentally stable, fought back to him and blocked him from getting another step closer. My mother joined in and helped. We decided to pack up and leave. (We own a camper, so we drove down to it to stay.)

Last night, she went back home by herself to ""have a talk."" She said that he was sorry. I can't bring myself to believe it and try to love him again. He's never tried.

Should I forgive him?

***Small note- I am not being abused. I do not need help. My mother is not being abused any longer. My brother will not be. I do not need help, and if I did, I would call for it. I was terrified to post this, but I just needed to get it off my chest.***",15Dec2019,1

My girl went to a club with some friends last night. It’s 1:30 am and i tell my girl i see her jaw clenching in her snapchats. She says I’m good baby. I said get home safe, it’s late.
I go to bed. I wake up at 5am and she hadn’t texted me. I looked at her location because I was genuinely concerned. It was not her home. I text her and she answers! (Why is she awake at 5am)
I FaceTimed her and on the 3rd try she answers,
Having snuck away into a hallway, wearing some dudes shirt. 
She said I’m at my girlfriends, we’ve just been chillin. I saw no one around and said then where is everyone. “Asleep”
I was at this point mega sketched out. Found out that she was not in fact at her girlfriends. More questions. This morning i made her tell me the truth. 

This is her truth: (charlie is her old boss)

I didn’t want to tell you because baby it wasn’t that big of a deal and I know you’d freak out because i know it sounds bad but it really wasn’t, it meant to be harmless.. we went back to Charlie’s house and he gave me a line but it was harmless, I didn’t mean to go behind your back like at all I just wasn’t thinking, so we literally just talked that’s it, for a long time, about the whole internship situation and life and stuff and then we kinda forgot that my car was parked at Sam’s so I slept in his guest bed. I was cold so he gave me a sweatshirt. It was literally just friendly stuff nothing bad at all. I talked about you so much and how I love you so much

611,"Repost: I rewrote the text from the original post to be more concise.

I’m a woman in my early twenties and I feel like I’ve accomplished nothing. People my age have a driving license, a job, hobbies, a skill or more that they are at least good at, activites they’re passionate about and so on, you get it. I have absolutely nothing. I’m just an useless person in the world, always in need of help, just like a mentally retarded child. I assure you I don’t make it up, I’m not too judgemental towards myself.

I’m a failure. I’m depressed, autistic and I have BPD. Everything is diagnosed by the psychiatrists I’ve seen. I’ve had several diagnoses (schizophrenia, psychosis, OCD, bipolar disorder) but they’ve proven to be wrong, according to my last therapist and psychiatrist. 

To add insult to the injury, I’m on disability benefits. Physically I’m alright but mentally and emotionally I’m unfit for a job, they decided. I never wanted to recieve this kind of help, my mom pushed for it without giving a damn about what I thought about this embarrassing situation. Finally, she convinced me to accept all of this because I’ve tried to keep a job several times and I didn’t succeded. Knowing the fact that this support is for life and I only can opt for it once, never twice, I can’t just quit like that and risk to be homeless afterwards if I don’t ever get a job.

I’m also a highschool dropout and that, besides my other issues, made me very undisciplined, lazy, depressed, unhappy and desperate. 

I’m addicted to weed, alcohol, cigarettes and junk food. Needless to say, I’m a bit overweight. 

My self esteem is very low, I’m my biggest enemy, but not only that. 

My biggest issue is my lack of social skills.
I’m below every woman I know. 
Almost every time I fell in love with a guy, he despises me or rejects me. 
I feel so embarrassed by the fact that I’m a woman, chasing average guys and I’m not good enough even for them. I get obsessed by them for years. It eats at me. I can’t stop begging for their attention. I would do anything so they would appreciate me. Sometimes, for them, I’m not even good for sex. And my physical appearance is... decent. Not great, not terrible. I still dream of the day when I’ll be able to get surgery to enhance my features. But I’m bad with my money, impulsive spender that can’t save money, so damn.

I’m a slob, my mood is so low that I can’t even take care of my own hygiene. Needless to say, the house I live in is a mess. 

I can’t do anything by myself. I have no friends right now. They usually cut ties with me because I give them no reason to keep in touch. I can’t talk about anything since I’m apathetic, shy and very afraid to say something shady. They have nothing to gain from me. 
People usually hate on me and every friendship I had ended up with drama. If you ask people what do they think about me, they would tell you I’m an embarrassment and nobody wants me around them.

I asked the last guy who rejected me (whom I have a very pathological obsession with, the worst of them all) why people don’t like me and he told me because: I have no life experience, I understand things to a bare minimum due my lack of life experience so why would people waste their time talking about serious matters with me, I say shady stuff, I’m pushy and inappropiate. 

I had suicidal attempts.

I’m not getting along with my mom at all. I think she’s the reason I’m like that today. My sister follows, she’s raised the same way, I can see it even if she’s only ten years old. She is a spoiled brat, obese and very illiterate for her age. My mom always tells me to stop dreaming getting a job, a family, kids, a driving license or higher education. She thinks I’ll always be unable to. Her reasons are factually untrue. She says I can’t take commands from bosses at work. I can, but I don’t trust her, she made a lot of bad life decisions. She says I’m unable to wake up at 7am. No, I am, but I hated that highschool and I told her I wanted to be elsewhere but she didn’t approve when I begged her to transfer me. 

Speaking of school, because of my autism I couldn’t blend in any community. So I’ve got anxious, very quiet and it’s very hard for me to interact with people. And I couldn’t take it anymore so I’ve dropped out.

616,"Hey Reddit - wanted some advice on a problem that’s been going on for years - my brother seems to have a weird fixation with keeping in contact with my exes.

I’m 35, divorced but now happily engaged again. Since my early 20s I’ve had 4 long-term relationships (including my ex-wife but not my current fiancé). Most of those previous relationships were quite unhealthy for various reasons, but I’ve been to years of counseling to work through my BS, and my current relationship is really fantastic.

I don’t keep in contact with my exes, but I’ve worked hard to not be the kind of person who actively holds a grudge against any of them. (There is one who I still feel contempt for due to repeated infidelities and really taking advantage of me financially- she has ongoing addiction issues). That being said, I do not want these people as part of my current life.

My brother keeps in regular contact with both my ex-wife and my ex I mentioned above with addiction problems - both through regular texting and occasional hanging out in person. He also keeps in touch with another girl I dated for 2 years in my early 20s (no hostility there but...weird, and reinforces the pattern). I don’t want to dictate my brother’s friendships, but frankly it bothers me that 1) this behavior keeps my exes in the periphery of my life when I’d really have them fully in the rearview and 2) that these people causing me real pain in the past isn’t a disqualifying factor for my brother.

I’ve tried to bring this up as being strange but he just gets defensive. Need some advice or insight here on how to proceed. Thanks",15Dec2019,1
617,"So some background info, me and my gf haven't been dating that long now almost 2 months but anyways.

Today I woke up this morning checked my phone and on snapchat she sent me streaks. On the streaks there was some (🥰) emojis and it said streaks but in the picture someones hand was on her thigh I didn't get a very long look at the picture so it could of been her hand on her little brothers leg or something idk. I ask her about it and she says it was her dad and it was a joke to mess with me and other people. I highly doubt it I've met her dad ( Her step dad ) and he doesn't seem like he would do that but then again idk I don't know him that well. 

What should I do could it just be a joke, cause what cheater would send evidence of them cheating to there SO?",15Dec2019,1
618,"So here is the deal, during my school year my mother tried to provide me with the best education possible. To do that she deprived me of the high school (1.5 years) and put me one to one with paid teachers. Therefore, I didn't attend high school and never socialized. After high school, I didn't attend the final party because I didn't know anyone(my school was also changed to illegally not to attend it). Then I was accepted to a university abroad(at the age of 17 where everyone was 19 or above). My university years were miserable since I was so nervous that I couldn't talk to anyone, the nervousness didn't stop until the age of 19. I was so nervous that I couldn't talk to my only friends. But because I was so socially scared(I wouldn't attend parties) I spent my time on other things and did many many improvements on myself. I wasn't a small guy(my height is 183cm), and I have very wide shoulders and a very small waist.

However, because I was so unsocial and was bullied all the time at school, I always thought that I am very ugly and nobody would like to talk to me ever(I was hating myself). So, therefore, I would just close up at home, go to the gym, read books and just focus on myself(I was very depressed). I thought to myself that I could never find a female partner.

But in my 19s many girls started to pay attention to me. Some of them would be so much into me that they would try to kiss me forcefully(mostly young ones and while we were drunk). I started to go to different parties and approach some females, in most cases they would start hugging me and talking with me(I didn't become a chick magnet but when I approached them they would respond to me with warmth).

Nevertheless, the above story might sound like a magical slap, but I still can't be together with a woman and I am still a virgin. The issue is that every time the kiss or something else comes to the surface, I chicken out(even though I kissed a couple of girls). It happened to me that I helped a girl to get home and she looked at my eyes and waited for my kiss, we literally stood there without saying anything for 5 minutes, and nothing happened. Another time, I brought home a girl got her drunk and let her out of the house. This type of situation occasionally happens and hearts me a lot.

I don't really know what to do with that, every time I don't take action I am losing someone. Girls that are attracted to me are very shy and they usually wait for me. Because of this issue, I am not as motivated to approach the opposite sex, since it many times ended in similar results. Now I am thinking of either finding a hooker(for practice) or being honest with the girl when the intimate moment comes out.

What can you advise to me? I would be very thankful if anyone has a similar story and shares it too.

Sorry that it is very long.",15Dec2019,1

620,"There was a girl living next door to ours. As far as I recall, my family and her family rented houses in the same building, in the same floor, in the same year or they rented the year next maybe. She's like 2-3 years older than I am. We spent a lot of time together since I was like 6 or 7. Well, she along with her family moved to another place, so far away, when I was 13. I have some sweet memories of her. Whenever I reminisce of her, I feel like I should talk to her or maybe text her. In fact, we talked through messenger. But, as great as I am, I ruined it in a bad manner. Don't want to put it in details, but the way I talked to her the last time, it was disrespectful, and I was super stupid to disrespect her space and I regret it.

638,"(Rant)
I go to this program every Wednesday after school and I HATE IT. It's about creating a project to help your town (I honestly still don't understand what were supposed to be doing). I've been going for a few weeks now and I have slowly started to view this thing as a big pain. The number of people that show up has been decreasing drastically and I was put as 1 of 2 team leaders for a group of people who started as 20 and now only has 5 members. I HAVE TO DO ALL THE WORK!! What sucks even more is that 90% of the people there don't speak English at all including the organization leaders, so I never have any idea what anybody is talking about. The only good thing about this is that they feed us dinner but that's it. Also they get upset when you don't take time out of your week to come to thier other activities and panels that are not part of the program. When we signed up they told me there wasn't going to be any homework outside of what we do in ""class"" but so far I've had to do everyone else's work for them ON MY OWN TIME! It's a free program too!! Nobody is paying for it!! So why do I need to make room for this stupid thing!! I've never shown up without leaving with a pounding headache!! For what? 10 hours of community service!? SCREW THAT!! I'd rather go get an actual job and get paid for half the work and time! 

My problem is, I don't know how to ask my parents to let me quit. I'm not doing any other activities after school, and I know they would be upset with me If I decided to leave. Whenever they ask me how it is, I say it was fine but really it's not! I know as soon as I bring it up to them they'll give me that upset angry look and I'll start to tear up, and when that happens they completely lose interest in want I'm talking about. I know they are not going to let me quit unless I find some other activity to do which is difficult as they won't spend a dime on activities for me (because they spend it all on my little sister's soccer team and dance classes).

641,"So my bf owns a bar (we’re located in Japan) and I’ve been trying to find out what to get him for Christmas. 

His past gifts have included: 
For his birthday I got him shoes. So that’s out of the question. 
Last year I had drawn him art to hang in the bar. But now he’s got a deal with a local foreign film theatre and hangs movie posters for them, so he doesn’t have art up anymore. 
I got him a cool scotch decanter that looks like a glove that he loved so much last Christmas. 
A little elephant carved somewhere in India. Not sure on the details I got it in an import goods store. 

His interests:
Sci Fi. We’re huge Star Wars fans actually. He loves movies in general tbh. 
Musicals. He loves La La Land.
Travel. Especially South Asia 
He’s bougie with the stuff in his store. Only like the most high quality stuff. But for himself he tends to go simple. 

Issue 1:
I’ve already talked about a jacket (he’s not using one right now) and tiles (the lost item tracker). 
When I bought him the shoes, I showed him a couple styles and got some feedback. He knew instantly what I was doing and got visibly excited. 
But when I’ve shown him these ideas he’s shot them down. 

When I ask him what he wants, he just jokes about sleep, or getting more employees, or something like that.

Issue 2:
He’s busy. Like busy. In Japan, it’s end-of-the-year party season. Everyday is a party. So anything that would be time consuming would be stressful for him until January (I.e a trip). 


I haven’t the slightest idea what to get him. I don’t even know what’s out there in the world anymore.  Any ideas?",15Dec2019,1

644,"I posted this here a couple days ago but just wanted some more options. This is a long post but I'm just trying to give as much detail as I can.

Background:

To make a long story short, I started hanging out and talking to this girl I met from the internet. We hung out a couple of times at our college campus then went on a ""real"" date. We ended up making out a couple of times on the date. We left my car after making out; she was being flirty with me so I touch her butt. She said in a joking/flirty voice ""Haha anon stop"" and I did it again. She then said ""Anon I really mean it stop"" which I realized she wasn't joking and I apologized on the spot. She proceeded to hold my hand and we went about our date. On the date she even asked me to keep my hand on her inner thigh to ""keep it warm."" She made out again before I dropped her off and she even joked how she needed to ""teach me how to kiss."" Her and I texted for a couple of days after the date, but I personally didn't see myself dating her due to her personality (e.g., rude, immature, didn't take school seriously, etc.).

One day I innocently ""liked"" one her friend's pictures on Instagram. A few minutes later I received a text from her asking why I didn't like her selfie. The girl then proceeded to say how she let me ""kept touching her butt"" when she said no; almost seeming like she was trying to gaslight me for not wanting to talk to her/give her attention. A couple of days later she texted me about hanging out again, but I gave an excuse that I was busy due to school. For the next couple of months the girl would still ""like"" posts on mine on social media and text me random ""memes"" usually with the caption ""This reminded me of you.""

One day I was on Twitter and saw that this girl screenshotted a tweet of mine with the caption ""This is funny coming from a guy who kept grabbing my ass when I repeatedly said no."" I texted her asking about it and she said that ""someone had to call me out"" and started gaslighting me saying that other girls had a similar experience with me (?) which is not true. Before she made that tweet she tweeted something to the likes of ""You're so cringey why did I ever go on a date with you."" The following day she proceeded to start liking my posts on social media like nothing ever happened and even contacted me about buying my car that I was selling. The social media posts (e.g., sending messages of things that reminder her of me, liking my posts, etc.) kept on for a few months until I decided to finally unfollow her on everything. Once she realized I unfollowed her she sent the message ""I'll miss you.""

Now:

I realized that this girl has some mutual friends with myself and my girlfriend. Part of me is worried that this girl may make another ""call out"" post about me.

1. How do I go about telling my girlfriend about this whole situation? This was something I have never told her before; I saw a similar thread in the past where people recommended that the guy shouldn't bring it up as it was in the past. Part of me is worried that she would break up with me over this, but I hope that she would realize how I have respected and treated her along with this girl's character would help her decided who to believe. Also, I feel like I should wait until after Christmas to do it?
2. Do you guys agree that it is weird that this girl still tried to interact with me following the date? I feel like if I really did do something to violate her she would have cut me off ASAP. To me it seems like she was just annoyed that I didn't want to talk to her anymore after we hung out and wanted to ""get back"" at me.

I appreciate any replies.",15Dec2019,1
645,"Hi! I'm using a throwaway because I became acquainted with this person on Reddit. 

So I run a mid-sized marketing agency and I'm trying to grow it a bit, and I've chatted with this guy on Reddit several times and he has expressed interest in working for me. We have had a formal interview and I have verbally offered him the position. 

The thing is, I've just now combed through his post history on Reddit and he seems to be a very Orthodox Christian. I'm non-religious, probably to a fault but I do make my best attempt at respecting other people's beliefs. I also know it is very illegal for me not to hire this person because of their religion. 

However, in their post history, they express their belief in ideas such as Deuteronomy 22:22 

&gt;If a man is found sleeping with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.

If you don't understand why one might find this disturbing, please don't respond to this post. 

There are several other instances of him posting about ""keeping his wife in her place"" and that his children are ""property"".

All of this makes me very uncomfortable, and I do not want to hire this person. However, not hiring someone for religious reasons violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

I'm not sure what to do. I believe in the Civil Rights Act, but do not want this person working for me. I can't spend 40+ hours per week with someone I'm uncomfortable around. 

To be clear, I wouldn't want anyone working for me who believed their spouse deserved to die for sleeping with another person. The thing that is making me uncomfortable is not his religion, but the ideas he attributes to his religion.

Writing this all out makes me sort of realize that his ability to work has nothing to do with these ideas, but they are so fundamentally gross to me that it has already tampered our relationship. I don't know what to do.",15Dec2019,1
646,"I’ll keep this short. 

Basically, I’ve [24,F] always been TERRIBLE at committing to things. It runs through my friendships, my everyday life, my health, my career etc. 
I’ll always tell myself to make effort with friends, keep up with responding to messages, and I’ll do good for a few days then I’ll just slip.

With my health, I have chronic fatigue and I’m pretty sure insomnia is in there somewhere. I’ll tell myself, bed by ten every night, less screen time, all the usual tips for a better night sleep. I’ll do it for two days, then I’ll slip. I went on antidepressants, and I stopped after two weeks.

I’m not up to date with important letters I’ve received, because I’ll “deal with those later”.

My family, I feel like the frustration with myself is making me hostile, and thus effecting the relationship I have at home with my sister and mum. They call me out multiple times on how I’m terrible at sticking to things. 

Please let me emphasise, that I have TRIED. I’ve been trying for years, and years. But it’s come to the point where I’ve lost friends, my social circle is decreasing rapidly in size. My mental health, my sleeping pattern, all of these are deteriorating badly, it’s leaving me with brain fog and overall just... a constant sad feeling in my stomach.

650,"Last night me and my bf of 4 1/2 years went out with friends and family last night. As we were leaving the bar/concert everyone did not want us to drive home because we were drunk, I think at least 10 people made sure of it.

His dad drove us back to our house and on the way my bf was freaking out about getting a ride home saying he didn’t need to, he’s grown, yelling and even bringing up personal things between him and his dad, he even threatened to beat his ass, I was in the back trying to keep the peace.

It’s not his first time freaking out because someone didn’t want him to drive drunk, one time he actually made me drive my own car home drunk even though I offered an Uber. He totally will ruin our whole night because of it, he doesn’t have an off switch.

So when his dad dropped us off at home, my bf went into his moms car and took it to the gas station to get cigarettes (again shouldn’t be driving) but I was at home sitting on the toilet talking to my mom - yes I talked about the situation but then our conversation became lighter.

As I’m sitting on the toilet talking to my mom, he gets home opens the bathroom door and starts screaming like a crazy man, opening and closing it. Then I realized - his little brother and sister were staying the night (gma was watching them) they’re both under 10 years old so I get up with my pants still around my ankle and said “stop fucking yelling kids are here”

Then as I get up off the toilet with my pants off my ankle, I’m yelling frustrated at him, stop kids are here but he wouldn’t quit. As I’m trying to walk out of the bathroom he pushes me back in and closes the door, I kept trying to get out and he slammed it multiple times pushing me and the door even ended up hitting me in the forehead.

This is where I got out and pushed him back out of my way and kind of slapped my hands at him trying to get him to stop - not even slapping him but like a doggie slap like get away. as I’m trying to get my pants back up he pushes me over a dresser then into another dresser super hard - I stood up trying to defend myself and he pushed me back down and we just started going at it. Then he put me in an unbelievable, unpredictable choke hold, when I say unpredictable I mean he doesn’t know how to properly do it - he could’ve snapped my neck or killed me - thank god I know self defense and I stood up trying to get aligned with my neck so I wouldn’t pass out. After he let me go I grabbed a belt and was swinging it at him, like that never fucking happened to me in my life to where I thought I might die. I even have bites on my arms, scratches, bruises.

Then I realized my mom was still on the phone and picked my phone up off the floor, she was already half way on her way and called the cops. 
She didn’t want to but she said it was going on for too long and her boyfriend said “Wtf that’s your daughter call the cops”

So the cops came and I made a report, the state pressed charges on him but he wasn’t there, he left on foot so there’s a warrant for him. 

This is not the first time he acted violent but it’s literally been 2 years since he has. Cops got called by the neighbors but I didn’t press charges but this time he almost took my life, I’m sure he didn’t want to but his choke hold was inches off from snapping my neck. 

I just feel like I could’ve prevented this, I could’ve calmed it down, all I’m thinking is did I egg it on? Did I engage in it? Did I make it worse than it would’ve been?",15Dec2019,1

652,"A little background: I am currently in college, and I live with my roommate (let's call her M) in a dorm. This is my second year living with her. During our first year, we became really close friends and did basically everything together. During this first year, she was also in a LDR for about 2-3 years. Their relationship was...interesting? Basically he was very enabling and let her do a lot of things (use dating apps, go on dates, and these other ppl were oblivious to her being in a relationship) even though she says their relationship was exclusive? I did not butt in and just contributed that to her navigating her life and it wasn't my business anyways. Then, after one drunken night, she slept with someone else. I was shocked and she seemed sorry about it too but communicated this to her boyfriend who again was mad but then softened up. I think this was all due to her threatening to break up with him (this was not the first time she threatened that). Over the summer, she broke up with him to get with someone else all within a week. 

This new one was also a LDR. Some things happened and he broke up with her. Within the next couple of days, we drank one night and she slept with one of our mutual friends who I had told her was in a relationship. I believe that this was mostly his fault and not hers but the fact that she didn't confirm or question his relationship was baffling to me. She said it wasn't any of her business to check to see that they were in a closed relationship. This was all communicated to me in a ""i look down on you"" type of voice and I basically told her that I don't want to know anything relating to her personal life because it was too much for me to handle.

Clearly, she has a lot of issues and not only with her personal relationships but with herself too. In the time that I've known her, she has been known by all of our friends to ""go too far"" in drinking and has landed herself in the hospital for concerns about her mental health. I have tried to talk to her about this and, when I couldn't handle it, defaulted to some of our mutual friends. However, everything that surrounds her just seems to be a burden on me, and it has been affecting my mental health after I tried to (and succeeded) in digging myself out of a dark place last year. Lately, everything she does just seems so irritating to me, and I have started to completely ignore her (not like she really talked to me either). 

I am unsure of how to proceed with our friendship because I know she's going through something with her just broken up bf and she's mentally unstable? Other than those pervasive issues, she has been a good friend in the past when our lives were not as busy. I am not sure whether I should just keep doing what I am doing right now and ignoring/avoiding her or if I should reach out more because she is going through a hard time.",15Dec2019,1

I just had food delivered by someone who was very annoying on the phone, obnoxiously asking for directions in the most loud way possible. Or it could have been just regular energy, I'm hung over. That's why I ordered greasy food delivered on Sunday with a food app.

Anyway, I didn't really have to give her directions, she was just screaming into the phone her location and updating me by yelling ""Woohoo! You can do this!"" as she approached the building. After that, she asked me to meet her. I told her that I could meet her downstairs if she entered the building, went down, and she told me that she had put my number into her phone and that she wanted me to call her exclusively when I needed food delivered. I said that I didn't want to set up any side deals, took my food, and went back upstairs.

She called back shortly after and left a voicemail telling me that I looked at her like she was a ""black thief"" and that I was a racist. She told me that she was a former mayor, and was only driving food as a way to pass the time. She told me that her son was chief of police, and that they have standing in the community, and she wants me to know that.

This last point is what I take as a threat. The former stuff was just terrible and baseless accusations - I just didn't want to deal with her this morning so I just took my food and went back to my apartment. No words other than when on the phone, when she asked me to guide her ""I don't know where you are,"" and when she didn't want to come upstairs ""I can meet you downstairs if you come into the building"" and ""I don't want to set up any side deals"" when she wanted to set up a side deal.

But insinuating that she has power because she's a formerly a mayor and that her son's a police chief seems to me as though she is threatening retaliation. I complained to the food app, but don't expect much other than a refund on my tip.

What else can I do to protect myself here? I'm actually a bit concerned about retaliation from police chief son in a misguided attempt to protect his mom. I know that sounds silly, but I've known police to do some fucked up stuff when they feel that they or their family are slighted.

Edit: All of this information was confirmed through Google searches. She gave me her full name on the voicemail, so I knew where to look.",15Dec2019,1
656,"Hello I don’t really know how to start this off but I need you guys advice on this, I’m kind of stuck and I don’t really know what to do. A little bit of backstory here is in summer of 2017 I started going to therapy because of family issues and my mom going threw a nasty divorce. Reason why it was so nasty was because of my dad. My dad had been shortly in and out of my life for as long as I can remember. Honestly if you counted the number of times I’ve actually been with him it would be at least 4 or 5 times (I just turned 14). This was partly because of his job which he worked in Georgia (I live in Florida) ,but hang on this is where it gets really weird, whenever he would come down to “visit me” he’d actually never even stay at the house. My mom many many times would invite him to stay, but he always refused saying he was gonna “stay with a friend.” Which apparently he was actually going to stay with his ex wife and cheat on my mom with her. Also (not important but) I never knew this but he had a lot of kids with this particular ex wife, I think like 3 kids, they’d be in their 30s now. I never even knew he had an ex wife or I should say ex wives because my mom told me that apparently he had a shit ton of ex wives and also this wasn’t the only one he had kids with. Which was a lot to take in for me considering I now have god knows how many half siblings. So anyways years later my mom got a divorce with him for all that and also because he was verbally abusive towards her, always making her feel like complete shit whenever they’d talk, and another reason is because she felt like he was never being a father to me which I think is true. (Sorry that was so long for you guys to read.) Anyways about a year passed and in December of 2018 I felt like I was better and not sad anymore because of that and that I didn’t need therapy another thing to is my mom’s divorce was over and finalized. Lately though I’ve been kind of wanting to go back. I feel like I left too early and honestly I feel like I was just lying to myself, telling myself that I was happy when I really wasn’t. I feel as though I just wanted life to go back to normal so that’s why I stopped going because at the time I didn’t see going to therapy as “normal” which is a totally stupid thought. I really want to go back but my mom says whenever I’m sad I just need to talk to her but I don’t know how. It’s kind of hard to talk to her about things. Sometimes I’ll just feel like I’m on top of the world and I can do anything, but then others I’ll feel like crap for no reason and sometimes I’ll start crying my eyes out for no reason, not because something bad happened or something someone said but I’ll just feel like that for no reason. Most of the time as a coping mechanism I’ll just daydream but it’s getting to the point where I’ll just sit and daydream for hours and it’s kind of messing me up I can control my daydreaming but I don’t want to. How do I explain that to my mom? I feel as though she wouldn’t understand. I don’t even think she wants me to go back to therapy because like I said she wants me to talk to her instead. What do I do guys? I feel helpless.

Summary: some days I’ll feel really happy and on top of the world and then some days I’ll cry my eyes out for no reason and feel bad, and have been using daydreaming as my only coping mechanism. I want to go back to therapy but my mom doesn’t want me to.",15Dec2019,1
658,Hello everyone. I made the wise decision to fly to Toronto Canada with no cad on me. My debit card was just canceled (I thought I lost it so I canceled it). I have American express and my checkbook. Can I get through five days?,15Dec2019,1
659,"Hey guys I’m (16M) and I know I’m going to get some comments saying “oh you’re 16, you are stupid and just a teenager you don’t understand anything.” I don’t care. My parents really annoy me. I love them to death but they are super annoying. Let me give you an example. Yesterday I was coming home from a restaurant. My neighborhood has a speed limit of 25 MPH. I was going a little under that at 23-24. When I got home my parents immediately started to yell at me that I was going too fast and that I needed to slow down. They took my keys for two days (not that big of a deal.) 15 minutes later, my neighbor who was walking her dog at the time I arrived emailed my parents about my fast driving. They extended the punishment to a week and started scaring me that she is going to report me to the police about my “reckless driving” and that i could get into serious trouble and the police will keep an eye on me. I don’t fucking understand! I was going below the speed limit. Fast forward one day and my parents told me they were going shopping and asked if I wanted to come. I said no and I told them I might have a friend come over. They told me that I still wasn’t allowed to drive while they were gone. I agreed and they said they will take my keys with them. (Just for context, this has happened more than once. A few months ago I went to get my sister from the bus stop and a boomer neighbor reported I was going too fast.) My mom said “we still don’t trust you since you got reported a few months ago.” I said “yeah I know it’s ridiculous that someone would report me for going the speed limit. They then got super angry at me, extended the punishment to two months and started yelling and screaming at me, all for saying “yeah I know it’s ridiculous.” My parents are so fucking annoying. I literally can’t say or do anything without being criticized. If I have one spec of dust in my room they yell. It’s over the most stupid shit ever and I can’t do it anymore. It’s always me that is being targeted. They never yell at my siblings. My brother is a complete slob and does nothing but play video games and eat food all day and they have nothing against him. I feel like I can’t ask or say anything to them. Even once when I forgot to take out the trash they yelled at me right in front of my two friends and embarrassed the shit outta me. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I know this won’t be possible but when I turn 18 I want to move out so I don’t have to hear this bullshit again.",15Dec2019,1

Anyway, my fiancé and I have had a difficult time getting our wedding plans locked down due to a couple of unforeseen circumstances with my family. We had a date set, but my dad was diagnosed with stage IV cancer. My fiancé and I decided it would be best if we cancelled our big wedding and just have something small with close friends and family, that way my parents wouldn’t need to stress about financially helping with our big wedding while my dad is going through treatment. 
We had shared the news about my dad early on to just very close family. We asked my fiancé’s dad not to disclose the information to anyone. My dad doesn’t want people to know what he’s dealing with right now, and said he would share it when he was ready. We assumed my future FIL respected those wishes. 
When we rescheduled our wedding, we asked him not to let any of the extended family know what the new plans were. My fiancé and I felt that we owed our original guest our own explanation and I wanted to find the best way to tell them while respecting my dad’s wishes of not letting people know what he’s going through. 
My fiancé was ready to tell his extended family our plans, and I asked him to check with his father to see if he has said anything. When we asked, he acted completely oblivious to the fact that we asked him not to say anything to anyone about my dad’s cancer or our new wedding plans. He said he didn’t understand why it needed to be a secret and that my dad’s cancer is his(FIL) business, too. When I told him I felt like he disrespected me, my fiancé and my family, he said he was going to cancel the wedding and will not be joining. 
I told him that’s not what we want, we just wanted him to understand what he did wrong. He still cancelled and informed everyone he will not be there.

668,"Please, please, please, give me whatever advice you can here. I literally no one to turn to.

My life is an utter mess right now. At university for the third time and probably drop out. What has caused me the other times to drop out, is I struggled with the university life as I was lacked motivation, and had zero skills (my parents are alcoholics and never emphasized any routine, hard work, or taught us any of the ""basics"" I guess), I had a hard time forming relationships, and was quite depressed. 

At the age of 18 during school, I used this drug called Modafinil to help me catch up with the fact I was so far behind as my mum got ill. It worked fantastically well. I got brilliant grades, and it was largely because of that drug. I was using it in moderation. Stopped when the year was over.

...but then about a year later, I came back to it. And at this point I started looking for other drugs that could ""aid"" me. If I felt anxious, take X. Meeting someone for the first time? Meet Y. Tired or need to re-adust sleeping pattern? Take Z. To cut a long story short, the last three years anytime I need to \*do something\*, I've needed a drug of sometime. There have been periods, where I have gone home &amp; traveled extensively, where I don't turn to them. But the last couple of months it has got to the point where even when I'm at home, I'm taking drugs sat in my room for no apparent reason.

My issue is, I want to be honest with my family about all of this. Largely to create a sense of accountability to people. They love me, and aren't the type to get get mad, the issues I have though are:

\- I don't want to worry them. I don't want my Gran to be texting me if I'm quiet 'cos she's scared something has happened 

\- I don't want them to look at me as ""an addict"" or a different person and all the connotations that come with that.

\- And finally, what I'm struggling with most - is the awkwardness. All over our family it feels like there is a sense of not really talking too much about sensitive or awkward conversations. I'm gay, my family accept it... but it's still not spoke about. There's a culture of just ""burying things"" I think and not being too open, even though they're accepting people.

I'm a team lead software engineer at a fairly large company with a salary in the low 200k range, I speak 2 languages and am just starting my 3rd and I spend like 2-3 hours away in the gym. (cardio, weights, stretching... etc).

Outsite of this time I'm usually reading up on stuff for work, or for personal projects as I want to start my own company one day.

Obviously all of this comes at the cost of maintaining a fairly rigid schedule and I spend most days without a single social interaction. I try and spend at least one weekend day with friends (I do have a fair big friend group and 2 or 3 quite close friends), but find that most of the time I'm with these people i'm just thinking about work or not really enjoying myself anyway and have a really hard time being \*present\* in these group events.

671,"Hello internet, I have decided to reach out to you for some advice from different perspective of lives.

For a bit of a background, I started doing odd jobs after graduating as I wasn't really a great student in uni so I didn't think I could get to anywhere. At that point of time my aim was to get more life experiences and pay my monthly rent living in a city. After hopping a few jobs, I managed to secure a 1 year contract with an MNC. I did okay so I managed to get myself employed as a full timer and in all honesty, this company has helped me grow a lot and with a relocation opportunity, I managed to move to a different country and just from the currency alone, my pay increased exponentially. I struggled quite a lot at work as the job requirement is to be more on the analytical side and that did not bode well with my Public Relations background. The job made me feel stupid but I somehow managed to get by because it enabled me to send more money back home to support my family with my mum dealing with terminal illness. 

As the job role changed, I moved to a different company and continued to delve more into the analytical side of the business. As I wasn't really good at my job, I was just merely getting by with the day to day so I was just helping the company to move on with the operation but not enough to bring exponential value to the company during its growth stage. Somehow I wasn't fired from my job so I continued for another 3 years here. As the business expanded, we hired more people to join me. As the new hires start killing the job, I'm really happy that they brought the business to a new height but I also felt saddened that the company could have experienced the revolution a lot earlier and I wasn't capable enough to be like them.

Fast forward, the role continued to make me feel worthless as a human being and I am starting to think of moving downwards so that I can work i something that is more of my caliber. While I welcome the idea of reduced paycheck in exchange of getting on a different career track, I'm not sure if I should give up my current job just because I feel stupid. Then again, I don't want to waste anyone's time anymore and want to be more realistic with what I can really do (and after trying for 3 years, I'm still not apt to be detail oriented, innovative and analytical as I should be). I'm stucked for any promotion since I have stagnated in my growth and I don't see myself getting better. My mum has also passed away two years ago so that has further killed my motivation to stay for the pay but I do not want to be irresponsibly rash since I still want to be able to support my family financially. My partner recommended that I stick on the job a little longer so that I save more money before I get back to my own country. But at this point I'm very embarrassed for sticking around in the company as new hires were definitely more useful than me so I feel like I should know my place and leave. 

As a very lost individual, I would really like to get some new perspectives. Should I persist or should I move on to a different job but with lower pay? Thank you!",15Dec2019,1
672," Hey all!

This text can be a bit long (sorry for my bad english)

Okay so.. I have this friend who is 35 years old. We have known each other for a long time.

He wanted me to help him to find a girlfriend almost since the beginning of our friendship.

He is diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome so things can be hard for him to do.

Anyways. I've tried everything to help him. I've tried to understand him and tell him that he needs to practice on his social skills. And I know its hard for him. The only thing he says is that he does not know how to do stuff, how to talk to people and so. I've told him how, and he tells me that he can't do it. Like small talk.. He does not understand the concept of small talk. I know its hard for him to understand and master that, but im telling him how to do and what to do. Because he constantly asks me what he needs to do to get better and what he needs to do to find a women in his life.

The thing is also.. I told him that many people told me that he looks scary and that he is awkward because of the way he looks and acts.

So I advised him to slowly change his style. The only thing he wants to wear now is a pair of press fold pants(black) a white shirt and when its cold outside a suit vest. he does not have much hair on his head, and he wears glasses.

Ive told him that he can improve the style. He can look stylish anyways without the press folded pants. Now he looks like an old man. ive told him he can change to a bit more stylish glasses and so on and so on. Anyways I understand that its hard for him to do that because he does not feel good in other clothes.

So then we talked about how to talk to other people and what other people does not think is awkward.

I tell him to ""fake it untill you make it"" and everybody knows what that means, and Ive told him what that means, but he is stuck on that he is lying if he is faking to be a person he is not. And that is not even the point.

Every girl he asked on a date, has rejected him. I've tried soooo much more than this , and all the time with the thing in my mind that he is having a hard time with some stuff.. But whatever I tell him to do, he tell me that ""its now the way people do it""

He wants me to go out with him to the pub and push him to talk to girls but I cant be his wingman (im a woman)

Also.. He has never been with a girl before.

Well... if you have any tips.. welcome to share them with me.. Please dont be judgemental.",15Dec2019,1

My husbands sister and I started off almost hating each other when I first started dating her brother. Eventually, as the year’s went by we started to get along. We have a pretty good relationship, She calls me for anything and everything BUT even though we have a decent relationship, I can’t seem to trust her as much as she does me. Throughout the years I’ve realized that she is manipulative, is quick to anger, expects everyone to do everything for her and is the kind to not be happy for any of my accomplishments. I’ve constantly been pushing myself to work harder to please her because I’ve always wanted the “perfect sister-in-law relationship.” 

Extremely long story short, she has two kids and lives with her mom (my MIL). They’ve been having issues because of my sister-in-law and how she takes advantage of their mother. They drag my husband into everything and he feels responsible to make peace. I tell him that it’s not his responsibility and that they are grown woman and can figure it out themselves. I want to slowly retreat myself from her toxicity but don’t know how without making it a big deal... any advice?",15Dec2019,1
674,"To start off, I never have cheated and I don't plan on doing so. It's just so hard to fight the urge. I was raped about 2 years ago by a close friend, and I'm still not coping too well. It has made it incredibly difficult for me to be intimate with my partner. I just don't really know what to do anymore.

We relocated from a big city to a small rural area because of my partner's job. The closest therapists who take my insurance are (or just any therapists in general) are 50 miles away. There are no support groups at all. I thought about seeking help from a church but they don't really have any groups that meet. I'm not religious so this idea of using a church makes me feel horrible. I feel so lost and helpless. Often times with the rape and the relocating I feel like I have no control over my life anymore. 

I don't want to cheat, but I keep getting these urges which are becoming increasingly hard to manage. I don't know who to reach out to. I lost all my friends after my rape and don't really have anyone to talk to. My SO is extremely open-minded but this is something I just can't bring myself to talk to him about. I feel like this would just hurt him so much. 

Reddit if you have any advice at all I would so appreciate it. I feel like my life is just existing pointlessly with all of these constant conflicting thoughts. Is there anyone with a similar experience? I just want to get better.",15Dec2019,1
675,"My brother has always had issues. We suspected autism but he was never diagnosed, and I was always sympathetic. He used to become very violent when drunk or annoyed. He disappeared off the radar aged around 26 and I have only recently heard from him. Turns out he has had no gas or electricity since July. He's about to be kicked out by his landlord due to failing to go to the jobcentre. So I took him in and tried to sort it out.
  First night we had a nice meal and a drink and everything was ok. Next day both a bit hungover, I stayed in bed watching tv on my phone. He went past my room several times during the day and paused and stared at me through the crack in the door. Ff two days - he drinks all night. I get up early for my sons assembly and my brother hasn't slept all night and is drunk (11 beers). He goes on and on about joking about rape. Then about knowing a rapist. Then about his 'dick' then about my gag reflex during oral sex. He's shouting, making very lewd gestures, and tries to intimidate me.
I try for several days to put it behind us but I can't look at him the same way so when apart I text him and tell him to stay at his, and explain why. Next day he messages me on fb saying he knew a rapist and he psychologically bullied him. I say 'I know'. His response is 'you know I did what?'
  Frankly, there is something creepy about him. I saw an artists sketch of a rapist in the local paper months ago and thought it looked like my brother then felt guilty. Now I wonder. I didn't feel safe around him and don't want him here, but ai feel awful sending him back to a flat with no gas or electricity in winter. Am I wrong?",15Dec2019,1
676,"So I'm going to refer to my friend as Jane in this post.  I've been pretty good friends with Jane since freshmen year of college (we're both seniors now) , but recently it seems as of she doesnt want to be around me as much.  The first situation happened on Halloween as she told me that her and her apartment mates were throwing a party.  I should have checked in with Jane the day before but I didnt and the day of I asked them when I should head over for the party. But then she told me that they decided against having the party and instead shes going to one of her friend's. 

 She didnt invite me to tag along so I basically was all by myself on Halloween as that was my plan.  I had another friend attending another party, but they're really popular so I knew that they'd be surrounded by other people and I'd feel really awkward and alone and I have terrible anxiety, so I decided against having going.  Knowing that I was planning on Jane's party, it felt like she just left me hanging by not telling me that they weren't having it anymore, and made it even worse that she was going to another party and didnt invite me knowing that I was all by myself.  I know that no one has an obligation to invite me anywhere but I would have done the same for her.  I wouldnt want her to be alone.  

Then near Thanksgiving before everyone went on break, her and some people from her freshman hall had a dinner.  Not everyone who went was part of their freshman hall and some people invited some other friends outside the hall group to tag along. I know a lot of people in this group as I've hung out with them before and I get along with them pretty well.  She randomly mentioned this to me and I thought it was weird that she would mention this and not invite me, basically evoking some FOMO.  Again, I know that there is no obligation for her to include me, but it just felt like I was unwanted.  

Lastly, they're having a holiday party tomorrow which, again, she mentions to me but leaves me out.  Again, I know everyone in this group and I think I fit in pretty well.  

I'm the kind of person who likes to include people and make them feel wanted.  I definitely wouldnt mention something fun without offering the person to come if they wanted to, especially when they know and get along with the group, so this is why this behavior is so confusing to me.  I'm a vegan so theres the possibility that she would be concerned about me being at a place where animal products are being consumed but I'm not militant about it at all and wouldnt chastise other people and she knows this.  Also, she sometimes takes me to my therapy appointments which I appreciate so much but further makes me confused.  I appreciate that she does this for me, but I get the idea that I'm more of a chore to her even though she says she doesnt mind and I try to pay her back for taking me.  We hang out sometimes and study together so she doesnt hate being around me but still I'm confused why she keeps mentioning these things and leaving me out knowing full well that I struggle with loneliness and depression, though I present as very positive.  Am I being overly sensitive about this or am I justified in feeling sad and hurt?",15Dec2019,1
677,"I've had an online friendship with this person for 5 years. We've even met in person a few times! After I  became friends with another writer (we met through a forum for creative writers), everything started going downhill- my friend instantly made friends with her too, started constantly asking if I was talking to the other girl. If I was, she'd immediately start talking to her, too. It's like she can't fathom that she and I can talk without having to butt herself into the conversation (and she literally has, by asking me what we're talking about and then messaging the other girl about the exact thing). She'd make comments about the other girl liking me most, about my forgetting about my friend of 5 years for this new girl, etc etc. If I don't respond to a message from my older friend before I respond to the new one, it becomes a whole moody ordeal. I'm so exhausted.

I spoke to this friend countless times that I don't appreciate her jealousy, that she needs to work on her issues, that her difficulty with my separate friendship with this new girl is /her/ problem and not my responsibility. In the beginning, I asked: how can I make you more comfortable? What can I do to prevent things from getting negative? But now it's clear that there's very little winning- I've gotten conflicting directions from her and it feels like everything I do is a problem.

Now, I'm finding myself resentful and annoyed with this old friend and, oddly, unwilling to interact much with the new one. It bothers me so much that the new friend has no idea how immaturely and toxically my old friend is behaving in response to her. I see them interact on social media and I feel a real frustration because their friendship feels like it's being built at the expense of my sanity! Help? What should I do, if talking hasn't worked?",15Dec2019,1

Now I'm lying there in bed thinking someone's under my freaking bed. I check under my bed to get rid of my fears. I do fine alone when lights are on but it's scary when I turn the lights completely off, I don't like to keep my night lamp on, hurts my eyes while sleeping. I could just sleep with others, but ya know I stay up late *and uhhh... ya know...*. ;) so that's not an option.

I don't mind the dark (not pitch black, can see) as I can see what's in front of me, it's just that  I can't see what's under the bed (scare of the unknown).

So anyways, I've neen picking the skin off my lip since as long as I can remember. It's constant, my lips are always cracked, bleeding, or just red from irritation. I apply chapstick/lip balm probably over 100 times a day to try and keep myself from picking, but I always just keep rubbing my lips together and wearing it away within minutes just to continue picking or reapplying chapstick. On top of that is I leave the skin in my mouth and suck on it for hours (this is the most embarrassing part that I've never admitted to anyone before) so it's also an oral fixation.

The longest I've ever gone without picking at my lip was a month. And that's just because I asked my girlfriend to make me stop if she ever sees it. But now I just go into another room or just wait until she leaves.. I swear I'm even doing it in my sleep.

692,"So I know this seems a bit minor, but here goes.

A little backstory, this girl and me (I'm female too) were best friends since we were about 3-4 years old. Fast forward to when we're 9-10 years old and I move 4-5 hours away. We try and keep contact every so often, and each summer holiday I go see her and she comes and sees me, however this past summer we didn't since we were both very busy. The last time we talked/when we were visiting eachother we got on well. We're on good terms (or at least I hope we are).

We haven't talked in months, and I've been wanting to catch up with her for a while now, so I messaged her about an hour ago, she opens it and doesn't respond.

I've been pretty worried for months now that she doesn't like me or something since we haven't talked in ages and she hasn't reached out to me (I know I am at fault since I didn't either), but now I'm sort of upset since she hasn't responded despite seeing my message.

Is it okay for me to feel upset about this? Should I send another message?

Semi related note: I do keep in more regular contact with another friend that I had when I was living there. 
I am also friends with some of her (the ex best friend) friends as I see them when I'm visiting, and she is friends with some of mine, although there isn't really any regular contact with them. There is no discourse between any of us.",15Dec2019,1
693,"My (F18) parents have been together since my mum was 23 and he was 19. I am 18, and I was born when my mother was in her early 40s. I am their only child. 

I have no idea how they’ve lasted this long. My dad drinks every single night (I don’t know if that classifies as an alcoholic), whereas my mum now only drinks for special occasions. My mum quit smoking in her 20s, my dad is still a chain smoker now. They don’t sleep in the same bed, and my mum sleeps downstairs on the sofa because he snores and kicks in his sleep. He rarely offers to switch. 

My mum is the sweetest woman I have ever met. She does absolutely everything and anything for me and this man. She is out of work at the moment and spends all of her time doing favours for my cousins or looking after all of us. She is lovely and beautiful, and I have absolutely no problems with her. I truly believe she is perfect. 

My dad can be nice. He is an estate agent, and he’s very well known around town. He supports us through his income fairly well. He is quite smart, and seems to be very funny with his friends. Other than that, I do not really like him. 

He barely speaks to me or my mum. He spends his time on his phone/iPad on Facebook, and if I try to talk to him he is “doing work”. It has been this way since I was little. He knows next to nothing about my life, because he never asks and I never have the opportunity to talk to him—he doesn’t know the names of my friends, he has no idea how I’m doing in college, he has no idea who I am as a person. 

He gets angry, too. Sure, me and my mum fall out as well—we’ve both said some things we didn’t mean, especially me. But I apologise every time I do, and the worst I’ve ever done is told her to fuck off while I was having a panic attack, something I regret to this day. But my dad is something else. 

I now have a lock on my bedroom door because I do not like him coming in to it sometimes. I have depressed days, and I have panic attacks occasionally. Whenever I experience either of these things, he is prone to coming in to my room with no knocking, despite me telling him to leave me. On multiple occasions I have asked him to leave because it is upsetting me to have someone else around me, and he has responded with anger, and most recently he told me to “(oh) fuck off” and slammed my door on his way out, genuinely just because I asked him to go. He pushes my mum once every few months, he has shouted at us too many times to count, and he has hurt me a handful of times in my life (digging nails in, punching me on the arm). 

To make it all worse, he never apologises. The best I have every received is a sorry look and a kind-of-joking “sorry..” with him smiling because he knows I have to forgive him anyway. Never once have I felt an apology was genuine, nor an apology that was over three words. He has never examined his actions and told me why he knows they were wrong, or has he EVER learnt from his mistakes. 

Now, I know some people will advice they break up. But my mum is 57—she has loved this man since the 80s. I don’t think she could ever recover from it. We also have most, if not all, of our income from him, and everybody in our tiny towns knows and respects him as some kind of celebrity. 

I don’t know what to do. Me and my mum are clearly far too scared of what he would do if we told him he needs help. I’m 18, I’ll be going to Uni in the next couple of years—I don’t know if I could leave her to live alone with him when he is so unpredictable.

I feel slightly awkward around straight women as I grew up around people who used to make negative comments about lesbians, and this has made me feel cautious about befriending people outside of my comfort zone.

The colleague has told me that she has no friends in the country, as she is also from somewhere else. Perhaps I am reading into this too much but she may have been hinting.

Generally I don’t look for my friends amongst work colleagues, but I feel that in this particular country, I will struggle to make friends outside of work, as I struggle with the (dialect of the) local language.

My most recent girlfriend and I broke up earlier this year due to personal differences but decided to stay friends as we still enjoy each others presence.

It's been months and I can't help myself to get depressed, jealous, angry, if she even speaks to another guy. I can't stand the idea, if were together or not. It disturbs me that I feel this way. I can't help but be possessive and feel that I'm the only one that should talk to her. Worried things will go well with another guy and she'll be with him.

It's obvious that I still have feelings for her, I feel like I'm still in love with her, I am still in love with her. We talked and sort of got closure and I'm working on it, but these feelings still haven't changed with me just recently feeling this way when she spoke about a guy.

I think it's best that I stop being friends with her, but I want this to change. What if it happens again? I'm friends with an ex in the future and I continue to feel this way. I don't want to keep going like this.

709,Can’t stop distracting myself finals in 18 hours,15Dec2019,1
710,"Before you say that I’m a snitch, let me give you a little backstory. 

My friend (let’s call her Q)  snuck out of the house with another girl and a boy on a school night. 

If you were to meet my friend, you would be just as surprised as I was to see that she did it. She’s a mostly straight-A student. My mother was also surprised she did it. 

Q and I have been fighting these past couple weeks. She broke up with her boyfriend (for the second time) and then asked for him back after I asked her, repeatedly, if she was sure this was the right decision. She was adamant about it. Anyway, she’s extremely pig-headed and immature. I’ve talked to her several times about what she is doing is wrong or immature, but she never listened. She gets mad very easily, and takes offense to everything, constantly trying to one up me. 
 
Basically, she stayed out until at least 2:30 am. The girl front she was with (Y) posted on her story with time stamps. Being the freak I am, I recorded it on another friends phone and have the video. I then messaged Y asking how their parents let them stay up that late, and she responded with 
“we don’t ask permission. We just do it”
Anyway, I then decided her mom had to know this. It’s her daughter. Who knows what else she could be doing? 

You may think that at this point I am portraying myself as a goody two shoes. I am not. I have done pretty bad stuff in my life, however, I matured (somewhat, I still think bathroom humor is funny) HOWEVER I would never sneak out of the house or do anything of the sort. I am not a saint. Keep that in mind. I’m concerned for both my friends academic status and health. I just want to help her. 

I do think that telling her mom would be the best thing. I can guarantee telling her straight up that what she did was not okay WILL NOT WORK. I have tried that. 

The only option I see now is telling her parents. How do I do that without seeming like a snitch (even though I am) and staying out of trouble I might get into? 

I understand that by telling her mother our friendship is over. I understand. 

I understand that I seem like a bitch doing this. I am. And there is an itty-bitty ounce of revenge attached to this. 

Please, bear with me here. Shoot some ideas my way. 

Anything will be appreciated.",15Dec2019,1

714,"I can't think of anything I want as a Christmas present. Probably because I'm depressed, not suicidal but still rather low right now. All of the things I know that will help me improve are things I need to do for myself, and don't require any special equipment. 
I'm completely socially isolated, overweight etc and my mother died last year. I have some plans in place to help myself get through/over this, and I'm going to be okay eventually.
I have games and books I've not yet finished even though I enjoy them. No active hobbies at the moment but all the art and craft material I could possibly need short of a kiln, which I know I couldn't afford to run. I have a great bike I never use but really should, and musical instruments I  haven't played in a long time. I don't want jewellery or anything like that because my mother left me hers and I still can't bring myself to actually go through her things since she died - neither can the rest of the family.
 I have 2 family members who want to buy me presents and so far all I thought of is a pair of slippers, which I'm told is boring. They're right, too. I'm going to enjoy buying gifts for them, and am planning to make something for my grandma. But I can't think of a damn thing to ask for for myself. And as much as I enjoy giving gifts (which is a lot), I 100% will feel sad and sorry for myself if I get slippers as my only present.

718,"This will be a little long I suppose.

For context: My girlfriend is asian, I'm european. We met while both being abroad in another country for a year. We both had ""deadlines"" which by coincidence were basically identical. In this time being together we grew extremely close, closer than we both ever expected or experienced previously.   
When time was up, by coincidence I happened to have another kinda program in China for the upcoming year. The whole situation led us to continuing the relationship, on distance. She lives in another country very close to China. I had a distance relationship before and would usually always advise against it. But she gave me a completely new mindset in that regard. Things were still pretty good.   
Then, as consequence of a completely unrelated story that took place in China, I had to leave early. Indeed I ended up moving in with my girl then. And man did I have the best time of my life. We felt so ready for this. Her family was so lovely and welcoming. I felt like part of it from the first time I met them. I was taking language classes, I was about to take a little nice job, we explored the country together. 

Well, then my foot happened. Out of the blue extreme pain. The doctor said its this and that and I realized my insurance won't deal with that. Had to leave, go back to Europe. I'm waiting for surgery. It will render me useless until April 2020. Moved back in at Mom's, can't work, can't attend university because of shit timing.  


Now we're here. My girlfriend had a difficult time lately. The distance is really bad. After a month of being apart she shows basically every sign of depression and anxiety. She said she feels totally empty, she's late to work every day, she has nightmares, gains weight and today she confessed to me she realised she is suicidal. She told me she thinks of crashing into a car lately. I never saw this coming, she was the happiest, easy going person I ever had the pleasure meeting. I try my best, convinced her to try therapy and encouraged her to speak to her sister, who dealt with depression before. She doesn't want, though, and feels she's bothering people. I try to make her understand that she's needed and that there are ups and downs and things will get better once we can move back together. But I fear now she won't pick up the phone anymore one day or that she does something stupid while I'm sleeping. I am helpless. I want to cry when I see her. What the hell can I do",15Dec2019,1

731,"I live in an apartment house and have had problems with these neighbors from downstairs (man and woman, ages around 20 - 28) for over a year now. Much of their actions could be counted as harassment, however I've found it hard to get proper evidence of their actions.  In general, I've always tried to be reasonable with them and have tried to discuss with them but they just keep denying the problem from me.

I have pretty much learned to cope with their behavior and have just lived normal life by myself however recently I've noticed very weird behavior from them that makes me feel like they are trying to frame me for stalking them. Here's some examples:

* I come home from work and go to kitchen to get some snacks. I hear my neighbor chatting loudly through the vent and then immediately I hear loud banging from their apartment just below me, the chatting stops and they leave their apartment. This has recurred at least 2 times.
* When I'm leaving my apartment for e.g. work / shop It's like the neighbor is waiting for me to leave my apartment and the woman immediately darts from her apartment seeming like I'm following her (No doubt they can hear when I'm leaving my apartment since they live below me). Once I noticed her filming at my car from the bus stop with her phone. Another day her or the guy was waiting for me in a car and immediately started driving when i was leaving with my car. One time the woman left with her car just before me and did a dangerous looking u-turn ""to get away from me"". (Have to admit I'm not 100% sure about these).

I started suspecting of the framing because one day i noticed weird looks and behavior from multiple women at my work. For example i was leaving work, this woman gives me weird look, and and she weirdly turned back when she realized we were both heading to the parking space. I haven't experienced anything like this before and i find it hard to believe I'm that scary looking.

In general I'm quite shy and haven't been able to ask anyone if they have heard any rumors. Also the situation does sound quite delusional and I have no proofs whatsoever so I don't know how i should ask HR or my boss.

I don't understand their motives but it does seem they are trying to get me to move away or just trying to get back at me for something I don't know I've done. Clearly there is some kind of jealousy or bitterness in the air. The problem is I live alone and don't really have people come over and they are 2 people so it definitely makes things harder for me.

So, any ideas what i should do? the options i have though of so far:

* try to discuss with the neighbor one more time
* tell myself that I'm paranoid, do nothing and see if anything happens
* Tell my boss (or HR) about my gut feeling
* Ask just the coworkers
* Ask just HR
* Just move elsewhere (not preferred)

If i were to lose my job because of such rumors then I think it would be too late for me to prove otherwise. I well know I haven't done anything wrong so i wouldn't be afraid to contact the police about this if found to be true. Also, wouldn't such case count as ""Defamation of character ""? What would i need to prove it?",15Dec2019,1

745,"Hello! I'm a female and I turned 18 recently, but I've never been in a relationship. It's not that no one wanted to go on a date with me, but it just never worked out.

The reason it didn't work out is because I'm a top, which means that even the thought of being penetrated turns me off. Since everyone who asked me out is probably a top too (they were masculine men) I didn't want to risk getting into a relationship just for it to be ruined by sex later on. I'm into women as well but never had a chance to meet any lesbian/bi ones.

A bit more than a week ago, my friend suggested to introduce a guy to me. She told me that not only is he a very sweet guy, he's open to try EVERYTHING in bed. Without giving it any deeper thought I immediately agreed, and she sent him a message asking him if he's interested in meeting me; he said yes. (She didn't tell him anything about my kinks or my sexual position since she knows he's going to be interested and it's something he would discover later on if things work out). The first two times we met were at my friend's house with another person, so we could get used to each other's presence before going out on our own.

Two days ago we met on our own outside, just chatting. So far everything was going great, the conversation was going well, we had a lot of stuff in common, had an overall similar world view, and I was attracted to him physically. I still didn't develop any feelings and didn't feel any huge spark, but I could definitely see how things can work between us. He told my friend that he was really excited about me and wanted to spend time with me, so everything was still going great.

However, after some time, I felt like something was wrong. It's not that I felt uncomfortable with him, but I felt uncomfortable with the situation I was in.

Half a year ago I started to explore the kinky lifestyle a lot more than I used to on the internet. I found unusual videos, forums for kinky people, made friends, etc. I felt the need to go out and explore that world for myself and not just through the internet, getting a taste of everything- from small group meetings on how to tie someone up to participating in a gang bang while at a BDSM dungeon.

Now one week into meeting him I'm having doubts because of a reason that can make me look like a disgusting person. It seems that I'm giving up on someone that I'm into just because I want to ""just"" have casual sex with other people- and I'm still a virgin with zero experience in anything! Doesn't that make me look like a player and a scum? Sure, I can get into a relationship with him, but I'm strictly monogamous and extremely against sexual contact with other people(/cheating).

I don't want to have thoughts about other people when I'm with him, but I can't promise that it won't happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should I do??** 

Should I break it off right now and give up on my first relationship ever with someone who is not only sweet but fits me in bed too? Such a person is rare in my country, and I can't move to another one for a few years, so I might have to wait for a few years for my first relationship EVER. 

Or should I give it a chance? I might end up liking the guy a lot more than I thought I would. However, I might always have these thoughts of exploring the lifestyle in the back of my head, making me feel constantly anxious. I'm planning for a long term relationship, so it might even last for a few years, delaying my plans.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming he really is into me and is willing to go forward with this, I think my choice can greatly impact how my life is going to be. I'm so lost, I'm so ashamed, and I feel so much like shit.

I'm hoping someone can offer me even the slightest bit of advice as soon as possible. :(",15Dec2019,1

I've been paranoid and insecure, clingy, stressing about every little thing everyone says and does. I can't communicate properly and I upset people because I can't say the right things and while I need someone to support and be here I'm worried I'll stress them out and I already have stressed them out.

My escapism has been off the charts and I've been longing to go on some magic adventure thinking it'll get me away from myself and everything I've been feeling, when it's usually just me wanting to go and explore somewhere I haven't been. I've been watching Disney movies to cope but its really only making me jealous. When I'm not at work, out with friends, or keeping myself busy I practically shut down. I have no motivation, patience, or really any emotion. But when that happens it's so easy to throw me off and I suddenly become that numb kind of depressed. I'm tired of finding constant things to do but I don't want to fall into that empty state. 

Its worn down on my relationship, broken off an entire friend group and caused tension in my home.

A lot of drama happened that caused a friend group to split. I was never directly involved, I mediated conversations occassionally and I just watched the garbage fire go up in flames. But everyone was so stressed by what happened it just broke us up. And that really took a toll on my mental state, and I'm upset by it because it was two weeks ago. It caused a rift between my girlfriend and I, and since she's in a shit state(she was directly involved and recieved a lot of the blunt end for no reason) she can't be there for me and also has a shorter social limit and patience. Which didnt help my paranoia and caused us to argue because I dont know what the fuck is going on and neither does she. I've been extremely clingy towards her as she's pretty much the only person I can feel normal around but she's been impatient with my antics and needs a lot of physical space to heal and it's been clashing a lot.

My family has been at odds because I've done things they dont approve of and my parents surprised me with a ""new"" car my dad picked up at a lot auction. The car runs like ass, and I have to pay for the repairs(which I agreed to) but literally everything is wrong with it. I've had to take out nearly 3/4 my savings to fix it, delaying my plan to move out within the next year or so and ridding of any other road trip plans etc. I've honestly been resenting my dad for it, who in turn is guilting the fuck out of me about it and that I should be glad he isn't making me pay for the work he's doing for it. Which I definitely am because I know he knows what he's doing and that I dont have to shell out the remainder of my savings for it. But every single time I say like I was able to buy my friends presents for christmas he'd flip and say ""oh but you had trouble paying for the $400 tires?"" when I literally picked them up a small and inexpensive item, or bark at me whenever I ask when the car will be done because I'm sick of biking to and from work in the cold. My mom isn't stepping up for me like she usually would, and its worrying me that maybe I am being selfish and a bad child.

I'm just really tired of causing fuck ups and wishing I could do the right thing for the first time in a month instead of causing more issues because I feel desperate for validation or because I'm paranoid and need to be reassured a million fucking times. I do have a therapist but she's sick this week and had to cancel. I don't know what to do right now and I feel like a lost kid. I need to know how to keep myself together right now.

751,"I started university this year. My first “group of friends” wasn’t that great so I and another friend “changed” groups. We haven’t changed at all because it has been a recent chance. 

So there’s a guy in this new group the “leader” who I think now doesn’t like me. At first, He was kind and when I asked to do a work group with them and he had no problem. 

He was kind and talkative but now is like he avoids me. He doesn’t look me in the eye when I talk to him. Before we could chat perfectly now it’s me who always begins the conversation. I asked him twice to come to study with me the first time and the second time with another friend. Both times he told me: Maybe I’ll drop at the library.  But he never came. 

Another situation was when one of his friends wanted to sear in the front table near my friend and I but he  stayed on his side and didn’t want to. ( The friend came)

I noticed he looks at me in class when we are far away. I smile at him so he could like me but he just makes a nervous smile.

Well cut to now, turns out he's going to be visiting the 24th and 25th. And that would be fine, but I know my mom is going to be really upset. She'll be yelling about how her Christmas is ruined, tell me I'm a bad kid and an enemy to her. She'll probably also say that she's dizzy and /or feeling sick and /or going to have a heart attack.

765,"Hi all

So I(27,m) started this job around 8 months ago. I have one direct subordinate (there are others but they're irrelevant here)

We have very similar roles and sit right next to each other. We work very closely together and always go on smoke breaks together. I'll even say I developed a little crush on her, and if she weren't 15 years older than me, married and with 3 kids, I would've maybe wanted to act on it as some point.

Last week another department approached her, and told her that they wanted her to join the team. On the same day, I found out her current role will likely be gone within a few months because a client dropped out at the last minute.

She decided to take the job because I told her she might lose hers soon but I'm still trying to figure out how im gonna go with my day to day without her

Other than the workload, which will be too much for me to handle, I will miss my only friend in the office and the person I talk to the most in general


She's going to be in the same office but different floors, we'll likely still go out for smokes together for a while, I'm worried that will eventually fade. Also there will be new people working with her and she'll make new friends while I'm stuck at the same place with no one

766,"First I’ll say I’ve wanted to be a comedian my whole life I’ve been preparing for it forever I’d listen to stand up instead of music blah blah blah I’ve pretty much been obsessing over comedy for 20 years (my age) it’s the only thing I’ve ever wanted to do with my life and I’m gonna do it, that much isn’t negotiable but I can’t decide whether it’s worth it for me to go to college or not  

The reasons I would want to go is:  
-You can’t solely rely on standup to make it so having a degree in writing might open up more avenues than just my standup would  
-I kind of feel like I’m wallowing away constantly being at home rather than out having a good time meeting new people and getting new experiences  
-Id go to a college in a city with a comedy scene so I can start doing standup as the same time as college  
-Being funny and being smart are pretty directly correlated and most comedians went to college so I feel like it’s the right thing to do  
-I can make money with jobs that aren’t “break back” jobs  
-And this would be more of a side benefit rather than a reason but people would stop giving me looks of pity &lt;which really bothers me  

The reasons I shouldn’t go is:  
-I don’t NEED it unlike other professions  
-I can pretty much learn anything I’d need to know by reading books  
-It costs so much money I don’t have and will definitely need, rn I’m debt free which is awesome and I’m reluctant to change that

768,"My cousin lost their job a few years ago and hasn't had a job in years. But, it has got to the point where without us, they would be on the streets and sleeping in their car.

So, my Mother offered our place to stay for a few days. Our cousin has now been here for 2 months now and seems to have no intention of moving. It is getting closer and closer to Christmas and none of us really want him here for Christmas. Not because we don't like him but rather because we all want our own space now and Christmas is probably the only time of year our family gets to see each other properly. Him being here is also putting huge stress on my Mother, she's a huge worrier and constantly worries about what he's doing, whether he's awake, whether he's going to get a job etc.

My parents feel guilty because they think he's going to feel sad that he hasn't got as many presents as us on Christmas day (Sounds stupid - I know). We've not been as close as we probably should have been to our cousin and for this reason I and my 2 siblings (5 members in our family already - living in a small house) feel awkward around the house because we don't really know what to say to him. It's the same for my parents too. We shouldn't really feel like this in our own house.

The situation would be a bit better if he did things around the house, like helped out with washing the pots, doing the ironing etc but he literally does not wake up or move out of his room (currently our backroom) until around 5PM when dinner is ready. He was also offered a job a few weeks back that he did not turn up to which also makes things more frustrating for us.  
None of us have the balls to say anything to my cousin though because none of us are like that. But, my parents have both had multiple conversations with him about when he's going to move out, what he's doing about a job etc. But, instead of coming up with a plan, he just blames his mental health, or not having money every single time and ends up in tears and at this point my parents feel sorry for him, again.  
We've tried asking his Dad to help out (My dad's brother) but he has no intention of helping out. Neither does his mum or any of our other family members for that matter.

773,"Overall, my mom likes to categorize/generalize people by race. She makes comments like “asians are _____” and “you know those indians _____”

To give you some background, I was born in a predominantly white town, and then we moved to another one that was a bit more diverse, but the majority of the population was still white. Of course, my interests have been effected by this. Certain artists, shows, etc. are more popular at a school like mine than they would be at a school with mostly black people. However, I’m still proud of and embrace my own culture and race. If I went to a school with mostly Hispanic or Asian people, I would still share some interests with the people that go to said school. Anyways, here are some of the many examples of my mom’s prejudices:

Example #1: My mom doesn’t want me to “dress like a white person” or listen to *their* music. She says that black people have style—which we do—but I want to dress in my own style as well. She doesn’t like how I talk/sound like a white girl according to her. Even before I really knew any white people, I’ve always talked properly*. She even mentioned how they smell a certain way when it’s humid. Not to mention, she thinks white schools sugarcoat and lie to you about African-American history. 

Example #2: Yesterday we we went to a Chinese buffet and after the waitress sat us down and stuff she said to me “Maybe you can say something to her in Japanese like ‘thank you.’” Of course I declined, but it’s still disappointing that she would even suggest that

I wouldn’t go as far to say she doesn’t like white people, as she says that “*some* of them are nice.” but she thinks that most white people are to some extent racist.  The real kicker? She’s mixed (her mom’s white &amp; her dad’s black. My mom and I are both light-skinned and my dad’s black.) She identifies herself and our family as black, and there’s nothing wrong with it. If you still don’t think it sounds racist, I’ll reverse the roles. What is she said “stop acting black/black people have a certain smell/stop listening to black music.” Sounds bad, doesn’t it?

I want to express myself and help her look at people for who they are, rather than what they are. Any ideas? If you think I’m wrong on my end, feel free to explain why. I understand she wants me to be knowledgeable and be proud of who I am, but isn’t she going to far?

*I don’t really want to say “properly” but I’m not sure what other word to use. I use grammatically correct sentences and phrases for the most part, and I don’t say y’all or ain’t. I don’t go out of my way to avoid saying y’all/ain’t, it’s just something I don’t really do.",15Dec2019,1

I thought I would turn to people online in hopes of getting some help with this, because I’ve pretty much exhausted all other possibilities. I’m extremely scared of planes, I have an irrational fear of flying and it’s a problem. I’ve flown before, multiple times, and I used to be fine with flying, but now I absolutely hate it.

Bennet and Audrey started dating at the end of last school year, and everything was going great. A couple of weeks ago I was hanging out with Bennet one on one, and he told me that he broke up with Audrey because of all her drama (I love her, but it's just that her personality that can be a bit much sometimes). Bennet was going on about how annoying she is and that he's glad it's over. I ask Audrey about it the next day, and she seems honestly confused and says that they're still together, so I just play it off as just having heard a rumor that must've been wrong. I confront Bennet about this, and he says that Audrey is seemingly ""in denial"" about being broken up with. I tell Bennet to talk to one of our other mutual friends who had to deal with this a few years back, and he says he will.

787,"Long story short, I've been having problems with this woman for months. We're partners in our team and should be working as such, but it's been *impossible* with her. From condescension to rude remarks to outright stealing projects I showed interest in, she's been a thorn in my side since we started. I've already talked to management about her once, and she's since had two other run-ins with them for reasons unrelated to me. But this week, I found out something that seems like I should be taking action.

Since I haven't said a negative word about her to my coworkers outside of management, a couple of our peers/friends asked me how I felt about her since they could sense tension building for months. They've also had some serious problems with her, it turns out: She's stolen projects, demeaned coworkers who've projects she considers more interesting than the work she's assigned, and just generally been rude, condescending, and mean-girl-ish. The coworkers I chatted with do not like her, either. So, I air my grievances, only to find out that she has been under the delusion that she does a ton of work every day and I, in turn, have been slacking off. She's routinely bad-mouthed my performance to the other coworkers to the point where it makes them uncomfortable. 

The joke here is that this is objectively untrue. Our supervisors send us both assignments and I end up taking on the majority of them on a daily basis. Whenever I turn to her and see if she wants to take on an assignment because I'm already too busy, she says she has ""sooo much"" on her plate. (Typically one or two assignments.) And they know this. During our mid-year reviews, she was told that she was too unproductive and has a negative attitude. (Mutual friend told me.) I, however, was told that I should pay more attention to detail and refrain from putting too much on my plate. Essentially, our workload is deeply imbalanced. 

So, my first reaction to hearing that she's been calling me lazy and denigrating my performance is to do nothing. Clearly our supervisors are aware of this imbalance and have addressed her about it. But...I'm actually quite pissed off. Like, I can't over-emphasize that I've been carrying our team for months. Generally, I like the challenge. I like having a lot to do, and as a result I've gotten better at the basics and am being trusted to take on cool, interesting projects. Meanwhile, she has taken four vacations in the past six months. 

The more I think about it, the angrier I get. Not only is it blatantly untrue, it's just so...dismissive? Cruel? Evil? To lean so hard into something that is so far from the truth. Like, talking shit about your coworkers *to other coworkers* is ugly enough, but spreading lies about my performance is just crossing a line. If you're mad or annoyed with me for personal reasons, fine, whatever, I don't care. But if you're going around telling people that I'm slacking off while I'm literally at my desk focused on the work, what the fuck is that?

It seems like I should take some sort of action over this. I've approached her *multiple times* about her behavior in the past, but this woman is so delusional that she finds a way to convince herself of things that are either exaggerated or totally untrue. 

I'm already sure that a storm is brewing because she's been ostracizing her friends in the office that have become my friends, too—yes, really, *they've even told me this*!—and this kind of disrespect can't continue. Like, you've got me **fucked up**.

She's on vacation right now (sigh) so I have some time time to figure out what to do. Should I confront her (again) or just go straight to management (again) to nip this in the bud? Clearly she just doesn't respect me, and I don't care what happens to her anymore.",15Dec2019,1

However, I realized I don't love this city, and I have some bad memories here. I'd be able to tolerate the city if I had a partner, but that's been hard here. 

I often say to myself that if I'm going to pay crazy rent to be by myself and just work, I might as well be in a city I like and the weather is nice.

Seems like a slam dunk to leave for California right?

Well my business won't be able to come with me. It's a state license thing. I'd have to get re-licensed to California which could take 2 years. I'd be making little money during this process. 

I also perform stand up comedy, have  a podcast, and I'd like to try to get into voice acting. All things I could do more of in LA. 

The biggest hurdle is leaving the business behind. I make good money, and I have a lot of student loan debt. 

But I'm not happy here. I'm not sure what to do. I'm also in my young 30s. So who knows how much work I can get in LA. 

Maybe it's a pipe dream and I should stick with what I have and know. But I don't think I'll be happy here.

790,"This is my first post I've made on this sub Reddit and I've been thinking about doing this for awhile now. Sorry for the length

So ever since I was a child (I'm currently almost 17)
I've always tried to be the best person I could be. You see I wish to one day become a therapist but I'm never supported on the matter. I've been bullied for most of my life up until around 2 years ago but it still gets to me. I grew up in a bad side of my city where when I was threatened it wasn't a hollow threat. I had to constantly watch my back and practically lived in the school library (no one goes there). Then I've lost alot of my friends as they all sided with an ex friend for getting my girl-friend to cheat on me and have sex with him so that he could send me a picture.I constantly asked my parents to help but they never cared just saying to tell a teacher (of course I did) I would even tell them how the teachers did nothing,in turn the next response being just to bear with it. This in toll gave me trust issues. What it also did however was inspire me to get up and study to become a therapist after all others must go through this too right? I have to do alot of work managing the house,taking care of all the animals,study hard for my school and medical class, and I help other people with their problems daily. Despite all this I'm never given anything. I can also see clearly tell that I'm the least favorite child as it's been proven multiple times. An example is how my older and only sister asks for hundreds of dollars monthly but my family refuses to even give me 20 dollars as it's ""not important."" My sister when she was born almost died because she was premature,it was to the point where the doctor told my grandparents to plan a funeral. While I understand their compliance to my sister, my problem is how in the third grade I went through septic shock and it was so bad the doctor told my mom with me still in the room how there was a 98% chance I would die and a 80% chance that I wouldn't make it to the hospital they planned to move to. No one was there for me those few days and it hurts me to this day. I know they don't care for me that much but it's ok because I think I'm strong enough. It took them 15 years to ask me anything on my problems only to get mad when I told them how I'm in pain claiming how dramatic and dumb I am for having these issues. I don't mean to be dark but I have thought about suicide and at one point I tried to OD on ibuprofen (luckily it failed). I don't have much to lean on anymore but I'm fine with it as even through all this pain I know I've gotta be someone else's hope to stand up. When I graduate next year I plan on going to UIW for medical school. So back to this old question of mine,am I worth even a little bit of praise,and following that am I strong or not.

A little back story for me and the situation. 

I grew up a very troubled child. Was abused both mentally and physically as a kid by my mother. Which has caused a lot of trouble in my life. 
As a young kid I was bullied in school and ended up moving schools due to the school prior not wanting to step in and take of the situation. 
When I moved to the new school it was a night and day difference. I went from a very socially awkward kid who was extremely shy and scared of the world with no friends, to someone who was very out going and made many friends. 

To keep it short, I fell hard for one of my friends. We dated and I got hurt. She was one of those girls that liked to play mind games with guys. Just my luck. This brought a lot of issues with me trusting women since. 

So 7 years later to now. 
I met this girl. She had a very rough childhood as well and we connected over it in exchanging stories. We’ve since became very close friends. 
We’ve had many talks about this, but if we lived closer and had met earlier in life we both agree that we’d be together. But unfortunately she lives on the other side of the state and is in a relationship with a guy who in my opinion is a pos but I feel I’m biased. He’s content with basically being roommates with a kid. He recently lost his job and refuses to go get a new one and won’t help with the baby at all. She’s expressed several times how she’s not really happy with how their relationship is. But she doesn’t want to put her child to have a rough time with the split. Her child has some complications and doesn’t do well with change. 
So to spare him some more complications she’s just dealing with not being happy. 

Now time for the advice. 
I’ve fallen hard for her. Every time we talk I have to hold it in not to bring up the fact that I love her. As stated before the feelings are there both ways between us, but I don’t know what to do. Like I don’t want to bring it up and cause any problems for her, because I care so much for her. 

I’ve been trying to keep these feelings under control and deep inside. But I’m just lost as to what to do. 

Help. Love hurts.",15Dec2019,1

795,"I'll keep this short. My brother got a new girlfriend who seems very nice and normal. However, despite only meeting her twice, my wife ""gets a bad vibe"" from her and constantly talks about how she doesn't like her. This has led to my wife proclaiming that she is not going to attend any event this girl is at and (the most problematic part) my wife has said I can't go to any event either since I need to ""support my wife"". 

Normally I wouldn't care but my mom is big on Christmas and my brother and his girlfriend are coming. My wife has since said we aren't going to any Christmas dinner or breakfast because of this. 

I really don't know what to do...I've talked/argued with my wife 1,000 times about this and feel she is being irrational, but she won't budge. She just keeps coming back with ""if you really loved me you would support your wife"". I get that but I don't want to upset my mom either....any thoughts?",15Dec2019,1
796,"I know that compared to what other people go through, my struggles in life aren’t that big of a deal, but still life’s been pretty rough for me the past few months. So I’d really appreciate someones opinion on how to deal with my situation. I just turned 18 and I’m male, if that matters for the story.

Half a year ago I broke up with my girlfriend of two years, we still see each other on a regular basis due to mutual friends and we still argue about dumb stuff quite often which really messes with me mentally. 

My parents divorced a long time ago, but my dad only recently decided to tell me he has a new girlfriend on the other side of the world and that they just got a daughter. I’m happy for him he found someone again, but I’m also angry at him. I only see him once every 2 or 3 months, and he lives pretty close to me, he’s never been a real dad to me. And I’m angry because he also won’t be a real dad to my half sister because she lives so far away and he’s not moving there. (I live in the Netherlands and she lives in Thailand)

I fell in love with my best friend and I told her how I felt, she took it well and we’re still super close but because we still talk all the time my feelings for her only seem to grow. 

Mixing all that together combined with the fact that I’m not the most mentally stable person has lead to me drinking, a lot, smoking weed, a lot, and smoking, also a lot. 

I know this is not how to deal with stress and I really want to do better. But I just don’t know how. I work out 5 times a week and I’m in pretty good shape, even though my lifestyle doesn’t suggest that. Working out is the only thing that kind of keeps me sane. 

I want to focus on myself, I want to seriously devote myself to powerlifting and not think about girls and stay off drugs, but it’s just so difficult for me to do so. Does anyone have any advice that might help? I just don’t know how to deal with all of this stuff.",15Dec2019,1
797,"I had a baby with my partner 2.5 years ago and things have been pretty shitty since then. He is not a good dad or a supportive partner (can provide more detail, if needed!) I have asked my family on several occasions if I can move in with them for a short term as a way to escape. They have said no. They don’t understand why I want to leave and think he is a good guy. 

To make things more complicated, I live in a city with an extremely low vacancy rate and I am also on disability due to an accident from several years ago which leaves me with debilitating fatigue and headaches so working outside the home at this time simply isn’t an option. 

I just decided a few months ago to just suck it up and give up on the idea of leaving. I see no way out and I have a kid with him, so what other options do I have? 

Last night, he ended up getting snowed in at his mom’s house last night, so wasn’t able to make it home. It was the first time in nearly 7 years that he has actually left the house in the evening and been away all night and it felt really nice to have the night without him here. Then, waking up this morning without him in the house was amazing and I felt so relaxed and happy without him here. The second he got home I felt tense and unhappy.

This morning was a huge wake up call that I NEED to leave him, no matter how hard it’s going to be. Even if I have to dig into my savings pretty significantly and sell my car and do all those things, it needs to happen. I can’t live like this anymore. 

He has 2 weeks off for the holidays coming up and I am already super anxious thinking about him just being here all the time. 

I did find a counselling place in the city that offers free counselling to women, though I need to check in with them to see if I qualify since I am not in a dangerous situation, just an unhappy one. 

The advice that I need is how to have this conversation with him to convey to him how serious I am. We have danced around the issue for 2.5 years now and then there is never any follow through from either one of us. How do I have this conversation to ensure we actually get to separate this time?

Also, it’s worth noting that I am a big dummy who got drunk last weekend when our son was at my parents house for a sleepover and I ended up sleeping with him and realized afterwards that I was pretty much in prime baby making time. (I am already pissed off enough at myself for this, but feel free to shame me over this horrible choice!!) I took Plan B, but I am sort of wondering if I should hold off on having any conversations with him until I can 100% confirm that I am not pregnant.",15Dec2019,1
798," This all happened in Dallas, Tx. 

On Friday, a lady pulled out in front of me and I T-boned her. Airbags from both cars deployed. I had right-of-way in the situation and I had a witness willing to corroborate gave me his card. The police who came said as much that I was not at fault. I wasn't injured at the time but my knee has gotten a little stiff since then. I immediately called my insurance and started the claim process and there is police report out for the wreck. My claims person has not called me back yet, but my car is absolutely totaled due to the age. The call center rep for my insurance company got me a towing truck and it is now sitting in front of my house.

Saturday, I was in ANOTHER wreck again not my fault. I Was driving my girlfriends car. We had the green turn light but an on-coming car did not stop for their red light. I slammed on the brakes and the person behind us rear-ended us. Once again, initially didn't feel injured although my neck and back have been getting stiff. Police wouldn't come out to make a report whenever I said there were no injuries. I called twice to verify this. The Wreck smashed up her back end pretty good but we were able to drive it home. We filed a claim with her insurance and it will be in the body shop on Monday. We got the person who smashed into our car's information, but the person who ran the red light kept going.

So, I guess I don't know how this should be attacked. With 2 accidents in the span of 2 days, if there are injuries... which wreck did the injuries come from. My car is a 2001 honda CRV. It had a lot of life left in, but the KBB is like nothing. My Girlfriend was only in the second accident. Should I/we be lawyering up right now. Do we let our insurance companies try and get money from the insurance companies of the drivers responsible for the wreck? What do I tell my insurance company about having 2 wrecks? Like what should I disclose?

It's funny, I've been driving for 15 years and never had a collision with another car, then had 2 in the span of nearly 24 hours.",15Dec2019,1
800,"From age 5 to 12, I had some behavioral issues that I fortunately grew out of. I remember my teachers from elementary and middle school complaining to my mom that my behavior is a bit of a nuisance and my mom would occasionally ground me and while that didn't worked, eventually due to a desire to go to a good college, I started to get my act together in 7th grade and my mental health issues shifted from behavior problems to social issues. From 9th grade to 12th grade, I desired to have multiple friends who I can hang out with outside of school, but that didn't materialized the way I wanted. However, my mom told me that its not the end of the world because most people who graduate from high school grow apart from the friends they make once they graduate.

Around 12th grade, I started to develop a really bad case of persistent anxiety over how to pay for college. I wanted to go to college for years but at that time (2013 and 2014), there was a lot of discussion over the cost of college, student loan debt, whether college was worth it, and whether college is a scam. Now, the good news is a combination of having a good high school GPA, SAT score, and anxiety that motivated me enough to apply for many scholarships (50+ applications sent, 8 scholarships awarded throughout college), I was able to pay for a US News Top 100 university (public university in the state of Florida that ranked well) without having to take out any student loans. However, avoiding that student loan debt didn't get rid of the root of the problem. When financial concerns subsided, something else came. For the first summer semester and the first five weeks of my first fall semester (June to December 2014), I managed college well. Then came a really difficult precalculus class where quizzes and exams were administered on an online testing system (not going to say the exact name, because I don't want to doxx myself) and the crappy part of that online testing system is that there was rarely an opportunity to get partial credit and the time to finish quizzes and exams were short. I eventually failed that class in Fall 2014 and had to retake it in the Spring 2015 semester. It went really well for me the second time, but then again came another class that stressed me out, which was a *Reasoning and Critical Thinking* course offered by my college's philosophy department. I passed that course, but the stress almost took me to the edge.

When I came back home during Summer of 2015, I started having panic attacks and having rumination spells (frequent cases of difficult to control rumination). Eventually, my mom suggested that I see a psychiatrist to go on medication for anxiety because she argued that as with any medication condition, if left untreated, anxiety can be a serious impact on my quality of life. So I conceded. In May of 2015, I was prescribed fluoxetine, an SSRI anxiolytic (yes, I know its primarily used to treat depression, but it can also be used as an antidepressant). The medication did the trick and besides some short-term side effects such as anxiety (how ironic), stomach upset, dry mouth, and one long-term side effect (sexual side effects), I tolerated the medication fairly well.

I believe sometime in late 2016, I talked to my psychiatrist on campus about tapering off the medication, and she told me that it would be best to stay on the medication until after I graduate since she doesn't want a relapse of anxiety to get in the way of my schoolwork. I conceded and followed through with her advice. However, from 2016 to 2019, I would often struggle with ahedonia, or ""feeling like a zombie"". I didn't know if I was falling into a depression or if the medicaiton was the blame. I talked to my psychiatrist about it and she said that if I am not having feelings of sadness, suicidal ideation, or hopelessness alongside the anhedonia (emotional blunting), then that means I am not getting depressed but rather I am experiencing a side effect of the medication. She then said that even though anhedonia can be a huge suck on my quality of life, she decided that the benefits of treatment outweighed the drawbacks, so she kept me on the fluoxetine for some time.

When I was about to graduate, I talked to my psychiatrist on campus again about the possibility of stopping the medication under the supervision of another provider after I graduate. She said that she is fine with that scenario as long as I can mange my anxiety and negative emotions without developing a relapse. She did say that if I want to go that route, I should consider therapy, as merely discontinuing the medication wouldn't the the ideal solution. She argued that if I stopped the medication without learning skills to cope with my negative emotions, then a relapse would be likely.

Twelve months later, I found a provider at my new location that can manage my medication and I was seeing a physician assistant who was very friendly and helpful. Let's call her ""Amanda"". I told Amanda what my previous psychiatrist told me and she mostly agreed. She then refereed me to a therapist (PsyD) who can help me learn skills on how to cope with negative emotions. So I did. The therapist primarily taught me four skills: learning to be rational yet sympathetic when dealing with life issues, countering negative thoughts and emotions, mindfulness, and re-framing (basically framing negative circumstances that you cannot fully control in a more positive light). Eventually, I told the therapist about my idea of getting my PA to taper me off my anxiolytic medication and he said this...

&gt; ""I am fine with you discontinuing the medication, as long as you remain stable. The thing with treating a mental health condition with medication is that you won't know how well you can manage without it until you are off the medication for a few (2 to 3 months) months. I also think that you should take this potential decision seriously because you have a lot to lose if your mental health deteriorates, especially if you are living on your own since there won't be anyone to directly support you if things go sour. If that means being on the fluoxetine or some psychiatric medication for the rest of your life to have a good level of mental stability, then I think that's a opportunity worth considering, even if that mean having to put up with side effects for a longer time.""

I told my primary care physician and he said something somewhat similar. So in August of 2019, my PA started my taper on fluoxetine and completed it (with discontinuation) in early December of 2019. I've been off the medication for about two weeks and so far, I haven't experienced any major changes in moods or side effects. My PA and PCP did say that because I was on the medicine for so long and because it has a long half-life, it would take a while for thing to return to a baseline. Both said about 2 to 3 months after discontinuation. The reason why I stopped the medication is because I think it was making me feel emotionally numb. I would describe it as, ""I can see, taste, smell, hear, and touch, but for some reason, I think something is missing psychologically. I think I would feel numb in the head, but I have been feeling this way for so long that I am not sure if this is normal or if it is due to the medication.""

Don't get me wrong, I am not anti-medicine, but my experience wasn't the best that it could be. However, the medication did relieve my anxiety symptoms well. However, while I was on the medication, I wouldn't feel empathy, anger, sadness, arousal, confusion, happiness, excitement, etc. In almost all cases, In would just feel indifferent. When I told my PA about this the month she completed my taper, she thought I was falling back into a depression. Here is how the conversation gone...

&gt; Amanda: How do you feel currently?

&gt; Me: Not fully sure. I don't feel sad, angry, aroused, or confused, but just numb and indifferent.

&gt; Amanda: You mean detached?

&gt; Me: I don't think that's the right word to describe it.

&gt; Amanda: That may be depression. Depression isn't always sadness, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. It can also be numbness and apathy.

This was very confusing because when I researched other people's experiences on SSRI/SNRI antidepressants, many reported about feeling blunted or numb on their medication. However, my PA had difficulty believing that the medication would make me feel numb and that she thought I was falling into depression. I had to convince her that it might be the medication and she gave me the benefit of the doubt. She then officially stopped treatment. The following day was my first day of not being on the medication in four years, and six months. Right now, its been almost two weeks and practically nothing has changed. I hardly have any friends in real life as of now (most of them have grown apart or distant), not under a stressful situation, and I currently have relationship (family) issues with my mom. Things aren't going as well as I hoped as of now even though I am doing fine in terms of not relapsing in anxiety and not experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms. Not sure if things would ever improve or not.

What concerns me is that everyone's experience on and coming off medication and some have wonderful experiences, some have horrible experiences, and while my experience has been a ""B-"" so far, I really don't know what to expect. Things can get better, things can stay the same, or things can get worse and if things don't go the way I planned, I am worried that I may be doomed to face this crap for the rest of my life with no help.

Overall, if you can comment on my experience and provide support, advice, and guidance on my situation, then that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",15Dec2019,1

It occurred to me today that if I’m fairly active on the server for a couple months that he will make me mod. I then plan on kicking out all 6,000 members to get revenge.

811,"Hi Everyone!  


Not sure if this is the right place to post, so if it's not just tell me :) 

I (18F) would like to begin saying that English is not my native language, so sorry for any mistakes. I also would like to say that I know I'm in the wrong here, so I don't need people telling me that.

So to describe the situation:

I have this big group of friends and a lot of them are couples. Now we are a really close group of friends. A while ago I started talking to one of the boys (23M, let's call him L) in the group. He has a girlfriend (18F, let's call her P). I'm not particularly close to P, but we hung out regularly. So one particular night I think maybe a month back, we were drinking at my place with the entire group. Fast forward a few hours and L and I were the only ones left. We talked a lot, also about NSFW subjects. To me, it all seemed harmless, but looking back I should've stopped it right there and then. L asked me to keep our conversation a secret from P and he told me to tell her that L fell asleep on my couch and I couldn't wake him up. I naively did that, because to me it all seemed quite harmless. (Stupid mistake on my part)

From that day L and I were texting all day every day. Just every day small talk.

So fast forward to today, I royally screwed up. I went to his place because I would chill with L and his sister. This was supposed to end at 2 am or so, but in the end, the three of us were still talking around 7 am. I was quite tired and drunk and didn't want to go home alone in the dark. It was about 20 minutes of cycling for me, in a not so great neighborhood. So when L proposed I just stayed over, I said yes. (Again, stupid mistake)

So in the end, we didn't do anything physical, but I slept in his bed (he slept on the couch). In the morning though, he joined me in his bed to cuddle. I stopped him then because it didn't feel good to me. L again told me to say nothing happened and that we didn't talk about anything NSFW (which did happen) I feel like L emotionally cheated on P with me, because I know I talked to L a lot more than L talked to P. L also complained about P's jealousy issues to me quite a lot.

I feel really guilty because I treated P horribly and my question is now what to do. I feel like P deserves to know the truth, but I don't know how to tell her. I want to fix the situation, but I really don't know how to.

TLDR: I screwed up by getting too close to a friend, who has a girlfriend. Now I need to know if I should tell her everything that happened and how to do that.",15Dec2019,1

Option 1. Buy 10-15 Acres and build a ""tiny"" house cost would be around 100k,ish for land and all. Loan through bank.

Option 2. Buy 30+ acres of pasture for cattle and already has house/trailer house on it. Loan would be a ag loan to purchase cows and equipment. This type of loan has lower interest and is meant to boost new farmers. Total cost say 150k,ish. Cows can cover most or all the payments.

815,"Basically all my friends left me for their girlfriends and pretty much ignored me and I was left out (we were 4 friends) I still try to make meetings but everybody says no. yes, I talked with them about it, they ""apologized"", we met up after a few months of not meeting each other and the state of our friendship stayed the same, they're still with they girlfriends and still ignore me.

I also had another group of friends which I played games with, they left me for E girls, they are buying them games, and even though they are online and I send them messages they ignore me.  

I don't have any social media except reddit (this is a 2nd account) thus most students in our school don't know who I am. I have a few classmates who I talk to on daily basis but one of them probably won't be my friend (she is a very popular girl) and the rest will probably just continue talking to me in class and that's it, no meetings outside of school.

my family is in a really bad financial state for forever and I barely go out, that's why I spend my day on my computer.

I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 13 but never actually considered taking my own life because I have much to live for but right now, I am left alone and I hate myself for it, I miss having friends and miss having a happy life. if you haven't experienced it yourself (I wish you the best) you won't know what I'm talking about, I feel like an empty shell.

If I touch paper or cardboard, or if I hear paper or cardboard being rubbed (Like two sheets of paper or even a book), it immediately makes me shiver, it's horrible. Even if I only think about it. Toilet paper and normal books are the worst, and after that comes normal copy paper, like we have at school. I can't stand the sound of drawing with a felt-tip pen or using an ink extinguisher too.

My best friend from the US has had a terrible breakup with his long-term relationship (almost 2 years) right before all exams where written.

This pretty much messed him up mentally. He isn't suicidal or self harming, but it's getting put of hand.

I've already tried my best. With advice, always being there (over texts only though). Sent him a care package and links for him to read. All that stuff that waa possible from a very long distance.

He did drink alcohol, which was fine at first. Normal party going with friends.

But then he did something really stupid and unfortunat.
He got himself so drunk that he couldn't think straight. He decided to walk home to his place being shit faced. The cops showed up and asked him if he waa drunk and arrested him. He spent the night in jail.

The next morning he paid his fine and to get out of jail. All of this has caused even more awfulness in his life. I don't know US Laws or anything regarding basic things.

I live in Europe and can't just fly over there to help him.
But I want to try my best.
I need advice for him on things he can do right now.

Like, Hotlines for legal help, maybe some really good online therapy or general advice going forward from this point on.

818,"I have a friend who i have know since we were 12 years old, since then i noticed that he acted a certain way, kids bullied him for it, and i knew that he was gay but since he never told me i let it go, and if anyone asked if he was gay i would deny it. 

Years later he came out but only to close friends. Last year he told me that he has been in a relationship with a guy for 4 years and that they were moving in together. 

This weekend there was a party and i was with 2 girls that were making jokes about me being with him, i then told them that we couldnt be together because he was gay. 

The second i said it, my friend who also knew look at me in horror. Later i called him and told him what happened, he was mortified and said that he has been saying to people that his boyfriend and him are just roomates and friends. 
All this time o thought that he was out of the closet and that he embrassed his homossexuality, but i was wrong.

819,"First and foremost, I don't mean in a sexual way. My friend (30F) and I (31F) have known each other for over 15 years, but I wouldn't have considered us friends until this year. We bonded over our divorces, and now we're both single parents, with kids. 

My initial take on her was that she was very quiet, sweet and thoughtful, just going through a really hard time. About two months ago though, I started to clue in that maybe she wasn't what she seemed. 

That girl seems to forever be going though it. I got her a job where I work. She got fired within her first week, because she slept in her very first day (one week training with me, then solo). Then, her van was getting repossessed. I had just bought a car, and offered to let her buy my old one. We agreed on $100 a month. Never saw a payment, but she still drove it around. Three months later, I needed to take it back, and sell it. She kept saying she'd return it, but then wouldn't. I ended up going, getting the key, and then later the car. She had trash everywhere. So much that it piled up under the seats. That stung. I was trying to help her out. 

I think the turning point was the birthday brunch of our third friend. She showed up 45 mins late, with three kids, one of which wasn't hers. They got hot chocolates, pancakes, fruit cups, sandwich platters. The total ended up being around $40. I knew she didn't have that much money to just drop on breakfast. The bills came, and she gave some line about accidentally forgetting her wallet at home. My friend, on his birthday, covered her bill (I would have, but I don't have that much to just shell out either). 

After getting my car back, I decided I was done. But recently she's been liking all my social media posts, and sending me *I miss you* texts. I'm not confrontational, and it feels mean to just ignore her. What do I do?",15Dec2019,1

822,"Some background:

Hi, I'm 17, and I've been an atheist for a few years now, but I've kept up the charade of being Christian, to keep my parents happy and to avoid being ostracized. 

But recently, my mom has turned ""every"" conversation into one about religion, and that got me thinking-- at some point later in life, I'll probably meet someone I like and start a relationship with a non-Christian. If... or When... that happens, my mom will flip out and start talking about how ""the devil sent this girl to turn me away...etc..."", and I'll eventually be forced to tell her I'm atheist.

Even if I don't, my mom's overly religious nature has already put obstacles in my way. (example: I didn't get in to a selective college, no big deal right? Just adjust the essays a bit. BUT no, Mom: ""JuSt PrAy MoRe!"", then my mom reiterated why its important for her to force me to spend 2 hours a day doing bible study, rather than letting me spend more time working on my essays.) 

Sorry this got a bit ""'ranty"", but the point is that :

\[TLDR;\] Sooner or later I'll be forced to reveal that I'm atheist to my parents/family. So how do I deal with the fallout of this? Anyone have similar experiences? Thanks :-\\",15Dec2019,1
823,"How many times should I contact a friend, by email, or FB message, without them replying before I should take further action, and what action would that be?

I have several people who never respond to messages I write them on Facebook and/or LinkedIn.  When it's a private message, I see they read my message. They never LIKE any of my posts, do not LIKE any of my comments I make on their posts, do not respond to FB messages. I see they interact with others on their page. A few are distant family that I never met but maybe once in my life - but we know we're related.  (I think there's some 'bad blood' between our lineage of my ancestors, but not sure, if it were a problem, why'd they friend me?)  A few others are people who used to be close friends of mine, some of them very close - and nothing in particular that I recall happened between us.  (I know people change and drift apart and become strangers once again.) And lastly we have the 'obligatory/friendly' friends that might be co-workers, people from local in-person clubs I participate in - but don't really know, or neighborhood folks.... I have a few people that I think consider me a 'frienemy' and are the haters in the background.  It's rarely - if ever - important what I contact any of these folks about, mostly just hey whats up, but it really hurts me and is offensive to be so blatantly ignored.  I do not want to retaliate, but I don't want people who are not good for me - or me for them - in my life.   Most of this is around FB, but only because that's our new mode of communication.  Some are by email or voicemail.  It's not about the FB, it's about 'real life' and who is in it.

All I know is that I love them, I want to be with them and I want to help them in every single way that I can but I know there’s nothing that I can really do. They just have to figure it out themselves but it’s just .... hard. I’m so happy and grateful to know this person.

I’m forever here for them as their friend, lover, partner. I love them as they are currently and I’m excited to watch them grow into a happier, more stable human being. I’m really optimistic about our future and despite everything they’re going through, they seem to have an open mind about us.

827,"As the title reads, I was fired on Friday from a job that I honestly should've worked my hardest at.

I'm a college dropout, not old enough to rent a car, yet I had a solid job with great health insurance, stock in the company, and really flexible location and hours (work from home, get x amount of work done, show up for online meetings). I got this job through a recommendation. 

I live very well off in a nice apartment in a nice area, and the only debt I have is a student loan and the rest of my lease.

I have enough money to pay bills and rent for the next two months, so ideally I'd get a job by the end of January the absolute latest. But, that's where I'm having trouble.

I have a lot of random skills. I can program, use video/photo software, use a camera and do basic production, understand hardware/networking, make basic music, I have some level of creativity, as well as a bunch of other random skills and knowledge.

However, I am not proficient at any one thing. I am a junior or less in each field. But, besides actual skill, the main reason I feel worthless is my work ethic.

Unless I'm explicitly told to do something constantly, it's difficult for me to actually follow through. It's how I've been my whole life. I do what I'm asked, and if I really don't want to do it, I'm given the easy way out, all the time.

At this job that I was just fired from, I effectively no-showed for over a month's worth of work days. They gave me too many opportunities to fix my shit, and they paid me for it while I slacked off.

I understood the gravity of my situation, and I knew I needed to work, but I couldn't bring myself to actually do the work. I always got distracted and was always procrastinating.

Even right now, I understand how shitty my life will be in a month or two if I don't get a job, but I just don't care. I want to care so desparately, but what's the point?

I've always been given the easy way out, and whenever I would make someone upset, I'd just say, ""Sorry,"" but not know how to make it up to them. I've worked 4 jobs, and only 1 of them I left on decent terms. 

I've pushed away a lot of friends because I can't act like a normal human being. I'm convinced I have some sort of mental disorder but my parents and doctors say I'm fine. People have only been nice to me, and I try to be a nice person back, but I've never actually had a close friend because I always put people at a distance. 

Its easy for me to put on a facade and not face how I feel. There's been very few times when I actually honestly was showing emotion. Every other time was some general facade that I can't control. It's almost like dissasociation, but I can remember random things that aren't relevant.

A month or so ago my brother called the non emergency line to check on me because I hadn't talked to anybody in a week. They came to my apartment and I broke down, so they asked me if I wanted them to take me to a hospital, so I said yes.

I was diagnosed with depression, and even in the diagnosis, I partially lied in that I wasn't having any suicidal thoughts because I knew they would detain me for a while and it would make my situation harder to handle.

They sent me home with a bunch of therapy recommendations, but I haven't tried to look into any of them. My Dad told me he'd talk to me on the phone everyday and try to get me to see a therapist, but that only lasted a week and now we don't talk.

Basically, I guess what I'm trying to ask here,  what can I do besides rot away? I literally have no  motivation to do anything. I know I need to go to a therapist and get a job, I know, but I literally don't have the motivation to do anything besides indulge in escapism. I feel like Shinji from Evangelion, but worse. 

I've also done a lot of shitty things to other people that I really shouldn't have, but I did them anyways because I felt invincible and that I could get what I wanted. I indulged in shitty behavior because I had nothing else going for me.

As much as I know I've done good things for people and created things or helped, it was mostly because I felt inclined to to keep relationships open or because I was told to. And as much as I know I've done bad things to people, it was not my intention and just my mind being erratic and doing its own thing. 

I'm a useless human being, I guess.",15Dec2019,1
828,"So here’s the situation. I work at a pizza joint in the US. For a long time I was stuck on dish and I couldn’t stand it. If I had stayed there I know I would have already quit. Nowadays I’m mostly making pizza. The job itself isn’t that bad and neither are the people, but I don’t feel very great when I’m there. I have a tendency towards suicidal ideation, and I found that work would bring up those thoughts a lot. It’s not so bad anymore but for a while it was near unbearable and I had a few episodes where I nearly cried at work.  Nowadays it’s not so bad. My mind still goes there sometimes but not too much. I have a tendency to disassociate there but that isn’t as big a concern to me. 

The hours aren’t the worst, but I’m still in high school so working Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, does mean that I don’t have any days where I’m not at work or school. The pay is good for high school 11$ and hour. And I might need the money one day. My parents still want me to work and I’ll definitely find another job, but I’m not sure if I should have left. 

I don’t know why I did it. The job isn’t that bad, but I can also confidently say that I’ve never had a day there that I enjoyed. I always wished I could be somewhere else or at my old job, but maybe I’m just making a big deal out of nothing. I could probably go back and make my schedule 3 days instead of 4 or move them so I can have weekends, but idk. I talked about leaving basically everyday to my friends. When people asked how work went I’d say “it was work” or that I hated it. But now I don’t know.

There’s one last factor that’s really the main reason I stayed as long as I did. Which is that current I’m in the closet as trans and for that I’m going to need money. If my family doesn’t support me, I’ll need another way to afford hormones. Not to mention clothes and also unrelated but college.

Upwards of 30 people all coming to my mom's house and she would gladly cook and clean for them, even though some of them are very rude and never appreciated all she did. 

Now even her oldest child will not even call her on holidays. She feels like now that her husband is gone no one wants to come see her and they were only ever around to see her husband.

She feels like I didn’t try enough to not be negative or sad. She told me she was done with me out of the blue. She said I was too negative and that she was in a good place in life and didn’t need me around anymore. I tried to reach out to her but she ignored my texts. I see her at work and at first she wouldn’t even look at me. Now she’s talking to me at work again. Not about what happened between us. Just joking around and being friendly in general, like she’ll come up to me and randomly start a conversation. I’m really confused and I don’t understand if this is her trying to talk to me again or if she’s just trying to be civil. 

Do I even bother trying to text her? Or do I just leave it alone? I miss her a lot and I’m just really confused and sad about everything. I want to text her but I feel like she’ll just ignore me and that’s gonna hurt 10x more if I make another effort. But at the same time there’s also a chance she’ll answer me. What do I do?",15Dec2019,1
840,"I have horrible allergies, cough and wheezing in my apartment and I am not sure what to do anymore.

I usually have grass allergies between May and June. However something strange has happened this year and my allergies continued on well beyond the usual time period. I have to note that I have a cat (which I had for 5 years without a problem). However she did have kittens around August. Having five cats in the house was a bit difficult to say the least but I managed to adopt them out now. I think pet dander definitely added to the situation. However petting/holding my cat does not prompt allergy symptoms. 

Upstairs I have a mold spot by the window sill because the window hasn't been able to fully close for well over a year. That is where my allergies are the worst. I also have a four square meter tiny room downstairs that I been hiding in to get away from my allergies, however as soon as I put a bed inside to sleep on, I started waking up with coughs and wheezes. 

I am so tired. I have considered plastering the window sill but I am running out of money. Im studying at 150% while working odd jobs. It is barely enough to pay the rent and get food. I have tried to get a time at the doctors to figure out what I am allergic to but they put me on a waiting list. I don't think I had a good night sleep in months. I am so tired, I just want a break. I noticed that I feel a lot better when I have all the doors/windows open but at this time of year it gets incredibly cold. 

I am not sure where to go from here. I cant afford anybody repairing the mold spot ( I have covered it with aluminium foil). My apartment community says they are not responsible for mold checking. I did end up buying an air purifier, but I can't say I noticed too much of a difference. Currently my plan is to pack all my stuff into plastic bags and go sleep over at my friends apartment. Do any of you have suggestions how I should clean or check for allergens my self? Any advice is appreciated.",15Dec2019,1

Me: 17(f)
A: 22(m)
B: 19(m)

So backstory before I ask for advice:

I’ve known A for a very long time. My bff is his bff’s sister and I had a really big crush on him for about a year before it fizzled it when I knew it would never go anywhere. I had a crush on B for about a week when he first started working but then I found out he was kind of a hoe and I knew he’d never like me anyways. 

So B and I had a thing going on for a few months where we started smoking together and we had a discussion about sex. I mentioned I was still a virgin. He offered to “help me with that”. Cue two months of back and forth. I kissed him on a dare, he tried to use tongue. I backed off for a while but on his birthday I gave him a card and baked him cupcakes. He questioned me about the card for a few days before eventually asking me what happened about me being dtf him. I told him he’s the one who let it go. He told he was still dtf and I said okay. So after work one day he took me out to a field and we had sex in his car. It was good, i mean I don’t have anything else to compare it to. He came rather quickly but that was because he was a little high apparently. 

A and I have only been friends. He’s suggested a few books to me and we’ve had discussions about them. Also, he’s been there for me when I was drunk or high af and has been a really good friend. The night I had sex with B, I told him about hooking up with someone but didn’t tell him who. Later on that night he texted me “I don’t want to seem like a creep and I’m a bit drunk. I want to say something to you.” Or something like that. I told him he was fine and he should say what he wanted to say. He texted “fucking turn 18 already.” I told him it wasn’t creepy and he was fine. Later on, he showed up to my house and kissed me. He’s a reallyyyy good kisser. He told me he’s dtf but only when I turn 18. 

What should I do? I need help. What if I catch feelings for one or both of them?",15Dec2019,1
843,"Over the past few months I was being harassed constantly by a boy in my year. He would send a message every single day to me, varying from just my name to stuff like 'I'm going to kill myself if you don't respond'. I eventually blocked him, and the next week I saw him follow me all the way home. I live out of town so there was no reason whatsoever that he would be walking that way unless it was to follow me. Since then, I have changed my schedule so he cannot do this, but I have received threats from him on a different platform (pictures of acid and knives in his room).

I spoke to him about this and he denied everything and sent me data from his exercise tracker showing that he had not been anywhere near my route home on the day. My mum has said that she doesn't believe me and she thinks I'm imagining everything. I have definitely done this before - once I thought I'd been raped but everyone there said they never saw anything. I also said to my mum that I once saw a person with a knife threatening me, but I can't prove that was real so I can only assume I imagined it. Furthermore, the messages that I swore I saw the stalker send are no longer there and they are not in the chat data - almost as if they never happened. 

I don't know if it's possible then that I'm hallucinating everything. Everyone keeps telling me that I'm paranoid and nothing is happening, and I can't prove anything. On the other hand, I still have screenshots of the original three months' onslaught of harassing messages I was sent, so some of this stuff must be real? I can't tell what's real and what I'm imagining. I know the obvious thing to do is tell someone, but my mum says that if I keep lying then she'll send me to live with my dad again (he is abusive, although it's possible that I'm imagining that as well). There's no way I can talk about this confidentially because my school has a legal duty to tell my parents everything if they think I'm in danger. It's also possible, however, that I'm not imagining this and I genuinely am the victim of a crime and I'm in immediate danger. I cannot tell what's real and what's fake, and it's ruining my life.",15Dec2019,1
844,"I recently purchased a Christmas gift for my wife 2 weeks ago and put it under the Tree. I got her a coffee maker that takes the k cups as ours last one broke 1 year ago and we have been using instant coffee. She like Starbucks so I got her the Starbucks K cups too. Today my wife got back from shopping and I see K cups in the groceries while carrying them from the car to the house. 

I think my wife bought me a coffee maker for Christmas so now we might have 2 coffee makers and both be giving each other the same thing. Should I ask my wife what the k cups are for or should I just give her my  Christmas present now or return mine?",15Dec2019,1
845,"I’ve been really depressed lately and really don’t know how to get myself out of it. I feel like I can pinpoint exactly what causes it, too, but I just can’t really do much against any of it. 

It’s multiple things… I recently got dumped by someone, the only person I ever genuinely *fell* for, so that one hurts a lot. I’ve never been this invested in a person before and despite them messing up many times - and hurting me in the process -, I’d do anything for them. Yet I don’t know how to move on &amp; I feel hopeless. 

I also feel like I kinda... Got stuck somewhere? I'm still living in the same town that I went to school in and my mind is yearning for change but I'm not sure how to get there. 

Adding to that, my mother has been in the hospital for a couple days now and we’re yet to get the diagnosis. It’s a neuropathic issue with her leg, we believe, so it’s most likely going to be fine (hopefully). But it leaves me in charge of caring for my younger brother and our family dog… And it’s stressful, when combined with all the stress radiating from the stuff that I gotta do for university. University in general is connected to a lot of doubts concerning my future because I'm *really* unsure about the subjects that I'm studying and whether those were the right choice for me.

There’s lots of other, smaller, more insignificant issues, too. Financial problems, communication issues within my family... They're definitely adding a lot to it, as well, but... They’re easy to solve as soon as I’ve managed to get through all this bigger stuff first. I simply don’t know how – or where – to start. It's just so much that I gotta deal with all at once and instead of fighting it all head on, I just kind of end up not dealing with any of it, completely overwhelmed.

It makes me really sad... I stumpled across old text messages between a friend of mine and myself from over a year ago today... And I was so happy. I can't imagine the last time I had such an energetic and joyful conversation with anyone and it really makes me want to change things because my friends have to deal with this, too, and it's not fair on them, either.

847,"I love my husband, when we met I fought for him. I did everything I could to make him mine and it was nice for a while. But now that we’ve been living together I’ve just felt a bit empty I guess... I still love him to death but his presence annoys me at times and I don’t like the way he treats me, he treats me like a kid and I’m trying so hard to be the big strong husband that I dreamt of being, but I’m just stuck in a rut. He acts all entitled at times and that he has worked so hard to get to me which is true but I don’t know how much longer it would be until I said something I regret that I say that I want a divorce because I don’t. 

I don’t wanna leave him but i don’t know what to do. We’re stuck in a roach infested apartment... I’m just a dishwasher while he’s a CNA working for his CMT and LPN. I don’t even know what I wanna do in life anymore, I have so many passions so many ideas and thoughts. I’ve wanted to be a tattoo artist, I have a tattoo gun but only practiced once. I’ve wanted to be a costume maker but I don’t have space or equipment in this cramped apartment. I wanted to be an artist of some sort but my passion is fading... I haven’t drawn really in months or even a year or two I’ve lost track.... my recent passion is game development but I open up the programs and do a few things get bored and stop... then I get upset at myself...

I’ve thought of maybe separation but I have At&amp;t and to break my direct tv contract would mean I’d have to pay a shit ton of money. And I can’t afford the apartment and bills on my own...and I’d have it transferred to my parents house but At&amp;t doesn’t provide service there for some reason? 

One thought would be have him stay at the apartment and I go live with my parents and I just make sure bills are paid but then he would need groceries and I’d need some groceries cause my parents would expect me to chip in. So idk how to make sure that happens without communication... then there’s the fact that we work in the same building one of us would have to switch and I can’t do it, and sure as hell he won’t switch to days, and I haven’t been at this job that long getting another is out of the question....


I’m just stuck where I am and no matter how hard I try or what I do I feel like I’m in a pit. What should I do? What can I do? I’m sure this is all just because I have undiagnosed depression, but I can’t afford treatment or insurance... I’m just stuck...",15Dec2019,1
848,"Basically, I made a discord server by myself 1 year ago, and I grew it to 6,000 members. I made a couple people mods along the way.  There was one mod in particular that EVERYONE didn’t agree with, and they let me know about it. I continually stuck up for this guy and kept him as mod.

2 weeks ago, I decided to leave discord and I decided to give my server to him and I transferred him ownership. This was an impulse decision. 1 day later, I asked for ownership back (co-ownership) as I decided I wanted to stay. He said “other people tell me bad things about you and I’m not so sure I trust you”. Obviously this is a huge dickhead move by him. So essentially I just said whatever and decided to leave.

It occurred to me today that if I’m fairly active on the server for a couple months that he will make me mod. I then plan on kicking out all 6,000 members to get revenge (doubt these guys will care).

Furthermore, I confided in this guy a couple months ago and he knows thinks about me he could use against me. Which may be another reason not to get revenge.

Is this a stupid idea? I feel if I do this I’ll just stop to his level of being a dick. Anyway I did give him ownership which was my first mistake.",15Dec2019,1

851,"Hey, all. I'm going to apologize in advance for the wall of text incoming. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom. The real takeaway is that I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place in my own home, and it's not fun.

Background on me: 26M, married, professionally stable, mostly well-adjusted, except for...

Background on The Situation: You know that old Owen Wilson flick, ""You, Me, and Dupree""? That's been my life for the past two and a half years. Back in 2017, my then-fiancee-now-wife and I agreed to let \[REDACTED\] (21NB), who has been my best friend since I was about 16, crash on our couch for a bit while they got their life sorted out. \[REDACTED\] comes from a shitty family situation and had an opportunity to get out, so I obviously wanted to help them. In my mind, that meant letting them stay with us for a couple months until they got a job, found a place and a roommate, and started living life as a functional adult.

Fast forward two and a half years. They are still on our couch. They have been unemployed on and off for roughly 12 of the 30 months they have lived with us (got fired from their initial restaurant job, quit the fast food job that followed, got laid off from the call center job they quit the fast food job for, now ""work"" for a catering company that hasn't called them in for a shift in a month and a half). Only pay rent when they are working, which is a crapshoot, do next to nothing to help out around the house while my wife works two jobs and I work three to make ends meet. And that's only the logistical side of the issue.

I know that coming from an abusive home sucks - I'm a survivor myself - but \[REDACTED\]'s complete lack of coping skills have long since started to cause discord and disruption in our household. We can't ask them to do anything or request that they do something differently without getting a kicked puppy look and a night of silent treatment (Literally. I'm talking ""I asked you to please rinse your conditioner out of the shower when you're done a few times over the past few weeks and I slipped and fell today so can you please remember next time?"" causing actual tears and a look like I had just slapped them.). Any time we try to confront this, we get ""Well my trauma makes me like this"" type excuses and basically made out to be horrible people. There's no arguing with them, no getting them to change, and NO confrontation under our roof, because it precipitates an instant panic attack. My wife and I have to leave the apartment if we need to argue/have an intense discussion. \[REDACTED\] refuses to seek mental health services - they are deeply afraid of being institutionalized and don't trust psychiatrists.

The stress is adversely affecting our mental health and the health of our marriage. We have never had the opportunity to just live as a married couple in our own home. \[REDACTED\] moved in a few months before we got married. We can't have healthy arguments without going elsewhere to do so, and the state of having to walk on eggshells constantly in our home has made my wife's already brutal anxiety levels skyrocket. I'm having anxiety and anger management issues due to suppressing everything and have developed a pretty nasty drinking problem because I feel like I can't deal with being in my own house sober. Shit has gotten wildly out of hand.

Early this Spring, we attempted an intervention, told them that things would have to change or we would have to re-evaluate our living situation. \[REDACTED\] responded to this with ""If you send me back to \[hometown\] I'll kill myself within a year."" This... put all of us at a very uncomfortable impasse. My wife and I have discussed this many times, coming back to the same conclusion each time: We cannot and will not kick them out. Neither of us could deal with blood on our hands in that manner. Sending them back home isn't an option, nor is turning them out onto the streets of our large city to face homelessness. And even with this intervention, their state of behavior and inconsistent employment has not improved. They won't change, because they know we're not going to give them the boot. I am losing my mind. At the end of the day, they are still my best friend. I love them and care for them, but I can NOT have them in my house anymore.

This year, for the first time since moving in, they are going home for the holidays, as are my wife and I. I'm frantically praying at this point that they just... don't get on the plane to come back. Ideally, their family (the part of it that's not shitty and abusive) can talk some sense into them, and they'll stay in their much more affordable hometown until they can deal with their issues enough to re-enter society as a somewhat-functional human being, and my wife and I can get our home back and just exist as a couple instead of having an emotionally unstable 21-year-old kid that we didn't sign up to adopt sleeping in our living room.

Is there anything else I can do besides hope? I feel like there's no choice I can make that won't ruin or end someone's life.

TL;DR

Best friend (21NB) has been You-Me-and-Dupree-ing up my (26M) and my wife's (25F) home for the better part of three years. Their poor behavior and lack of financial and emotional stability is ruining our sanity and our marriage. We need them out, but do not under any circumstances want to bring them harm or misfortune. They are threatening suicide if we send them back totheir hometown and neither of us are willing to deal with that guilt, but our lives seem to be crumbling down around us because of the way things are and have been. I don't want anyone to get hurt. How do I prioritize my wife's and my own mental health and domestic stability without literally causing someone's death?",15Dec2019,1

Pocd is a form of OCD that circles around a fear of being a pedophile. People with pocd often perform compulsions where they check if they feel attraction to children by masturbation, mental rumination etc. I'm conflicted on how I feel about this friend due to a compulsion he performed in June. He told me when he was in the bathroom masturbating he heard the sound of his 10, 8 and 5 year old cousins in the other room. He said he became anxious that he was attracted to them and he briefly tried masturbating to the sound of them playing in the other room to see if he liked it. He said he felt instantly repulsed and he stopped after about 5 seconds cause he felt so bad. I dont know how to feel about him cause I dont know whether hes a molester or hes struggling with ocd and I should feel some sympathy.

If you look through my post history, you’ll figure out very quickly that I’m dealing with some serious family issues that I’m trying to get through pretty much on my own. Please bear with me, the premise will be long. 

Awhile ago he told my dad and stepmom at the time that he tried to commit suicide. He was admitted to a hospital, and when he was released, my dad housed him. This is because he lost his apartment and was about to lose his truck because he couldn’t pay bills. He originally said he got laid off, but in reality he walked out of his job 2 months prior to his “suicide attempt”. 

I say that in quotes because there’s some evidence that he lied about it, but can’t say for sure it’s untrue. A couple months before this, my dad’s wife’s son tried to commit suicide, and she was worried that my brother would influence him to try again. Knowing that my dad would choose him over her, she left him. 

He was also instrumental in ending my dad’s marriage before this last one, because he was still being a huge asshole, and he sexually abused this wife’s daughter. I should mention that he did this to me as well, and also physically and emotionally abused me along with that. He faced legal consequences for what he did to her daughter, and while there’s no indication that he has done anything like this since, he’s continued to be selfish, manipulative, and apathetic to anyone else’s feelings. He continues to live off of my dad. 

Some time later, he threatened suicide again, so my dad called the police. They found a knife in his pocket, which he later admitted that he wanted to use it on my dad during a fight between the two of them. He was kicked out, and told that he could drink water from our hose, and use our internet to look for jobs, but that’s it. He was able to gain housing with us again when he said that he ate all of his pills, which I find very convenient. 

Through all of this, he lied about having multiple jobs, and a few days ago, I exposed him when he did it again. My dad said he would give him six months to get his shit together, and if he failed, he was done. He’s given these deadlines to him before and they never worked, so what makes this time different? With this, I’ve started to lose trust in my dad, and have hinted at him that he’s crazy for not doing something more significant. I’m so mad and hurt by this, that I’ve been avoiding him. I’m thinking about moving out, which I know he doesn’t want me to do. He tells me that I don’t understand what he’s doing because I’m not a parent, and I need to be more understanding about what he’s trying to do. 

So how should I feel? Am I right to be mad? Or am I a bitch because I’m not being more understanding?",15Dec2019,1

3. Tell her and see her response

875,"My husband (38 M) and I (32 F) have been together for almost 15 years (married for 10). I have a great relationship with his parents who have done a great deal for us both. I don’t have a father of my own and really appreciate my father in law and mother in law and consider them my parents given the lack of my own. 

My father in law (70) makes inappropriate jokes pretty often and it seems to be happening more and more as he ages. That being said- he has made me very uncomfortable today. His vision is seeing double and he was complaining he can’t tell where objects are located and has no depth perception. 

He then made a joke like “o I am seeing double oops!” And motioned his hands towards my breasts like he was going to grab them by “mistake”. I was horrified and he laughed pretty hard. I have been harassed multiple times by men throughout my career and life... this incident, by someone who I love like a father, has me feeling sick. It is degrading and has a huge ick factor.

I should also mention that I had breast implants a few months ago for medical reasons... I was wearing a very conservative sweater and did not encourage this whatsoever.

878,"Basically, I made a discord server by myself 1 year ago, and I grew it to 6,000 members. I made a couple people mods along the way.  There was one mod in particular that EVERYONE didn’t agree with, and they let me know about it. I continually stuck up for this guy and kept him as mod.

2 weeks ago, I decided to leave discord and I decided to give my server to him and I transferred him ownership. This was an impulse decision. 1 day later, I asked for ownership back (co-ownership) as I decided I wanted to stay. He said “other people tell me bad things about you and I’m not so sure I trust you”. Obviously this is a huge dickhead move by him. So essentially I just said whatever and decided to leave.

It occurred to me today that if I’m fairly active on the server for a couple months that he will make me mod. I then plan on kicking out all 6,000 members to get revenge (doubt these guys will care).

Furthermore, I confided in this guy a couple months ago and he knows thinks about me he could use against me. Which may be another reason not to get revenge.

As I’m headed to check out, this dude makes a comment like “you’re really riding the healthy train today” (i was getting ready to meal prep so lots of veggie/fruit/chicken/rice etc in my cart) i laughed and said something like “i try” or some shit. Anyways he asks if i lift weights or play sports and we bullshitted for a minute about fitness and jiujitsu and other small talk, and then he mentioned how one of his mentors was able to retire early and blah blah blah, long story short he asked if he could pass my phone number to his mentor to contact me about some financial advice/opportunity and my dumbass actually gave him my number. I know it was stupid, and usually I’m a lot more reserved around people but last few days have been hectic and i wasn’t 100% there mentally. The big takeaways tho:
-he didn’t really give me any weird vibes
-he knows my first name
-has my phone number
-knows where i go to college
-knows when i go back to school after Christmas break
-knows some other small shit like i train jiujitsu, I’ll graduate in august, i worked at a golf course last summer

Once again, I know I’m stupid for giving him info, but for whatever reason at the time he wasn’t setting off any “weirdo alarms” in my head, which sketchy people usually do. Afterwards, however, I realized that wasn’t smart.

Im pretty sure a huge factor in it is the fact that most of her friend circle went out of state for college, her family being terrible people, and a new medication shes taking that leaves her hungry alot of the time, leading her to stress eat more. However, when I hung out with her for the week I was back home, she had just finished a crash diet and was eating pretty terribly with lots of processed foods.

I’ve never been cheated on before and I am not really sure how I should feel about the situation. The relationship, we both felt had been progressing well and so did mutual friends so this came as a bit of a shock.  I noticed that since Friday she hadn’t quite been herself most likely due to guilt I shrugged it off and thought maybe I was just overthinking obviously this wasn’t the case. I feel more embarrassed than anything else and I could tell that she regretted her actions when she told me. She was also messaging me last night saying “she didn’t deserve me” I was out for a friends birthday so was quite drunk and thought she was just being nice but it was clearly guilt and maybe some regret for her actions. 

I told her she wouldn’t be getting a second chance, I couldn’t be in a relationship where my trust for her was gone and also where if I stayed in the relationship I would’ve felt second best. I tried to ask her who it was she cheated with, not like I was going to do anything to them just so I knew, as she was in a place with some people I know, she said she couldn’t tell me that.

892,"Last week it was my cousin's birthday. He had a small party with some family members and some of his close friends. It's important that I mention that:

a) his parents are divorced and live far apart, like different cities apart. He stayed with his mother and his father visits once in a while. I travelled with him to the party (we're close). He also cares about himself a little too much

b) I don't connect easily with people, especially partner-wise. I didn't like most girls I got to know in my city since I feel we didn't have much in common, both in hobbies and personality. 

To the thing: at this party, my cousin introduced me to his friends. Mostly men and a couple of girls. One girl in particular, M., has known him since they were little. We got along very nicely, and that alone surprised me since I don't usually get along right away with people. At first, my uncle (that of course knows her since it's his son's childhood friend) asks us if we talked before this (which we didn't) and said ""well you two seem to get along nicely"". Which we were, can't deny that. Silly uncle making silly remarks, no biggie.

The party goes on. At one point, everyone was sitting around the table eating, and we're still chatting. My uncle decides to state again (this time to my cousin and the whole room) how we're getting along nicely and how we should date. I'm embarrassed (and so is she), but I figured he may have had a drink too much and left it at that. Things got a little tense but after a while I decided to go at it again and just have fun. After some more time, my uncle's at it again trying to convince my cousin'g gf to *convince M. to go out with me*. At that point I just gave up. And I feel that she did too. The party finished and we all went home. I came back to my city the morning after.

Problem is: I'm now crushing on M. Worse than usual, since I feel we were on the same wavelength for some things and I wanted to know her better. Aside the distance problem, there's the goddamn propaganda my uncle tried to slip by her that prevents me from contacting her again. *I* was repulsed by it, I can't imagine her.

I wanted to know your view on this and if you would act differently than I do. I've thought about it over and over and the only possible solution for this is to just wait and see if she contacts me first. I can't contact her after that dreadful show with my uncle and I won't be seeing her anytime soon. I know it's a no-brainer for most people and I should just let it go, but it's kinda difficult for me to connect with people, and to be able to just do it so easily with someone is something I've never experienced before and I wanted to give it a serious shot, for once.

897,"Hi! F23 here, looking for some life advice. 

I went to college for three years but was unfortunately dismissed for lack of drive and dedication to my studies due to lots of tough life things. I moved back to my hometown and I’ve been a nanny for a family of 6 kids under 9 for a year and a half (only watch 3 right now because of school). It’s m-w for 5 or 6 hours. I am also a server at an upper class restaurant 4 or 5 nights a week. 
I make okay money doing both, can’t complain too much. It’s nice that I have control of my schedule as a server and I can work more or less if I want too and I’ve grown really close with the kids I nanny but I’m just ready for more. I’ve been looking for jobs for a few months, getting discouraged that all I could seem to find that didn’t require a degree were basic,  customer service jobs. Finally, I found a really awesome opportunity as a personal assistant to the CEO of a company that started local and now has locations nationwide. The position is a bit of a mix between nanny and personal assistant. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with one little one and they have two primary schoolers. Responsibilities would include running errands, taking kids to school, occasionally traveling with them, scheduling things, and other tasks that would help their family. It’s full-time, M-F, but they said it would probably rarely be a full 40 hours. It’s a salary job (40,000/yr, pretty decent for where I live) and has awesome perks. I’ve had two web/phone interviews and I was asked to meet their family this week. I think it’s safe-ish to assume I will likely get the job.

Change is really hard for me. I love when I’m comfortable in a job and know exactly what to do and what is expected of me. This makes it hard to think about quitting my current nanny job and working maaaaybe 1-2 shifts a week at the restaurant. However, there is zero growth potential in both of these jobs. 

Do I accept the job if they offer it to me? Does it seem like a good idea to completely change my weekly routines for a position like this? 

Another tough part of this is that the mom and dad of the family I nanny for are never home at the same time together. The mom goes to work before I get there and comes home after I leave so how do I break the news that I am leaving them? I feel like a group text to both of them is a bit impersonal but I don’t know how else to do it. I told the CEO that the earliest I could start is the end of January so that I can give them enough time to find a great replacement for me. 

TD;LR New job opportunity that could lead me into career. Should I take the leap of faith or keep looking for something else? Also, how do I break the news to the family I currently nanny when the parents are never home together at the same time.

898,"Whether a car crash or I bit myself, I find myself hyper focusing on just being angry. All I fucking do is ask myself ""is what happened ok, did i deserve it, was it fair"" and if the answer is no then I can't get over it. The fucking motivational posters and edgy one liner advice of ""just move on"" and ""its ok to not be in control"" and ""shit happens to everyone"" somehow magically doesn't make me fucking feel better. Who would've guessed that shitty one liners don't magically fix whatever the fuck is wrong with me, but every time i google this or reserach it, that's the best advice? I wouldn't fucking be doing this shit or posting here if it was that easy.

I can't focus, I can't be productive, sometimes I am able to ""get back"" at society which I won't get into now, but when I can't or don't it takes me hours to move on. I literally just smashed my fucking keyboard cause I couldn't type in a whatsapp web window for 5 seconds.

Now that two of my keyboard leds are broken, i'm fucking livid. I blame ""the world"". But now I have to do errands that are due tonight and I refuse to. Why should I fucking be productive. In what universe do I accept what happens to me, bend over, smile, and move on with my day. Oh I bit myself then broke my keyboard, how normal, time to be productive and be nice to others.

I get the world isn't fair, I don't want special treatment, I don't think i'm better than everyone else, so I don't think i qualify as a regular narcissist, but why should I be ok with bad things happening to me. Actually it's not even that, one or two bad things happening are normal, when it's a string of bad things, and the probability is 1/100000 but it happens like once a week, then I just fucking lose it.

I remember another thing I read to ""move on"" from bad things. ""ask yourself how you'll feel in an hour, a week, a year"". Well I can say that even a year later some things still piss me the fuck off cause at the end of the day, what happened to me was not ok.

And then I think of ""well a fucking baby born in africa with cancer that dies at age 5 wasn't ok"". The fuck does that have to do with me. No it wasn't ok. If i was in that situation i'd be fucking pissed. Bullied kids, abused people, rape victims, bla bla bla. No I don't think what happened to me was worse than them, in fact I think more people should lash out at what's unfair. I literally empathize with school shooters. Pushed to the brink and then they lash out and people go ""damn what a loser"". The fuck?!

Other advice is ""you're only punishing yourself by being angry"" and you know, it actually makes sense a bit, but I can't be rational when I'm angry. I am pissed, and what happened to me was wrong, and it feels WRONG to just ""breathe and move on"" or whatever normal people do. 

been to a top rated therapist twice, not sure it helped, in fact since therapists try to empathize so much and say others are worse, it made me feel less guilty about what i do.",15Dec2019,1
899,"&amp;#x200B;

As a background, my dad passed away about 5 years ago. About 3 years ago, my mom started dating again. However, the first guy ended up being a colossal asshole, and the second guy turned out to be an alcoholic. (she got out of those situations pretty quick, but she was pretty heartbroken for a while about the first guy's change of heart).

Flash forward to a few months ago, when I'm about to leave for college for the first time. She name drops a guy, but I think it's a friend or coworker I don't remember. Turns out she's seeing someone. I immediately get a weird taste in my mouth and are apprehensive every time she brings him up when she texts me about him.

So the next few months pass and I hear about him occasionally. My mom texts one day asking if it's okay that his daughter plays with my old dolls. I don't mind kids and say it's fine but I still feel weird and a little embittered.

A month ago was the first time I'm home since I left, Thanksgiving. I meet the guy for the first time, and I (for reasons I can't quite explain verbally) was pretty cold to him, giving pretty short answers to his questions and leaving the room as soon as I can.

I guess my whole problem is that my mom has already gotten pretty close with the guy while I barely know him. I'm still weird-ed out she's dating again, coupled with the fact the last two guys were problematic and all I feel is dread and discomfort.

So I'm asking for advice about 2 things:

\-How can I stop myself from being so pessimistic about their relationship?

\-How can I make myself be more open to their relationship and willing to get along with the guy?

Asking because I'm coming home at the end of the week for a month and I'm bound to run into the guy at least once. Any suggestions are appreciated, since it's the holiday season I don't want my weird emotions about all this to get in the way.",15Dec2019,1

I know I could be good at something if i worked a lot at it, but idk if i have it in me anymore. The nurse prescribed me meds, but now that i've been getting a little better idk if its worth it. I don't wanna fall into a deep pit again and be reliant on something, but at the same time idk if it will help. I'd feel guilty to have medication help me for some reason aswell.

904,"I work 3rd shift at 24 hour breakfast stop. We are known for crazy happenings but my specific location is in a pretty good area. I serve hundreds of people during my work weekend. Only a few customers stand out. Regulars, exuberant tippers, and the occasional Karen’s. I love my job and I love the variety of people I get to talk to every day however, I just discovered a craigslist post on the “missed connections” about me. Basically saying “I want to ask you out but I don’t know your name. Respond with my car type if you felt it too” and 4 days after it was posted, they updated it saying they found out my name. I usually don’t wear a name tag and I don’t name my tickets, mostly because I’m weird about people I don’t know calling me by my name and making it personal (weird I know)   So basically the advice I need is: what should I do? Should I respond and find out who it is? Should I prepare myself for a threat? I have no idea how to respond to it honestly",15Dec2019,1

He made a bet that he would have sex with a girl at a party and lost, and he says its because he didnt feel like it or something like that. But later on, he started insulting me infront of some new friends of his just to get them to laugh. He constantly sorrounds himself with people who worship him for being muscular, they even call him hercules and shit like that. Anyway so i tried talking to him about it, i said ""Dude i feel as if we're losing our friendship, i cant just blame you but im not really sure what i did wrong, But you have been ignoring me at school, insulting me, and talked shit behind my back and it kinda hurts dude"" he replied with ""tell me one time i did that"" and i did, bu he replied again saying ""Oh that was nothing dont overexaggarate""  So i cant even confront him about it.

912,"I’m finishing my undergraduate degree at St. Joseph’s College this semester.  My final day of classes is December 22nd and final grades are due by December 24th.

My plan was to attend TAMUCC’s online MBA program for their spring semester.  Their deadline for document submission is January 16th.

For some reason, SJC won’t be conferring my graduation until the 31st of January.  TAMUCC requires confirmation of my degree conferment by the 16th, otherwise I won’t be permitted to enroll.

SJC is refusing to make any exceptions in processing my conferment any sooner, and TAMUCC won’t enroll me until they’re confirmed that I’ve graduated.

What upsets me, is that it’s going to take SJC over a month after my final day of classes to confirm that I’ve graduated, and they’re refusing to do anything to expedite the process so I can enroll at TAMUCC.  SJC hasn’t been shy about reminding me that it wouldn’t be too late to enroll in their MBA program, which I have zero interest in...

This seems like a complete scheme to try and get me to enroll in the MBA program at SJC instead of TAMUCC.  Has anyone been in a similar situation in the past?  I really don’t want a two week time frame of delayed conferment processing be the reason to delay my enrollment at TAMUCC...",15Dec2019,1

915,"so I've had a pretty difficult past few months. in august I stood up to a very toxic online friend I'd been confined to for two years, and I don't regret it but I lost virtually all the friends I had in that group because of it-- this friend stretched the story to its limit. here's what happened-- no embellishments, I promise-- I misread the tone of one of her texts as passive aggressive and politely told her I wasn't trying to attack her. she got angry at me for assuming SHE was angry and I apologized at first but then I told her I thought that was unfair. she blew up at me and I blocked her on all platforms. she proceeded to tell all of our friends how ""manipulative"" I am and ""expose"" me. I've honest to God looked at this incident from all angles and I think it's fair to say she was objectively being horrible. for a few weeks after this incident, I didn't have any friends because I'd been plagued by crippling social anxiety for the past two years and my online friends were all I'd had. fortunately though, soon enough i found the courage in myself to join a theatre group because theatre is one of my passions. I got a big role that I loved in the play we were doing and made some good friends. we worked on the performance for two months and it ended up being a huge success. the next program will be in march and I can't wait. I still hang out with my theatre friends-- every other week-- but recently I discovered that my friend group didn't invite me to see a performance with them, and we always do everything together so this really hurt my feelings. I'm not a confrontational kind of person so I'm forced to kind of just sit with it, and that's lame. I think they must think I'm boring, which is even worse than them not liking me. it makes sense, though-- I want them to like me so badly that I hide most facets of my real personality in their vicinity, and so I can understand if I'd come off as uninteresting. I know that if they'd judge me for me then they're probably not good friends, but still. they're my only friends. if i lost them I'd be miserable and lonely again and I wouldn't know where else to look for new friends, and I'm homeschooled which makes this situation so much harder. but now that I know how they feel about me, it feels futile to keep trying anyways. I feel so shitty and my trust in people has been breached again and there isn't a thing I can do about it. I can't talk to anyone in my life about it because, A, I don't want to take advantage of them, B, don't want them to think I'm weak or get worried about me, and C-- there's already so much i haven't talked about that I'd have to cover and that would take a lot of effort and courage that I just don't have right now. I'm trying to recover from things I don't talk about and it's so hard.
I also.... have a big secret I've never told anyone in real life. it's not,, bad,,, it's just super fucking embarrassing. ah geez. i don't know why it's so anxiety inducing to admit this, but... during those two years I was stuck with that toxic friend, I was obsessed with roleplaying. there's already sort of a stigma around people who roleplay online but that's not the really embarrassing part. what I'm so embarrassed about is that the reason that person was my best friend was because we were roleplay partners and we roleplayed a ship that's sort of considered taboo. a lot of people deem it abusive but most people hate it just because, well, to be fair... it's stupid and entirely unrealistic. It is the poster child ship of ""cringy"". I got sucked into it when I was 14 and going through an extremely hard time and it just sort of became my number one coping mechanism for two years. if I'd discovered it now, I definitely wouldn't see the appeal in it, but my mind was pretty malleable back then. anyways, it's ridiculous and irrational, but I'm beyond mortified that the people in my life will find out about it and Judge me. my parents and therapist have already told me that nothing could make them have less respect for me, and I believe them, but there's nothing logical about irrational fears. no matter what they say, I will be terrified that they'll find out and think less of me. I can't feel like any of my friendships are real because I feel like if they knew then they'd hate me. it's a ridiculous thing to be scared of, but again, anxiety knows no logic. 
I'm also still dealing with the damage that losing all my online friends did to my confidence. :')

917,"Hi Reddit. Not sure where to post this, so hope this is the right place. Going to give some background info for context.

This past October, my mom called me and told me that her father (my grandfather, in his 70s) has liver cancer. The doctor said he had maybe 6-9 months, 6 at best. He also has severe diabetes (diagnosed last year) and has to go on dialysis three times a week. For those of you who don’t know what that is, he essentially has a pump/tube thing in his arm. It gets hooked up to a machine at the hospital that cleans his blood for him, more or less. Anyway, the diabetes makes things even more complicated as a lot of the cancer treatments will harm his liver/kidneys, which are already running dangerously low. They have him on a new pill, but the survival rate is minuscule. When my mom found out about the cancer, she flew to where he lives to stay for a month. While she was there, she saw nutritionists and made an extensive meal plan for him. What’s weird is a year ago from when she found out about the cancer, my dads father passed away. Anyway, that’s the gist of the background info. 

My parents have been divorced since I was 5. I’m not very close with my mom (we’ve had issues in the past). However I do visit my grandparents every summer (they live across the country). My mom, stepdad, and brother and I are going to visit him in a week. It will be his last Christmas. 

I just need advice on how I should act. I don’t know what to say to him or anyone else, knowing that when I see him will be the last time. It’s giving me high anxiety. I don’t have a connection with my mom (at least not a great one) so I’m not even sure how to act around her. She is emotionally draining on a good day, and it’s taken a lot for me to come back from the negative impacts of that relationship. I know I’m there for my gpa of course, but I’m scared for my own mental health. It’s conflicting. I just want to make sure I can support my family emotionally, but I don’t know if I can. A year ago, I lost my other gpa (dads father) and I was very close to him. Then, 2 days after his death, my best friend lost her brother suddenly who I was close friends with. I know what’s coming when I go to visit my sick gpa and I don’t know if I can handle it again. Last year’s deaths almost broke me, among a myriad of other things. Any and all advice would be appreciated.

Tldr; worried the neighbours kid is in an abusive household. Dad has anger issues, kid seems sick all the time. Need confirmation that i need to inform youth services.

My neighbours moved in a year ago. Ever since we first seen their child (1,5 or 2 years old) me (30) and my GF (31) had the feeling things werent right. He looks sick 24/7, pale skin, tired etc. We didnt see the kid much outside, but it was winter so we didnt think much of it. 

So summer went by and we both noticed that the kid was rarely outside Although my neighbours have a large garden. We know this for a fact since my GF was home all summer due to pregnancy leave and spent most time in the garden. Even when the kid was outside it was only for max 10 mins  when his mom was smoking a sigaret. 

During summer we both noticed my neigbour, the dad, yells at the kid. Not normal yelling, but from deep down maximum rage. Couple of weeks ago i learned he has anger issues. This is what the neighbours wife told me. 

Last thing that i noticed is that they are always negative to the kid. Dont do this, dont do that, no, no , stop that etc. The kid is now 2 years and can't say  a word. Not even mom or dad. 

The houses are really well isolated so i can only hear this when i am outside and they have the windows opened. I also payed attention to possible bruises, but i couldnt see any.

We are really worried that the kid is in an abusive household. But what to do? We both dont feel like talking to the neighbours and calling youth services seems the right thing to do. 

So is it us interpreting the whole situation wrong? Or do we need to call youth services?",15Dec2019,1

I feel like it is something that was meant for me. But then I looked at society and whenever I think of anybody I know no guy is a teacher for elementary school and below. It’s all women and that concerned me that this is something I want to do but men don’t do child care. I wanted other people’s opinion on this. Like what should I do? Go back to astrology or pilot even though I really don’t feel a spark although I enjoy it? Or should I go to what I feel like was meant for me even though when I look around and it’s not really something that is often?",15Dec2019,1

949,"so I've talked to my friends about this and ive been getting mixed reactions and answers so here I am on reddit.

a little background: I am 17F and my bf is/was 18M and before him I had never done anything apart from making out with people but nothing sexual. And im trying to figure out if it was a toxic relationship or not. 

\- So I had only consented to do stuff one time out of the 4 months that we dated and one time he convinced me to suck his dick so my condition was that he doesn't finish In my mouth he was sad and mad but said fine so there I was, I asked how close he was and he said 98% so naturally I go to take it out of my mouth but when I went to finish it with a hand job, he took my arms, restrained them and then grabbed my head and continued to push it deeper to the point where he moved it for me until I gagged and he finished in my mouth. I cried and kept saying how he didn't know that I didn't want him to do that.  

\-  we would be playing on my switch just chilling and he'd start coming onto me and id be like ""I thought we were just gonna have chill day"" to which he'd respond to along the lines of ""this is chill"" and sometimes he'd say ""but you're too hot to day no"". 

\- He also proceeded to take my pants and underwear off for me even after I said no. He always used the phrase ""babe please im going to go to college soon and we won't be able to see each other that much anymore""

\- he hated when I chose to hang out with my friends after hanging out with him for hours, he also thought I was dating my best friend which was annoying 

\- there were days where I wanted him to go home because all he'd ever want to do was have sex and drink wine and nothing else and it got exhausting to the point where id go to the kitchen and drink 5 cups of water to pass time.

\- in the 4-5 months that we dated I never once went to his house or met his family even though he met my family and stuff right away 

\- he invited himself to a concert that I was going with my friends and got mad that we didn't have room in the car and that the concert got rained out where as we enjoyed running in the rain and made good memories out of it. he also made a few rape jokes infant of them and didn't understand any social cues.

\- apart from those things he was a genuinely good guy who seemed to care about me and it took a lot of convincing from my friends for me to get the courage to break up with him.

953,"My husband and I are super close with a mentor type “dad” type figure in our lives. He gives advice and support and encouragement in our marriage and parenting advice and has truly become like another dad to us—the kind of dad that is so wonderful and kind and supportive and emotionally safe and runs around playing frisbee with his (even grown up!) kids. The kind of person you can tell your secrets to and know they don’t judge you and just want to be there for you. And tells you frequently all the ways you are doing really awesome in life and as a person and he just is beaming with pride when he says it. You just feel so *seen* as a person when he looks at you. 

My actual dad loves me SO SO much and was always super overprotective of me, and he felt so worried about not being able to provide for his family so he buried himself at work sooo much to make sure we’d have insurance and be able to survive. We didn’t have a ton of money or anything but we always had food on the table. He would tell us all the time he loves us and is proud of us. But he was always so drained from work and was a major introvert anyway so I feel like I was frequently not really able to connect with him or have much quality time hardly ever. My parents were really strict too so I never had the close friendship sort of relationship either. 

I feel guilty because I was kept safe and know I am loved and they try to be so generous as much as they can. I tell them soo much how grateful I am and I truly do recognize how lucky I am that I had even what I did. Heck, they even realize they have a lot of regrets in how I was raised and wish they parented more like how they see we’re parenting our son. So I feel like I should not be sad. But I just can’t help but feel some sadness at what I’ve missed out on when I see our mentor dad type figure interact with his adult kids and how emotionally close they have always been and still are. I really wish I could’ve had that kind of closeness with my actual dad too.

I’ll use some simple math to explain why:

You and your partner aren’t just 50% of your relationship, respectively. Rather, you’re both 100% of the relationship because if someone were to remove one of you from it, 100% of the relationship would be gone.

Therefore, if one of you is unhappy with the relationship, both of you are unhappy because the relationship itself isn’t entirely happy.

I thought I was dogshit to all women and their bfs and that I was a waste of space, even though I brought it on myself. I failed out of college this year and I’m worried about stuff. Now I really want that degree again and will take it seriously. Unfortunately my path has had its obstacles. My uncle who I loved was trapped in a burning building and died, so I’ve been taking care of his house sale. Because of that it’s now even harder to get that degree. And finally, this part is true as well, no lie. Week after my uncle died, I got into a horrible religious crisis and was scared straight of going to Hell for five months.  It cost me lots of sleep and made me feel horrible, listening to the fact I deserve to be burning for all eternity and that the only way out was by being a radical Christian.  This fear of eternal flames latched on to me very tightly for five whole months and it wouldn’t shut up about it until three weeks ago.

My first few months here really haven’t been great. I don’t care for the culture, I find it very hard to make friends here, and I don’t like the culture and pace of life.

966,"Hi! 23 here, looking for some life advice. 

I went to college for three years but was unfortunately dismissed for lack of drive and dedication to my studies due to lots of tough life things. I moved back to my hometown and I’ve been a nanny for a family of 6 kids under 9 for a year and a half (only watch 3 right now because of school). It’s m-w for 5 or 6 hours. I am also a server at an upper class restaurant 4 or 5 nights a week. 
I make okay money doing both, can’t complain too much. It’s nice that I have control of my schedule as a server and I can work more or less if I want too and I’ve grown really close with the kids I nanny but I’m just ready for more. I’ve been looking for jobs for a few months, getting discouraged that all I could seem to find that didn’t require a degree were basic,  customer service jobs. Finally, I found a really awesome opportunity as a personal assistant to the CEO of a company that started local and now has locations nationwide. The position is a bit of a mix between nanny and personal assistant. The wife is a stay-at-home mom with one little one and they have two primary schoolers. Responsibilities would include running errands, taking kids to school, occasionally traveling with them, scheduling things, and other tasks that would help their family. It’s full-time, M-F, but they said it would probably rarely be a full 40 hours. It’s a salary job (40,000/yr, pretty decent for where I live) and has awesome perks. I’ve had two web/phone interviews and I was asked to meet their family this week. I think it’s safe-ish to assume I will likely get the job.

Change is really hard for me. I love when I’m comfortable in a job and know exactly what to do and what is expected of me. This makes it hard to think about quitting my current nanny job and working maaaaybe 1-2 shifts a week at the restaurant. However, there is zero growth potential in both of these jobs. 

Do I accept the job if they offer it to me? Does it seem like a good idea to completely change my weekly routines for a position like this? 

Another tough part of this is that the mom and dad of the family I nanny for are never home at the same time together. The mom goes to work before I get there and comes home after I leave so how do I break the news that I am leaving them? I feel like a group text to both of them is a bit impersonal but I don’t know how else to do it. I told the CEO that the earliest I could start is the end of January so that I can give them enough time to find a great replacement for me. 

TD;LR New job opportunity that could lead me into career. Should I take the leap of faith or keep looking for something else? Also, how do I break the news to the family I currently nanny when the parents are never home together at the same time.

A bit of background: A year and a half ago (March 2018) I (26F) got sexually assaulted by my on/off partner at that time. Since that horrible night I've been working through a lot of crap, ranging from claustrophobia to crying fits. 
Today I'm doing really well. I see a therapist and take care of myself. I'm no longer claustrophobic, I'm open about what happened and stand my ground really well. Came out of the ordeal a lot stronger. Friends that know what happened are there to push me when I get stuck of triggered. 
The person (""D"") that assaulted me knows what they did and saw the damage they did to me (the change in me was night and day) but no charges were filed. 

So what's the problem? As the title said, I have awful nightmares, especially when stressed. Right now I'm feeling the pressure for university coursework. Last Saturday I woke up from one again. It's more or less the same thing: ""D"" and I stuck in the same room and nobody helping me or hearing my pleas to get out of the room. ""D"" is mad at me (""D"" is at least a full head bigger than me and has at least 100lb on me) and continously makes the horrible comments they used to while we were together and makes accusations.

969,"Quick story: work for a multinational at the HQ for one of the firms largest arms. About 1,200 people in this office. 

M23, F23-30

I’ve noticed this girl at the office gym several times. She’s just really cute and I’m interested. 

I found out she works at the same company but on a totally different team, with little to no interaction. Her desk is on the complete opposite side of the building. 

Turns out though she had emailed me about something last week, I gave her a buzz and discussed over the phone and WOW, she was incredibly nice, friendly and appreciative. This is the first time we have ever communicated and I looked her up in our company directory that’s how I knew who she was. 

*(Before anyone says creepy, jeez it’s just a way to see the team she’s on etc. I do this for every new contact that comes through, it also tells the desk location phone ext, who their boss is, etc.)*

I don’t know for sure if she knows who I am or what I look like, or did the same in the org chart etc. 

I’ve thought about just swinging by her desk this week to finish resolving the matter she originally reached out about and introducing myself in person, or even doing so at the gym, but this would assume she has connected a face to a name.  And id just say “Hey, name” for example. 

I know this is typically advised against relationships in the workplace, *however* I am in the process of leaving the firm and joining a new company, which will likely be complete in 3-4 months.  This isn’t really an issue now as this is such a down the road matter, since I’m not even certain if she knows who I am aside from finding a guys email in the company directory and reaching out at the direction of her boss. 

I will say that going by her desk and introducing might be a little unnecessary /(weird?), but based on our phone call, I doubt she’d take it that way. I only say this because what I need can easily be done over email and as a professional I know time is valuable for both of us. 

Any advice here? 

My objective: I would like to get to know her and let her know, in a non creepy, somewhat subtle way, that I am interested, but also have an easy non awkward “out” explanation whatever you wanna call it to defend my actions and act is if she just got a wrong read, in the case she’s not feeling it at all.

To be clear: if I were to introduce at work, it would literally only be an introduction and professional conversation about the business dealing. Nothing else. Then maybe it’d open a door to say hi if I see her working out or something? After thinking about it a bit here as I typed, maybe it makes more sense to go this route given that I can say I literally just stopped by talked about work and introduced myself since it’s the first time having interacted. 

I will be honest she was super cool, friendly and kind on the phone and I even made her laugh. She was both appreciative of my efforts and apologetic of the extra burden of work.

TLDR; 23M 23-30?F. Girl I’ve noticed at the office fitness center, happens to work for the same company (1200 employee), coincidentally she is doing work for her team on a mutual assignment, she emailed me for assistance/info.

Me and my short term girlfriend are having our first child.

I met the love of my life over a month ago, I realise this isn't a long timed I know this sounds cheesy but when we first made eye contact,, I just wanted to marry her then and there! We've been together almost everyday since and we've loved every second of it! I can't stop thinking about her...

The first time we had sex was her time to get pregnant... I didn't wear a condom, the rest is self explanatory..

She told me yesterday night that we're having a baby and honestly, I've never really wanted a child or at least not now, I couldn't stop smiling! I was overwhelmed with happiness.

She is super excited to be a mum and I know she'd be an amazing parent, and I feel I'd be a great dad too - but we're kakking ourselves.. I know this is only natural but we're not exactly in the best situation in life. I work full-time at a job that doesn't pay the best, while living in a foreign country and her visa runs out in a few months while working at a low pay nanny job!

Our main concern is finding a country we can both live in and settle down, somewhere we can make a decent living to raise this child as best as humanly possible. That's all we want.

Im SUPPER nervous and we can't bring ourselves to tell our parents. 

The other thing is neither of us have met each others parents... so that's a thing! 

I think I'm really looking for first time parent advice or advice from parents who have had a child youngish and how they got through it. I need some positivity in my life right now.

I get mostly A’s and have a 3.9 cumulative GPA and like basketball and guitar. I’m slightly above average looking. But I’m short 5’7.5” and on the high end of a healthy weight (160lbs). Is there any chance I could find a girlfriend? If so, how?",15Dec2019,1
977,"I'm probably a pathological perfectionist, and I am pretty sure I have some form of depression. 

My parents are Asian and mental health is a big ""no no"" topic. I told my mom (house mom, quit job when I was 5 to care for me because I was showing symptoms of anxiety or something) back in high school that I wanted to kill myself and she essentially told me that I wasn't depressed and that if I ever say something like that again, she will kill herself too because she spent her whole life caring for me (only child) and there is no point in her living if her child is ungrateful for life. 

6 years later, I've been hiding my depression from everyone but I don't think I can keep it up anymore and know that I need to seek help, but my college psychologists are too busy for me to make an appointment with them, and I'm not sure where to start.

Do I talk to my primary care physician and have her refer me to therapists/psychologists? Do I just find one myself? And, once I get a therapist, if I use my family insurance and my debit card for the co-pay, will my parents receive some sort of letter saying that insurance was used for mental health services? 

Many of you will probably suggest that I talk to my parents about it, but my dad and I don't really talk (he's not my biological father and we've never talked to each other about anything serious.. our conversations are only ever about farts, pooping, or our dog), and I don't want to tell my mom because of what happened before and I would rather not make her sad or think that this her fault in any way because she means everything to me and I just want to get help and become better without her knowing that I'm struggling. I have a boyfriend, but he doesn't really understand what it's like to be depressed regardless of the information I've tried to send him and he just tells me to ""be happier."" It's also finals season and I don't want to be selfish and distract my friends from the work they need to be doing right now.

I'm sorry if a similar question has been posted before - I don't really know how to use the search function within subreddits :(",15Dec2019,1
978,"I'm not sure what kind of advice I cant get, but I'm a teenager boy and all the hair in my body makes me extremely uncomfortable. My parents once noticed that I feel very uncomfortable when using anything other than pants because of the hair in my legs, that makes me ashamed. I told them that I don't like the hair in my legs, but the only things they told me are like ""you should feel comfortable with your body  the way it is"" and ""you dont want to SHAVE do you?"", because shaving my leg would be a ""gay"" thing to do.  I never really tried to tell my parents that I would like to shave because I fear what they might say.

I feel ashamed and disgusted of my body, besided all the physical discomfort I feel in more private parts.

My english may be a bit shitty because it's not my primary language.",15Dec2019,1

980,"I had a roommate move in to my house about 10 months ago under the assumption that they only needed a place for 3 months top. The problem is they are still here. The problem is that they don't really mesh well with the rest of the people in the house. No fights or anything, but just kinda of awkward situations. Is there a way I can ask them to move out without causing any hard feelings? I'm a very non confrontational person and don't want to make a scene or come off as a jerk.",15Dec2019,1
