0,"I always have the constant need create something or lead, sometimes I feel depressed or feel like improving my life, and then I'm back to my old unhealthy ways of living. Could this be Bipolar disorder? Is there any way to help this and make it a little better?",29Nov2019,1
1,"So I’m sitting here in my room trying to sob quietly so my family doesn’t hear. It’s thanksgiving. My brother is really creepy and spied on me a couple years back and I don’t feel safe around him anymore. He’s really starting to deteriorate for some reason cause I think my opinion means a lot to him but I’m very distant and for good reasons. When I was friendly to him a year or so ago he started to make really strange remarks which put the walls straight back up again. 

But it’s starting to get serious. I think he might actually be dangerous. He’s really anxiety ridden and always tries to make me laugh and get my attention but I just ignore him cause he freaks me out so much. I’m really afraid he’s going to snap one day and hurt me, my parents, or himself. And my family blames me for his odd behavior. 

I’m trying to keep the details minimal in case he comes across this. I’ve already made my weird feelings towards him apparent and I guess have been pretty cold but like when I started to be nice to him he started being weird and honestly, I’m really afraid of him. And I’m starting to worry a lot. He still lives at home and may never move out. And I’m about to graduate college. 

I love him and everything and want things to be okay but I don’t think I’ll ever get over this. And idk what to do",29Nov2019,1
2,"So a little story. Me (18M) and 2 coworkers were hanging out during our breaks. One being my friend and the other just a guy in his mid 30s being nice. He asked if any of us were dating and I said that I was trying. He said “You know, (crush) has a crush on you.” My eyebrows went up to which I turned my head to my friend and he nodded ‘no’. They then laughed which I understood was a joke and so I chuckled about it. The guy then said “But seriously, (we’ll call her Kate) has a crush on you. She goes out of her way to say ‘goodbye’ if she sees you leaving.” My friend then nodded ‘yes’.

Now my crush is attractive, smart, social butterfly, a nice and happy person. Kate is one of those depressed girls. Doesn’t really take care of herself and is always groans when a manager comes by, tells her what to do in a nice manner, then leaves.

The problem I have is that I always avoid my crush. Like if I see her in the back room, then I won’t go into the back room until she leaves. Meanwhile I go out of my way to say “Hi” to girls like Kate and compliment them. I also am not myself around my crush. I try to be cool, laid back, and smart. Meanwhile when I’m around girls like Kate I act like my stupid, funny, childish self.

I don’t understand why I do it. I always tell myself “I won’t with this girl” but then I end up doing it. Maybe it’s because I fear that she will have a boyfriend or reject me. But when my friend nodded ‘no’ I wasn’t upset about it. I just kind of shrugged it off and accepted it. I’m probably going to attend community college soon and I need some help when it comes to getting a date. 

How do I get over this habit? How do I break the mold and say “screw it.” It’s easier said than done. How do you be yourself around an attractive girl?",29Nov2019,1
3,"I changed my number a while back and have made the best attempt to tell everyone. However, there have been a few important texts that got sent to my old phone number from family and friends. The guy who got my number cusses them out, makes them think I will be at huge events (my younger cousin's adoption I ended up not knowing about because he said I was coming) and generally saying horrible things to people. Is there anyway to put this guy through phone call hell as retribution for being a terrible person to strangers?",29Nov2019,1
4,"I’ve been seeing a guy and honestly I’ve never felt this way before. So excited to see him again even though we only hung for like 6 hours, once. I smile every time I think of him, I keep imagining scenarios/conversations, I keep finding excuses to talk about him.... yeah it’s a crush. Luckily he likes me too.

But in the past (with other guys I’ve dated) I’ve always been like: he’s kind of annoying... don’t like his clothing style... his haircut is questionable... etc.

NONE OF THAT. None. I don’t give a shit. He’s cute in every way.

But every time I talk about him, my best friend kind of looks at me weird? Or just seems a little disinterested. I feel judged. It’s making me a little self conscious but I can’t tell if it’s due to anxiety? I used to really worry about what others thought, but now? Rarely ever. I kind of try to talk it down to not being a big deal now and try to not mention him. 

It’s not even because I talk about him a lot, because I’ve heard about the same thing with her mom all week and she’s heard about toxic ex a million times and we try to be equally as interested every time. 

She has a boyfriend herself and she talks about him too and stuff.

Idk?? Am I overthinking? Like? She’s happy for me, no doubt. Would you react differently? Maybe she’s trying not to show emotion so it won’t effect how I feel about him?",29Nov2019,1
6,"Me and my gf were having intercourse 2 days ago, using a condom of course. When I was about to finish, I took condom off to finish on her stomach/chest area. Unbeknownst to me, some of my cum dropped straight down onto her vagina. This was dumb of me, I know, but she was luckily smart enough to cover the majority of her vagina with her hand. Her hand caught the majority of it, but I saw some stuck in between her fingers. I ran to go get a towel and she stood up to prevent it from running down her fingers. We got a towel and wiped her vagina/pubic area and her hand. I didn’t look at her vagina before she wiped it, so I don’t know if any actually got on it. If it would’ve landed on her, it would’ve landed on her clitoris area. According to her period tracking app, which she has been using for a year, she doesn’t ovulate for another 6 days, so that’s 8 days from the day of the incident. What are the odds that she’s pregnant? Any insight is much appreciated

Edit: Just a note, we wiped her vagina with a towel multiple times with 2 different towels and she was on cycle day 9 out of 31",29Nov2019,1
7,"The last 3 years of my life:

Hello, im a 20yr old male i graduated school about 3 years ago, i wasn’t the best in the class in highschool most of the times i didn’t study but i always did OK/AVERAGE In the tests ( 70 - 85), i decided to study civil engineering because i really like the career and it interest me a lot, im from Panama, i graduated in December of 2017 and in January i started going to the u, i studied 1 semester and i didn’t like it there so i started searching for universities in other countries i discovered Tec de Monterrey in Mexico, Monterrey. Also a friend was going there( one of my best friends) so we decided to live together in mexico. 

In my first semester i did Average like in school,i had a lot of trouble making friends by myself because im really shy and self-conscious( im always changing my physical appearance from skinny to bulked up to skinny again changing hairstyles every years, etc) but my friend is an extrovert he makes friends very easy, so all my friends here that i know have been presented by him and i made really really great friends that i love here in mexico

In my second semester it wasn’t that good i had 6 subjects and i failed 2 of them; 1 for excessive absences and the other because i didn’t went to the second exam, my mom told me to do better but it wasnt that big of a deal BTW( both of my parents did incredible well at school and studied  university in very good places my mom went to brasil to study odontology and my dad studied pharmacy in NYC, my mom got her PhD in panama an had the magna cum laude best in her class i think. but my dad didn’t finish his PhD he started it but he didn’t finish it idk why) but they really never demanded me to get good grades they tell me all the time that i just need to give it my all and pass the subjects because when you really learn is when you graduate and work in the field/office 

In my third semester is when all went to shit i was failing all of my subjects and had to drop the semester it wasn’t because it was hard but i couldn’t get my self to go the classes we have 3 exams in my university, i did average in the first one and i didn’t go to the second ones. I called my mom at the end of the semester and obviously she freaked out and told me to call my father( my father is my everything he’s such a good person and has been through a lot in his life: his father died about 10 years ago and left him a good amount of money and a company with her sisters, they decided to sell the company and split the money, my father started his own pharmacy here in Panama and put a lot of money in it and unfortunately it didn’t work he was unemployed and we had a very tough time with money but they really didn’t tell me and my sister about it he went through a lot, but eventually he got a really good job in the construction field and got himself into a really really really good position a few year in the job but the bad part its that he’s only in Panama 4 days every 2 weeks and goes to china a lot) so i called him and he told me told me that i cant be failing like that but he knows the most important thing is not how you fall its how you get up, i went to panama and they told me they were gonna give me one last chance. And i went to the psychiatrist and she told that i almost felt into depression and had anxiety. I worked in the meantime with a psychologist for about 2 months 

Fourth and current semester same thing happened i did ok at the first exams and didnt went to the second ones( after the second exams had past i told my self i was going to email the teacher to give me a chance to do them late but i couldn’t email them because i was afraid, i spent most of time going to bed at 5/6 am, not going to my classes, and eating 1 time per day, im really a weird person because i dont feel like im depressed because i like to go out with my friends a lot and talk to my family, but what i have  realized it that i never talk about me or my feelings (im always the funny guy) i have a hard time talking about my feelings to anyone and i find it so weird because i love hearing other people problems and give them advice from the heart, i think i dont talk about my feelings because i dont know what i really feel most of the times it seems like i got comfortable with staying in my bed and watching movies/youtube to disconnect my self from reality, and my friends text me all the time to go out to eat and hang out, i go out and have a good time. 

i have a hard time going to classes i dont know why i really like them and the teachers are incredible i just cant go after the first exams, i lied to myself and convince me everyday that tomorrow im going to email the teachers to do the mid terms but i just cant do it 

 i need to tell my mom that i’ve failed once agains and it really hurts me to disappoint my parents they ask me for 1 thing and i cant do it, i dont really know what to tell them , what should i do? Feel free to ask any questions about my life thanks to everyone for the help i really appreciate it right now.",29Nov2019,1
8,We broke up about 3 months ago and I still think about her all the time. She was my gf for a year and we broke up due to distance and mental health.

I’m 16 (currently in high school) and I’m looking for a job over the summer. I have never had one so I don’t know what I need. Do I need to open a bank account? How many hours should I work? How do I apply?, Things like that. I wish I could talk to my parents, but they won’t even touch the subject.

10,"I’m 15 and this started back when my mom started kissing my on the neck. At first I didn’t think much of it but then i searched on google “is it weird my mom kisses me on my neck” and some guys said “yes wtf” others no she’s your mother.





Fast forward I stopped letting my mom kiss me, hug me or even touch me. When she touches me I feel uncomfortable (very) like in a sexual way. I don’t find her attractive or anything and would never think about it.




Now my brother who I know isn’t gay when he touches me I freak out and fele disgusted like it’s ruined my life. My mom would Hugh my brother or kiss him on the cheek and I get depressed and angry but I’m positive they are sexual, idk? Today my brother was laying on my mother. He’s 17.






They spend a lot of time together &amp; this has pushed me away from them. I hate them both now &amp;  ever since this all started I stopped caring about life in general. I stopped taking care of myself, stopped going to school, showering or leaving the house.




My cousin who is a male he puts his legs on me sometimes or he’s 21 and i don’t think he’s gay. He had a girlfriend has had a lots of sex. He also sometimes puts his legs on my brother and gets kind of touches but my brothers fat and ugly,,,




I’m honestly done with life at this point I don’t Know what to do but just cry I am rude to my family I can’t look at them literally. If my mom or brother were to die I wouldn’t feel anything at all now. If anything was to happen I wouldn’t fee anything





I just want to die &amp; get out of this hell. I what do I do? It’s ruining me and has already ruined my life.",29Nov2019,1
12,"I am a mid 20s guy who has no real motivation to do anything fun or productive besides work. I have a good paying job, I have a bachelors degree in Accounting, I havent been able to pass any of the CPA exams and its hard to find more motivation to keep studying. I cant really even study at the moment since it is pretty close to the start of busy season where its really difficult to do anything but work and go home and sleep until June. 

My birthday is coming up and I have given up on trying to celebrate it with the few friends I have. I havent really done anything for it in years anyways. I always dreamed of my friends throwing me a nice party or getting me a gift or something but that never happened even when I got everyone a gift last year for their birthdays. I just dont celebrate it really at this point.

I have never had a girlfriend or sex and dont really have hope of that ever changing at this point. I dont really have great dating experiences but I have kissed some women and slept in a bed with one. She wasnt ready for sex at that time and things didnt work out so we stopped seeing each other a few weeks later.

I am trying to get back into the gym and gain weight and muscle. But other than that my life is just go to work, come home, make dinner, eat, get ready for the next day, sleep and go to work. I am also kind of shy and timid around my supervisor so I am always feeling like walking around eggshells while trying to make sure I do my job well and not upset them.

My friends do talk to me here and there, its hard to get them to go out and do anything even if they say they want to. Usually the plans I make never work out because they are doing whatever they want or need to in their lives but I am glad they seem to be doing well from what I can tell.

I have tried to go to meet ups but they revolve around bars and its not my thing. I just want to go and try to live out that life everyone had in college, I dont feel like a regular guy on his 20s. I dont feel like I really fit in or matter.

I am not close with my family and pretty much work to save for emergencies since my parents are getting old and dont know how much help they will need so I worry about how that will all work. I have siblings but one of them is a stay at home mom and the other is working on their degree so it wont be easy to get through since I know they will really depend on us financially.

Everyone else goes on trips, has relationships, seem pretty optimistic about their lives, have goals, all that. I get social media doesnt show everything but I literally havent done anything this year except for work and slept. I dont really know what I want or what I can even do with my life at this point. 

I can go on trips here and there, I could go out to bars and drink, I could pick up a hobby but I just dont feel motivated or happy about my life. I mean I have a good degree and a stable job, I find some kind of comfort in the tv shows, movies, anime, superhero related stuff, and music but other than that I am pretty lost. I dont see my life getting more exciting, getting closer with my friends, making more friends, meaning anything to women. I am kind of going day by day.

I dont really know what to ask here, I feel like I always need to be told step by step on what to do or what choice to make. I just am looking for anyone to tell me where to go from here, or if I can really go anywhere from here at this point. Thanks.",29Nov2019,1
13,"So my husband is livid because our 18  year old daughter is having a sexual relationship with her 19 year old boyfriend.  He spent a lot of time preparing her to wait for marriage, but she is like most and decided to try it before she buys it. I’m stuck in the middle because I think she is old enough to make her own decisions.  Dealing with the stress of this is very difficult, and the uncertainty that they may never repair their relationship is heartbreaking.  Both sides are at a stand off and neither will budge,  I’m trying to bridge the gap and help them repair the relationship, but their personalities are so similar and they are both strong willed so it is a slow moving process.

16,A friend that I’ve had for three years doesn’t seem to be invested into the friendship as much as I am. The last time we talked was about three weeks ago. After texting him multiple times through out the day he answered back with a one word response to one thing and ignored everything else I said. He’s made new friends which I can’t get mad at but it seems like he’s just forgotten about me. Yes I could text him also but it being three weeks since we last spoke just made me realize that I’m always the one starting the conversation. We’ve been through a lot together in the three years we’ve known each other and I thought we were really good friends. I stopped talking to another friend of more than ten years because she was a SHIT friend and he helped me realize just how much of a shit friend she was(example-she got married and didn’t tell me). I don’t know if I should be the bigger person and contact him or if I should let it be because if it’s been this long and he hasn’t reached out do I really want to be friends with this person? He’s my only friend at the moment and it’s kind of hard making new friends considering I have two jobs work from 6:00am to 9:00pm Mon thru Fri and work mornings on weekends from 9:00am to 5:00pm and don’t like staying out late because I don’t want to tired for work the next day.,29Nov2019,1

I wouldn’t do it and even if I would I don’t have any firearms and no way of obtaining any. 

I’m 16 years old and I do nothing all day everyday at home. Absolutely NOTHING. 
Every time I go outside to do some errands like picking up something from the grocery store and see groups of teenagers hanging out and having fun, it hurts me emotionally so fucking much. I don’t have a single friend and I can’t even make any. I can’t even talk to people. 
I don’t even have any hobbies or talents. I have nothing going for me. NOTHING. 
And whenever I ask for advice people never take me seriously or give me broad answers like “putting yourself out there” or simple to talk to people.  
Just watching People my age enjoy a carefree life while I’m isolated in my house instigates my hatred, anger and envy. And seeing the news of mass shootings burns the fire in me. I have such anger and hatred against teenagers that I sometimes pick fights with them.  
I don’t get any attention or support from my family and anyone.
When I tell people of my situation they just tell me to “see a therapist “ or some other bullshit professional help or just call me a troll. 
I’m sick of telling people over and over that I have a goddamn therapist and a psychiatrist. I need advice and encouragement on how I can improve my life and my self esteem. 
I have so much depression and anxiety I even wish I could just die instantly instead of living a empty shallow life being isolated in my room and being envious of teenagers. Some teenagers even get to experience sex. What. the. FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHY CANT I?!?!?!! As a teen I have raging hormones and knowing teens are having sexual experiences while I’m stuck with my hand makes my blood while. 
Where did my life go wrong? Why is it impossible for me to build relationships and socialize with people or AT LEAST have some independence and confidence in myself to do what makes me happy and fulfilled. Why?...

We‘ve been happily together for over two years before we broke up three weeks ago. (We had a „relationship break“ where we didn‘t meet or talk at all but still wouldn‘t make out or do similar stuff with someone else which started I think early-mid october and concluded in when we broke up)

She made a 180° change in personality and now wanted to go out every weekend (without me, there was no possibility for me to go with her) and instead of being so glad and happy that we both already met so young she now regretted it and told me that it would‘ve been perfect if we had met in five years or so. She also told me that if she won‘t live that life now, she already knows she will have a big midlife crisis later on.

I know I may sound pathetic writing this post but I just need some help right now. It absolutely broke my heart and destroyed my life as she was my everything and I was so happy with her (and I was her everything and she was so happy with me too) till everything changed all of a sudden. 

I‘m a semi-professionell athlete and even though I work out almost every day I work out/do various sports now way more often just to get a distraction. I also try to spend as much time possible at the university stuying or hanging out with my friends.

However, I‘m still shocked by how fast someone can literally make a 180° personality turn, and how someone can break up with you just because you always stayed true to yourself and didn‘t make a 180° change too. What kills me the most is that she‘s the one who broke up with me and now she‘s the one able to live her best life, while I can only mourn after the best life I already had.

But I‘m always thinking that this can‘t be it. She simply can‘t forget me that easily out of her life. We had an absolute blast those two years and she always made me feel like I‘ve been the best thing to ever happen her. And I‘m sure that this part is at least minimally in her still. 

I‘m not saying here that I‘m eagerly waiting for her to have a change of heart and want me back, I‘m just saying that I could start crying again thinking how that girl that‘s been everything for me and I for her now lives her best life and won‘t even miss me a bit from now on. Please, just tell me if she‘s ever gonna start missing me and when that will approximately happen, cause it breaks my heart again thinking that this may never happen. I mean even when we broke up she already told me crying that she knows that she will heavily regret this one day but just has to go that route now.

We accidentally saw each other this Monday when she drove right next to me. She waved at me with her mother in the passenger seat smiling and waving at me and I waved back. The day after she wrote me that we have to meet up again because of something I still have that belongs to her (which didn‘t seem like a coincidence at all). Generally everytime I‘ve seen her after the relationship break (so when we broke up, when we met to give each other the other one‘s stuff, that incident this monday) she already kinda had a very regretting face on, but from everything else I‘m hearing of her (instagram stories, etc.), she‘s living her absolute best life.

(Sorry for that really long text, but again it just breakes me how that person you‘ve been everything for now lives on like you‘ve never existed)

Met this guy through a mutual friend at a bar. We’ve only gone out twice and both times we just got hammered and ended up having sloppy drunk sex that neither of us remember too well (oh well). Both times were unprotected, and normally I don’t like condoms, but I know we’ve both had fun with many many people and I’m just not feeling like taking that risk again. I mentioned it to him once when we were drunk and he said he wasn’t a fan, neither am I lol.

26,"TL;DR
After my dad passed my mom has changed and is rejecting all help which is weighing me down.

Details

This summer my dad passed away. He died between me and my moms arms as we were doing cpr.
It has been only half a year since the incident but I can see it eating her away.

She doesn’t sleep well at night but will not take medication. Talks about psychiatrist gets a laughter and negative(hurtful) comments. Snaps easily at everything and everyone(family, store workers etc). Mindset of everyone is wrong and she is always right. Says she thinks about the situation a lot and also cries often. After work she just watches tv for 6-7 hours every day. She doesn’t want to go to any new hobby/group setting (that she has always disliked). Her and her friends live a bit too far from each other to hang out. She says “it will take 2 years to pass” - something she read online and uses as a shield. She has always been extremely stubborn. But the new character that is going on is something new.
Additionally dad did not treat her well for the last decade or so. As she was blamed for all and they fought(verbally) daily. I guess also body memory of fight to protect is still in her so reactions that used to go to dad go to me now.

She doesn’t listen to me or my siblings. It is weighing hard on me mentally as I was in a bad spot before the incident and just downhill from there. I want to move on and get better. Also I really have to move out(living at home now) if I want my life to gain any quality. 

I do understand that on one hand, yes it takes time and yes I am very patient with her. Same time I need to live my own life and I can’t help someone who can’t be helped. I also can’t leave her now as it will damage her even more.

What are ways to get someone out of the hole and start to understand how they hurt us all and mostly themselves. Anyone who has lived a same situation, how did they get better?
I care about her a lot and she is my best friend.

27,"So my wife who is actually my ex wife, we still live together. It's been a love triangle with her ex before me for quite some time and I've put to with it for my kids. I moved from the states to Canada to be with them but it's been pretty horrible since that move 4 years ago.

She's pretty abusive to me but has times she tries to show me love but I really don't love her at all anymore and I know if I stay, I'll leave down the road anyway. She's comfortable and really wants me to stay and days things will get better but they never do. She just to wants a puppet to help and have her ex on the side. I have no freedom and I feel like I'm a prisoner.

I know it's selfish of me to stay just for my kids and I know it's not fair to anyone by just using that as an excuse to stay. I have a room rented that I can move into tomorrow but I'm just having a really hard time right now with leaving my kids. I feel really really sad because of how much I love them and have been with them for the last 4+years. They are 7 and 6. I just don't have anyone here besides my kids. No family, no friends, nothing but my kids.

There's so much more to the story that I could write a book but it's just so much.

30,"Hey everyone. Here's my situation. Im a college freshman and a couple of weeks ago our college had its major prospective student weekend. One of my close friends was an overnight host, and because our group always hangs together, i got to make friends with the prospees. Well, this girl and I got to talking and somehow we just clicked, we shared life stories and stayed up till like 3 am talking since our friends were still up. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, we were very flirty, FaceTimed every single night, and overall have had a great ""relationship"" without the label. The issue is, she lives hours away, and my college is not near her top choice (its not a good fit for her, even i can tell.) Today, out of the blue, she asked me if we could just stay friends, which I replied i had been thinking about as well and ultimately we agreed that if the circumstances were different, then we would be together, but oh well. Anyways, she still wants me to come up next weekend and visit, and im not sure thats the greatest idea given the fresh ""breakup"" or whatever you'd call it... Any advice?",29Nov2019,1

32,"So I met this guy in July (about 5-6 months ago), and he was working as a bouncer at a club that I was at. I approached him and told him to take down my number. He seemed shocked and took it down. He contacted me that night and we have been talking here and there ever since. Every single day I wake up with a ""good morning beautiful"" text, even sometimes when I do not respond. We have been on one date (which he paid for). We have only kissed a couple of times. I have seen him at his work once or twice, but he still remains persistent. Recently, I started to really like him. Before I liked him and thought he was great but I didn't LIKE him you know? So I started to reciprocate the sweet texts and we started talking on the phone, etc. but lately he's coming on really strong, saying things like ""you are my world,"" ""I would do anything for you,"" ""I'll never stop trying to be yours,"" etc. And while this is all really sweet, I just can't help but think he does not know me like that, and it scares me because I feel like he is infatuated with who he thinks I am and not who I really am. And I mean it has been 6 months of talking, but for most of that time we really didn't hang out or talk about personal shit. We really hung out on purpose ONE time, and talked surface level stuff up until recently. He would ask to hang out, but I was so busy I didn't really have time, and he was understanding because he works 7 days a week at crazy hours (which is fine by me). So I guess I just want to know what the deal is? What is your perception of what is going on here? If this is all for sex.. I mean if it is, damn homeboy has hung in there for 6 months. I just feel he is coming on a bit too strong. He told me he's never felt like this, and he is young so that is a possibility? I like him a lot but idk, something feels off.",29Nov2019,1
33,"Hello, sorry, I may mess up somehow as this is my first post. I also apologize for the heavy topic, I don’t know where else to ask.

I’m a year 10 in high school ; I hang out with a smaller group of friends. We all have our own things going on however one has been open about having depression. We don’t treat her any differently, in fact she is really pleasant to be around. She has also been open to cutting herself. I don’t think of her in a bad way or anything, I am just worried now. I honestly have no idea how to help without coming off as creepy or pushy. 

Shortly after finding this out, (about a week) a male in our group has began doing it as well. I guess it couldn’t have come out of nowhere but they’re both so casual about it it’s frightening.  
As a side note, The girl had previously asked me what I would do/how I would react if she had killed herself. It was a serious question so I am honestly terrified. They’re both great people and as I’ve said I have absolutely no idea how to help and I feel like an asshole doing nothing.

He’s never touched me, he’s just done stuff like trick me into looking at explicit photos and making lewd comments along the lines of “you should see me dick.” He constantly asks my other coworkers when I’m scheduled so he can make sure to show up when I’m there, and he has gotten into the habit of calling me every single day.  After I blocked his number he then proceeded to call me from a different number which was super creepy. I get anxiety coming into work now, I no longer enjoy my job. I’ve gotten into the habit of scanning the parking lot for his car before I go in to see if he’s there or not. When I’m on shift alone I’m lucky enough to have friends and family that are willing to come sit near me so I won’t have to be alone with him. I reported all of this to my boss but she seemed much more focused on the fact that this was distracting me from my work rather than the fact that I no longer felt comfortable or safe at my job.

39,"A while ago I met an incredible girl through a dating app. We had a couple fun first dates that quickly turned into a more regular intimate affair. A year later we’re in a happy relationship that feels perfect. With both of us being without a serious job and any serious life commitments we’ve been traveling a lot together. When we first met she mentioned a country she’s always dreamed of going to. I told her I shared that dream with her, showing her a tattoo I had relating to their culture and telling her about my love and desire to visit. 
Fast forward a few months later she told me she was seriously considering finally going. I thought it was a great idea and was eager to go with her, but at the time I was not in the same financial position to start booking it as she was. I arrived at her apartment soon after that conversation and she told me she was booking the flights, she was going there solo. It was as if the previous conversation about me coming with her never happened. I sat there and watched her book flights and tell me all about the hostels she planned on going to in total disbelief. I knew this was her dream but if she’d listened to me before she’d have known it was mine too. For months after her booking it she’s been talking about how excited she is and how she’s so happy she feels comfortable enough to go on her own. I brought up how I felt about it and she said ‘well if you want to come so bad you still can’. She knew I couldn’t afford it and she’d already booked private single room hostels/hotels. It was such an empty statement. 
Fast forward to now she’s on a plane there now and I’m sat at home feeling upset and hurt and I just want an outsider’s perspective as to whether or not I’m being selfish or if I have a right to be this upset.

41,"There is so much happening right now that I cant sum everything up together, before I explain the situation I just wanna say my life is not terrible and I am grateful for what I have. I appreciate the good things in my life. Sharing this online can either go really good or really bad but I just feel terrible and stressed.
Although I'm blessed with extremely supportive and helpful friends of course theres a downside, I dont have a real family. Im so tired of having to take responsibility and be the adult, I just want to act my age but Im so exhausted. I live in a very bad area so that may be part of the reason them and so many other residents are so toxic.
My mothers family was extremely abusive, alot of domestic violence, drug abuse, child abuse, murder, etc. I have seen so much shit go down that I still have nightmares related to it. I've had many tramautizing things done to me by people your supposed to trust, and I had therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD and depression.
My moms ""family"" is constantly arguing, fighting and threatening one another. They're also extremely jealous, I'm still a teen and often times they act to me as if they're still in their highschool phase and they try to one up me. My mother's ""family"" is also ignorant and they dont know how to communicate its so broken, my aunt just tried to kill my grandma a few days ago because my grandma accidently stepped on her lawn and I can't take it anymore.
My uncle who loves me very much and treats me like his own daughter is in jail again, the first time I met him he just got done serving his time but he just keeps going back over there and it's killing me. He motivates me and is part of the reason im so talented at art but I miss him, especially since my cousin just recently got killed, I miss him.
Somebody is always dying or getting shot or on drugs or fighting I cant take it. I remember seeing my family being arrested as a child. Usually I tell myself not to let it get to me but it's always on my mind. I've actually healed alot by myself. What makes it worst is no one listens to me because of my age and I'm often gas lighted and told it never happened or Im crazy. Ive tried to get help from other adults and they just sided with the adults instead of me. My other friends always complain about how from time to time their family can be embarrassing or annoying and I honestly wish thats all I had to worry about because I dont know how much longer I can take this. People don't suspect me of having these problems when they see me, I look fairly normal.

49,"So, I (17f) have a first cousin (22?m) that I was extremely close with growing up. We were best friends and I honestly looked up to him more than my own brother.

Eventually I snapped because I woke up to him pressing himself against me (he was naked). I was 11 when it started and it went on for about a year. CPS got involved and the whole family found out, but they were only told that ""something inappropriate"" happened. It temporarily ruined my life and I tried to commit suicide shortly after the family found out. I eventually came to terms with what happened and just started ignoring him at family gatherings. Well, I've been ignoring him for 6 years and he hasn't spoken to me. Today, at our thanksgiving gathering, he walked up to me and said, ""Malea, if I start a ping pong tournament, will you play?"" And I said yes. After that the family was playing board games and he participated for once and really tried to interact with me. I know it sounds stupid, but this just threw me into a frenzy. Should I allow small interactions like this? Do I ignore him because he ruined my childhood? I like to say I'm healed and no longer impacted by what he did to me, but I don't know if it's an insult to my past self to interact with him. I don't want him to think I forgot or that it didn't matter, but it would honestly be refreshing to just let go of some of the remaining anger.

I'm still getting 9 hours per 24 hours, and 3 hours is enough for at least one, usually two REM cycles, apparently.

I have 3 cats. I have had cats all my life, but me and my family (mom and siblings) don't have enough money to take them to the vet, never did in fact and it was never a problem since none of our pets ever got sick, at least not visibly and not terminally - I know it might sound irresponsible, but I will forever believe that it's better to have them sleep and eat well at my warm house without vaccines than starve in the streets still without vaccines. However the 3 I have now have been developing some kind of skin crusts all over their ears, head and chin this last week. I thought it was from the cold but yesterday my younger brother woke up with rashes and upon going to the doctor, he's now being treated for fungal skin infection. The doctor asked if we have cats and he said that my brother probably caught it from them and since they have very similar symptoms, we can't simply ignore it. So now my mom is freaking out, but we still can't take them to a vet, therefore we can't know what to buy to treat them. There are no animal rescue facilities in here and abandoning them is, of course, out of question.

So, is there anything I can do? How do I find facilities that'll treat them? Is there any medication like paracetamol appropriate for cats that might just help them without being too much expensive.

Very talented guy and it sucks because AFTER they staplered my head I started to cry uncontrollably. I was not in pain and there was no reason for me to sit and cry and he held my while I cried and I allowed myself to cry more.

56,"I’m 31/F and my partner is 32/M, we’ve been together ten years.

Two years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder. For a while I was considering whether I wanted to have children at all, worrying about the risks of passing on my illness, and how it would affect my children having a parent with a mental illness. Ultimately I’ve decided I do want children. My illness is becoming a lot more manageable with the combination of medication, therapy, and changes to my lifestyle. I wouldn’t want to have children if I didn’t think I was capable of caring for them.

Yesterday I caught up with my partner’s boyfriend’s girlfriend, who has bipolar. I told her we wanted to start trying in about a year or two. She asked me how I felt about the risks of passing on my illness, then suggested we adopt instead, given that there are so many children who need homes already. I didn’t have a good answer. I told her the way I see it, one in four people have a mental illness. If my child has bipolar, they will have parents who understand the illness, who can recognize the warning sides, and who can make sure they get the care and support they need. In addition to this, I believe the mental health care system is rapidly improving, and I imagine it will be a lot better 15 years from now. As for why I want biological children instead of adopting, I guess I can’t really explain that. Maybe that is indeed selfish. I can only put it down to a biological urge.

Oddly enough, when I opened up Facebook, the first post I saw was by another person I know with a severe mental illness. She said she was kicked out of her support group for telling everyone she thinks having children when you have a serious mental illness is “selfish, abusive and unethical”.

On Tuesday, I received an email that let me know that I had been rejected from Oxford University to study Economics and Management... great. Although, I guess I knew this was coming since it is one of the best universities in the world. 
Took about a day and I was over it, only then to be rejected by another university (UCL) for economics today for having a predicted grade in maths at an A and not an A*. Because of this reason, I’m pretty sure my final top 3 university choice (LSE) will also reject me because they also required an A* in maths and even favour those who took further maths (which is not a requirement btw) and I don’t take that either :( 
So yep guess I can expect a rejection there too...
I felt pretty strong about my application hence I took the risk applying to these universities otherwise I wouldn’t have bothered. 
Now that I’m about 99.9% sure I’m about to recurve rejections from my top 3, it’s hit me that in reality I may not go to university this year. (I do have two other choices but they were more random picks that I’m not too keen on :/)
I just feel like absolute s*** and I honestly don’t know where I went wrong. 
I’m seriously doubting myself and I hate to say it, even though I love Economics maybe it wasn’t the right path for me... :( 
It sounds stupid that I’m so upset over this but for me studying is the ONLY thing that I’m good at and gives me value. I’m not talented in anything else, so the fact I couldn’t even get my studies right makes me feel like such a failure.

Over time it's gotten worse but it's never gotten to the point where it's affected me as it has today.

I've just started college and that means interacting with new people, and while some of these people understand my tic, others don't.

There's one girl in my class who keeps giving me dirty looks and I can only imagine she thinks I'm a pervert or something. I've also had comments from a group of guys in the class but I've defended myself.

Since I've started college the tic frequency has increased and I'm getting headaches almost daily. I come home and my head is pounding and I feel dazed. On top of all this I'm being tormented for looking like a freak.

I'm a 27 year old guy and been alone for 5 years now. I did had the chance to start a new relationship but I refused to do it as I didn't felt that I found someone special. I also had my depression periods and preferred to solve them on my own instead of starting a new relationship, as I've seen others do. Throughout the years I mainly focused on self development. I used to be very shy around girls... Now I feel very confident and don't really have problems in talking to them as I approached so many of them and I don't really care about rejection or stuff (also noticed that rejection never really happens when you have this confidence in you, except for the ones that are married or have kids etc.). The shyness is gone but I'm still consider myself as mainly being an introverted person. Most of the girls say that I'm cute.. I don't want to sound like I'm bragging about it but this is the feedback that I have from them. Felt like adding this as it may be relevant to the advice that I hope I'll get.


I recently met a girl that I like so much... I saw her at the subway. I went up to her and just told her stuff that I felt in that moment. The details won't matter that much, my approach worked and made her to give me her contact so that we can talk... Also she didn't made me any type of promises, but she is opened as a person. It's the first time I'm meeting someone like her... Like seeing her as ""the one""... I feel like we see the universe in such a similar way. 
We had the chance to talk for just a bit through text and voice messages then she left in a vacation for a period of about one month. This period is about to end these days. Last time we talked I told her that I want keep in touch and maybe see eachother again when she will be back. I didn't contacted her during her vacation as I felt that we don't know eachother that well and stuff like that so I preferred to wait until she's back. I did responded to one of her Instagram stories by sending just a picture of what was related in that story.. thing that I kinda regret cause now I feel that was a dumb attachment and she didn't responded either (not really a thing that needed a reply, but anyways)

Now she is about to be back... Even though that I do feel that we had similar experiences in this lifetime that made us who we are today as persons.. and I do feel that I have a lot to share with this girl... I'm so nervous that I don't know what to say to her to re-engage the conversation and to make her wanting to go out with me. I'm afraid to not blow this up... I also feel that she is better than me in so many ways.. but this is kinda what I am looking for :) ... 

Bottom line... She is soooo damn special and I don't think that I'll ever meet someone like her... I don't know what to do, but I do know that I want her to be mine :)

What should I do? How should I approach her again?",29Nov2019,1
69,"Lately I've been pretty confused. I'm a 25 year old female living in Toronto. I work full-time and go to school part-time to finish my undergrad degree (I previously graduated from college with a diploma). My job pays well and I see myself working for the institution for a long time. However, I feel like my studies sometimes get in the way of my social life. Even if I am out with friends, I can't help but feel guilty or dread the situation because I think of the stress of my assignments or exams that I have to study/complete. 

Recently, one of my friends got engaged and another three are in serious relationships. I can't help but feel like I wont find anyone, and with school I feel like it really puts a damper on things. I went back in 2017 and will be done my undergrad by Fall 2022 (WHICH SEEMS LIKE FOREVER). I can't help but feel behind or jealous of my friends who just have to worry about their relationships and work..

This may be just be venting, but has anyone else also felt this way before? What did you do to change your mindset/how did you cope?",29Nov2019,1

71,"I just started a job three weeks ago and it’s killing me. It was my first job in another city as I graduated last December and had been working and living at home since then. 

The job is alright, kind of boring but the pay is decent and the people are nice. I was excited to get this job but ever since I’ve started working I’ve been so depressed. I have no appetite, I feel no happiness or joy in life anymore. 

I’ve dealt with a pretty bad few months in the past and felt depressed but nothing like this before. I’ve only been working for 3 weeks here but I feel horrible every single day. I know if I quit and move back home everyone will be really disappointed in me. 

I was planning on proposing to my girlfriend in a few weeks, I was so excited to do it but now I just don’t care about anything in life anymore. I feel no joy for anything, not even sports which has always been something I get so much joy out of watching. 

I know everyone goes through this and bitches but I really feel horrible and no meaning in life anymore. 

How do I get over this? How do I feel happy again and feel a meaning in life? Should I move back home and do what makes me happy until I land on my feet or should I just stick it out? 

Thanks for any advice, I just needed someone to talk to and strangers are perfect for that.",29Nov2019,1

74,"Tried it sum it up as best as possible in the title but this is kinda multiple problems, all sorta tied together, try to bear with me here, also I'm 17 if it matters.

I hardly even know where to begin with this but the fact that I am a person and will only ever be me and only ever see through my eyes and live my life, freaks me the fuck out , I feel a deep pit in my stomach and my legs feel weak because my mind always asks ""why?"" and theres no answer, or I feel like I really really don't want to know the answer if there is one, it's not that I have a bad life or anything I love my family and im grateful for the life I've lived but *why am I me,* why won't I ever be someone else (unless you believe in reincarnation which I find myself believing in sometimes, but if there is reincarnation you wouldn't know aside from some feelings people say they get so it doesn't help me a lot, and theres still the *why* question)  
I've struggled with this since I was a very young child, almost too young to remember exactly when and I couldn't put it into words at the time but I remember I'd just start crying about it and then make up some reason why, to this day I struggle really putting it into words and usually sum it up as ""fear of death"" but thats not quite it, although it's definitely part of it.  
I feel like I know something I shouldn't and sometimes I tell myself that when I die it'll all be revealed but obviously I can't know that and I also have a massive fear of death, this is going to sound really stupid but I'm sometimes very afraid that i'm going to like, die but not know im dead and be a ghost or something and I know it sounds stupid but it legitimately makes it very hard to sleep some nights because I'll stay up listening to my heartbeat to make sure it's still beating I guess and one night doing that gave me a panic attack so bad I had to wake up my parents because I felt like I was dying and if I could stop worrying about this I would, I know it's a dumb thing to worry about, I'm aware of that, but it doesn't help most of the time.

I'm constantly worried theres something medically wrong with me and I'm going to die sooner then later, I feel like i'm running out of time and time just goes by so so fast and I'll never get to relive a day again, even if I don't die sooner then later I still have a limited amount of time and it goes by SO fast, even if I live to 100 years thats still such *such* a small amount of time in the grand scheme, and then it's just on to whatever's next, which might be nothing, and then I'll never get my answer to *why* why does this all exist why am I me why does time work the way it does why is life like this why.

although as mentioned earlier I'm not even sure I *want* to know, in the back of my head I feel like I really really don't want to know the answer, or even I already know the answer but I don't want to remember, that if I remembered something terrible would happen to me, I definitely don't want to think about it, I feel a pit in my stomach and I want to cry when I do, but every now and again it just comes up again, and lately my anxiety has been really bad in regards to my fear of death and fear of time and when I worry about those things it comes up again and I don't know what to do.

I just want to stop being like this, I want to not think about these things, it destroys me and I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry this is kinda uh a lot I didn't mean to ramble so much but I thought writing it out might help I guess.

75,"I was saying goodbye to my uncle at Thanksgiving and I hugged him. After I pulled away, he put both of his hands on my hips, barely above my butt, and got really close. I was already kind on edge, so I'm assuming my expression was a mix of shock and ""I'm going to kick your face in"". He said something to me, which I believe was ""Don't get bullied"", but also could've been ""Don't get mugged"" or ""Don't get in trouble"". I don't know why he would say that, besides that this is the first time he's seen me since I started transitioning as a transgender girl a year ago.

80,My GF is currently in a jewellery store shopping for the exact same kind of jewellery that I got her for Christmas.

81,"I (24) was with girlfriend (27) for 1.5 years, recently ended after what I did. We met at uni, it had always been very intense right from the start, we lived 3 hours away from each other after I left as she stayed an extra year so always been a bit of struggle to see each other but when we saw each other it would be no less than a week at a time. She has been violent with me on several occasions throughout our relationship, everything from hair pulling, slapping, kicking in the face, stomping on my genitals, biting, spitting, I feel she intentional induced a panic attack and I started some minor self harm, all leading me to a near suicide attempt in my car. When we would argue we would scream and shout, name calling etc, wether in person or on the phone. we would spy on each other, go on each others phones and laptops. Part of me feels what I did was a stupid way to get back at her, but I'm just so confused about the whole thing.

When we had been seeing each other for 2 months, I took a random girl home who I would never see again and all we did is kiss, I lied to her and said I didn't kiss anyone when I asked her out a couple go months later. She saw a message a few months later on my phone that I accidentally showed her of messages from the girl. She broke up with me, but agreed to see me 2 weeks later and I spent 5 days with her and we were trying to work it out, however a day after I leave she kisses an ex boyfriend and lies to me about what happened. we start going out again, I find out she lied to me about kissing her ex but she is doing exams so I sit resentfully on t for a month until after her exams before I confront her. She manages to convince me not to leave somehow. Then a week later she started talking to an ex of hers and video calling him and lying to me about it. We left each other multiple times for various reasons some of them petty some of them very reasonable reasons why you would leave someone. We were supposed to take a months break but that didn't last long and we were back fighting on the phone. Got back together and agreed to tell the other if we had seen anyone else, she said she had but said it was a random guy. I found out later she lied and it was a close friend of hers. 

Thats just the background, knowing that and mostly disregarding that, I have been a truly awful human and I don't know what to do.

I went on holiday to the place where she cheated on me, 2nd night I go back with a girl and my friend goes back with her friend, and sort of had unprotected sex but I was jelly so couldn't really and soon gave up, but we both did unprotected oral sex. 2 days later I get a small clump of acne just above my chin. A few days later I go home and I have managed to convince myself that I have oral herpes, and so I told her I had it, while lying to her saying I didn't cheat on her. She wanted to have unprotected sex but I didn't for fear of stds, so we didn't. However I came on her stomach and she used it on herself. I find out later that it highly likely it wasn't herpes because it hadn't spread into my mouth and is just a spot. All the while telling her nothing happened and making up more and more elaborate lies. She managed to work out who my friend slept with and messaged her and asked her what happened. She then asked to see my google timeline and my friends who I was with to collaborate my story.

I decide to come clean and admit that I cheated and that I may have given her oral herpes, she goes decides to start attacking me, deep scratches mostly targeting my eyes, but all over my face and neck and a black eye, while I am just letting her do it because I felt like I deserved it for cheating on her and potentially giving her herpes. and is screaming awful derogatory things at me and threatening to damage my car.

I decided to phone the police and report it, stressing that I did not want her to find out and I did not want them to contact her. It was just insurance incase, as she promised when she left me she would make my life a living hell. This didn't work and recently I was told that the police will be going to interview her. She will tell them about me giving her herpes which I vent mentioned, although now it likely isn't but it still could have been. Can this all blow back on me, can she claim that I sexually assaulted her by still cumming on her stomach and kissing her, all the while thinking I had oral herpes and not knowing if I actually did because I had had unprotected sex. I just don't know how badly I am in the wrong, I just don't know, I hope you can help me work it out.

Sorry for the rant it might not make sense, and sorry its long, I don't know what ""I am expecting from this post just want some honest opinion about the whole thing, it was my first relationship and I was madness through and through, and I just need to hear what is normal in a relationship as I have no fucking clue.

TL;DR loads of background into my relationship of back and forth emotional and physical abuse. I then cheated on my girlfriend for the 2nd time, may have contracted oral herpes but likely now that it wasn't but I didn't know that at the time, kissed her, lied to her over and over again about not cheating, finally admitting cheating on her and  said that I may have herpes, she attacked me causing black eye and scratches all over my face.",29Nov2019,1

I have no idea what I'm really supposed to be doing tbh. I know I'm supposed to intern at some point and I've joined 1 research project but it's currently inactive apparently. I don't know how to network with people.

I made it my entire life without having to really make connections with anyone in regard to my education. I was and am still a huge loner, so having to actually be social and network is a GIANT pain in the ASS for me. I legitimately have no idea how to even start a conversation. Not just with networking but with talking to other human beings in general. I've spent the last few years dreading the thought of having to use people to get ahead in life, and now that I have only 1 year left, I'm panicking. How the fuck do people talk to each other???

On top of that, my GPA is kind of shitty because I've been dealing with a ton of shit since I began college. I've had depression since I can remember and every grade until high school was relatively easy, so I could just breeze through classes and wallow in self-loathing and agony when I got home. Now that shit is actually challenging, it's hard to juggle my mental fucked-up-ness and learning things. I've been put on meds but they aren't miracle workers, of course.

My parents take every advantage to remind me of how important it is to do well in college and to network and if I'm being completely honest, I'm fucking lost and I wish I could shoot myself ahaha. I've been working towards getting into college basically since the day I could fucking talk. My grades have been slacking. The inability to focus that I brushed off in high school is kicking my ass in college.

Mental illness, social isolation, and failure don't mix. Doesn't help that my parents love to bring up how successful my relatives are/were in college followed by them questioning my abilities. I'm seriously starting to think I'm not cut out for this. Only problem is, college is the only way I can go anywhere in life. I'm from a poor family and without college I'd be right on my way to continue the cycle. I'd honestly rather die than be a failure.

I just feel physically tired all the time. In high school I just played it off as lack of sleep as I had to get up early for school and often played video games at night with my friends. As I grew up, I got really bothered with feeling tired all the time, getting nothing done because I was so tired.

I'm just rambling on, but I'm not very high in the social hierarchy because my grades are pretty low and my teeth are crooked, which is somehow meant to deter you from becoming a dentist. Getting to the point though, there's this other kid who is taking a course on Nuclear Engineering and is so strong it's almost unholy. I asked him to tutor me where I would pay my entire wage from my part-time waiter job nearby. I only make 6.50 an hour but make almost 18.75 an hour with the good tips alone. I'm hoping to make it to college with this money and do a four-year diploma with it. I'm currently saving up everything I own. I've been doing this since 5th grade and I'm in 11th now. I'm up to 80,000 dollars now and counting still. Anyways, this guy saw the $6.50 and blew me off. After that, I said I could give him money from my savings for it and he demanded $35 dollars an hour with a bonus if I got an A on my report card. (the bonus is $800) Me being an idiot got angry because I thought this was an absurd idea and an absurd amount of money, but I guess it was non-negotiable. I started getting angry and began to raise my voice with it. This got the other students chilling outside instigated and they all started whispering to each other as if a fight was gonna happen. The other kid saw that and took the bait. He got into a fighting position, but I was too much of a pussy to back down or take the first hit. Then, I got into a defensive/""please don't hurt me"" sort of stance and the kid charged me. We started with a tussle where he got his hands behind my head and kneed me in the face, then when I stood back up he punched me in the face. I tried to punch back, but he ducked and got me in the ribs. He grabbed my arm and slammed me into the ground and proceeded to kick the shit outa me while I was flailing helplessly. Afterward, when he left me alone I grabbed my bag and asked my friend to drive me home. He did, and now I want to repay him soon.

98,"""Just Do It"" is a punchy slogan that has been remembered. What characterizes it? Its short, concise and easy to remember. The slogan is the mantra of your company. It tells the consumer who you are and what you represent in a few words. Impossible for him to forget you, even drowned under a plethora of marketing messages.  


How to find a punchy slogan that stays in memories but also to keep people away/aware from egocentrism ? It may seem paradoxical given the name ""onlymove -&gt; only me, and seek to show the opposite .. what do you think?",29Nov2019,1
99,"Our neighbor has a dog that is constantly coming to our house. While we're not opposed to animal visitors every once in a while, whenever he comes down, he begins digging and destroying our trash, running our cats up trees, and sitting outside our door, scratching at it and whining begging to be let in the house. Now, normally, most people just call the neighbors and they come get the dog and put it on a leash or cage it up themselves, right? Well, in this case, it doesn't seem to be working that way.

The first couple of times this happened, the neighbor was more than willing to comply, and actually did have a cage put up to keep the dog in. But the dog is a rather large one, and kept breaking out of the cage and wound up right back down here. After my mom has called various times and the neighbor has been complying, recently when this occurred, the neighbor either never picks up the phone, or never even comes to get the dog, almost as if she's thinking we should just deal with it. Also, come to find out, she's talking about us behind our back, calling us crazy for constantly contacting her about it while she's out having fun with her boyfriend, which is honestly the final straw to me, I want this over ASAP.

What should I do to remedy this situation? My mom doesn't want to call animal control because outside of the few problems he gives us he's an otherwise very sweet dog. We can't take him in ourselves because of the cat problem (and other possible legal reasons that may arise because of it), so it leaves us at a crossroads. Any advice is appreciated.",29Nov2019,1

104,"Stupid argument really. Been with my wife for over 10 years. Over this time, we have had several computer printers,  and they have all followed the same lifestyle. She uses them once or twice, leaves them until the ink dries out, and buys more ink to use them once or twice again. This cycle continues until the printer doesn't work properly, and then it sits in our basement for what seems like several years until it's thrown out. As soon as it's thrown out she thinks she needs it again, and wants to buy another one.
I have a leniant workplace, and they don't mind me printing whatever I need for home on the office printer. I can also scan whatever I want at work during my lunch hour and after work hours for her. Obviously they would have an issue if I printed several hundred pages, but that's not really what a home printer can do anyway.
I understand that it is I bet of an independence thing, so that she can print herself with her relying on me. She also says it's different now because she wants to print colouring pages for my three-year-old to occupy her instead of watching TV. I like the idea of reducing TV time, but I can buy 20 or more colouring books for less than a printer and ink.
Just to be clear: I am not stopping her from buying a printer, i am just not liking the idea of her buying one and making that dislike known.

Earlier on in the semester, she missed about a week and a half of class during which we had a substitute. After she came back, she seemed a bit frazzled so I stayed after class to ask her how everything was doing.

Her dad died. He got sick suddenly and died very quickly. This was in September near the beginning of the semester and she didn't take a leave of absence or anything, just kept teaching. I felt at the time that I should have written a letter or something, but was too hesitant.

I definitely know I want to write her something before we leave for break. It wouldn't be too weird, since our class is small and I see her around a lot and make a point to have friendly conversations. I just have no idea what to say; what's appropriate, what crosses a boundary, what my drudge up bad memories, whether I should even mention her dad*.*

115,"I don't want to go into too much detail, but I am a 24F who grew up with a father who binge drank and lashed out on occasion as a kid. He would get irate and yell so loud at my mother and call her terrible names. He'd throw things and break things when he'd drink and become so irrational. This would happen on a somewhat occasional basis when I was growing up. One night that sticks out... I was around 12 years old and I was the only kid home (I have 2 brothers). I was in my room and I could hear my dad starting up and then it escalated until he started yelling at my mother and eventually broke a glass vase on our counter... my mom got a hotel room that night for us to stay in. I remember uncontrollably trembling after i heard the glass bang and then the sound of my mother grabbing her purse and keys before opening my door and saying ""come on. we're leaving sweetie."" That is just an example of the type of shit I witnessed as a kid.. my dad would always ""apologize"" the next day.. he'd do so without any sort of sincereness from my perspective because it always inevitably would happen again.. going off to college was a relief until I was sorely reminded of my father's bullshit the very first time I visited home.. 

So here I am now, 24 years old, and I went back home for Thanksgiving and I couldn't stand to stay. Today, I left right after I ate, fought back tears as I said goodbye to my mother who had worked so hard on dinner, and rushed out so quickly I said 'no' to leftovers.. I've been alone in my apartment depressed. 

Last year, my father got drunk and obsessively accused my mom of cheating on him at the dinner table. I had had enough of it and I demanded he stop acting like a fucking idiot all the time. Of course, I had 'fought back' and stuck up for my mother throughout the years of this shit, but as a grown woman now, I am so much more aware of the degree of BULLSHIT his behavior truly amounts to. Now that I and my brothers are grown up, my father doesn't even bother apologizing for his antics.. in fact, he will try to manipulate anything he can to make it seem as if it is somehow ME being irrational. I am the main target.. and if not me, it is my mother. He does mental gymnastics and I am so much more aware of it now that I am older, but I watch my mother continue to be gaslit and emotionally/mentally/verbally abused... but she just deals with it and will pretend everything is fine. 

 I have gotten to the point where I can't pretend anymore. I've tried almost everything. I've tried to talk to my dad, it ends up becoming abusive or mental gymnastics. I've tried talking to my mother, she makes excuses for him like ""he loves you so much"". Which I used to believe, but these last couple years I can't believe that anymore because of the way he has acted. My mother has always deserved so much better than how he treats her, and all she wants is a happy family... but I can't pretend to be happy in my family any longer while I feel like I have been subjected to some fucked up childhood experiences and verbal assaults that can STILL happen out of nowhere sometimes.

118,"Fake account to message girl

Fake account

So me (18 yr old F) and my boyfriend (19 yr old M) have been together for 3 years this past October. Just yesterday I got on his snapchat and I seen he was talking to a girl.. I keep looking and it’s a fake account he made exactly a week ago(made sure of it , hasn’t been longer) . He wasn’t saying nothing bad and he was talking about how he loved me to this girl and the rest was just like friendly talk from what I can see. I also seen he added two of his ex girlfriends but they didn’t have no conversation at all he also added another girl and all he said was “single?” And she didn’t not reply. He was sleeping while I did this so I woke him and I felt so much hurt in my heart and started bawling. I left him and came to my moms and he keeps apologizing and he knows he fucked up and he said he didn’t do nothing physical or talked to them in any flirty way but this is still NOT okay to me. He has been crying and begging me to just listen to him and he said he doesn’t even know why he did that, that he just did and had no intentions on hurting me with this by doing this. I love him so much but when I’m in a relationship I want to feel secure by knowing how we stand in our relationship and the fact that I have lack of trust with him doesn’t help with that at all. I know I’m worthy of more and im enough and a good person to be loved right but I also want to know I’m the only one they’re interested in, only girl he has his eyes on, ( I don’t want to be with someone’s who has other girls on his mind) which he says he only wants me but I don’t see where the necessity was for him to have gone to make a fake account to do that and he said he doesn’t know why he even did it, that he just did it and that he knows he fucked up but he wasn’t doing anything “wrong” just friendly talk ( but I can only see chats not actually snaps). I want to be with him but a huge part of me doesn’t want to deal with that but I feel like we still got so much to do together. I’ve also felt like I have gotten too dependent on him and I don’t feel like I know how to be alone no more which I want to work on because I really do dislike a lot about myself and I want to love myself and be okay with myself but it’s just like he is my best friend and it’s just so hard to think about us not being together. I need advice on what I should do basically stay and work it out with him OR leave and work on myself and see how that goes.
TL/DR 
“Boyfriend of 3 years made fake account exactly one week ago to talk to a girl. Nothing flirtatious was said and he mentioned me and talked about him loving me. Still did it behind my back.

I come from a very working-class family where me and my brothers are the first to go to university. We went through financial  troubles during my formative years that really set me back and has left me with trauma. My mum took out her anger on me and my dad was not  totally there to support us emotionally. As a result it destroyed my self-esteem and to this day I have huge issues with self-doubt.

Now I see many of my friends  who had 'normal' upbringings doing fine in life.  They have absolutely nothing going for them but because they didn't have the same issues as, everything seems to just happen for them. My best friend from school was treated like a god in his family since he was the only boy and was also gifted intellectually. I didn't care that his career was going from strength to strength all because he didn't have to go through what I did, but now he feels too good to even associate with me and this has made me absolutely resent him. Sometimes my anger to him gets so much I wish bad on him (which I know is a terrible thing to do).

I am thankful every day for what I do since compared the the vast  majority of the people on Earth and history, I am living like a king.  But at times my bitterness can take over and I find it difficult to get on with my life. 

Can someone give me some advice to help me get over it?",29Nov2019,1

Here is the problem. We just obtained a new administrator. I have liked her okay and given her leniency due to this being her first position like this. She trusts me. Heck, most days she likes me. Keep in mind I'm salaried. The old administrator made it clear that I am not to work over my 40h to the point of sending me home if she knew I had stayed late the night before. Wouldn't let me take home my lap top to catch up at home. This one does not agree. She added on so much extra work that it's like working 2.5 jobs. I'm not the only one either. Other managers are having the same issue. When I tried to turn down additional responsibilities stating that my day was full she dinged me on my review for not delegating my tasks to my staff and coming to her with a problem and not a solution. Again, these tasks are in addition to my position. I checked my contract and there is a clause stating that they can basically tack on whatever they want. Heck, she added so much for my staff that it was literally impossible. Our census was low and I couldn't even give out one full shift per day with out going over my hours. When she told me to cut hours I asked which tasks she would prefer cut. She stated none of them and to figure it out. So, I emailed the other managers from other facilities in the same positions asking what they due in an instance of a low census. They stated that they do not cut their staff. I mentioned that I attempted to come to her with a solution and this was the result. She stated that not cutting staff hours is a good way to get fired. So I cut back. However, this meant picking up my staffs work as well. At this point, my heart rate was 108 at rest due to stress. I'm on great terms with my corporate contact. I reached out asking for any tips on prioritizing or even communicating with my boss. She was very sympathetic but stated she didnt know what to do other than work as many hours as I needed to in order to get the job done. Well, a similar organization reached out asking me to interview. When I did, it was very up scale. Not really my thing but everyone was incredibly kind. They were very impressed with my resume and answers to their questions. When the wage aspect was brought up, it was less than I am currently making. I told them I wouldn't leave my position for anything less than what I make. They stated that the wage is negotiable and asked me for a second interview. This place is one of those ""too good to be true"" types. I'm always sceptical when things seem too nice. Heck, this place even has a live in dog and cat. The company is solid. It would actually be less responsibility on my end. I'm not entirely sure I would be taken seriously with in the facility. However, I could bring that concern to my second interview. The position is hourly so I would get paid for every single hour that I work including approved over time and holiday pay. Heck, they even recognize 2 additional holidays than my current place. Oh, and they have a heated parking garage for staff vs parking outside in snow. Where I'm most torn is that I love the population I serve.

It's a 14 hour drive there and back, so 28 hour drive full. My parents don't really like flying.

Although I'm 3 years away from actually moving out, I've started to feel *really* guilty the more I think about it.

I'm trying to think of the positive side, by thinking about how I'm going to move in with the love if my life, move in the same town as my best friend, and how I'll make new friends, but the guilt keeps overwhelming the positive.

How can I feel less guilty about moving out?

How can I tell my friends and family that I'm moving away.

How can I still stay in contact with them?

I have/will still have a phone, so I'll be able to contact my family, friends and parents, but what about hanging out and spending time with my parents and/or family when there's a 28 hour drive in between us?

What about the holidays? If my friend/s and SO are okay with me inviting my parents/family during Thanksgiving, Christmas or other holidays, how would that work? We'll most likely be in a flat/apartment, so there's not much room for guest rooms, so they'd have to come and go the same night..

I don't know. I'm so uncertain and worried about the future, especially that time.

Any help, please?",29Nov2019,1

140,"I apologise in advance for how complicated this might sound and I completely understand if you just want to skip over this post.

I am currently in my first semester of college. My senior year of highschool I basically had two best friends (we'll call James and Rob). Midway through the year, James and I met Rob's friends and we all seemed to click. We hung out for the few short months we had left together and it was great. However, I was always self conscious if the friend group liked me back, or if they just included me because I was James and Rob's friend. 

Come the new school year Rob went to the military and the rest of us went our separate ways. (Now this is where stuff gets blurry for me). Apparently while I was off at college, James made someone in the friend group mad at him (I think he led her on and backed out).

We're all currently back in town for the break and I haven't seen any of them since halfway through the summer. I'm still close friends with both James and Rob, but no one from the friend group has said a word to me. Well, just yesterday I got a text from someone in the friend group telling me that they were all hanging out later with Rob and I could come. This was the first I heard from them since summer and it felt out of place. Maybe I'm all in my head about this, but it didn't feel entirely genuine. I really want to see Rob and I don't how to approach this situation. On top of everything James it texting me on the side asking if I can hang out at the same time and he's asking if anyone in the group has reached out to me. I don't think he knows that he's screwed up and they don't like him anymore.

Should I go hang out with the group tomorrow? It really feels like they are ""allowing"" me to see Rob instead of wanting me to come. I also told them that I wanted to see them so they might just feel pressured to invite me. I know this might be a hard situation to understand over just a few paragraphs, but any advice would be greatly appreciated!",29Nov2019,1

I have been feeling numb to everything and don't have anyone to talk to about my feelings asides her. For a long time I felt attached to her but now feels like a chore to accommodate her with myself when I already stuggle with living my life. She's always asking to see me even though I know I have only allotted time I can spend at the college before I have to go to work or study. I want the attention but at the same time. I hate not feeling good enough for her. I've debated on either breaking up or just waiting til I mess up big and she breaks it off which she's so attached to me I don't think that will happen. I'm not close to anyone in her family like parents. I feel like a waste of space 90% of the time due to how rinse and repeat each day is. Work and school and then having time for her. I dont have friends and have no interest in making new ones due to how if I cant spend time with my gf how the heck do I spend time with friends. I seriously just want to be in solitude but at the same time I just want to be noticed and given attention. 

TL:DR : Never has time for long distance girlfriend who is extremely clingy due to work and school. We see one another at college at thats it. I want attention but could live happily in solitude. Not sure if I should break up and let her find someone who can give her the time of day and with someone who isn't stressed out 100% of the time trying to make ends meet.",29Nov2019,1

145,"I’m 14. I want outside opinions. And I know that a lot of you are going to say that I shouldn’t, but... I need to know.

Should I kill myself?

I’ve tried before. I have spent 8 days in an inpatient unit, and I’ve long since hit double digits for attempts. I have severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, severe Major Depressive Disorder, and Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorder (I have every symptom of anorexia except for being underweight).

I’m currently in an intensive outpatient treatment program for my OCD, and, since starting four weeks ago, my depression has gotten significantly worse. 

I can’t reach out to my friends because a lot of them also struggle with suicidal ideation, and the last time I did they said they couldn’t handle it, which I completely respect. It’s important to be able to set boundaries and put your own safety first.

I’m scared of telling the clinicians at my treatment program because I don’t want to scare my parents. A lot of times when I’ve had a bad suicidal streak it’s turned out to be nothing, and I bring stress on our family. My parents are divorced and have extreme difficulty communicating, though it has improved over the past 10 years.

I have a therapist, but she hasn’t ever been effective in treating my suicidal ideation, and I don’t want to talk about it with her.

I don’t know what to do. I feel awful for dumping my issues on a bunch of strangers that didn’t ask for this. I’m sorry, I just don’t know anything anymore and I’m lost and scared.",29Nov2019,1

Cheats on her bf and is money hungry. Power hungry.
She treated me well though as a friend! She was fun to talk to and someone to hang with / talk to daily. 

Anyway, one day I had enough of her bragging. Just like really couldn’t stand it. I’m financially in a rough spot and she just was really going over the top so I asked her kindly to please be mindful of it, I’m struggling and don’t need to hear about her constant income (she is an escort).

She got SO heated and called me jealous and insecure... and told me if I were to talk to her about my income she’d be happy for me...
I said that’s not the point and how it’s just hard for me right now..

Since the first day I knew it wasnt for me. They stuck me in the reject branch where there are literally 3 other people working there, and I work with exclusively stupid middle aged women. Half the time there is absolutely nothing going on and then all of the sudden it gets insanely stressful. One of the women I work with does not stop talking all day and the other is so incompetent I dont know how she makes it out of bed every morning. I’ve hated the job since the beginning, and making it this far has been an absolute struggle. 

Not to mention I interviewed for a part time position, and they have been making me work not only full time but overtime every single week since Ive been there. On top of this, there was a total system conversion just a few weeks ago that was executed so poorly with so many issues and It was absolute chaos. I was forced to work insane hours and deal with angry customers for two weeks straight, and still am dealing with it. I was to learn both the old system and the new one from the start.

I hate this job and I know I need to quit, but I have absolutely nothing lined up yet. Ive been there 3 months and I feel like I absolutely cant take it anymore. My resume is not too great and Im worried about what it may look like if I put my 3 months at the bank on it.

I go to college which is an hour drive from home. 

I'm working a part time job (min wage 9.25) strictly weekends. Roughly 100 dollars a weekend for gas during the week as it takes $100 week to commute to school.

In a relationship who I see at only at college and at her house sometimes during breaks or summer.

I live with my grandpa who is a control freak. (Imagine a 1930's household where the oldest male is the leader of the house even if they don't bring home the bread) When anyone disagrees with him he has other family members jump on said person by saying, ""isnt that right (family members name) "" after he says something. He throws constant fits and tantrums when he is mad over the smallest thing and doesn't comprehend that he can be wrong.

I can't move closer to college due to not having funds and I'm 5.5k in student loans. I can't drop out because If I do I'll have to pay the military back all their money they used to help put me in college.

In the national guard so I have all those obligations to fullfill. Went guard soley to pay for college.

College blows hot loads. And wouldnt have went except its the only way I can show my family I can do something my brother can't. (He is way smarter than me but ended up dropping out).

161,"As the title describes it, since last August my life has radically changed. Before that month, I was a boy that was distracted by his university duties. Never had a date, never had a relationship, and certainly hadn’t given a Kiss to someone. Only I was doing my life studying for my final exam (that will be in March of 2020), playing videogames and seeing movies or enjoying with my family. 

Well, in a moment of August, I was seeing “Stories” on Instagram when I noted that one of my friends \[27/F\] was sad. I asked her what’s going on, and she told me that she was done with her boyfriend \[???/M\] because he didn’t help her when she needs it. During that month, we were talking a lot of things, I helped her to overcome this situation, but every weekend she got together with her ex, they had sex and then they fight again. She told me all these things, and I got demoralized because I was feeling something for her at that time. We had lunch a few times, but she was doubtful about to give to her ex a new opportunity or move on. I counted about 4 or 5 attempts to return, but all falling in the same mechanic of sex and the discussion.

Then, and motivated for what happened, in September I decided to install Tinder

I got a few matches at that moment and I started to talk with a girl older than me \[29/F\]. The same day that we started to talk on Tinder, she gave me her WhatsApp and the conversation flowed there. She invited me to her house to “teach me how to cook”, but the day after some aspects of her arose in the chat. She told me that she was a “jealous person that didn’t believe in a man-woman friendship”, and she likes to be “obeyed” when she gave advice or something. Even with that, we meet at her house the next day, we kissed and everything else. That day she told me that she has a child of 10 years old. Two days after that, we have a discusión because I was invited to a party with my sister’s friends, and she believes that I had chosen the party over her. I decided to broke up that day. 

Some weeks after that, in October, I reinstalled Tinder and I started to talk with another girl \[27/F\]. She seems nice and she followed me on Instagram. We talked a lot of things, from studies to food, music, films, love and everything else. She invited me to her house, we cooked pizza and we were in her bed seeing Netflix. Nothing happened, we didn’t kiss or something, even when I tried to approach her. The next week she invited me again to her house, and even when we were going directly to her room and I told her at that moment some things like “I liked her hair”, nothing happened again. We only saw movies. 

The last one happened with a girl \[27/F\] that was following me on Instagram. Even when she invited me to meet us three times and all of them she canceled, she was talking me about past relationships, her ""adventures"" with some guys that she meets when she goes out at night, the type of men that she likes and her dislike for the “self Independence” on a couple. She offered me to teach me to smoke weed, but one day she slept badly and when I tried to help her, she rejected that and the next messages that I sent her she let it in “Seen”. I deleted her from my Instagram.

Actually I only have contact with my friend and the second girl of Tinder. About my friend, she definitely broke up with her ex, but she didn't answer any of my messages. The other one hardly speaks to me.

So now, I'm sitting in front of the computer writing this post. I don't know what to do about my situation, because I regret for all the occasions that have failed in these months. Sometimes I think: ""What should I need do to get someone at my side, to be with someone that loves me or appreciate me?"", but I don't know the answer.

Thanks for reading this.  
 

TL:DR: Since August I was meeting some girls who changed my paradigm. First, I started to had feelings with my friend, but she came back and ended constantly with her ex. Then, I went out with a girl I met in Tinder, but by their attitudes, we broke up. Then I met a girl who invited me to her house twice but nothing ever happened, and finally, a girl with whom I could never meet her, who told me about her past relationships and nighttime activities with some other guys.",29Nov2019,1

I am struggling hard with this decision and would really appreciate some advice. I am 29 years old, recently married, renting an apartment in a city in Canada. I love the area I live in as well as the apartment I live in.

I recently applied for a job in Belgium as I heard of an opportunity and deep down moving to Europe temporarily was something I had always wanted to try, as to date I’ve lived in the same city since I was born.

I got the job and I accepted the offer to start in January pending visa papers, and my plan was to stay for 1-1.5years. 
But here’s the kicker... I keep having feelings of wanting to back out because of a few reasons:

1. The job doesn’t pay as much as I could be making in my current city

2. The housing market in my city is slowly rising so I am worried the longer I wait to invest in property the tougher it will become

3. General fear of the unknown, leaving the comfort of the apartment I currently love

4. Putting my cat through the stress of a transatlantic move

5. Just general wanting to settle down now that I am married, buying a place of my own. I am Wondering if living abroad was something I always wanted to do but may no longer be something that fits my current life goals...

Not really sure what to expect from this post. I guess I could just use some words of wisdom if anyone’s got any

&amp;#x200B;

For clarity, I'm 15 years old and my grandpa passed away in 2012. After the death of my grandpa, my dad mourned for a few months (perfectly normal), and began to collect my grandpa's sermons into a book (my grandfather was a priest). My dad worked on this book for 3\~ years. A couple years after he finished the book, my grandmother died. My dad planned out a family get together for 1.5\~ years. Due to all of this, I grew up with a father but it seemed his daily cycle was get up&gt; go to work&gt;come home&gt; work on memorial/book/organize my grandparents stuff. I basically grew up drawing and playing Animal Jam because my dad wasn't all too interested in me. So my home life for about 7 years was just me, my sister, my dad, and my mom staring at our screens. As I write this out my family is currently down stairs on their computers. My mom has talked to my dad about this, and my dad certainly does interact with me more and says ""I love you more"", but he still compiles my grandfather's sermons and is currently organizing his inheritence. I respect him still being hurt over the death of his parents ( I would be and will be when he passes away), but this whole constantly thinking and mourning about the past isn't healthy. I've tried hinting about hobbies he said he's wanted to do before, and even offered to help him. But, my dad is the ""if I have to pay to do it, I'm not doing it"" kinda guy. It would hard to have a talk unless through my mom (whom  I'm probably even more distant to) because my dad is really trying his hardest to make life comfortable and good for me, and I don't want to say it's not enough.

later she confronted me about being snippy and unpleasant. so i explained i was just kind of sad with how she spoke with me sometimes, and that i was sick//with a cold// and didn't feel my best. the next day she was cold and ignored me. and later that day told me to talk to her when i was less sick. which, ill admit hurt my feelings. which opted for me to decide not to talk with her for a couple of days. another friend stepped in who was seeing we were having problems, and knew both of us well. she helped some, but now i just feel terrible it even happened. the friend who got upset apologized, but i still can't help but feel it's my fault it even started. i feel so emotionally constipated and want to cry desperately but just nothing is coming out. i fee like i'm overacting and blowing this way out of proportions, but i'm also incredibly stressed.

fights like this have happened often and i just want it to fucking stop. how do i keep myself from causing these problems? what do i do? i feel like what i say is small and not harmful but it turns out to be for her, what do i do? every confrontation i bring up to her ends up hurting her and nothing gets solved, in fact, it's like i make things worse. so i don't like telling her when things are wrong, or how to be gentle enough. i just want to be nice to her. i just want to be nice in general. i feel like a fuck up",29Nov2019,1

R passed away nearly 3 years ago when we were still in high school, we're now older &amp; he pitched this idea. i would have gone to the grave with this secret of R not liking S, however it feels wrong to let him get a tattoo for her when she didn't even like him. &amp;, they weren't close. their friendship was strongest in 8th grade, by junior year it was a 'hello' in passing. what do i do? do i not say anything &amp; let him get it, or if not, how do i gently tell him not to get it? 

thank you in advance!!",29Nov2019,1
172,"I’m only 17 but I feel like this is going to be my entire life. I have social anxiety, intimacy issues, and I don’t like sex so of course i’m never gonna be able to hold a stable relationship. I feel not only unlovable, but also like I wouldn’t be able to give much to my theoretical partner. I just want to cuddle and watch movies really. I’ve never really had a sex drive and the thought of doing it just sounds uncomfortable and I feel like I won’t ever meet someone I love who feels the same way. Maybe it’s just because I’m insecure about myself, maybe it’s just because I’m young, but i’ve never had a boyfriend or girlfriend and with my current level of confidence I don’t think I ever will. I rarely get crushes, and when I do, it’s usually with someone who i’ve been friends with for a while and I never want to admit anything due to how it would affect our friendship and I would never want to risk anything. I just don’t know how to deal with the dread of living a life alone with a boring office job in a boring suburban town. How do I get out of this mindset?",29Nov2019,1

So i’m gay (not out) and i’ve developed a crush to a guy on the swim team. He has been really nice to me and is just a really great person. He’s cute but he’s not  like the hottest guy in the class. He’s new here and it’s his first year at my school. 

It feels like butterflies whenever i talk to him and i can’t stop thinking about him.

176,"Or would you? Harsh title but it’s honest.
I have a couple of online friends that I made while playing a popular online game the past couple of months. Friends is kind of stretching it because none of them really know much about me. I told them I was a private person and didn’t want to talk about my life. They really didn’t talk about themselves either so even though we would play often, we didn’t know much about each other. I met most of them in game. Didn’t really play with the expectation to make friends, just wanted to play the game. I was going through some stuff so I played the game more often (sometimes every night a week , usually 2-3) but now life has shifted and don’t have the same time as I did before. 



Since I’ve gotten busy, most of them have an unspoken understanding that we play if I’m ever on but don’t really push it when I go weeks without playing which is great. Another one of the friends pretty much messages everyday about playing or of something related. I don’t really want to talk about the game so much and they dont do anything else but play it. Conversations are pretty dull since it’s usually me carrying the weight of it. I used to reply to just be nice but I feel like at this point I should say something because I don’t want to talk everyday. How would you go about saying this in a nice, respectful manner? I’ve since lowered my frequency of replies but I feel weird since they’ll just message again the next day and the next even if I didn’t reply to their last message.",29Nov2019,1

182,"For clarification about 2 weeks ago I sold an older desktop tower to some guy on Facebook Marketplace. He came round, I showed him the system working and he said he was happy with it. Even gave the dude a free keyboard and helped him load the PC into his car. He messages me later asking me some basic questions which I'm happy to answer, then says Windows isn't activated which I apologise for and I give him detailed information on how to activate the system. Over the next couple days he continuously asks questions, and finally he asks something like ""my mouse isn't working when I plug it in"" and I stop replying since I'm not tech support. 

Couple weeks go past until this morning when I receive a furious message from him calling me a scammer because he doesn't know how to activate Windows and apparently its been overheating. He says he paid for a technician to come round and apparently one of the clips for the CPU cooler was snapped. I had run Prime95 while monitoring temperatures with CoreTEMP and the entire time I had it there were zero issues, even with Prime95 it was running at the high 60s to low 70s. I tell him I didn't notice any issues with it while it was in my possession and it most likely was damaged during transit while he had it. Dude starts going off and cursing, saying I'm a scammer who knew it was broken and he wants me to buy and install a new cooler for him as well as come round to his place to install Windows for him. At this point he says ""I expect Windows 10 at the least or I'm coming to drop it off... You can say no, but I'll show"". At this point I again tell him there are many tutorials online, which I have linked to him multiple times and if that's too hard he can buy a legitimate product key for about $7 on eBay. I then tell him if he comes round I'll call the police, we have surveillance cameras and he incriminated himself in these messages. I then blocked him since I'm sick of him at this point and don't appreciate his constantly cursing, calling me a scammer and especially the threats he made about coming round.

What do I do moving forward? I am worried he'll show up to my house or try something. Should I leave him blocked, or unblock him and try to resolve it?",29Nov2019,1

Traditional publishing basically means you give up your ownership of your book to whatever company you're with. That means characters, places, everything. It's no longer yours 

Self publishing means you get to keep everything, but it's so fucking expensive 

I've been thinking about it, and I'm deciding on if getting a femdom (I think that's what it's called?) or a side job selling pictures online for cash. 

I feel guilty for even thinking about it, because I have a boyfriend. However, I just don't see another way. 

I work a minimum wage job with bills and insurance to pay. I'll never be able to afford this, not by doing what I'm doing now.

Being a published author is my dream, and I'm concerned I'm going to have to start selling feet pics or something.

201,"Can I just leave my job?


So let me explain my why I want to just stop showing up. My manager sucks. I don’t know if she doesn’t like me or something, but she definitely has her favorites within our pet salon. Our salon is separated in 2 groups, the bathers and the groomers. I’m going to be talking about the problems the bathers have. She never trained any of us. There’s literally only 1 bather that actually know how to do everything, but this bather wasn’t originally from this salon, which is probably why she is so much better than the rest of us. Her idea of training is just to watch the bather who knows how to do it work. Many of us don’t know how to do sanitary trims, anal gland cleaning, or paw pad shaving, which is concerning since we’re supposed to be “professional” as far as the customers know. She also makes it very obvious who she likes and dislikes. She’ll be having good conversation, laughing, smiling, joking around and then when somebody enters who she doesn’t like, she’ll just stop talking and frown at them. She’ll even book us with 6 or 7 dogs and still expect us to do the dogs that come in needing nail clipping. And then afterwards get irritated when we’re taking a long time to finish our dogs with actual appointments. Nail clipping is not easy! It takes maybe 10 minutes for a dog that’s nice to work with. But for a dog that bites, is scared of the nail grinder/ nail clippers, or scared of the noise from dogs in kennels, blow dryers, water from our shower heads/ hoses, etc, or even is scared of a stranger having to grab their paws, it takes 15-20 minutes to finish. And when 6-15 dogs come almost all at the same time, those minutes add up, and it makes us really behind. And lastly she expects the bathers to clean EVERYTHING, where as the groomers are only expected to MAYBE clean their station in the front. We’re basically the janitors to the groomers. We clean the kennels, the floor, their stations if they didn’t clean it themselves, the bathing area etc. The work is not equal. She’s not reasonable. All the bathers are lowkey intimidated by her. And i want to leave. I’m over it. She’ll get mad when I don’t know what to do, even tho it’s her fault for not training or showing me how to do it. If you get bitten by a dog, she won’t do anything, you’ll still be expected to keep working. All she’ll say is write a note on the dog profile about it, for the next bather or groomer who gets the dog. Oh and I have a health condition, which keeps me from doing bigger dogs. But if a big dog comes in for nails, and I decide to go to the back and ask for another bather to do it she’ll be like, “you can’t do it?” judgmentally. And if a pet parent with a huge dog books an appointment with me online. She doesn’t change it. Like a big Mountain dog came in the other day because they booked online with me, mind you she sees our schedules, and I had to ask another bather to add this dog to her already overbooked schedule, because she didn’t fix it ahead of time. I tried to give a 2 week notice to quit, but she never replied to it, my nails are so thin because with all the dogs showing up for nails I end up having to rush to get through all of them so the dogs with actual appointments don’t overstay, which results in me grinding my own nails in the process. I have so many scratches on my arms from dogs not wanting to get their nails done. I have a bruise on both of my legs from having to do big dogs that are way stronger than me. I usually am either late for my breaks or have to pretend I’m on my break while I’m still working or else my dogs will overstay. Most of the time the bathers don’t get their 30 minute break, but since we get a penalty for not having one, we end up having to pretend to. We end up clocking out and going back to working with our dogs while setting a timer for us to go back to clock in and then continue working again. And our 15 minute break, lol we never ever get it. We can’t, we have no time to. So this is why I want to quit. I want to stop showing up.",29Nov2019,1

205,"I am a good college student when I try but after I performed poorly in the summer 2018 semester I was put on academic probation. Not an excuse but untreated anxiety and depression issues which I am only coming to accept I need help for definitely contributed to this. In October 2018 my mother died very unexpectedly, while I actually did well in school for the fall 2018 semester by winter I was feeling very low and unmotivated in school, I performed poorly at college again and was put on academic suspension until May 2020. My partner also became unemployed in December 2018 and was until August 2019, she has serious depression and anxiety issues which were exacerbated during this time, and they are still more of an issue than usual because of job dissatisfaction. Though she is actually very gentle / emotionally intelligent / empathetic and so loving I never opened up to her or anyone else, not even my best friend, about my issues at school, and I have not spoken much about my depression and anxiety issues which I am very good at hiding and repressing but have been increasing a lot. Some of this increase has to do with my mother's death, some of it from worrying about a possible medical issue which was discovered after medical tests ordered after my mother's death, and some of it from dealing with other people's negative emotions often (my partner is not the only source, my best friend has depression and dealt with several losses last year which put him in crisis, my father took my mother's death very hard despite the fact that they were divorced in 2001, my only grandparent has dementia which my father and close cousin are primarily dealing with, and all of these people sometimes rely on me to support them emotionally, or at least I put that responsibility upon myself).

Basically I have used these issues as an excuse to hide the fact that I haven't been enrolled in school since April. I lie about my classes (I said they were mostly online) and everything to do with it, I haven't done anything useful in months since I don't work. Today my father asked me for proof of enrolment at school so I can access education funds my mother left me. I have no choice but to come clean to my partner and father, but honestly I'm tired of lying.

I found out today I can apply to basically erase select semesters to improve my GPA and remove the suspension from my record, but not in time for the January start so it'll still be May that I can start again. I think I will qualify because aside from my failing grades I have all high Bs and As as well as really good professor references, plus documentation for my mother's death which can hopefully corroborate my depression issues. Tomorrow I start the process to do this. I am also going to make an appointment with my doctor to be referred to mental health services but I'm not sure what the wait time will be. I am also going to register to do online courses at another university in January which can possibly be transferred to my university when I start again. So basically I am working now to amend this as best as I can right now but I had to be kicked in the ass to do it.

How do I tell them all of this? I feel so guilty. I am afraid they will be so mad but realistically it's more that they'll be hurt I lied and sad for me, I am so uncomfortable talking about my problems and I don't want people to know I'm so sad :( writing all this is the closest I've come to saying anything to anyone and I don't know how to do it in real life...",29Nov2019,1
206,"So I’m a small 20F, and I work a very well known store in town. I do help out in many different departments and for the most part, dealing with customers isn’t that bad. I get along with some customers really well and some I believe I get along with well. I’ve been thinking about how I could have handled this situation and I’ve been told that I should have reacted differently, but I cannot be mean to save my life. At work, I have a quite older gentleman think it was absolutely fine to yank on my hair a few times after I got him help in the right department, with someone that worked DIRECTLY in that department. And I don’t mean like tugging, he yanked my hair and I couldn’t walk away. As soon as he let go, I walked as quickly as I could because, personal things I’ve dealt with in the past. I did tell a manager but it wasn’t until after I calmed down from a major panic attack. Sadly, for some reason I deal with a lot of other gentlemen trying to get too close to comfort with me, and I’m scared that if I tell management, they’ll either think I’m lying or that I’m making it up. I love my job, but I have no clue how to handle these situations once they become physical.

207,"First of all, my boyfriend is 24, and we have two daughters. He is a great boyfriend &amp; an amazing father. We’ve been together for almost 4 years.

He always says i’m a terrible gift-giver. Maybe i am, but I always try really hard to make his gifts something he likes or (what i think) is really thoughtful. For example, I bought him one of those pretty crystal pyramid things, and spent a lot of money on it. He was into crystal healing for a short time. Well, I’m dumb and didn’t read the dimensions of it, and the pyramid got sent really tiny. Hahaha he laughed about it, but my gifts always seem to get messed up.

Anyway, we are basically hippies. He loves Joe Rogan podcasts. he has tattoos of different hippy/spiritual things on his arm. We are not religious. He isn’t too into sports. But he loves UFC/MMA fights. He likes funny things and nature. He is a cook in a restaurant kitchen, so he wouldn’t really like anything that has to do with cooking. And he likes beer, but wouldn’t call him any kind of alcohol connoisseur. 

Since we just had a baby, i had to save up money really hard so I could get him something. I’m on maternity leave now, so it was especially hard to save up. He works really hard &amp; goes to school full-time. We love him, and I would feel horrible if I couldn’t get him anything.",29Nov2019,1

My husband needs prescription pain killers for a diagnosed and documented pain condition and other injuries that have him in constant pain.

216,"I met my boyfriend last year of November and we’ve basically been together ever since, I really do see a future with him but it’s hard when he constantly does things that make me doubt our relationship/future together. (For the most part or if what he tells me is true he feels the same about wanting a future etc)
Just this month I went and visited him for the first time for 13 days. (I had an amazing time and really felt like things with him are suppose to work out, this is why I’m torn) while I was staying with him I could tell he was being suspicious or trying to hide something and I didn’t know what. I’d asked to do something on his phone at one point and he started asking “why” “why can’t you use yours” “you don’t need to go on mine” kind of thing. Which of course if we’ve been together for almost a year it shouldn’t be an issue if I go on your phone in my opinion but whatever maybe I’m over stepping. In the middle of my stay with him I noticed he’d always get Snapchat’s from other girls (he won’t let me see the snaps, and yes I know guys can have friends that are girls) so I asked “why do you have so many girls snapping you all the time?” He answered “they are just premium snapchats, nothing to worry about”  which I’m pretty sure that means a bunch of naked snaps from random girls, LOVE THAT. 
But, that didn’t bother me as much as the message he got a day later from his ex saying “hey wyd later today?” And of course wasn’t allowed to see his phone when he answered that either. 
FAST FORWARD to later that night we were getting ready to watch A movie and cuddle up etc, he ran downstairs quickly because he forgot something and he left his phone open.... 
HE LEFT IT OPEN
So of course my grimy little fingers had to go and snoop and possibly destroy my relationship. Ah...
I went to the messages from his ex, scrolled up and up until I find a text from a month ago saying “honestly was trying to fuck” from my boyfriend.
From the guy I’m suppose to get old with, right. You can only imagine what I’m thinking.
Also the text explaining why he wasn’t able to hangout said “it depends what my friend is doing”..... YOUR FRIEND? ok.. OK. So not only is he trying to “fuck” but also keeping me a secret from his ex who “I don’t have to worry about” 
SO... I got up and went to the bathroom put his phone back in the same place and didn’t really know what my next move would be, I had 6 more days left there... where the fuck was I gonna go? No where. Was I gonna break up with him???

As soon as he got back upstairs he knew something was wrong, apparently I don’t hide anger well. He couldn’t figure it out, I kept asking if there was something he needed to tell me. He kept saying idk. I was just shaking. I told him to give me his phone and he did. I scrolled to that message showed it to him and he just looked at it. And looked at it. Like he didn’t know what to say. After a minute he came up with the excuse that he was high and nothing ever even happened. Then had the audacity to say that I did the same thing with someone else. (who I hadn’t seen/done anything with while in a relationship with him.)

I also found it quite ironic that his only motive to breakup with me would be if I cheated. Like what kinda backhanded bull shit is that?

Anyway, since it all went down and he claims nothing happened and he’s blocked her on Facebook (that’s what they were messaging on) and told me he won’t hangout/ talk to her anymore. I have forgiven him but it still haunts me that he’s doing something behind my back and will continue to hide things. I really don’t want to throw a year down the drain but sadly it looks like he had no problem with that. 

I just need some advice on what I should do or even advice to cope with it

218,"I'm 25 years old. I work minimum wage, I'm in debt, single and only dated two women (briefly) my entire life. Both cheated on me, the last relationship was especially traumatic and I haven't been able to get it up ever since (3 yrs).

I have no career prospects, nothing to look forward to, and I feel like I've run out of options. I'm in a really bad place. 

I've been to university, but my field wasn't in demand and it only left me in debt. Then I worked in film but eventually left that too 
because jumping from gig to gig, not knowing when or where your next pay may come, and working in a high stress environment with egomaniacs wasn't my cup of tea. 

So I left that career and started working minimum wage at 22 to figure my life out. Its been three years and I still have no idea. 

**Military** - I looked into every career in the CAF, only two interested me at all -- Imagery Technician &amp; Personnel Selection Officer. Turns out they are both *very* difficult trades to get into and pretty competitive. 

**Police, Fire &amp; Medic** - Of all those options fire sounds *slightly* more appealing but I have no interest in that field. I respect what these men and women do but I don't want to see badly hurt people, especially kids. 

**Going back to school** - I won't even consider it unless it's a career I'd really like that's in demand which doesn't apply to anything right now.

On paper I feel like I'm capable of doing many careers, I graduated high school with honors and I've always been very creative and analytical. But literally none of my interests and skills are relevant to the workforce. I love training Jiu Jitsu, writing, reading, working with numbers and doing independent research projects. I can't fake interest, if I'm not interested in a topic it's extremely difficult to focus and just drains the life out me.

Then came a long multi-paragraph text. I replied and told him he would never hear from me again. In the morning he started sending me vulgar texts demanding I send him everything he had at my place. I blocked him. He started sending me texts from a different bunch of numbers. I finally unblocked him since he wanted one last change to text me. After I got his text I wished him the well. Obviously he not mentally stable and he himself admitted it. I didn't go to the police.

Today I got another text from a weird number with a link to a post of me on TheDirty. I know it's him. I know how he writes and the screenshots he posted are from our conversation and the pictures are pictures I just sent him. No nudity whatsoever. I can prove he harassed me by text message.

222,"This is going to sound fucking stupid because this situation is, in all honesty, kind of stupid, but I’m having a full on panic attack and need to get it out.

My ex (??) and I had been together for just over 2.5 years. He cheated on me with his ex girlfriend early on in the relationship and periodically would “flirt” with other girls (while I had no concrete evidence, it was fairly obvious). He lied to me pretty consistently, blocked my number while he went to parties, and basically just manipulated me and lied to me in a whole lotta different ways. 

I forgave him and believed him most of those times he apologized, and the past 6 ish months he had changed so, so much. He didn’t lie to me anymore and he became a lot more affectionate... until 2 months ago when I (accidentally) found texts on this phone telling an old female friend of his that he was single. (Spoiler- he was NOT single). Oddly enough in their entire conversation history he was not flirting at all, and he literally told her he had no interest in catching up with her, but at the time I was so hurt and confused I freaked out and didn’t notice.

Obviously this was soul crushing for me, since I am clearly very in love and couldn’t believe he would say something like that. And so I broke up with him that night and told just about everyone I know. Long story short a few weeks later we started talking again. He explained why he told that girl he was single, then proceeded to tell me he felt horrible for how he had treated me and wanted to make things right because he loves me. We’ve decided to take things slow, get to know eachother as friends, etc, but the one thing is we agreed not to fuck around w other people.

One of his friends basically accidentally told me that my ex and some girl had hooked up. I have no idea if it’s true or not- he denies it, his friend insists that my ex told him that word for word, and I have no idea who to believe. I decided to ignore it.

My ex’s OTHER friend has started hitting me up lately very often and we have started hanging out all the time. We were friends before he and my ex boyfriend even really knew eachother well, but they became really good friends while he and I were just normal friends. All the sudden since the breakup we became super close, things moved super fast and basically tonight we ended up making out on my couch.

I feel fucking horrible. 1. Because I broke my promise and 2. Because I broke my promise with his best friend, of all people. But at the same time I almost feel better- my ex cheated on me fuck knows how many times, at LEAST twice, and absolutely broke my heart. I didn’t do anything nearly as bad as he did and we aren’t even together right now, but it feels almost like some fucked up revenge. I feel disgusted with myself but oddly calm because I’m having a hard time telling myself he doesn’t deserve it.

225,"Long story short:

I learned that my middle daughter's aunt attempted to have my rights stripped so that she could adopt her. She apparently thinks that I am an unfit mother. I am not. Her grandmother also apparently said some very hurtful things about my youngest daughter and son.

The person who told me this requested that I not say anything, so I haven't. This aunt has no idea that I know.

This family also became close to my oldest daughter, considering I was with my ex for almost 3 years.

However, I have not sent my oldest to them in nearly a year due to these issues. I have no choice with my middle daughter, as her father has (not consistent) visitation, and I can't control where he takes her during his time.

Here's my issue: said aunt wants both of my oldest daughters to go to her house for a friend's party.
she has messaged me multiple times asking if they can go. I, honestly, have completely ignored these messages.
I will also admit that I have rather severe anxiety, and I struggle with being outright in situations. This is something i am working on in therapy.

I don't want them to go. I don't want them around her. She has ignored my wishes on multiple occasions, and was giving them Melatonin without my knowledge OR permission.

I worry that me saying no, especially because they want to see my oldest so badly, that it will cause a huge issue. I don't feel that I can trust them with my children anymore. I never thought that they, of all people, would ever try to betray me in this manner.

Am I totally wrong to ignore her messages? Should I just leave it at a simple ""I don't want them there""? What if she then asks for them a different day?

I try to avoid conflict. I don't deal with it well. I worry that no matter what I do here, it will be an issue.

233,"Apologizes for formatting, Im on mobile.
Im trying to get everything relevant written without making it too jumbled.

TLDR at bottom.

First a bit of context.
Im currently in my first semester of college. Initially while applying I thought I needed all the help I could get to get in so while choosing my major I looked for what would be the most out of the ordinary and settled on petroleum engineering because I figured it would be boring and not many people would pick it. Little did I know the college Im going to is one of the best in the world for petroleum engineering.

Due to extreme luck I somehow made it into the college of my dreams despite my extreme stupidity and lack of credentials. Though now Im having many second thoughts about my declared major.

Ive always had a large interest in the medical field. I find pharmacology, the body, and  psychoactive substances fascinating and I find myself browsing r/supplements r/medizzy and r/nootropics quite often. As a casual drug user I also find myself reading scientific literature about substances and their effects on the body and mind extremely interesting and my friends come to me when they want to know what something is, if they should take it, if its safe, and what potential harm it can cause because Ive grown to learn a decent amount. 

I love the human body and find it so interesting how many things work. I also have extended this learning to apply it towards growing physically, I develop my own exercise plans with mesocycles, diet and muscle hypertrophy. I coach my friends and have made others and myself decent gains through lifting, and I love reading new journals that come out on different topics related to muscle building.

I guess all this is just a lead up for me saying I think the body, its chemistry and the mind are fascinating, from MAOIs to knee anatomy I cant get enough.

I’ve been told by a large amount of people that I should change my major. Everyone says I know and talk too much about it to not seek a profession in the medical field, but I just don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been gifted such a great opportunity to become a P.E. it would be a shame not to take advantage of it especially with the school Im at. Plus if I were to graduate, the payoff would be enormous and Ive already began making connections and have gotten an internship interview with a decent sized company, and Im almost done with my first semester. The pay is the main attractor to P.E. for me, I see the alumni come in and talk to us and I feel like Im looking at a future me, a future with stability and no money worries unlike the first 16 years of my life.

But if I have no passion for it should I even consider it? I feel like its already too late and Ill be too far behind. I didn’t take AP Biology in high school and Ive already started on the P.E path even taking every physics class my highschool had to offer. On top of that what happens if Im not smart enough and then I cant get back into the engineering school due to grades? I barely made it into this college based off of legacy, how would I even manage? I cant see myself doing it no matter how hard I try. I have As, Bs and Cs in my classes right now and Im trying so hard and college is a huge difference from high school its so cumbersome.

Anxiety is building and I feel as if I don’t make a decision very very soon Im going to be stuck with that decision wether unhappy or happy my whole life and I don’t want that. I want to be happy. I want to financial freedom, stability and more. I want success for myself so my family will be proud of me. My siblings are lawyers and CS majors I just want to be seen in the same light as them. Successful.

I cant waste time or my parents money so Im working as hard as I can but what if its not enough in the end?

At this point any advice is highly appreciated. So thank you to anyone who comments on this.

Apologies. This turned into a ramble.

He lived like 3 houses up from mine, so we walked home from the bus stop together. He gave me his Instagram and that’s when things got weird. He started talking to me about porn stars he liked and they were all of the same ethnicity of me. At first I just blew it off because I often got cat called and was called “Mia Khalifa” because I’m half Arabian.

I ghosted him and he stopped coming to school, I’m assuming he moved over the summer. I was reminded of him when going through old Instagram DM’s.

236,"I think I'm starting to get depression. I just feel burnt out for some reason, and I just want to feel better again. i feel like I'm a zombie. I'm just gonna lay it all out in the best way I can (I have HFA, so sorry if I'm confusing, or don't make sense btw):

* I go to sleep at like 7 am and wake up at 3 pm every day. It's a regular schedule, but it's fucking up my concentration. I end up in the bed just sitting there until 4 or 5 pm on some days.
* I'm stressed about my life. My parents are $900 in debt, and we likely aren't going to be able to spend anything for Christmas. I have $300 dollars, and I plan on spending it on Christmas.
* I rarely go outside because my parents have agoraphobia, and we're too poor to do anything.
* I drink too much soda and eat too much junk food like fries, pretzels, cheese-its, etc. We can't afford to get any vegetables or any healthier food (though sometimes we eat healthily)
* I rarely talk to anyone outside of my family. Its been like this since I graduated high school.
* I watch youtube and look at memes on social media all day. Depression memes piss me off.
* I rarely do anything outside of drawing, schoolwork (I take online classes for a community college), and videomaking

Now, let me list some of the good things I have going for me:

* I haven't masturbated since June. Sometimes, I cave and watch a bit of porn, but I mostly stay on track on abstinence.
* I'm really talented apparently. I've won scholarships for my artwork.
* I'm in college to be a lawyer. I'm not in debt yet somehow, and I have a 4.0
* I meditate often, and I use Duolingo regularly.

I just don't want to be depressed anymore. I feel like I've been shut down for some reason. I want to get social media out of my life, have a more consistent sleeping schedule, and get my parents out of debt. The only reason why I don't have a job is that my parents won't let me while I'm in college. IDK man. I just cannot keep doing this anymore. I don't want to keep going like this anymore. I feel like I've hit rock bottom recently.",29Nov2019,1

How do I know people are actually enjoying the conversation? I can sometimes tell, but it can be difficult for me to tell with some people. And how do you know if someone is being a bit controlling of the conversation and what do you do about it. Also, how do you explain to people that it’s difficult to navigate conversations? I know I ramble on too much, sometimes its the energy, but a lot of it is being worried about if this would fit with that sentence. Or a lot of it is I just get stressed and can’t stop rambling.

242,"My mother is an alcoholic, and I’ve slowly come to terms with accepting it’s just out of my control over the many years of stressing over it. But tonight, I’m sleeping over at her house, and as soon as I go to bed she starts drinking. Then, when her roommate comes home, I can hear their conversation even with the door closed. She’s complaining about her day, and I start to realize that she’s just telling lie after lie to her roommate. Lies about our day, lies about me personally, and our family, and it’s honestly really pissing me off. Some of them are small and not a big deal, but other ones are just flat out wrong and hurtful. And you can tell by their tones that her roommate is in such an awkward position and that this must happen often. Every time her roommate tries to talk, my mom will interrupt her and steer the conversation back to herself. She’s also practically insulting her roommate to her face, and just overall being an asshole, saying things like “why aren’t you asking about how MY day went?” multiple times. Jfc!

I feel so sorry for her roommate. I can’t even imagine what lies she’s told her about me when I’m not here, and I can’t imagine what she must think of me. I’m worried people will fall for the things that she says. She’s also dating a guy that is the father of a couple people I went to high school with and I can’t imagine what she probably tells them when she’s at their house, and it’s kinda just making me feel sick. Like how am I supposed to ever show my face to these people again???

How do I get her to stop doing this? I wish I had thought to record her and play it back for her in the morning, but I also kinda feel like that would’ve been too confrontational anyway. 

She isn’t like this when she’s sober (that I know of), but I honestly don’t think I’ll ever be able to trust anything she says again.

268,"Hi, I hope everyone is having a good Thanksgiving. I'm a mid 20s that just got a big break last Feb and landed a job at a fortune 500 company in NYC. I have lived in Cali all of my life but moved because this is a big jump for my career.

Recently I went back home to visit my parents and found out my mom was diagnosed with cancer last June. She is on drug chemo and is doing well, the tumor shrunk &gt;50% but is showing sign of partial relapse from her test this tueaday.

From my research this mean the cancer is gaining resistance to her chemo (Tagrisso) in just 4-5 months of treatment. While she said is doing much better now compare to June, eating well and no pain, this still mean her outlook isn't good. According to what I can found on Google, she likely have a year left, on the median range, if that.

She is the most important person in my life and I have always envision that when I have a stable career, a home, a family, that she will always be there. My current job pay well and it's my first job in the industry so quitting before I get to 1 year would definitely hurt my career, but the time she have left will never be recovered.

I have thought on Jan this year that 2019 is going to be the one, the year when I finally get my life together, get a good job, moved out of my parents, become an adult, but it seem everything fell apart so fast before the decade end.

271,"Thanksgiving has come and gone, and after a very weird family meeting, I’m left feeling very eerie about the following thoughts: 

My uncle Ken was remarried 3 years ago. With his first wife, he had my two cousins (Tanner &amp; John) . Jessica has 1 daughter from a precious relationship (Mary). Since the new marriage, he has become a completely different person. My Nana (his mom) has noticed such a shift in his personality (from getting belligerently drunk and, ‘borrowing’ over $500 of my uncle H’s money on his wedding night, missing holidays / mother’s / birthdays, not allowing my Nana to see the two boys, causing very unnecessary tension between him &amp; the first wife - who was adored by our family, and so on). The boys have shared custody with the parents.

The new wife Jessica is very odd. She is highly sexual in nature speaking and behaving very inappropriately towards anyone and everyone, which very clearly makes the rest of my family very uncomfortable. She sits on Ken’s lap at the table, is constantly rubbing and touching him, saying suggestive things.

At dinner tonight, she was telling everyone how Tanner has been an awful teenager in their house (taking extra long showers, claiming that he told Mary to “come on in” on him in the shower, being too sexual himself). That was a huge ordeal, with her claiming him to be a sick pervert. She puts him down, and treats him like he’s disgusting.


She claimed that one night around Christmas last year John had gotten “egg nog drunk”, and had managed to mistake which room was his, ending up in Mary’s bed naked, and unable to wake up or leave. He doesn’t remember it, and was visibly uncomfortable and confused when she brought it up. He’s very soft spoken, and barely said a word.

My Nana has told me additional stories including one where they went to a pool party with all of that family. Jessica was wearing a very revealing swimsuit, trying to climb on Tanner’s back, and play with him in the water. 

She made a comment to my grandparents about a romantic getaway they had for their 25th anniversary, and was asking questions regarding “sex swings”, making them wildly uncomfortable. 

She let Tanner take a sip of her cocktail (Jameson &amp; soda water if it matters), to which he responded that it “tasted like medicine” and that all alcohol “even wine” tastes like medicine. Now he’s 16, so I get that it’s not absurd to let him try a sip at home in a holiday, but just very off putting for them to normalize it.

Ken, Jessica, and Tanner were “wrestling” in the living room, trying to tackle each other, and give each other “purple nurples” - okay not necessarily outrageous on its own, but with all of this context...

Ken &amp; Jessica live in Chicago and I have seen countless photos of them on Facebook partying and looking absolutely trashed. She made a joke stating  “big pharma will need to make a new pill to let me live through the rest of the teenage years with these kids”. 

I may be looking into this behavior too far, but often predators have been known to groom their victims. 

Inappropriate touching, putting them down, instilling guilt, placing blame. I’m extremely concerned about the possibility of them being drugged? I don’t believe she would or could fully rape either of them, but it doesn’t have to be that to be considered sexual assault. I think she may be preying on his sexual vulnerability for his age, and the lack of sexual boundaries with their relationship. 

Women predators go overlooked so easily, and I can’t help but think if this was a man, we would have already called the police. 

Everyone has thought this is completely eerie.

277,"Hi reddit

So this is my first post on this platform, using a throwaway account so I can't be traced. None of my friends or associates will help me with this matter, so this is kind of a last resort. 

For some background information: I am 18 years old, transgender male (no medical transition yet), senior going into college. I have a large extended family and a well sized but distant friend group. I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was in 7th grade (age 14/15)

So, here's my problem. It's my 18th birthday and also thanksgiving, so lots of family members were around tonight. 

Aside from my immediate family and closest friends I am not out as trans. But because it was my birthday and also a holiday, my family and I decided to drink. I am not in the mood to hear how illegal and irresponsible it is, I know that already and have enough shame about it to last me though new years. Regardless, I made the mistake and decided to drink. While under the influence, I told my sister the story of a boy who liked me and how I had attempted to shut him down by explaining that I could not be his girlfriend because I didn't identify as a girl. My distant cousins who were present at the time overheard me, and because the alcohol lowered my inhibitions and made me act recklessly, I ended up nonchalantly coming out to them as a trans male.

Initially, they responded in such a casual tone ( just a nod and ""okay"") that I thought this was fine and I would hear nothing more of it. Throughout the night I made several more mistakes and said things I probably shouldn't have, but that's pretty much the expectation when you're drunk. 

Tonight, something terrible occured that didn't really hit me until now. My adopted cousin (we'll call him W), upon leaving, thanked me for being open with him and expressed that he [has?? Had??] liked me and found me attractive. Whether that was sexually or romantically or even personally attractive, he did not explain before promptly leaving. At the time I was drunk and dismissive enough to ignore it, but as soon as he left it all hit me like a truck and I broke down. 

Here is where the problem emerges.

1.) I had never meant to come out to W or any of my extended family. I wasn't ready. I only did so because I was drunk and couldn't think clearly about the consequences. Now I will have to live with the fact that they know for the rest of my life. I am worried that they will spread my secret to the rest of my extended family and ruin my relationships with these people.

2.) While W is not my biological cousin and we are not blood related at all, he is an adopted member of my family and my family considers his family to be our cousins by association. The thought of him being sexually or romantically attracted to me is revolting because I was not only a minor until literally today  (he is about 26), but because I am practically his cousin. Should I confront him about this [what I feel is a] breach of familial trust or accept it and move on as if nothing happened?

3.) People being romantically interested in me has always terrified me for a number of reasons. Ever since I was young, I've never known of anyone who had a crush on me that made me feel genuinely flattered or interested in the person. Instead, I'm filled with fear, anxiety, and disgust with myself. I don't know why this is. I don't know why I fear relationships, especially because there are times when I crave romantic affection. My romantic orientation and capacity is truly a mystery and I honestly don't understand it, but I know that I've about had it with people confessing to me. I've had about 4 people in my life confess to having feelings for me, and each time I had to turn them down because I simply don't feel the same, nor do I feel I will ever grow to feel that way. I've had crushes on people before, but when people have crushes on me, I'm like ""ew, no thank you."" I find that I don't want people to like me. I don't want people to be attracted to me. I feel like an empty shell of a person, incapable of providing them with the warmth and love they expect of me. I feel as though I am no one. Don't look at me. Don't think of me. I'm nothing. Leave me alone. 

4.) I know that when people think they like me, they are assessing me based on the vision of me they have created in their mind, not the real me. I feel like no one knows the real me. They only know the sweet, smart ""girl"" who sends them memes and likes corny jokes. But I know that's not me. Few people know the twisted, broken, suppressed and confused man I am inside. No one knows what goes on in my brain, the person I am under all of this performance. The disgusting worm that lies underneath all this glamour and the desperate overcompensation of femininity. How can they love this illusion? They should be ashamed of themselves for falling for this facade. If they knew the real me, they would never think twice about these feelings. 

So basically, I guess what I'm getting at is that I wish I didn't exist so people wouldn't develop feelings for or about me. I don't want people to remember me, or think about me, to like or hate or love me. I don't want to be real. I wish I wasn't real. I wish I was never born. 

I don't want anyone to think about me ever again. I wish no one knew who I was.

Which brings up the questions: How do I, a person who can barely assess my own existence, communicate to people that I do not want to be romantically pursued? How do I express to the man I consider my cousin that his feelings for me are inappropriate (If they are in fact inappropriate, please let me know what you think about that as well)? And what do you think I can do to combat these dissociative emotions that make me distance myself from potential relationships? 

Thank you if you read through this whole thing. Any feedback is appreciated.",29Nov2019,1
278,"Here's the story: a couple Saturday nights ago, the 9th of November to be exact, my friends and I went out to a bar for drinks and a night out. It was a real good time. My friend was acting pretty rowdy but we thought it was because he drank too much, which we've seen before. Later on he said he couldn't remember anything from that night. We thought he overdid it like I mentioned before but he thought he got drugged because his brother got drugged at the same bar last year which was unknown to us. We thought he was being paranoid about it during the week and that he was probably overreacting. The next weekend of the 16th and 17th came and went as normal. We hung out Saturday and would've Sunday but he was bummed about his favorite football team losing which happens all the time. Anyway on the 18th, my friend took a drug test and it came back positive for rophynol, which explains why he couldn't remember anything from that night. After finding out, my friend's entire demeanor changed. He's usually the one making jokes, calling us silly names and pushing us to do things. But him finding out totally made him meek and nervous. Last Wednesday, me, him and another friend were playing Xbox and talking on discord and he was convinced someone was coming after him because around the same time, someone at work told him he was working too much overtime and now he thinks someone is trying to get him fired or something. He went into a full blown panic attack and it was really hard to calm him down, especially since I wasn't physically with him. After a while he finally went to bed. Last Friday and Sunday, he hung out with us but was very quiet and seemed in a trance the whole time. On Monday and Tuesday night, he didn't play Xbox with us like he usually does, saying he was dealing with anxiety. We told him we were thinking of him and to let us know if he needed anything. Now this is where I got really concerned. On Wednesday, my friends and I were supposed to go out for dinner for Friendsgiving. We all were to meet up for 7:00. After waiting for my friend, I called him asking if he'd be here soon. He said he was on his way. Nearly an hour later, he doesn't show up. So instead of going to the restaurant, we drive to his apartment (he lives alone) to make sure he's okay because he hasn't answered any phone calls or texts. In the car as we approached, we come around the corner to his apartment building and see a police car and an ambulance outside and my friend goes ""oh great, that's a REEEALLL good sign"" and my heart dropped into my stomach, my appetite gone. We moved up and we see my friend in the back of the ambulance talking to the paramedics. My friends and I in the car didn't really know what to do and eventually the ambulance pulls away. Not even a minute after it does, he texts me ""with the police, everything is good"" I ask him what happens and he doesn't respond. Later he texts my other friend saying he's going to hospital in a town nearby and he has a mental breakdown. We don't know how or why it happened which is scary and we haven't heard from him since except this morning. We wished him a happy thanksgiving, hoped he was alright and if he was out of the hospital or not. Again, no response. I had a wonderful thanksgiving but now it's nighttime and this is lingering on the back of my mind. My friend is in a very messed up state apparently and I have no idea how he's doing after going to the hospital because we haven't heard from him. I apologize if this is very long and kinda a downer but I'm very concerned and need someone to talk to about this or get advice from someone who might know how to help.",29Nov2019,1
279,"So I moved out from my parents a while back, they have never expected money or anything from me, in fact they are always making sure I'm managing with my bills (I am). 

Problem is, because they never accept anything from me, they have a very strong sense of them being the parents, me being the child, they support me, of that makes sense. It isn't in a bad way, they would just feel guilty taking from me since they see it as the parent should provide.

However, there's been some issues with my dad's work and he's going to lose his job, the pay he will get will be much less and I'm worried they'll end up in trouble. Of course some of this is me just worrying, its quite possible he will find a new job fairly quickly and things will sort themselves out. I just don't want them having any problems when I know I can help, I hope that makes sense. 

How can I offer them support when I know they will feel guilty accepting it? Any good tips on how I can pay for things for them without them realising I'm doing it? Or gentle ways I can offer money without it coming across badly? I don't want to come across as patronising or anything.

Well she has been with her bf for 3 years now and we've had no problems whatsoever until recently. She admitted to having a crush on me before she started dating her bf. This has been about a month since she told me that and now this week she wanted to hang out with me some and go shopping. So I said sure and we did. Well she dressed all cute like for me and she definitely tried to overstep her bounds some. She found ways to stick her ass out to me a few times and on one occasion she layed stomach down on a bed and told me to sit beside her on it for a min. Then she took me over to some sexy crop tops and bikinis saying that she used to wear them all the time and loved them. So after that shopping trip I've been kinda at odds with her and wondering if she is starting to get feelings for me again. I mean she is cute and all but I'd never do anything just for the fact that she has a bf and I wouldn't disrespect him like that.

I use it to avoid responsibly and so people will go ""well she's not all there so can't blame her."" I know these things won't usually work as an adult in the real world like it did in my family when i was a child.

But it's all i know. I feel comfortable as that person. I feel good when people think I'm not all there in the head and a weirdo who can't help certain things. I actually get social anxiety when i attempt to act like a fully functioning adult. It feels weird and uncomfortable. Just today some guy in Walmart got annoyed with me walking so close behind him and when he angrily told me to go around i just shrugged and said ""YEAST"" before i walked away.

294,"Hi Reddit,

I (22F) am a full time employee in an ad agency who is making a internal department shift from social media to copywriting.

November is my last month in social media and the company has hired a intern trainee (21F) to replace me. Her internship is for 2 more months post which she will be offered a job.

I have been training her for the past one month and have been extremely patient with her. She asks incessant questions and sometimes asks the same question multiple times. All my colleagues despise her for it and many of them have been rude to her too and i have always defended her. I have also patiently sat her down and taught her every part of the job but now i feel its time for me to stop. 

I am trying to ask her to figure things out on her own because otherwise she just uses me as a safety net and concedes in challenging situations easily. It's probably because she thinks ""If I can't do, OP definitely will do it for me."" 

Now I feel like it's borderline coddling. She even tells me when she needs to go to the washroom! 

This entire process of teaching her has been like handling two jobs at once and has been extremely taxing on me. 

Is it a good idea to stop and let her figure out things on her own? If it is then how do I do it? I feel like I'm in too deep and if I suddenly stop helping her she might not take it well, but if i don't she's just not taking up her responsiblities on her own.

297,"Throwaway account because this is hard for me to ask for advice on. I had an epiphany today as to why I'm so goddamn miserable. It's because of this program and my life path. But I'm not sure if this is the right choice. I'm terrified of failure.

I'm 2 weeks away from being done with the semester, and one more semester away from graduating in May. I have a 4.0 GPA. But, I'm miserable. I hate the program, the internship, and I don't want the job when I graduate. 

People in my life want to either see me succeed or completely fail. Failing would meet most of their expectations of me.

I've had a somewhat difficult life. Drug/ alcohol addicted mom, and an alcoholic, emotionally abusive father who passed when I was 14. I was left with my mom who overdosed 6 months after my dad passed. She lived, but lost custody of me. I moved in with my older sister(14 year age difference). I did ok after that. Years of therapy. I struggled with depression, anxiety, and obviously trauma. I did ok in high school, went to community college, then went on to get my bachelor's in psychology. Now I'm working on my masters in counseling. I wanted to use what I went through to help others. The closest people in my life are so proud of me. They constantly tell me how proud they are and how strong I am. These are the people I hate to let down. The people that don't like me hate to see me succeed.  

Anyways, I think I want to drop my program. I am miserable. I have been pushing through but I'm just hating my life and waiting to be happy. I'm honestly not sure what I want to do with my life but I don't want this anymore. Sometimes I think dying might be better than living the future I have paved for myself. 

I have been coping by drinking. I'm seeing the circle of alcohol addiction cycle around and I'm terrified. I'm worried it's going to continue to get worse if I stay on this life path. I've talked to my husband and he seemed overwhelmed with the idea of me dropping (40k in debt for this program) but he was supportive. 

What gives me pause is letting down the people that are proud of me, and proving those that doubted me right. I don't know how I would ever explain myself (yes, i know I don't neeeed to explain myself to anyone but I really do). I also can't help but feel like a moron for wanting to drop out of a program with good employment opportunities.

Right now my husband and I (newlyweds but have been together for 7 years) are living with my mom. We have been for a year. She was doing well and we wanted to get out of our shitty apartment and save for the wedding/house. We paid only about 5k for a small wedding and the rest has gone to the house fund. We only have about 5k saved because my internship for this program is unpaid. My husband works fulltime but one income with bills makes saving go so slow. My mom is severely depressed and just lays on the couch all day watching the news. I need to move out so bad. Being here kills my mental health. I want to drop my program and just get a job.  

I do plan on going to talk to a counselor about this. However. I'm thinking of going in on Monday to meet with the program director and explain that I'm dropping. It's a small program so it will crush her and the cohort. I need advice before I decide whether or not to do this on Monday.

TLDR: I want to drop even though I'm succeeding in the program but I'm miserable. Drinking is bad, and sometimes think I would rather die than live the life I have planned right now. But I'm in 40k debt and terrified of letting loved ones down. Thinking of going in to drop on Monday.",29Nov2019,1

Im 13 years old and fairly new to Reddit so if there's a better place for me to post this please lmk. Also on mobile so bad formatting.

For context, My dad is a fairly violent person and is heavily alcoholic (drinks like its water) and is about 7 foot and has a strong build.

Hes always been a dick to me and my sister as well as our animals. There have always been minor child abuse undertones to him that range from his anger issues but the worst things have always been to the animals. Hes an asshole to them constantly for barking, greeting him or family members after walking in, wanting to be pet, and sometimes just looking at him while hes eating which he considers 'begging'. 

I was never okay with how he treated the animals and how he would yell at them and if they didnt come back immediately when let out he would sometimes kick them. I would get incredibly mad but could never stick up for them being a fairly young child thats about 5'4"" in a household thats very for ""respecting elders"". So i would just have to watch.

Today, however, things were different. While my cat was in the kitchen at Thanksgiving dinner, he went to go jump up on the counter that my dad was standing next to. He gets on the counter alot and i doubt he knew about all the food up there as most of it was pies and all the meat and actual food hed want was on the table across the room. So hes midway through the air about to get on the counter when my dad grabs him by the scruff, lifts him above his head, and then slams him into the ground. Full force. Im the only one in the room and Im watching him as he does this, petrified. My cat screams in pain and i swear i saw it all in slow motion. He doesnt seem to be seriously injured though which is good.

From what i remember seeing in that millisecond long event, he had landed on his hip. Luckily, my cat trusted me enough to hold him and take him to my room. I checked him out and he didnt appear to break or fracture anything. He had a limp for a while but appears to be better. And his fur is too thick to check for bruising. I told my mom that if my dad pulls that again im calling the police but I have no idea how i would or what would happen. Im scared of my other family hating me for it. Im scared of my pets getting taken away. How would I go about contacting authorities if this does happen again? What all would happen if I do contact them?",29Nov2019,1

315,"My brother is 14 years old and is in his freshman year of high school. He has always been somewhat awkward and very introverted. He's really into gaming and stuff like that, but in the past year or so I'd say he's come out of his shell a bit and found a good friend group that has similar interests to him. I've always worried about my brother because, well... he has zero social skills. But recently over the past month or so, it's been really bad. My parents bought him a gaming PC and it's ALL HE DOES. he locks himself in his room all day and plays his games. He doesn't even hangout with his friends in person, they just talk on the phone and play games. I don't have an issue with the gaming, it's how much he does it and how it's affecting his life. Like tonight was Thanksgiving, and he barely said 2 words to anyone and was just on his phone the whole time watching YouTube videos begging to go home. Last week we went to my cousin's house and he wouldn't even talk to him either and my cousin is only a year older than him.. they used to be really close and he honestly never acts like this. I'm getting really concerned about him being closed off and never having real social skills or human interaction. He is actually such a sweet kid and has the best sense of humor, I wish I could just get him out of his shell more and not be so difficult. I get that he's a teenager and maybe this is just a phase but I feel like he's been so closed off his whole life. I talk to my parents about it and all they say is, ""We try, we just can't get him out of his room to do stuff"" and I just feel like they enable him. They're the ones who bought him the gaming PC and don't limit his screen time. He also stays up all night on his phone watching videos too. I just feel like his whole life revolves around gaming... but not in a good way. He needs friends too, he needs to go out more and do regular teenage boy things. He's just so shy and introverted, and I know that won't change but I just need to know how to get him out more. I don't know what to do and neither do my parents. Has anyone else had similar experience with someone like this?

316,"The relationship wasn't perfect, it had it's ups and downs like everything else. Up until a couple of months ago I was happy. Then she started distancing herself from me, making rude remarks about me, even lying on me once, and telling her family that I never wanted to do anything even though I was down to do anything all of the time.

I don't know if it was resentment because I wasn't working at the moment and she was, for context we just got out of high school and I was just enjoying myself a little bit before getting on the grind with work, school, etc. Was it wrong of me to not be working when she was?

But eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and asked if we could work on it, she told me ""idk"" because she didn't know what was wrong with her or something like that. Added context, her family isn't that big on her dating and such and made it well known so idk if that had something to do with it. She said that earlier that day her family had a discussion about her dating and what not, so I feel like there was more to it.  But I broke it off. She seems sad. But next morning we speak again and she's kinda being insulting but she said she still cares about me and then expressed what she didn't like about the relationship (none of this I was aware of even though I continuously asked). And we went back and forth and that was the last time we had a full conversation. I wished her happy birthday a while ago to no response.

And now, whenever I hear her name or think of old times I physically feel myself feel a mixture of anger, hurt, etc. It triggers an emotional response. And I can't look at her on social media without being tempted to cry. I still have dreams about her constantly. I just want all of this shit to stop so I can let go and move on. 

Any advice?",29Nov2019,1
317,"I’ve had a crush on a very close friend of mine from high school for awhile. We go to colleges on different coasts, so I only see him during university breaks. That being said, we are close friends so we talk/text almost every day. I know one of the most common ways to get over a crush is to try and forget about them, but since we’re friends I’m not sure how that is possible. Also, I am not going to tell him that I like him, not only because I don’t think he likes me in that way, but also he has some attributes I can look over in a friend but I could not stand in a relationship.

318,"NOTE: I think I used parentheses way too much lol

A little bit of backstory: I’m a student in Australia, apart of the ‘popular’ group at my school. I used to hangout with people that weren’t popular (two people), one of them was nice but a bit antisocial, I had only started talking to her at the end of last year, let’s call her T. The other I had been friends with ever since I was 3, she was an absolute jerk to me and (didn’t realise it at the time), she’ll be called L. At the start of this year in Term 1, I started realising who my friends were and who weren’t my friends. L was a great example of someone who wasn’t my friend, always putting me down, never encouraging me, but always relied on me to help her with everything. I started to to T more and more and L less and less. Everything has gone pretty well ever since I stopped talking to L, everyday T and I texted each other but never really talked at school, and I found my friend group. 

You may be wondering what the problem is. Well, after I stopped hanging out with L she started looking for new friends (T still hung out with her ). She found a new friend group (along with T) who were fairly popular. These people are funny and nice, so I was happy for T and L. I thought everything would turn out fine for all of us, but recently I’ve been feeling really bad about myself. This caused me to selfishly neglect my relationship with T. I hadn’t spoken to her for a few weeks, up until today. She told me all about how she won a competition and got 3rd place (I was so happy for her!) I was supposed to enter that competition and be the representative for my class since I scored the highest on my test. This caused me to regret not entering the competition and feel a little bit jealous, but I didn’t mention anything. Then T told me about how her arm hurt because she was talking to G (one of her friends), texting in a group chat with her new friend group, and me. 

That was the point where I felt a sinking feeling in my heart, then some fear kicked in. I felt really shitty, I thought about why I felt like that for a while. Then I realised I felt that way because throughout I friendship I never truly appreciated T. She has been one of my best friends since the start of this year, and now I’m afraid that since she has new friends she won’t talk to me anymore. And since the year is nearly over and we start a new grade next year with new people. I believe that she’s finally gonna branch out and find new friends, and I have a fear about not being one of those friends. 
How do I show that I appreciate her?",29Nov2019,1
319,"I got kicked out of the second semester of grade 12. I had to homeschool because I was banned out of the district and my private school which I had been kicked out of. I graduated thankfully and went to University the following semester. Went for one day and had been kicked out because my English 12 grade wasn’t a B (it was a C-) so I have to upgrade that. And for that I have to go to an upgrading school which is close to me and no problem to get to. The struggle is that I dealt with a lot of stuff from 2016-2019 which led me into addiction with Xanax (which is why I was kicked out) and a whole bunch of other drugs as well. Since then I hate staying sober, it reminds me of my past issues in my life. Now, I am clean on basically all drugs. The real thing I struggle with is marijuana use. I smoke way too much and tried to quit it many many times. I failed every single time, my self control would give in.

But the worst part about that is when I ask for money it's a big deal, but then they expect me to give out huge amounts of money and scoff at me when I say I'm trying to save money.

321,"I am not in depression. 

I just feel like, everything is so hard, it's so hard to always do things you don't want to do. 

I'm not doing anything right now, I don't work, I am not at school. But I registered to go to school (higher studies) because I thought I should. I feel good, I feel fine, when I do things, I don't feel good, I feel horrible. My brain just tells me to avoid it. It doesn't want to go to school, it doesn't want to go to work, it doesn't want to maintain relashionships, walk outside, do things, buy things. It's all exhausting and I've been there, it's much more depressing than the place I am right now. At home I can occupy myself if I want. I live with my dad and brother, and I have great relashionship with them. I know I shouldn't be thinking about this, but my dad will die one day, and I would have to go live with my mom. My mom, is toxic. She kicked me out ''for my own good'' because ''she couldn't stand me''. Anyway, living with her I would commit suicide, and I wouldn't be able to do anything to get out of her hell.

I always been like this. I wouldn't want to do anything during summer vacation, I never felt the need to see my friend but I did because ''I thought I should''. 

I should say I have generalized anxiety. I am very emotional, I'm what we call ''hypersensitive''. When I go outside, everything is overwhelming. The people, the cars, you can't have a single calm moment. When I was at school, I used to ask my teachers to go to the bathroom or drink water often, I didn't know why I was doing it, but now I know it's because the school was peacefull when no one was around. It felt empty, and it felt good, like I was the only one.

I decided to quit school because I had suicidal thoughts, and I thought ending my life because of studying is really stupid. It felt like I was burned out. When I'm doing things, I'm burned out, when I'm not doing anything like right now, it feels good. I makes me feel like my limit is so low, I wouldn't be able to do anything in this world. 

I registered for school, I'm planning on having motivating thoughts so I can 'survive'. I want to try to enjoy things more. Now that my mom is out of my life, I want to see how things will be going. And I also want to work on my anxiety. So this is my motivation, I don't know if it's enough for an hypersensitive like me. I can't stand being bored.

My brain is telling me ''you should do this and that'' but my heart is telling me ''nothing matters, you don't have to do these things it's all futile. You're a slave to this hyperproductive world. Everyone are sheeps, they're all doing things because they're told they matter''

330,"TL;DR at the bottom, it might be easier to read the whole passage though.

Since I was a child, I was somewhat of an academic in school; I performed outstandingly in a private school, and everything was comfortable in my life. Parents owned/ran a business, then everything happened. Don’t exactly know the specifics, but early into elementary, all of the luxuries in our family life were removed. Expensive family car gone, all of us were out of private school, and suddenly I grew a worry for the financial integrity of our life. Not to mention the luxuries, those were merely a means of displaying the family business’ success. Upon the beginning of the end of the family business, circumstances changed. We ended up living on the business property, driving to a public school everyday, everything pretty much went to unrecognizable bits and pieces. I realize that I tend to understate things, so I’ll admit that we really struggled for a solid 2 1/2 years with events removed. During this time period, the only thing relevant to my inquiry is that one of my parents’ mental health severely deteriorated. Once we (somewhat) landed on our feet, there was a massive, life changing scare that happened, emotionally scarring my siblings, but not necessarily me. To express the magnitude of this event, my family had a genuine means of worrying for their present lives at the moment. The aforementioned parent who had deteriorated mental health was deep in a mental rabbit-hole, and the next day extended family came to pick us up, only bodies and clothing within our dressers and whatnot coming along. We had to basically start from scratch, and lived with the extended family for a few years while we rebuilt a shadow of financial stability when compared to the one before everything happened. Now I’m a college student, doing quite well in my courses, and despite some confidence issues, don’t really have anything to complain about.

My adoptive parents are atheists and will say no if I try to get their consent, even for a small cross.

My dad was moved to another room recently to treat an infection. He used to have his own room because he hates having a roommate. My sister bought him some posters that she hung on his wall and he had a lot of important family pictures on his bulletin board. There was one specific picture of the family dog that was the only one of it's kind which has great sentimental value as Rehab is no longer with us.

To paint a clearer picture of just how much we've lost, his ex girlfriend stole everything including all the family pictures so most of what we have left over isn't replaceable. Besides the picture of Rehab, the other pictures came from my mom and grandparents who thankfully still have some. 

We found one poster under his TV stand that was wrinkled, ripped and folded and couldn't find the other one.

So all of his family pictures are lost, one of his posters are in shitty condition and the other is lost.

Is there anything we can do? Any idea what may have happened to them? We visited dad on Thanksgiving so his nurse and the people in charge weren't there. I might also post this to LegalAdvice.

Our house is literally falling apart as we live in it and she wants to sell it and move somewhere cheaper to live but it's going to cost a fortune to get the house fixed. We have shitty insurance so insurance doesn't cover anything.

To put a little perspective to how bad the house is: we aren't even legally allowed to sell the house unless we fix the shit that's wrong with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fortunate enough to have a job that for the most part, I really like - the work is interesting, there's room for advancement, I really like my team (ha!), and crucially, I get paid well above market rate.

The fly in the ointment is that I work closely with a guy I really, reeeeaaally like - I'm almost never attracted to anyone, but he feels like the most interesting person I've ever met. Regrettably, I'm fairly certain that he's super, super gay and I very much do not have a penis. This has been going on for 2ish years.

I'm going through a very bad bout of depression at the moment, and being around him for 40 hours a week is making alternately happy (bc he's great fun!) but then I remember that it'll never happen and I feel like the worst kind of repulsive creep and p much want to die, and then I do a bit of discreet desk-crying.

My plan has been to stay at my company for at least two more years (one to do some further training that they'll pay for, and one year to essentially pay them back for that) - after that, I'll be qualified to apply for senior roles at other companies in my field. Right now, moving to a different company to do an equivalent role would likely mean a pay cut of around $10K and fewer opportunities for development, which I could live with if I had to, but ehhh, I like my current standard of living.

It's worth noting that I'm in therapy and am looking to switch up my anti-depressants, which might make this a bit less distressing - but regardless, I ultimately think it's not good for me to be around this man in the long-term. But setting back my career progression because of a dude also seems very short sighted.

I felt I was the only one really putting work into our relationship and that she was very passive. Now, before you grab your pitchforks and say ""DiD yoU CoNSiDer ShE WAs WoRkiNg HaRd TOo,"" I planned almost all of our dates, went out of my way to be present in her life, and made plenty of time for her. She too often seemed to find something to prioritize above me. But I digress. After a rough couple of months, I broke up with her.


Here's where things get extra messy. Call me a piece of shit or whatever you like, I realize I made plenty of mistakes all throughout, but this is where I was definitely extra shitty. I broke up with her partly because I hated feeling neglected in our relationship. The other part (I'm assuming just an excuse of mine tho) was that she was having a hard time in her own life and I didn't want to put anymore pressure on her with our relationship with me. She knew I wasn't feeling satisfied with it, so I didn't want to make her deal with the pressure of being in a relationship like that. We broke up on good terms and decided we'd be friends. If you haven't guessed by now, I am young, naïve, and in need of advice. I figured that, being friends, I'd still be able to talk with her. BOI WAS I WRONG. She kinda ghosted me and I was feeling extra worthless at this point. Maybe a week later I was feeling so shitty I decided I needed (*needed*) to talk to her and just figure something out. Not necessarily to make up (as much as I desperately wanted) but to close things up better at least. When we broke up, she had told me if I needed anything I could talk to her. I went over to her house to see if I could talk to her (I've realized this was a mistake.) She told me she couldn't because she wanted to be with her family. I honestly just broke at this point. Once again, I am just brushed off again. I left quickly, went for a drive, and had an emotional breakdown. I texted her in this state (mistake) and went suicidal on her. I realize this was absolutely toxic of me, but I can't take it back now. Anyway, LSS, things did not go in my favor. 

A month passed from then and I'm still kind of talking to her. I'm trying to undo as much of the damage I've done, as futile as it seems. LSS I got to have a much much more civilized conversation with her about my feelings and thoughts. We left on better terms, once again as ""friends."" I must be a complete dumbass at this point. I don't feel like friends and it just makes me feel shitty. 

This was a lot of Long Story Short, if you want I can divulge more info if you guys care enough. The core of my question is as follows: I message my ex often to check up on her and see if shes doing ok. We decided we'd be friends and this is my attempt at being friends. I've told her several times that if she wants me to stop texting her or if she feels like I'm bothering her, she can tell me to stop and I'll stop. She has yet to tell me to stop. I feel like it would be good if I gave her space, but I also don't want to just kinda ghost her. Maybe I'm not picking up hints that she's dropping, but isn't that just a childish game to play? I will continue to offer her support until she decides to tell me she'd rather not have it. But is that ok? Am I just prolonging a painful relationship? 

Btw I just want to say that I've never degraded her in any of my conversations I've had with her. Even in my suicidal breakdown. I've always tried to treat her with (subjective) respect and never told her anything with the intent of devaluing her. She was the most precious thing to me. I'm trying to determine if she still is. It might be hard to comprehend, but I tried my best to treat her as the love of my life, and as the most precious thing to me. I may not have alway done it well, but I swear to God Almighty I never did degrade her or devalue her in word and in deed (although I can't guarantee I haven't done it unintentionally.) Not sure if thats applicable.",29Nov2019,1
352,"My friend said that she thinks ik a pushover and it kinda upset me. Like first off. Is that a bad thing? Like I'm only a pushover to her and people that are important to me. Cause I want to make them happy. So if there are ways for me to do that, then I'm more then willing to cause why wouldn't I? And if a random person asked me to do something for them. I'd do it if it was reasonable. Cause I like making people happy. Does that make me a pushover? Like if it was something I dont agree with or that was against my morals, I'd say no. Like if someone asked me to buy them cigarettes or alcohol I wouldn't. Even if the were of age, cause I just dont agree with smoking or drinking.",29Nov2019,1

I've been kicked out three times until the police stepped in and courts ruled it unlawful and he also had no discernable reason. By our state laws he wasn't allowed to do that in the first place due to the high amount of minorities who did that to their children and spouses in the 80s and 70s. 

As a result he dismantled my bed and forced me to sleep on the couch that he is now forcing me off of because he's concerned about how the plastic will look to the guest..before that he made it as uncomfortable such as interrupting my sleep after knowing I've come home from work late, blasting music in front of me giving me headaches and more.

I've constantly expressed I don't currently have the means to move out, he doesn't wanna help me and its impossible to listen to me so I just do it all on my own in secret..I've created my plans this summer and predicted the timeline but I need some help maybe anyone can suggest easier ways to possibly find an apartment?

355,"I need some sort of small advice. Something to make that light bulb go off. I love studying a wide range of things sort of like a polymath. I constantly need to learn things. Unfortunately I wasn’t aware that humanities degrees weren’t California “rent paying” types. I love to work with animals and can get a vet assistance cert but I’m scared of blood. I can be a peer mentor but I don’t have the time or resources right now (also I can’t drive. They actually don’t care too much about experience just that you can drive) I can get cert to work with kids on the spectrum but I’m afraid I’ll do the work and never get hired. I currently work with animals by boarding them. I don’t like people at all. Major factor. Being around people after long periods makes me boil so I’m majorly stuck. Does anyone here have a humanities degree? What do you do and how did you know that’s what you wanted? Would it just be wise to move to a cheaper state before getting my BA?

357," This may be trivial compared to other posts I've seen here, and if there's a better place for this question lmk but... If I use a space heater as a person with at least three working brain cells will I have anything to worry about? 

context: I recently found out that anxiety is common in our family and now it's making me question some things my mom is super freaked out about... like space heaters. 
When I told her I got a small space heater she went white as a sheet and went on this long spiel about how I need to be careful and keep an eye on it and DO NOT KNOCK IT OVER AND KEEP THE AREA SUPER CLEAN and some more stuff that really boils down to ""have common sense"" but the way she freaked out had ME freaked out so I didn't use it after that. Unfortunately it's cold again and I can only do so much wrapped up in blankets. I'm also always cold and my husband is always hot so it's not exactly fair for me to make him suffer when I'm really only in one or two spaces in the apartment. One of these has a plastic collapsible desk that I put the space heater on, but then I heard my mother's worried voice in my head and started to worry it would melt the plastic. The other place is a wooden sewing desk that has a large sheet of glass on top but I was too terrified to even really try it there because the desk is from my grandmother and it's hands down the nicest thing I own. (mostly by virtue of being from my grandma. I don't do a lot of sewing in the winter so it's mostly a drawing or writing desk for the season and well cleaned up.) The space heater has an automatic shut off if it gets knocked over, I couldn't even move it with out it shutting off, and is like something you would see at someone's cubical. As long as I used an inch of common sense and unplug it when not in use would I be okay? Or do i just give up on it?

tldr, my mom freaked out when she found out I had a space heater and then I got anxious and didn't use it but it's cold again so now I'm wondering if I'm over thinking things and that if I'll be fine as long as I use common sense with the thing.",29Nov2019,1
358,For the last 5 years I keep reflecting on my days in high school and how I fucked up all of my relationships with the people I knew. Some of those relationships were toxic like the ones with my close friends. A lot of the problems though I created but some of them were not true friends. I really don’t know what I did back in those days that made me so I un likable that people don’t even want to see me in public. It’s strange to me. Maybe I was dealing with hormones or problems at home that made me act out I really don’t know. The issues really shown through at the end of 10th grade on to graduation. I currently have no friends and no girlfriend. I stay to myself and am kind of an ass because I don’t want to get close to people. I keep thinking of the mistakes I made and the people that were hurt by me and I can’t move forward for some reason. I don’t think I did things that were that bad but when I never hear from old friends and no one ever wants to do anything it makes me question myself. I have a hard time connecting with people and maybe that’s why I did or do strange things I don’t know? I’ve been trying to work on myself and that’s why I’m posting this. I just need to know what to do from here. Thanks for any help.,29Nov2019,1
359,"I'm an 18 year old in college, but was home for break this Thanksgiving. While home, I decided to go see a friend, who I've known since June. She's got a great personality and was really cute, but we were just friends, so I was just going over to her house to chill. 30 minutes into Disney+ and chill (Yea, it actually works), we start getting into it (Yes, I lost NNN, but it was worth it, sorta).

So 2 hours later after we finish, I was excited for like 5 minutes and then came to the realization that I wasn't a virgin anymore. I just felt this huge crash in my emotions. Like all these thoughts were going through my head. Like ""What would my mom think of this?"" and ""I thought I was going to save myself until marriage, what happened to that?""(I wasn't serious about that, I just didn't wanna just go and give it out to someone random) Because I was one of those people that felt that my virginity was sacred.

But now that I lost it, I don't feel as pure as I used to. I just feel so lost and guilty, because I lost the last sense of innocence I had. Can anyone describe this feeling for me?",29Nov2019,1
361,"So I'm 15, and have been experiencing this for maybe a few years, I feel as if this year it's become a lot worse though.

I have this issue where I get these urges to tense my muscles, furrow my eyebrows, and scrunch up my nose. I constantly tense up my calves, shoulders, thighs and neck to the point that I'm aching frequently. Alongside that I feel like i 'need' to furrow my eyebrows and scrunch my nose all the time.

 I can control these urges but it's extremely difficult as it leaves this weird feeling lingering with me, similar to when you're going to sneeze but don't. 

I think what's really been getting on my nerves though is that I also feel an almost uncontrollable urge to put pressure against a body part (this changes). I find myself digging my fingers and nails into my skin to satisfy myself, when I'm on the bus I push my knees up against the seat in front of me, and I am always trying to 'crack' my knuckles even though I know they're not going to crack. If I don't do these, once again I'm left really uncomfortable.

I have ADHD, just in case that may have something to do with it. Thank you in advance.",29Nov2019,1
362,How can a self-loathing lead a better life? 🙁,29Nov2019,1
364,"The other day, I (27M) was visiting my parents because they were babysitting my nephew (almost 2M). I had the day off work and wanted to pay a visit to say hello and what not.

At some point while I'm there, my mom says she needs to go pick up my grandmother from somewhere and take her back to her house (my grandmother's house), and that she'll be back soon. I hang out with my dad and my nephew for a little while, and then I say that I'm going to go play music in the garage.

After a little while in the garage, I get bored and decide it's time to go back to my place. I go into the house to say goodbye to my dad and my nephew.

When I open the door to my parents' room, my dad is facing away from me with my nephew in front of him on the changing table. My nephew is standing up with his shirt on, but I can see he's naked from the waist down as I walk into the room. I think at that point, my dad was already pulling his pants and diaper up, and he looks over his shoulder and sees me and greets me like ""Hey"" or something. And I just say, ""Hey what's up?""

If my dad wasn't pulling up my nephew's pants before, he's at least done it now, and he says, ""Not much. We just had a pee incident."" or something like that. And he picks up my nephew and tosses him on the bed playfully, saying he's taking out the trash, as he does it, which is an old game he'd play with my brothers and me that we loved -- tossing us onto the bed over and over.

And my nephew is loving it too, and coming back again and again to be tossed, and I pick up my nephew and do the same thing. I also pick him up and spin him around really fast, and he's just having a blast and laughing and all that. I'm talking to my dad while we're playing with my nephew.

That's really the whole story, but I felt awkward as I was talking to my dad. The quoted conversation I've written isn't verbatim, but for what it's worth, he didn't appear shocked to see me or anything. I don't remember exactly what he said if it was ""pee incident"" or something else, but he said something about pee. I'm not sure if it seemed like unneeded explanation, or if it was completely normal, and I'm not sure if the playing on the bed immediately after was normal.

Other things didn't seem to add up to me:
1) I didn't see a dirty diaper or evidence of a change.
2) Why was my nephew standing on the changing station and then having his pants pulled up?

Regarding 1): I guess there could have been a diaper thrown away somewhere (there is an attached bathroom to the bedroom)... since I didn't go looking. I just tried to look around while I was talking to my dad and playing with my nephew.

Regarding 2): Could it have simply been that he was checked for pee and he was all clean? What was the pee incident or whatever then?
Also Related to 2): I know my brother wanted to potty train my nephew pretty early on. It's possible he is using pull-up diapers at this point. I can find this out.

What should I do? Am I overthinking things?
I don't want to bring it up to my family or anyone I know because the implication is so awful and there is so little to back anything up. It would be really hurtful to suggest my dad is behaving inappropriately with my nephew, if it weren't true. However, if it were true, I'd never want him to be around my kids (when/if I have them) and he should definitely not be around my nephews anymore (at the bare minimum).

I really don't think there's enough to warrant calling CPS or something. Another thought I've had is secretly filming their time together, but 1 that only opens up the possibility of more abuse, and 2 it could never happen again on camera, potentially and that doesn't prove anything really.

idk.

Do I talk to my dad about it, or is that the worst option of all?

For all the suspicions I've laid out above, here are some anecdotal commentaries supporting innocence:
- the tv in my parent's bedroom was up pretty loud and my dad knew I was home and would say goodbye, and that my mom would be home soon. to try to do something inappropriate would be a risky and stupid move. you'd at least want to be able to hear if someone was going to come into your room, right?
- I know my dad loves my nephew sooo much. as his first grandchild, he's said how he was amazed that being a grandparent, you love your grandchild like they are your own. and he just loves telling stories about my nephew and what he is like, etc.

365,"Just a little backstory. I’ve had this friend for a long time now, like 6 years. In the last year I matured a lot and he changed a lot in someone that can only see his interest and him being the only one that has the right answer to everything. When I tell him something he always starts the sentence with “ I already knew “ or “ I know”. He has to be right in every conversation. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. He’s been asking me for 2 months like 2 times a week to meet and I always turn him down because I am completely sick of it. The kind of person that won’t give you peace and will push it further and further in every discussion. I know his family, I know his friends and everyone. But I just can’t put up with it no more. I don’t want to tell him anything about it because he will probably start victimizing and tell his family and friends and turn them against me. Im sure about this one because I know them very well.

My GF of 4 months today messaged me that she is intending to kill herself tonight. She asked me on ways to effectively kill herself, ideas she had on how she was going to kill herself, and asked if I would join her in suicide. She has mentioned that she has a minor bipolar disorder and is depressed. I've called the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. However, I don't know her address, phone number. I only have her Instagram. I do have her father's phone number, but he is presumably her abuser. I already called her father's phone number, but he did not seem to care.

She brought up how she was brought up in an abusive household and is still being abused (as well as her mom). She specifically wouldn't give me her address - so I wouldn't be able to call CPS. I suggested her call CPS herself but she elected not to because of two reasons: Lack of evidence, and she wants her family to remain together.

This is in California, and I know legal advice might not be the best place to ask for advice, but I'm desperate for any kind of help. I do have screenshots of the parts of the conversation where she mentions abuse and suicide.

374,"TL;DR. I’m premed taking a gap year. I now realize I am too depressed to actually apply this year and will take 2 gap years. While I was self-deluded that I would apply this year, I convinced my parents that I was applying, who told everyone I do and do not know that I am applying. How do I get myself out of the hole I dug for myself?

I am a pre-medical student who graduated college last spring and am in the midst of what was intended to be my first and only gap year to apply for medical school. After graduating, when I should have been preparing my application for this year, however, I was abroad for language study. I told myself that I would submit my application while abroad, but was unable to do so due to a combination of writer’s block, burnout, and moderate depression. 

For those who are not familiar, medical school applications open in June and admissions are typically rolling. I have tried to convince myself that I can still apply late, but the same issues have prevented me from submitting. Depression has been a growing barrier for me, which is worsening as I am now living with my parents, unemployed, and essentially home-bound with no friends, a big change from my university life. I somehow deluded myself that I could still apply this year until now, but I have realized that it is not feasible in my current state. 

The issue with breaking the news that I’m taking another gap year is that my parents have happily told every family member/friend that I am applying this cycle. That is because I lied to them that I am while I was self-deluded that I could eventually get it done. One of my parents has a bit of a narcissistic streak and brags to friends, so the information is widely known throughout our entire community. I went along with the lie while deflecting questions about specific schools before since I really believed that future me would apply, but I can’t do that anymore without feeling guilty. 

I am telling my parents that I’m taking another gap year soon. However, I don’t know how to handle the community fallout.If people know that I lied about applying this year, I will be the center of gossip for a while as my parent’s faulty brag token. My braggy parent has no social tact and would probably leak the information right away while complaining to a friend that I’m wasting time away. I don’t want to continue lying to the community, but I don’t know if being 100% truthful would be worth the social cost. Since I’m living at home &amp; my friends have moved away, my superficial community interactions are all I have socially, and if I lose even that, I really think I’ll go crazy.

379,"So I have been in my current company for about 10 months now. And my team seem to be very tight knitted. Like one colleague (Ree) is best friends with my manager's (Yuu) daughter, and another apprentice (Vee) is a cousin or something to Ree. Then the other two let's say Nuu and Fuu have been in the company for like 6 plus years.

Now when I first joined, they would joke around with each other and I would try to joke too which at times are okay. But Yuu who is my manager when she talks to anyone in the office she's very friendly and has a smile on her face and let's say I have to ask something or just talk in general she puts on the most straightest face she can in a matter or seconds.

At first because I was new I thought maybe I am new so that's why maybe. But she has always done that which is getting under my skin. I have done anything to upset her, at least I don't feel as though I have.

And then there is the event for asking for holidays. Vee who has only been on the job for 5 months gets approved for the max alloted holidays he had. 25 days. And Ree has a whole month off in a weeks time.

I on the other hand needed 18 days for a wedding and because I'd be travelling halfway across the earth. I get told we can only take 2 week max at a time. 10 working days.

As I was new at that time, 7 months in. I figured maybe I don't press it too much. So I didn't but I feel as though these people are a real tight group. Maybe I'm just a boring person or something but I'm not comfortable with this place anymore. I am kinda just going in and out as it pays the bills.

Any advice?

I mean should I be looking for another job, and also if so how can I do that whilst still working full time.

And lastly supposed I find myself in an interview, if someone asks about my current employer, since I don't enjoy my time here, how could I tell them or what can I say?",29Nov2019,1
380,"so compared to some of the post's i've seen here, this can be debated whether it's ""bad"" or not but anyways

basically i'm 15 turning 16 in a few months and then a few months after that, my mum is getting cut off her carer's payment (we live in australia). I have ASD, ADHD, Severe anxiety, depression, a few minor physical issues but i'm not sure if i'm able to get the Support Pension we need to keep our lives and future's stable. She's basically a single mother (father doesn't pay child support and step-father moved out a year ago so he doesn't help) with 2 kids. Now i am relatively smart and in the last year i have taken big strives in education to try and go as high as i can on the ladder but i don't think it's enough. we pay around 600 a fortnight for rent and then probably $2000 or more a month on food, power and just the other things we need, there is also school fees which are quite expensive even when education is an essential part of life and other things. if our mother loses the payment (around $40,000 a year) we won't be able to pay rent or anything and we don't know what to do. Our nan (mum's side) won the lotto a few years back and has millions, but ever since my mother was little she's basically hated her and so our nan refuses to support us in any way and constantly criticizes my mother's life.  i want to study, go to uni but i'm not sure if i can, i just want to get through high school first but even that is slowly becoming an impossibility. Advice would be appreciated. i'm not sure if i can work, at least not enough to make the money and study, and even if i dropped school i'm not sure i could make anywhere near enough, and my mother hasn't worked in around 20-30 years and just, it's getting too much but i want to help my mother, what  really need is advice on what to do if i don't get the support pension we need.",29Nov2019,1

I don’t exactly want to ask the male roommate if he’s got porn audio playing, but it happens even when he’s out of the house, so I don’t think it’s likely to actually be him.

**PHYSICAL SCIENCES** (Chemistry &amp; Physics):

•Matter and materials

•Chemical systems

•Chemical change 

•Mechanics

•Wave, sound and light

•Electricity and magnetism

**MATHEMATICS** (Pure?):

•Functions

•Number patterns, sequences and series

•Finance, growth and decay

•Algebra

•Differential calculus

•Probability

•Euclidean geometry and measurement

•Analytic geometry

•Trigonometry 

•Statistics

410,"To make the long story of my college/career life short, I chose the 'dream' major in college in hopes of pursuing it equipped with the skills from the major. Well, I'm getting shacked up with the love of my life, I've got bills to pay, and my retail work schedule is so sporadic I can't find time between my days and life events to pursue the dream. This has lead me to 'table' my pursuit until I can find a job/career with a more stable schedule that can support this frivolous dream of mine.

With the experience I have now, I can't seem to break into that stable 9-5 M-F job I'd love to have, or even the 12 hour days working a factory job for money to alleviate some burdens in my life. The only field that will have me is retail... And I'm ready to kill myself every day I go to work because of that.

So, I've considered going back to school to pursue the avenue that most do with my degree, teaching, despite my desire to avoid that career path. I've also had brewing in my mind about just writing my degree off as a financial loss and pursuing a trade degree of some sort as I do enjoy working with my hands and the jobs in technical fields are plentiful and well-paying. It's less school than my Masters/returning pursuits would be, but just throwing what I established already hurts my heart and it feels like I'm admitting defeat on my dream.

All that to say, what would you guys do in my shoes? Would you suck it up and double down on what you've already done? Or would you change directions entirely?

414,"Here’s how it started. 

We met several months ago on a messaging app that was super anonymous. Username, name and pic could be whatever you want — phone number not required. She met acquaintances in the past who have ended up stalking her. So, she’s super cryptic about any personal details. 

That, I’m okay with. Most of the folks I casually meet online, I try to stay anonymous. If I develop a closer friendship with them and enough time passes, then yeah — if they seem trustworthy, I’ll trust them. Even on Reddit, hell... I’m using a throwaway right now. But on my main, I try to make myself indistinguishable. I was cool with it until... well. 

We fell in love. We were going to be together but I led her on. When she pushed me for a reason, I deeply regret not asking her, “How can I be with someone who won’t even tell me their last name?” But eventually, we grew apart and when we reconciled, she came to the same verdict that I did — that a relationship between us would be impractical. 

So then, we became best friends of sorts. We call often. We talk on a daily basis. We share a lot of venting sessions to each other. She usually comes to me about news in her life and stuff. We’re close friends. 

But what irks me is her decision to stay cryptic. I get it. She herself has told me she has the stereotypical “strict Asian” parents. She was born in the Philippines and moved to the west when she was around 7-8 years old. So, her dad has never really trusted anything online (e.g. she can’t do online shopping) and plus she has been stalked online in the past. 

I understand. But I’ve been her best friend for months — she’s told me that. She has fallen in love with me more than once. I’m usually the first person she comes to with any news in her life. But when she nicknames her friends or tells me that she went to “a store” but doesn’t say which one. When she calls me during class and they have school announcements and she mutes the call as soon as they mention her high school’s name. When she sends me a screenshot of a meme she found on Instagram and blacks out her profile picture on the bottom left and any of the friends’ usernames who liked the meme. When we video call and all she decides to show me is her hand or her wall. When she sends me a pic of her wearing the cool dress she really wanted to buy with the camera flash on completely hiding her face AND deleting the picture message after I’ve seen it. When it took 30 minutes and an argument for her to mention the province she lives in. When she tells me she made an anonymous Twitter for Anime Twitter but doesn’t bother to tell me the username. I will admit, I do contemplate if these should all be considered one big dealbreaker for our friendship. 

I’ve earned her trust. I won’t say that I worked for it, because it truly was all natural and I have no ulterior motive in my mind. Nothing like, “haha Finally, after these 9 months of knowing her and having earned her trust, I shall now deceive her!” For unrelated reasons, I’ve actually been the one who was willing to end our friendship or just walk away and take a break from it. But she always pulls me back in. Not that it’s a competition, but she really does fight for our friendship more than I do.  

The thing is, I’ve given up months ago. I don’t ask her for a hint on what her social media usernames are. I don’t ask her what her last name’s initial is. But she’s the one who gives me these constant reminders.  “Ahh, this girl I just added from my school is so cute! I wish I could show you a pic of her.” Her reminders make it hard to ignore this abnormality in our friendship. Normal friends say, “I made a Twitter, follow me.” Not “Omg, look at this screenshot of my twe—oh wait, nvm...” Normal friends tag their friends in memes. Not, “Hey look at this meme but let me blur everything else out.”  Normal friends say, “Hey, it says the file is too big. Just email me that video.” Not, “Hey, send me that video through that email you made for me since I don’t wanna give you my real email.” Normal friends know their friends’ last names. Normal friends video-call each other and show faces. Normal friends message other on iMessage. Normal friends use FaceTime to make video calls. 

Look, it’s not like I’m asking for anything out of the ordinary. I understand that there are boundaries. Address, I would never ask her. Yes, even though friends send each other gifts to their houses, I can understand why one would be wary about giving that information away. You, the reader. I want you to think of a friend. Ask yourself, do you have them added on social media? Do you know their last name? Do you know where they live? What school they go to? What they look like? Chances are, you can answer “yes” to most of those questions (if not all). 

tl;dr: Girl pretty much metaphorically tells me, “I choose you as my best friend but I cannot trust you with normal information.” It irks me since literally none of my other friendships — both online (with other people who’ve also been stalked, mind you) and offline — are like that.

419,"Yeah this is a throwaway account, but im gonna get to the point.

A few months ago I asked out a girl who was my best friend at the time. She responded very kindly and told me that she was just not ready for a relationship and that she was ace. Over the next few months we continued to be friends but both of us were hurting the other in some way. I talked too much knowing that she was an introvert and I felt that she was just not enjoying my company that much anymore. I didn't know what I was doing wrong and nothing seemed to work which got me depressed for the time we were friends and made me think I was a terrible friend (which I was). Before that we went out regulary but after a while we didn't really go out anymore. In the final month she lied a few times, saying her parents wouldnt let her go out for a few weeks to study, but later on a friend told me she went out with him the very next day I asked her, and then 2 days later again. It was obvious things were getting sour and I didn't know when to ask her if we should do a 'time out'. Turns out she did it first and overnight she confronted me about what she thought of me, how things changed, saying how I was nothing better than the bullies in her previous school and many other things. This was a reality check for me that got me thinking about how much I fucked up. Of course this did hurt quite a lot as well, and took a few weeks to figure things out and get me in a better mood. Among many things I told her I was sorry that I did this to her and that I will not contact her again until she decides that she is ready to start talking again.

What followed were 3 weeks of rethinking everything and working on correcting my traits that hindered my ability to make friends and maintain being friends with someone. Summer break rolled around, during which I finally opened up to family about the issue and, after 2 months, finally lost the weight that I felt on my heart everyday.

That is until a month ago. She started talking to me again, of course a lot less, and we no longer talk online, online on occasions in real life. No problem with this so far, but every single time I talk to her the pain of the situation comes back and even haunts me for a few hours after I finished talking to her. It's gotten to the point where her very presence makes me feel guilty and brings out my negative traits again. 

I don't know what to do to ease the situation. I don't want to feel bad after literally only saying 3 sentences to her. I don't want to be rude and ask her not to talk to me but I don't want to hurt her again. What should I do in this situation?",29Nov2019,1

421,"Hi reddit,

I am struggling hard with this decision and would really appreciate some advice. I am 29 years old, recently married, renting an apartment in a city in Canada. I love the area I live in as well as the apartment I live in.

I recently applied for a job in Belgium as I heard of an opportunity and deep down moving to Europe temporarily was something I had always wanted to try, as to date I’ve lived in the same city since I was born.

I got the job and I accepted the offer to start in January pending visa papers, and my plan was to stay for 1-1.5years. 
But here’s the kicker... I keep having feelings of wanting to back out because of a few reasons:

1. The job doesn’t pay as much as I could be making in my current city

2. The housing market in my city is slowly rising so I am worried the longer I wait to invest in property the tougher it will become

3. General fear of the unknown, leaving the comfort of the apartment I currently love

4. Putting my cat through the stress of a transatlantic move

5. Just general wanting to settle down now that I am married, buying a place of my own. I am Wondering if living abroad was something I always wanted to do but may no longer be something that fits my current life goals...

Not really sure what to expect from this post. I guess I could just use some words of wisdom if anyone’s got any

TLDR: got a job offer in Belgium. Currently live in Canada. Should I stay or should I go?",29Nov2019,1
422,"I need help.  
My boss, who will remain unnamed doesn't like me.  
The reason being is because I constantly get injured - From trying to catch a dropped place resulting in 2 deep wounds, one per wrist, to getting hit by a car on the way to work and now getting an extremely bad infection due to not properly taking care of an injury because he would get upset at me; the infection (I'm pretty sure at least) has gone into my blood stream - because one of my main veins in my wrist is immensely swollen. I have been extremely sick and I still go into work because if I don't go - He'll get upset with me and put me on 8 hours a week, I can barely survive like that - Let alone eat. He berated me for not coming into work because of the infection that caused me to get sick and didn't listen when I tried to explain what happened (What happened was that I was on an electric scooter and the wheels suddenly froze up out of nowhere, sending me flying and causing me to receive injuries on my wrist, my elbow, my waist, and my hip) and when I tried to explain what happened - He would cut me off, ""No excuses"" he said, when I was trying to explain to him what happened. I was very sick that day, one of my workmates noticed and helped me out - I was on the verge of tears because of what my boss said and that he wouldn't listen to me.  
I don't know how to talk to him or what to say to him. I'm going into work tomorrow because I need to pay something off and after work I'm going to the hospital to see what's wrong with me.  
I don't know what IS exactly wrong with me, but I've got a feeling that it has to do with the infection on my wrist.  
Please help me out - I have no idea what to do, I don't know if he'll fire me, I don't want to be out on the streets, I need money to pay stuff off so that I can survive a little.  
I feel like I'm going to possibly have surgery.  
It's making me lightheaded, nauseous, feverish, it's making my eyes feel hot, and my nose and my forehead and my mouth.

423,"I lived with my parents and my uncle as I was growing up. I was always a naughty kid and caused quite a bit of trouble, but that would be stuff like running around the house, fighting with my cousin and so on. 

My mother would always slap me, knee me and call me a bastard. 

My dad would him me full force. I remember once I was waiting in the car for my family when I was outside my house. We were supposed to go somewhere and I was waiting in the car for ages. I pressed the horn twice and my dad came outside, opened the door slapped me on my face full force. I could see the anger in his eyes. 

My uncle would also pick me on me by punching me fairly lightly on my back to try and  reaction from me. He would also push me onto a sofa and just kind of hold me there. It would obviously annoy me and stress me out. 

Once he dragged on up the stairs by my ankles. I shouted for my mother and she just turned away and smiled. This only happened once. 

He dragged me across the floor to throw me out the house. This only happens once.

He made me eat a chocolate bar out the bin. This only happened once. 

One time I was being really stupid. I was about 10 and I sprayed my cousin with deodorant can. I could have got him in his eye. It was a really stupid thing to do. Me and my cousin were making a racket and so my uncle came to us to find out what was happening. My cousin told him what happened and my uncle pushed me onto a bed and pressed as hard as he could into my face. I obviously couldn't free myself because I was about 10 and he's a big fully grown adult. I eventually screamed out ""I'm sorry"". 

He stopped and I had bruises on my face. I was also hyperventilating. It's like I was constantly gasping for air. He tried to bribe me by taking me bowling. I went inside to get some information and I'm sure the staff member I was talking to noticed my bruises because she kind of looked at me funny and then looked at the car (that was uncle was driving) outside. I just got the information and left. 

I've been smacked, punched, kneed, threatened  to be sent away and all the rest of it numerous times.  Most of the time it happened because I was being naughty.

My family weren't all bad because they did by me things such as playstations, Xbox, video games and so on. It's not like I had a completely miserable childhood. 

**So was all this justified**? I'm asking because when I've Google physical abuse the stories are much worse with children getting broken bones and so on, but I've not had anything like that. 

My psychologist also did an initial consultation with me and she asked me if I was physically or sexually abused. I said I didn't really want to say. I have a follow up appointment with her next week and I'm sure she'll ask me about it again. 

**Should I mention all this to her**. 

Thank you.",29Nov2019,1

430,"Some context: I've been depressed for a long time. I am very ugly (in my opinion other people say I'm not so idk) and I never thought a girl would ever be interested in me. I felt dirty in my own skin. I was very suicidal, and had isolated myself by pushing away all my friends. Then after a year of isolation, a girl started trying to talk to me but I kept pushing her away and saying ""no"" to going with her, because I wanted to be isolated. Then we had the summer break.

After I got back from summer break, she told me she wanted to talk to me because she was going to ask me out. She said she loved me for 2 years. She told me she was depressed and all she wanted was me but she never thought I would say yes. She said I was hot, I never thought anyone would think that about me. I was shocked. But, she told me over the summer break she'd got a boyfriend. I was actually going to go with her at one point but I got the timetable wrong, so didn't think I could. If it wasn't for that tiny mistake (which I realised straight away), then we would be dating.

It was the best month of my life. She spent all her time with me, we met up every night, she was messaging me at all hours, she wouldn't leave me alone. She kept hinting she was thinking about leaving her boyfriend for me but I didn't have feelings for her (or at least they weren't too strong and I kept suppressing them because she has a boyfriend). We held hands, cuddled, and acted like girl friend and boyfriend, and apparently her bf was okay with the hand holding and cuddling.

Then one day, she came round. We spent the whole day cuddling in bed, it was perfect. She fell asleep in my arms and when she woke up she looked at me a way I didn't think anyone ever would. Then, she began acting very sexual. She started grabbing me, and then tried to kiss me. I pushed her away and reminded her she had a boyfriend and asked what this even was between us. We had an argument.

Now she doesn't spend much time with me. I'm back to eating my lunch alone. She and her boyfriend are now much closer. They've been together for months now. I feel like they'll be together forever. She'd told me that if her and her bf ever split up then she'd date me. So now I'm waiting for them to split up, but what if they don't. I'm trapped waiting. I don't know how to move on. Do I keep waiting on her? Do I move on. I don't think I can. I've tried. She was so perfect. The situation was so unexpectedly perfect. It will never happen the way it was going to. And it's all my fault. If it wasn't for that tiny mistake...

They're both 18 so still young, which makes me think there's a decent chance they won't last, but the not knowing is killing me (I know it's wrong to want someone to split up but you can't blame me). I have nightmares about them getting engaged. I have nightmares about her all the time, isn't that ridiculous? I don't know how to move forward.

It kept going up from the high 90s all the way to 102.3. We're pretty short handed at my work place, so I didn't want to call out, especially since my manager had thrown up at work earlier in the week. So I went in. It turned out to be worse than I imagined, my head constantly throbbing, not enough energy to get any of my shift duties done. Eventually my lower back started hurting so bad that when I wasn't actively ringing up a customer, I was sitting down. I left a note apologizing for not getting things done, explaining how I wasn't feeling well. Yesterday, I wasn't feeling any better, and I learned my lesson about going in sick, so I called out this time. The employee that answered the phone said the manager had already done their Thanksgiving dinner and didn't mind coming in. I'm pretty sure I have the flu, and called out today, adding that I'm not sure when I'll be able to return to work. And that I plan on going to the local clinic to see what they have to say about it. She didn't complain, but noted that she had also been sick since Monday (Probably also the flu, probably who I got it from). I feel kind of bad that she's working while sick and I'm not. Especially since she's a bit on the older side. But she should be able to call somebody above her to cover for her, right? We only have 5 employees, including the manager. The manager coming in sick could wipe us all out for a few days, and I really don't want a repeat of Wednesday, especially for a full shift. I'm pretty conflicted, because on one hand, I feel like I'm letting people down, but on the other, I need to look out for my own health. What's more important here?

443,"I am currently a nursing student at a university and things aren't going so great with me mentally. You see, I was recently diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety by a doctor and I am now taking some medications for it. My parents aren't very open to the whole ""Mental Health"" thing so they wholeheartedly believe that I am overreacting. I am also from an Asian background so the stereotypical background of getting ""good grades"" is there as well as the expectation of graduation with a valuable major (engineering, law, medicine, nursing, etc.)

The university that I am going to is a very strict Catholic school and they are not very open-minded about most things. I remember that at the start of the year, I would spontaneously just cry in class. The teachers have personally told me this, ""Why should you feel depressed when you get really high grades? What do you have to feel sad about? Just snap out of it"", and I remember feeling so alone and lost since I didn't have anyone to confide to.

My doctor suggested that I should consider taking a semester off to get better but my parents are really against this. My parents have a very big impact on my decision since they are paying for my education and I feel that I owe them a lot.

After he got those pics he became a bit distant from me, which threw my anxiety into a crazy spiral. Eventually he told me to send him nudes (the intimate pics were sexual but not nudes) I asked him for a month to ready myself for nudes because I have trauma related to them so he started giving me the silent treatment and said we shouldn't talk anymore, I felt used and vulnerable and tricked into trusting him and cried and begged for hours to him to not leave me before I had a massive panic attack and said something I shouldn't have and he left me. We talked only for 9 days so I shouldn't feel so attached but I do. I just do cos I had hit rock bottom before him and someone as perfect as him came along but I ruined it cos of my insecurities. I keep trying to connect with him but he blocks me everywhere and this is seriously madness but I don't know how to stop. I just want one last conversation with him to get peace of mind and understand why he told me I can trust him with intimate pics but is now gone cos I didn't send nudes right away. I just want closure.

And before someone mentions it yes I'm in therapy but I don't know if it's helping. I just self harm and cry everyday and keep apologising to him but nothing works and I know he will never be back but I'm in denial and keep thinking if I keep apologising to him with new accounts he will come back somehow. I asked my friend to contact him so I can apologise but he told my friend to beware of me and I know I'm crazy but I just feel pain every single second and really can't believe he's gone even though he told me he won't leave.

In the time we were dating, I graduated college and was hit with the reality that I had no idea what to do in life. My girlfriend, on the other hand, was just starting her path. Due to my BPD, I began to dissociate and distance myself from the stressful reality of being an adult. I made other friends outside of the relationship that I probably hung out with way too much. My girlfriend began complaining often about my friends and began demanding I be home more often, but they were the ones keeping me feeling upbeat.

In October, I sat my girlfriend and let here know that I felt as if she was being controlling for no reason. She said she would work on it if I spent more time at home. Things did change a little but not enough and I broke up with her late October. 

The entire month of November, she begged for me back. During this time, I had a major health scare and my aunt was diagnosed with cancer. These stressors caused me to dissociate harder and push her away. Last weekend, I took a trip home to see my family and my friends came as I didn't want to make the trip alone. This apparently was the last straw and my now ex girlfriend separated completely. For some reason, when I got home, I snapped out of my three month dissociation and all emotion hit me hard. I went from being numb to realizing I had given up almost everything in my life. 

I tried talking to her (as we still live together) and she said she felt as though I abandoned her. We would still lay together and kiss and tell each other we loved each other. That never changed. I let her know that I wanted to be with her and I would try my hardest to make it up to her. She said she would try.

Two days go by and we go on dates and I study exams with her and life is going amazing, until Wednesday. On Wednesday, my childhood friend passed away. This not only caused me to grieve her but it brought up my worst memories of friends and my brother who attempted or successfully committed suicide. I was a wreck. I got off an 8 hour shift and I just wanted to see her. Instead, my ex went to this guys house who she is ""just friends"" with. She stayed there and refused to come home saying that I was ""being too much and stressing her out."" 

The next day was Thanksgiving and we had plans with her mom and my ex refused to answer texts or calls about plans. It wasn't until her mom called the guy did she realize that my ex was ditching us both on a holiday. This was the day after my friend died. That night her mother was admitted into the hospital and my ex still did not leave this guys house. It is now day 3 of her not coming home to even check on her cat.

She is not on the lease and by Florida standards, I could give her a 15 day notice as a month-to-month tenant. Do I kick her out and give up and move on? Do I keep trying to win her back because I did push her away? I feel betrayed that she abandoned me on such a dark day when things were improving, but I did abandon her for a month. I feel lost and confused and any sort of advice will help.",29Nov2019,1

459,"My best friend keeps making everything about her. We’ve been friends for about two years and honestly I really love our friendship and her in general but recently she’s been making everything about herself and I don’t know what to do about it. For example, at school she always ditches me for this other girl and I just have to awkwardly tag along since the other girl really doesn’t like me and I have no idea why. Also she always wants me to listen to her playing piano at lunch times since we’re at school and we can go to the Studio at lunch and free periods. When we’re in the studio she is so self obsessed, she is always playing piano and doesn’t give me a chance to do anything without getting offended because ‘I’m not listening to her singing'. I really don’t want to be petty but I just can’t keep going on like this, I’ve been distant towards her lately because of how this is making me feel. I don’t want to offend her since she’s one of my only close friends and I don’t wanna mess things up..... I just need advice honestly",29Nov2019,1

461,"I (F18) have a neighbor (M18) who I recently found out has depression. Honestly, he was the last person I would expect to suffer depression because he actually knows stuff about depression, the causes, symptoms and things like that but it really is true that depression can happen to anyone. He self-harms, has very self-deprecating thoughts as well as suicidal ones. He has had 3 suicidal attempts ever since he was diagnosed. He has not told his family even if he has been staying home for almost 24/7  because he thinks that they ""won't care"" but I know that they really will. Weeks ago, he has been opening up more to us but it seems like every advice we give him, it turns to something negative and he begins to bash himself more. I've been patient with him and assuring and giving him motivations so that at least he would continue to let us help him and himself get better, letting him know that he has a lot of people who loves him as well as those who would help him like us. But these past few weeks have become tiring on our part because not only does it seem that our advices won't work, he chats in random times of the day for example when we're on a family affair, late at night or early morning and our personal life has been affected. Our grades have been slipping since we can't study as much when we need to or have that time for ourselves and family because we have to constantly monitor him, hoping that his reply wouldn't be his last most especially that he has been mentioning about the right conditions to die and that he has made a letter for each of his friends. So I'd like to know how should you approach people with depression in the best way possible without having to possibly hurt their feelings every time.",29Nov2019,1
462,"I'm from Singapore. So the people are different, but the vibe should be the same.

Just a quick overview of myself, so that it will be easier to understand. I'm in secondary school, the Singapore equivalent of High School in the USA. In my school, I am part of the debate Club, and started a chess interest group in my school. 

My personality is very quirky and eccentric (I am interested in fields others don't care about), but I mean no harm. I go for science events in the country, and have represented my school in them. I am also trying to work for the school itself. A goal that I have set for myself is to be the Valedictorian for my cohort when I graduate. 

I am trying so hard to survive in secondary school with the social status. I'll break it down to two points here: social standing and competition. 

Social standing:
I am a very eccentric student in school. That is for sure. But what I don't like is how my peers are looking at me. I have people making fun of me, cursing at my face for no apparent reasons, and no one seems to care. I am not taken seriously for anything that I say. Then when I shoot back at them, saying how I am sick of their attitudes towards me, I am confronted with their tears, and with them putting me as the bad guy. And this is with everyone, regardless of their positions.

Here's an example: A prefect in school (basically a student role model) that was my classmate too (so basically Singapore is different in the way that all students have standardised classes and students wait for subjects teachers to come to class, than the other way round.) called me out in recess when I was sitting in the classroom, when I was using a FM radio-connected headset, citing a rule of 'no electronics in the classroom, whether it be recess or not'. When I refused to keep it, she rallied the other prefects to outnumber me. 

Here's the problem; that rule was in the case of communication devices, like phones and laptops. Even the year head said that it was acceptable.
But I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she, and the other prefects, didn't know.

Fast forward a few weeks later. She and her group of friends were talking, LOUDLY, in class. Feeling annoyed, I asked for them to quieten down. The response? ""Put on your headphones. Then you won't hear us.""

I was in shock, hearing the hypocrisy. How can you stand for something, then go against your stance for your own convenience? This is just one of the many injustices I have experienced. 

I feel a large sense of hatred, from all the injustice. But I don't know how to keep myself from falling apart, when no one takes me seriously, and when I'm looked down upon by everyone.

Competition:
In my school, competition is high. In order to make sure their school-issued testimonials when they graduate is good, they do many things. 

I am trying to contribute to my testimonial by working to make a name for myself in the school. Others, I can't say they stand for the same things. Many suck up to teachers, many spread rumours about their opponents. I pull myself up, they pull others down. And for those that I find a serious problem with, I can't even report to a teacher, as they have all been brainwashed.

Here's an example: In the debate club, there's me, and the others in my cohort. I have a serious problem with them, as they drag my head in the mud. The coach had told us to do research on our own time. OK sure. I did that. When the coach asks us questions on current issues and answers, and I'm the only one to answer because I DID MY HOMEWORK, what do I get from them? Scoffs and eye rolling. That disrespectful behaviour is disturbing to say the least, but I could live with it. What I cannot live with, is that my juniors are acting like them now when I answer a question from the coach, and I suspect, it is because my peers have been spreading rumours to my juniors behind my back.

I mean, is it my fault that they didn't do their homework?

But that is not the only case. There are two other male peers in my cohort. Let's call them David and John. They have not shown much, if not any respect to me throughout the year. And this is basic respect that I'm talking about. Just acknowledging me as a person.",29Nov2019,1
464,I have the habit to play with my tongue. The problem is that I'm able to reach for example my uvular or my nose holes from the inside. The friction always makes my pharyngal sore and sometimes I feel the taste of blood there etc. What can I do?,29Nov2019,1
465,"I (16M) celebrated Thanksgiving with my best friend (18F) because I was visiting her and was away from my family. It was really nice of her and her family to invite me, but at the end of the night I just felt really weird and I feel like I made 18F feel bad about it.

I'm not completely sure why I feel so bad about what happened. There are a few things that I think it could be, but I don't know if any of them are right.

First, I felt super weird because people kept, like, saying stuff about my body. I know that I'm not very physically fit, but it just felt super super weird. Like, 18F’s mom was talking to me while we were eating and out of nowhere she just said, ”so, you've changed your eating habits?” and I just said, ”what?” cause I had no idea how to respond to that and then she just kept saying that I was thinner than the last time she saw me and I know that's a nice thing to say but I feel really weird about it because I didn't really think that had happened at all and also everyone was laughing and I think she might be been lying but then I don't know why she brought it up in the first place. Later that night, 18F and her family were joking about me fighting her mom because I'm kinda scared of her mom and they all know that. But then her mom walked into the dining room and said something about me being able to handle myself and then she held my arm like I was flexing and slapped it and everyone laughed and I didn't feel as weird about that in the moment but now I just feel, like, embarrassed and stuff. 18F kept bring that up and joking about it and saying other stuff a couple times throughout the night and I know she was joking but I just feel, like, kinda disgusting by it? Like, the jokes themselves don't make me disgusted, they make me feel like I'm disgusting, but I know I am and I don't know why I feel so bad about it.

Second, 18F invited her girlfriend (19F) over to eat dinner with us which was really nice and fun and I was glad that I got to meet her but after dinner, the three of us went to 18F’s room and at first we were just kinda awkwardly sitting there, but eventually we got comfortable enough to all lay on her bed and cuddle and watch Captain Marvel on my phone and it was super nice at first cause I got to lay next to 18F and hold her hand and put my head on her shoulder and stuff, but then it started to feel like she cared more that 19F was there than that I was there and one time I got up to use the bathroom and when I came back out, 19F was laying on top of 18F and they were playing around and stuff and I know this is weird to say but I was jealous because it seemed like 19F was getting all of 18F’s attention and I was just there as a third wheel. And I also felt left out because now 19F was covering 18F’s whole body, so when I laid down, I got to hold 18F’s hand and that was it. But I just held the phone up so we could all see it and I know that I'm just being a jerk because they're actually dating and I'm just 18F’s friend and also they hadn't seen each other in a week, but I just wish that there was room for me or we all could’ve cuddled and I just hate that I want that but I feel really really bad about it.

Third, I think I was being kinda mean, mostly because I was jealous that 18F and 19F we're laying together. I feel like I should've just been okay with it but I was being an idiot and I kept trying to get their attention and I think I was just annoying them and it's even worse since they were together so to them I was just some guy who stayed longer than he should have and I feel like they didn't want me there and I was just getting in the way.

I'm really not sure which one of those made me feel so bad about the night, but when we were driving back to my hotel, I was sitting in the passenger seat and 18F was talking but I wasn't talking very much because I felt really bad and 18F said, ”you're acting weird” while we were driving and then when we got to my hotel I got out and 18F got out to hug me and she asked if I was okay and I just said, ”i think so” cause I didn't know what else to say cause I didn't know what I was feeling or why I was feeling but I think she could tell that I didn't like something about that night and I'm scared that I made her feel guilty for just trying to have a good time with her family and her girlfriend.

When she got home after dropping 19F off, she texted me and asked if I was okay and I told her that I just felt really weird about that night and I wasn't really sure why, but I also said that we should talk about it in the morning because at that point it was already midnight.

I don't understand why I didn't like last night so much and I want to figure it out so I least have something to say to 18F, but I don't know what it is. If anyone has any advice or questions or anything that could help, please comment it.",29Nov2019,1

468,"# Hi All,

I would be grateful for some advice please.

My son has been having some issues at school. I have been working with the school to try and resolve these. This escalated at the beginning of this month and my son was set upon by 4 boys and off course - no teachers on duty to see this. I was notified by the principle something was wrong over the phone but my son wouldn't talk to her. I took him to the psychologist and we got the full story out of him. I also called the police to get some advice because the school is obviously covering up the bullying. The police said they could only caution the parents as the kids were under the age of 14 and I gave them the parents' phone numbers.

The next morning, I went into the school as requested by the principle to discuss discuss the situation. She was not in the office so I was sent out to the playground to find her. I ran into a friend and given I couldn't find the principle just stood there holding my son and saying good morning to another parent. One of the kids that had attacked my son the lunch time before came up to me to ask me if he was okay. I asked him if he thought what had happened was okay? Next thing I know I was getting screamed and sworn at by a woman I had never seen or met in my life. The lady with me told the screaming woman (the aunt of that kid) to calm down and then she came forward and started telling me to take my kids and leave the school that we didn't belong these and swearing. I told her to stop screaming and swearing and calm down as she is being embarrassing. I started to turn away from her to to walk away and she punches me in the side near my neck and pulls my hair and head backwards. I tried to push her off me but she was much taller and bigger than I am. Surprise, surprise, no teachers on duty off course during the yelling and swearing but they came to help another two mums pull her off me.

I call the police and ambulance and the police go and speak to her and the mum of the boy (who was outside the entire time whilst the aunty was inside) and then come and speak to me. They would not take the witness account of the lady standing beside me because she is a ""friend"" and decided because they couldn't tell who threw the first punch, they would charge us both with affray. I get asked to leave the school premises. I took my boys home who witnessed this and were very distressed by this stage.

I get a phone call about 2 hours after this from area diocese asking me to read the letter in the email coming out to me.

Here is a copy of the letter but without the details of the school. This was sent to me by Sydney Catholic Schools:

I am writing to you in relation to an incident today, Tuesday 5 November 2019 at

DELETED NAME OF SCHOOL &amp; ADDRESS

in which you engaged in an unacceptable altercation with another parent in front of students, staff and community members. We particularly note that the incident today, occurred in a primary school in the presence of students aged 5 through 12.

● Your displaying inappropriate behaviour in front of students.

As a result of these behaviours NSW Police were called to attend the site.

Regardless of whether you intended it or not, your behaviour has resulted in students, parents and staff at School feeling fearful for their safety. This cannot be tolerated. I consider your behaviour to be inappropriate and not in keeping with the standard of behaviour expected of persons who enter onto this site. It is of significant concern that you have acted in this manner given the previous directions from the school around acting appropriately.

Entry onto the school site is a privilege not a right and I have authority under the provisions of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 to control your access. This authority includes the capacity to impose conditions and/or prohibit your entry to this school site.

As you would appreciate, SCS has an absolute legal obligation to protect the wellbeing of our staff and students both physically and psychologically.

I invite you to make written contact with the Principal in the event that there are issues you wish to raise with the school.",29Nov2019,1
469,"TL;DR I’m afraid of loving things because I don’t want to have to deal with heartbreak or grief.

This started after I split from the girl I was dating recently, I was really into her but we had to remain friends because our lives were heading in different directions (geographically)...anyway that still really messed me up a bit because I was willing to give it a try but she wasn’t

In an attempt to make the sadness go away I started seeing a couple of girls from tinder to see where things went. I started to not see the point, because I thought I was just going to get hurt again. I’d like to start dating properly again but don’t want to feel that shitty again if things didn’t turn out the way I wanted.

And now just tonight I discovered that it extends to other things as well, like animals. The video I watched was of a man helping his old dog walk through the snow. I thought, wow he must love that dog so much, and then acknowledged that I’d do that with my dog. But at that level of love for the dog I would be devastated if it died, which makes me not want to get a dog, just to avoid heartbreak.

Has anyone else felt like this before?",29Nov2019,1
471," Originally posted on r/relationship_advice

So a couple months ago, a college girl \[19F\] and her two roommates \[M/F\] moved into the apartment above the one I live in with my family. They had something of a moving-in party with their friends, and a few teenagers/college students from the building went as well. That night was the first time I got drunk, and apparently she and her roommates were zonked as well, because they didn't realize my friend \[15m\] and I were drinking at the party and felt guilty about it.

The next day, she came downstairs to my place while my parents were at work, to say that she had made a mistake, and to apologize for giving me alcohol. She asked me to please not tell my parents, because that would definitely lead to trouble for both her and myself. I agreed, and said I didn't intend to, and that the party was fun. I invited her in and we exchanged phone numbers and started talking about school and college, the normal stuff.

Over the next few weeks I got to know her pretty well. My parents work late hours and it's usually just me at home for most of the day after school, until almost midnight. Her roommates attend a different university which is a couple hours away and they're usually only there on weekends. A couple times a week, she would invite me upstairs to do my homework and play video games, while she sat at the table and did her endless college work and projects. I started talking to her about everything and she started helping me with homework for my APs. I should mention that the girl is extremely attractive - not just to me, but even by society's standards she is conventionally beautiful. I got infatuated by her...the typical crush stuff (but I think it was way more intense) She's also a very cool person who's into a lot of stuff I like (anime, grand strategy games, history)

At one point, I was talking to her about girls, and how I'm usually nervous to talk to them (like literally any other high school guy, lol) and was telling her how I've never kissed anyone/gone out, the normal shit.

When I said that, she asked me to give her my hand, and moved it under her shirt onto her breast, and told me something along the lines of ""go ahead, feel it."" I was hesitant, but after she did that I wasn't about to resist, and I ended up undressing her and feeling her up properly (with my hands/mouth). She was totally into it and was encouraging me the whole time.

After that, she had college midterms and she went on a vacation with her friends, so I didn't see her too much for almost another month, but she texted me again and asked me to come upstairs a few days after she was back. Of course, I was awkward, and she finally told me that she let me do it ""cause you said you never had, so I thought you might like to""

Since then, she has let me touch her several times, all way too casually. We haven't had sex, but she has let me perform oral sex on her, and proceeded to just go back to talking to her friend on the phone after it was over. I still see her when she's free, which is 2-3 times a week after school evenings. When I asked her why she let me touch her, she just shrugged and said ""because you wanted to"" and got back to talking to me about anime

This casual thing isn't working for me and I'm getting frustrated as I get more and more infatuated with her. I'm pretty sure I'm in love at this point - I can't stop seeing her and making out with her because it's such an easy thing for me to do, since she straight up lets me. Most of my friends think it's inappropriate because of the age difference, but I don't mind that at all and she doesn't seem to either. I'm scared to ask her if she feels the same way about me because I'm pretty sure she doesn't - but then again, she was the one to initiate. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do?

478,"orry for the format I am on mobile. First a little back story to help you understand the situation.

This all started last year, I have a male roommate and we both were attracted to each other and became FWB. Around this time last year I discovered I was pregnant, the same night I told him another female called and told him she was pregnant as well.

After a few months into the pregnacy he started to pursue his current girlfriend. He said that he wants to be a part in this baby's life but only went to a few appointments during pregnacy. 

When I was 8 months pregnant he started dating this women and leaving me alone with no support or food.(my current workplace cut my hours due to pregnacy). He started leaving me alone for days at a time at 8 months pregnant so he could spend time with his girlfriend. It got to the point when I was 9 months pregnant his gf, his brother and himself took a three day trip to another state. When he got back to our state there was a bad storm and a tornado 5 miles away but he chose to stay with his gf instead.

I have been holding a grudge against him and his gf due to the fact during my entire pregnacy they both have been perfectly fine spending time together without his daughter being there with them. I have asked mutipul times if he could take his child with him but he always has an excuse on why he can't take his daughter with him while he is with his gf. Either that or when ever he does take his child with him to go see her she gets upset that he has his child with him and tells him to go home and refused to speak to him for a few days. 

The most recent is for Thanksgiving she invited him and our child to her family's house and he showed up with his kid. (I am assuming she didn't think I would let him take our kid to her family's house) So he shows up and sees our kid with him and tells him she is ""sick"" and she would have been fine going if it was just him and her going.

Every time I mention him taking his child with him he gets upset and we argue about it. This has been happing since our child was born. Every time he goes I ask if he wants to take his child with him and he argues with me. When he does take his child with him she throws a fit that they don't get to spend enough time together alone. Just recently she told him she was pregnant as well...

She lied to him about the time she got pregnant because her due date is a month and a half farther than the time she said she was pregnant. Example she said she got pregnant on labor day and told him she was 5 weeks pregnant at the end of September. Her due date isn't until July.

I still care about the baby's father and I want to try to get him to see that she lied about being pregnant so he would get his gaurd down and actually get her pregnant.......

It is just a messy situation all around and I am at a loss to what to do.... I also have so much rage on how they both treated me during my pregnacy and how they both see no wrong in they way they treated me. Now that she is pregnant he has been spending a lot of time with her and refusing to take care of his child that is born",29Nov2019,1

480,"Hi all,

I’m a woman and will start my very first job at a hospital in December. This was extremely exciting for me, until very recently. I was already accepted for the job when they informed me of the change of uniforms. They will now be wearing a uniform with short sleeves. Mind you, this is a setting where hygiene is very important. My profession didn’t have to hear the same coat, but starting in December, my profession will have to wear the same coat with short sleeves. Nothing may protrude from under the sleeve, no clothing, no jewelry, nothing. 


Here’s the issue. I have extremely visable self harm scars from a few years ago on both arms. 


I’m just not sure when to tell my employer this. I obviously haven’t told them anything about my past yet. This job is a dream come true, but I basically feel it falling apart before it has even started yet. Any advice would be amazing.",29Nov2019,1
481,"My job has put me in one heck of a bad mental state recently, I’ve been having panic attacks and extreme anxiety. Finally today I had the courage to go to see a doc and she wrote me off work for a week and scheduled me some free counselling.

I really want to make the most out of the time and feel as better as possible when next week comes. 
I am planning to do some self care and cleaning of my apartment to try and put my mind in a clearer place but I’m scared I’ll give in and waste the week wallowing or something.

I’d greatly appreciate any and all recommendations and ideas for everyday things I can do on my week off that will nurture my mental state back to a better place! I appreciate everyone is different, but it’d be really nice to hear what has worked for others!

482,"Hey, this is my first post to reddit so sorry if I have awful formatting or writing here.

So a little background first, I have been dating my girlfriend for about 3 and a half months at this point and for the most part we’re fine as a relationship. We haven’t had any major fights or problems just the small ups and downs.

Anyways, her best friend (for the sake of the story I’ll call her T) is a lovely person and I’ve known her for around 2-3 years and she’s the reason me and my current gf met. 

However through the course of me dating my girlfriend I have noticed that they’re VERY touchy and close. I don’t really have that much of a problem with people I date being close with their friends but she goes out of her way to avoid me just to hug her or be near her.

I may need to point out here that I am a girl and I’m gay hence why I have a girlfriend. T is also bisexual for clarification and I don’t have a problem with it obviously just seemed relevant to point out.

Here’s where things get a little messy,
We all as a massive group of my friends went out to a concert to support our friend playing.
The whole night T and my gf where hugging laughing touching all sorts throughout the night, I tried bringing it up but I got shut down as being jealous or overreacting.

At one point I even left to go to the bathroom in near tears because I was just heartbroken that she didn’t even want to speak to me and just hang about with her “wife” ( they call each other that). People even come up and ask me if we’re even dating anymore because it’s gotten to a point where they’re as confused as i am.

I’m just really hurt because I spent a lot of time with her and trying to be with her and I know they don’t realise what they are doing but I’m really stuck on what to do. I don’t want to break up with her because that will destroy her and she suffers from a lot of mental issues.

I don’t consider myself a very jealous person but I don’t know how to tell her how much this is bothering me and when I do try I just get shut down as being a jealous piece of sh*t and that my feelings and worries don’t count to anything.

I don’t really know what to do because I do really like her but if she does like her best friend (which many people think she does) I wish she would just tell me because this uncertain feeling is getting the better of me.

Thank you for reading if you got to this point any advice would really help.",29Nov2019,1
483,"Hey everyone! I need your advice. I am a 32F. Sorry if this post is long. But I figure if you can’t write a book on Reddit, where can you?

When I was growing up I was badly beaten, sexually abused, and physically and psychologically tortured by my older brother throughout my entire childhood and adolescence. The only thing that stopped the abuse was when my brother became really ill and I moved out of the house when I was 19 years old. My brother got over his illness but continued to live in our Mom’s house on and off. But not because of his illness, it was because he played video games all day. 

My mother saw the abuse happen all the time but she did absolutely nothing to stop it. She was and still is in a very deep state of denial about a lot of things. She also has mental health issues and she was neglectful of both of us, the house, and the pets while we were growing up. She has hoarding disorder along with other mental health problems. My father do not live with us.

There were other adults who knew I was being abused. I’m not sure how many people knew the extent of it but my mothers friends and other people in my family knew I was being abused and not a single person did anything at all to try to stop it or to help me. 

In an abusive family is the number one rule is to keep up appearances, maintain the façade, and don’t tell anybody. The number one rule of fight club is you don’t talk about fight club. 

After the abuse stopped for many years after I never told anyone, never got therapy, and I continue to maintain the façade by Sitting at the dinner table Across from my brother and breaking bread with this monster every single Thanksgiving and Christmas. Believe it or not I was even a bridesmaid at his wedding. It didn’t occur to me until recently To even question why I was doing this. But I recently read that this is not uncommon for victims of abuse to do stuff like this.

My brother got married a few years ago and he has an infant daughter who is less than a year old.  every time I see them his wife just looks more and more miserable. She is not a happy person at all. Last Christmas she was telling my mother and I about things that my brother was doing that I recognized as clearly being serious psychological abuse. There is some serious gaslighting going on there. It was very similar to some of the psychological torture that he inflicted on me. But she did not recognize that, she just thought it was “annoying.” She was also telling us about how she has to Walk to the train station in the snow and take the train into Manhattan to go to work full time all throughout her entire pregnancy because her job doesn’t give maternity leave. And she can’t quit her job because despite my brother having a JD and being an attorney, he does not have an official full-time job so their health insurance is dependent upon her keeping her job. I couldn’t imagine being in her situation.

She’s never mentioned that my brother has hit her and I’ve never seen any bruises on her. 

But her telling us about some of the psychological things that my brother does to her was extremely triggering for me. I just ended up crying and shaking all Christmas night because of it. It was then that it occurred to me for the first time and I had an epiphany like, why am I sitting down and eating dinner with somebody who beat me, molested me, and tortured me?? I know it sounds weird to a real lot of people that this was the first time that this occurred to me. But that’s what abuse does to you. 

For the last year I have been going to therapy. My therapist helped me come to the conclusion that what I truly want to do is cut off all contact with my brother. In March of this year I wrote my brother a letter telling him that I wish the best for him and his family but that I’m cutting off all contact with him and do not intend to speak to him ever again. It was one of the best things that I have ever done in my entire life! It was the best decision I ever made and I finally feel that I am free to move forward with my life.

I’ve arranged with my mother to celebrate holidays with just the two of us a few days after the actual holiday. Which is totally fine with me. The rest of my family is dysfunctional anyway so spending the holiday with just my mom a few days later is actually a huge relief.

Last year I moved to another state. I live about three hours away from my hometown. My brother and his wife and daughter still live near there. I have never met or seen my brothers infant daughter because I moved and cut off contact with them shortly before she was born.

Here’s the problem I’m having. I am very fearful for my brother’s wife and daughter. And I feel overwhelmed by guilt about the possibility that he is or will abuse them and I did absolutely nothing about it. No one did anything at all to help me and I am afraid that I’m going to do the same thing. Because doing nothing is actually taking a deliberate action.

But the thing is, I live in another state, I have absolutely no contact with my brother his or his wife, I’ve never seen his daughter so I can’t see whether or not there’s any signs of abuse, and she’s just an infant so he might not be doing it yet but he might start when she’s a child. I have no proof as to whether or not he’s beating his wife because I’ve never seen any bruises on her and she’s never said that he has. As serious as psychological abuse is what she says that he does to her is technically not illegal and there’s a lot of ignorant people out there who will say that it’s just “annoying.”

A few months ago I finally talked to my mother about the abuse I suffered at the hands of my brother and about my fear for his daughter. She didn’t deny that it happened but she did deny knowing about it - which is bullshit. I do not trust that my mother is in a mental state in which she would do anything if she knew that my brother was abusing his daughter.

My therapist suggested that maybe I write to my brothers wife. But I’ve also cut off contact with her because she’s not exactly the type of person that one would really want in their life either. And also I don’t think she would be receptive to it at all because she is also very into maintaining the façade and pretending like everything is great behind the white picket fence. Writing to my brothers wife might make things worse.

I’ve considered writing to other people in my family, particularly my aunts and my cousin, and telling them what happened to me in terms of my brother abusing me and my concern for his daughter. But I have so much shame surrounding it that its extremely difficult for me to tell them. I also don’t know what the reaction would be. I’m an outcast in my family and I’m not sure if that will just make it worse or if they’ll side with my brother.

I’ve talked about my guilt with my therapist and she told me that it is not my burden to bear. Her mother is the one who is responsible for keeping her daughter safe. It’s also her responsibility to leave him if he’s abusing them. But I still can’t shake this intense feeling of guilt that my brother might abuse his daughter and I did nothing about it. 

Is there anything that I can and should do???

I mean, if it was a matter of having actually saw my brother hit or molest his daughter that would be a completely different story. I would go straight to the police. I’d calling hotlines left and right. But this is a totally different situation.

Like I said, I live in another state I have no contact with them and I have no proof that he is physically abusing them. The only proof that I have that he’s psychologically abusing his wife is what she said last Christmas. But I don’t have a recording of that or anything. I don’t even know whether or not he is physically abusing his wife or if he will physically or sexually abused his daughter in the future. But he did it to me all throughout my entire childhood and adolescence so clearly I’m extremely concerned.",29Nov2019,1
484,"Throwaway because my boyfriend knows my main account. 

Yesterday I went to Thanksgiving at my boyfriend's parents house. My boyfriend forwarned me that his paternal grandfather was racist. He's been dreading going all week because of Racist Grandpa. His (bf's) mom however was acting like he was the dickhead for not wanting Racist Grandpa to be there. I thought I understood because sometimes my grandparents can say off color things. Usually I lightly call them out on it, and it's all good. I was not prepared for what actually happened. 

The grandparents arrive and Racist Grandpa was shooting the shit with my boyfriend. My boyfriend is about to graduate with a CJ BS and wants to do either corrections or parole/probation. I guess some relative was doing that and quit. My boyfriend was like ""yeah, people can get burnt out."" And his grandpa said 

""He got tired of all the n*"" 

I honestly was in shock. We're in the south (barely, though) and I'm from the north. Before leaving for college in the south I had never heard anyone say the n word hard r. I heard it used that way for the first time shortly after arriving in the south for college. This was like my second or third time I've heard someone drop it in person. Maybe I'm just sheltered but that word makes me extremely uncomfortable, even when its not used in a racially charged way. 

My boyfriend wrapped up the conversation and left the room. Racist Grandpa started talking to me and insulted my hometown. I wrapped up the conversation and tried to find my boyfriend and found him in the back of the house complaining to his mom. His mom was basically just like ""deal with it"". I thought about saying something like ""my brother is black, so I would appreciate you not saying that."" If he said it again. For some reason racists take you more seriously if you're related to black people, as if you wouldn't have a reason to care otherwise. However I was afraid if I said that he'd go into the whole ""theres black people and n*"" diatribe racists like to go into when they're confronted. Plus, its not my house and not really even my family so I wasn't sure I should say anything at all. 

We get to dinner and racist grandpa and my boyfriends dad started talking WWE and the womens wrestling portion of that. Sasha Banks got brought up, and he fucking said it again, something like

""I dont like that n*"" and at this point my boyfriend's mom was like ""hey"" in a tone that gave a vague disapproval of him using that word. He didn't even really acknowledge it. Everyone there was white but my brother really is black and I guess my boyfriend's (half) sister has black (half) siblings as well. She left shortly after dinner ended. We stayed a little longer but I told my boyfriend I was really uncomfortable and thankfully he was on the same page so we left pretty early too. His mom acted like we were dickheads for leaving so early but like I don't know what else to do in that situation. 

I plan on staying with my boyfriend for a long time, so I will have to interact with racist grandpa again. Does anyone have any advice on how I can shut him down in the future without really overstepping my place? This whole situation has me really thankful for my own family where I've never had to deal with something like this before.",29Nov2019,1
485,"My best friend was new to my school and I was nice to her immediately. We got really close and I got to know her better

And I realised who she really was

She is so smart and talented and has so much potential. But she smokes, drinks and worst of all. Cuts. 

So yesterday her older group of friends one of whom she had a crush on.  Sent her photos of her crush and another girl hugging.

My friend was really upset and I knew she was going to go home and slice up her arm. 

I feel this was a tad dramatic but that’s my opinion 

And what do you know she doesn’t show up to school the next day and she was in the hospital. 

She sent me photos of her arm and it was really bad. She was out of the hospital and she is currently on a quick vacay. 
 
I have told her I care about her and that I want her to stop but she is the most stubborn person I know so that didn’t go very far. 

I called her crying and told her that I have anxiety about someone going to say the wrong thing and her going home and doing something dumb and going too far.

487,"i graduated from junior high and i work part time (12noon to 8pm, daily)  as a redemption booth assistant for a mall near where i live. a few weeks ago, we had a briefing regarding this year's christmas event. technically, the management department of the mall instructed us clearly to gift people a specific items according to how much the customer spent in the mall. (eg. a notebook for every $50 spent, an umbrella for every $100 spent, etc etc etc.) as the amount they spent increases, the redeemable gifts get better. in event if a customer decides to get $50 gifts and he spends $300, we are supposed to give him multiples of $50 based on the amount he spent. (this is ridiculous as the mall is a tech mall and tech items are usually very expensive and we emphasised that during the briefing but the staff giving us the briefing just waved it off)

the event has been going on for more than a week now. today, we checked in with the management department and asked if there were extra stock for the items, as clearly 12 cartons of a total of 7 different items weren't going to last us till christmas, much less the new year. instead of confirming with us whether it's possible for them to order more stock, we got scolded for giving out ""multiples of the same items"" to customers with large bills. aparently it was ""common sense"" to give 1 item or a maximum of 5 items for every receipt. my coworkers and i felt really wronged, as  we just merely followed the instructions that was given during the briefing, and weren't notified even if there was a policy change. at this point, we suspected that the staff that gave the briefing to us left it out by accident, and brought it up to the management department, hoping that they would understand might have happened. a few hours later, after tons of nice customers and a few ridiculous ones, the management department sent a lady over to the counter to reprimand us for trying to ""shrink responsibility"", and blamed all of us for not listening and not paying attention during the briefing. she then proceeded to make ridiculous claims about how ""the previous batch of students are much more mature than you guys, at least they knew how important jobs are and how to properly work"", ""the previous batch or people didn't provide us with such problems"", ""how could you have screwed up in your first week of work"". i felt really angry because it was one thing to scold us for something that might have went wrong on our end, i would be willing to accept that, and another to compare us to the previous batches of people that worked for similar events over the years. my one question was, if the previous batch was as wonderful as you mentioned, why hire us? why not re-hire them? i'm the type of person who trusts the truth and facts more than baseless accusations, and got really frustrated because the management department didn't bother to find out what actually happened and fix it, but instead tried to push the blame to others. 

this incident just added to the frustration that has been built up from ridiculously demanding customers and i've decided to take a day break off work on monday to clear up my mind (i felt the need to build up my endurance too and properly relax to prepare myself to deal with similar incidents all the way till end january). i had a really bad day at work today and decided to relay the story to my mother to let off some steam and how i decided to take a day off on monday. immediately she cut me off in the middle of the story and stated ""wow, you're rich now huh? deciding when you want to take breaks a week into the job."" and ""it's just a really small matter, in the corporate world, people at the bottom of the ladder get blamed for things they don't do daily. why blow it up?"" 

while i realise that it's a small matter, i am not willing to go against my personal beliefs just for the sake of earning money. i don't want to see my other co-workers get scolded for things they didn't do as well. am i really dwelling too much on this matter, or is it reasonable for me to vent and feel frustrated over this matter?

489,"I am riddled with guilt. I don't know how he died exactly, but it happened slowly and I should have taken the signs more seriously. My dog's name was Manali, and he was with me since he was 2 months old, and he was still growing when he passed in front of my eyes.

One morning he didn't want to walk further after his morning pee, so we turned around and headed home. he jumped up the stairs to the front door and collapsed right in front of the door. I tried CPR but it was useless.

He was an outdoor/indoor dog. I let him be wild and leash-less outside as we live in a mountainous rural area. One night Manali came home from one of his adventures waaaay later than normal and absolutely exhausted. I checked him over for any wounds, found nothing, and then gave him lots of water and food before bed. At the time I guessed that he had just lost his way going somewhere new and had some trouble getting back in the dark. He was tired from the long mountain journey... and he stayed tired like that for 3 whole days before starting to perk up again. Then there was an okay-ish-week where I wasn't worried because I stupidly thought he had stopped begging and digging holes just because he was maturing.. not because he conserving energy. Then the last week Manali slowly became quiet too, no whining or barking. When he started breathing heavy, I called the nearest vet (hour and half drive) and made an appointment the next day... but then my friends gave some terrible reviews of the vet and I decided to cancel.

I let another week pass before calling in a vet that does home visits. The Vet visited the night before Manali died and gave him a B12 injection. I found the injection done sloppily and now I wonder if it might have actually quickened his end... but I'll never know.

I'll never know what happened to Manali... and I'll always believe I could have prevented it somehow by acting quicker. He was such a good dog. One time he had a run-in with a leopard and got away. He used to ride on motorcycles as a puppy and loved it. I really thought that I had at least another 10 years with this friend of mine. I imagine now that something happened to him that day he came home late, somehow disrupting his internal organs. In my mind, I'm caught in a web of ways it might have happened... but I don't think I'll ever know.

I would like to have my own child someday, but now I am really doubting my ability to care properly for them. Like, shouldn't my instincts have told me that Manali was near death? I really never thought it would come to that like this.

Anyways, I really needed to get that off my chest in writing...  
In the comments, I'm open to opinions of what might have happened to Manali... even though I should probably let it go... also any suggestions on how to deal with grief is greatly appreciated.",29Nov2019,1

I've been dating my girlfriend for about two months now, and I really really really love her, she's given me so much happiness and just makes me feel so special and great about myself. Overall, she's made me a more happy, productive, and optimistic person (quite impressive considering how negative and not-so-self-confident I used to be in the past).

However, there is one thing that I've noticed that I do very often, both in this relationship and my past relationships. That is, hearing about my partner's romantic history really bothers me for some reason. I keep comparing myself to my partner's exes and get too in my head and start overthinking everything, this is my fault really but something that happens quite often is that whenever my girlfriend talks about her exes, I feel less good about myself, as if I'm not as good as her exes. I know this really doesn't make sense, considering there is a reason that she is with me right now and not with one of them (as pointed out by many of my friends to me). 

I really want to stop overthinking so much about all of this and just focus on her and the relationship. I don't want to feel inferior whenever she brings one of them up because it really doesn't make sense and all it does is ruin my mood.

HELP MEEE!!

So let me break this down I met this girl(21) I’m 21) , she’s currently adopted into a white family and her parents aren’t racist but just concerned, she’s currently in college and lives an hour from her parents but let’s get to the point, we got to know each other etc, through about 2 months of knowing eachother and than. Somehow her mom(divorced- lives separate house)was suspicious and wanted to meet me so I was like cool you know let’s meet your mother, than her father found out and he was super cool about it at first. Than after wards I told them about my life how I’m currently a DACA person and than the convo was going on, until the next morning her father texted me and threaten to call the cops on me, he lives in pa and I’m more towards florida, 

so than I kinda got scared and blocked her it hurt me so much I couldn’t do it so the next day I found a way to call her through a spoof number Incase they tracked her and we’ve had the relationship going on secretly until her mother became suspicious again before she left to go back to college (was on break) so than she ended up telling her mother and she claimed she was cool with it so I was like uhhh okay than my gf told me that the reason her father did that was because his current gf was abused and threaten in her last relationship and used her to get papers and later got the guy deported ) 
 
welll this isn’t my first gf I’ve had experiences in the past I’ve done stupid shit I’ve hurt someone so bad that I truly told my heart that I will fully dedicate and it’s what I’m doing but anyways her father threaten me cause he thinks I’m getting with his daughter for her PAPERS(keep in mind I was raised difffrently and have dated other females and I’m her first boyfriend, she’s pretty mature) but that’s not the mf case like I never even had a thought of that it’s just childish

 I’m a hard worker I currently am injured and her mom was aware of that the first time she met me and was like this is weird: so technically I feel like her mom has trust issues or something but anyways it’s been 4 months later and her mom told her that she has to tell her father which she will tell today but yesterday I talked to her mom and she made me really uncomfy she claims she isn’t racist but she asked me when my green card expired I told her it wasn’t a green card and explained it more( she’s aware of it I think) but anyways she proceeded to ask if I told anyone about my gf and I mentioned my brother and sister) but than she said can I meet your brother and it was 10 pm and I was like I think he’s busy (as in having sex or talking to his wife and she kept pressuring me into getting him and I’m just afraid of what my brother will say because he’s pretty straightforward like not mean but I’m sure if she ask him something it’s going to throw him off because he’s like a father 

(my father passed away and my mom is in Mexico ) I brought my sister she met my sis she just asked question like it was an interview ( keep in mind it’s on FaceTime) she asked what’s your name how old are you what job you do and that’s it not even trying to make a convo and I was very uncomfortable my sis was to so than I was like my brother is busy can we try tmrw and I think she got mad she’s like I don’t get why it’s so hard to meet him and I just feel like she’s to blunt with her question and it will affect my brother but she seems controlling idk I would be more comfortable if I talked to her more but my gf was in college and is on thanksgiving break, I was sobbing yesterday in her mother’s face because my sis told me something about my health and I explained on what I’ve been through lately and  her mother was just blunt, so how do I ask my brother on that her mother wants to meet him( I also told her this is between us I’m an adult but she still wants to meet him because she’s going to be there when my gf tells her father) what do I say to my brother ? How do get him comfortable before her mother talks to him or what do I do",29Nov2019,1

A few weeks ago, I was looking through an acquaintance's Facebook and saw a good friend of hers who I found to be extremely attractive. This led me to her page, and in a bout of insanity, I sent her a friend request, not at all expecting her to accept. A couple of hours later, to my tremendous surprise, she did indeed accept. I was floored and, frankly, completely unsure of what to do next. We haven't exchanged any words whatsoever. 

Could she have accepted because we have three mutual friends in common and simply thought ""Eh, whatever?""

Just for context I am 5’5” and 134 pounds. My breasts cup size is 34 C. I have always been curvier with fuller hips and breasts and muscular legs, and my waist goes in a little and then my hips go out. I’ve always had body image issues / insecurities because I gain weight easily and have to work really hard on fitness etc. Right now I think I’m at a weight I’m content with but I’ve been heavier before. 

Anyway — 

My bf and I were cuddling in bed, just chilling and watching a movie, having a good time. We were both naked after having sex. I was kind of nuzzled up against him, head on his chest, laying on my side, and his hand was on my naked side belly area. He started gently gripping my side fat / love handles a bit and playing with them. 


I can’t remember exactly how the conversation went down, but I called him out for playing with my side fat and asked if he was implying something (like me losing weight) or if he wasn’t happy with how I looked etc. He assured me that he’s told me so many times that he loves my body. 

But I felt like he was still implying something that he didn’t want to say (me losing weight) so I kinda pressed him again. He said that I had “birthing hips” and he was touching my body, saying how I needed some of that fat if I was to carry a baby. 

The whole experience — he wasn’t demeaning or rude at all. It was tender and almost sweet and he was very gentle/endearing to me. But I think it’s my own insecurities and suspicions/paranoia? Not sure..

The next morning I brought it up again, asking if he was implying anything that I should lose weight. He wasn’t annoyed — he just said, “You’re super sexy and I don’t want you to change at all. I grabbed it cuz I liked it.” 

He also said how if I lost the side fat then I’d be “too thin” and “anorexic” and I’d also lose my boobs. SO THEN I asked him if he wanted the side fat gone and just keep the boobs. And then he said that wouldn’t be natural... but I felt like he was implying he would actually like me to lose side fat, conclusion. 

Ugh am I overthinking this...? Is it just my insecurities or does he seem unhappy with how I look/my body?? 

TLDR; boyfriend and I were cuddling naked after sex and he started playing with my love handles (I have body image insecurities). I felt like he was implying I should lose weight despite him assuring me he loves my body and doesn’t want me to change. Am I overreacting for thinking he secretly wants me to lose weight??",29Nov2019,1

515,"This is my throwaway account.

My boyfriend of 4 years recently relapsed after being clean for 2 years. It took us a long time to get where we are today and I’m so proud of him. He used heroin for about 10 years and when I met him he was on and off of it. 

History:I have never used heroin before and did not know he was an active user, he told me he was a recovering addict. I didn’t find out he was using during our relationship until I noticed his behavior was changing and I thought he was cheating on me and I caught him texting his dealer, this was 1 year into our relationship. I broke up with him but got him help because I care about him a lot and did not want anything bad to happen to him. He went into counseling and I thought he was doing better so we got back into a relationship, a couple of months later I find out he’s using again. I told him this is it, either he gets real help or we are done. 

He gets on suboxones and has been clean up until a few weeks ago I noticed his behavior changing again. I asked him if he was using again and he straight up lied to me. I told him I wasn’t stupid and I know how all of this goes and finally got him to admit he had been doing it here and there (which I also know is a lie it seems like he’s been doing it more often than here and there). I told him he needs to be honest with me and he said he doesn’t need to be honest anymore because he’s gonna stop. Fast forward to Thanksgiving yesterday, he said he’s going to do a few bags to get through the holiday because he feels really sick. I said that’s his excuse today what’s it gonna be tomorrow. He promised it’s his last time. Today we wake up and we’re supposed to get a Christmas tree, he said he wants to have energy so he’s gonna get a few more bags, is that okay with me. I freaked out. My text to him went like this:

“It's turning into a full blown problem and I can't have it be my responsibility you can't put that kind of pressure on me, I have to worry about myself. You can be honest with me but you can't look to me for any sort of justification or decision making thats unfair and I know not your intention but also manipulating and I'm not gonna be resented eventually bc ""I didn't allow you to"" and then you get sick I know you're not doing it intentionally but when you start using, your way of thinking changes. You can’t “sell” your problem to me and present it to me in an appealing way saying it makes you more affectionate, it makes you more helpful around the house, it gives you more patience..it’s really manipulating. You’re an adult, I can’t control you you’re gonna do or not do what you want.”

His response: sorry hun it was just a moment of weakness. 

He won’t talk to me face to face, I tried but it’s almost like he’s getting annoyed with ME.

We live together but I have started to look at other places to move out to because I know the lying is going to start/continue and I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t want to become an enabler, I don’t want to support his habit but I want to support him because I care about him, he’s a good person and I don’t want anything to happen to him but I can’t put myself through this again..it’s almost like I have PTSD from last time because I am giving myself panic attacks everytime I start to think about him lying and using again. What do I do?

I'm writing here because I don't know what to do anymore. I am desperate.

We live in a third world country. My wife's mother was very sick and needed emergency surgery. My wife had no money and in desperation took money from a loan shark.

After much effort she managed to pay very high, but the loan shark continues to threaten her by saying that the money she owes is much higher and has begun to threaten her.

&amp;#x200B;

We went to the police and reported it. Three days later my wife disappears. I was desperate, I searched everywhere. After 2 days, I get a call from him hitting her and saying he'll kill her because he's from the police. I begged for and said I would get the money. He said if we went to the police again he would kill everyone.

We were completely broke before, we had borrowed and helped others. There was no way to pay. So I stole money from the company and handed it to him. The next day she shows up at the bloody hospital. She was 3 months pregnant.

He said we still owe $ 50,000. I do not know what to do. I lost my daughter, my wife is completely injured and receiving death threats and I will be arrested.

517,"Hello advice reddit! I wanted to apologize for formatting as I’m using my cell phone for this post! 


To give some context, I’m a senior in college and I have been living within the dorms for all 4 years at my time here. Freshmen and Sophmore year, I had lived with a extremely toxic roommate (stole money off me, would verbally and mentally abuse me to get her wishes, would lock me out of the dorm and the list goes on...). I moved out and begun living with 4 other girls in a dorm further off campus. I lived with a girl named Barbra, and Liz in the upstairs section that I was close with, and there were two girls downstairs (the other two girls I am more distant with).

Junior year, things were great. I lived in a single, I was content with my roommates and stuff and we were all happy, with very little issues between any of us, and I begun to feel like my roommates were better off then my prior one, and the toxic cycle finally ended. 

This semester it begun to go down south. The one girl in particular (named Barbra for this story) who lived in the downstairs room became very toxic. Although Liz (my direct roommate) has her issues, Barbra became almost another human being. 

The issues first began when she started have extreme family issues at home over the summer, burdening herself with responsibilities that she shouldn’t be (I.g thinking she needs to be something she isn’t). She begun to excessively drink to cope with her feelings and then have extreme meltdowns that me, Liz and Barbra’s direct roommate had to baby and force her into bed in order to get her to control herself. She’d say things to us, things like “you don’t know what it’s like to be alone,” “you guys have boyfriends so you don’t know what it’s like” “you guys don’t love or care for me” and so on. She’d on numerous occasions outright discuss personal family issues Im having to people I don’t really know, and excuse it to her being drunk. She’d then verbally yell and mentally push us around in public, private etc and would then furthermore, say “I’m sorry for how I acted, you know I love you” in order to get a forgiveness out of me and my other roommates. 

We’ve tried and tried to get her to seek help, but she refuses to seek any therapy or help for these issues. So I’m at a loss more or less, cause I know the moment I address it to her she’d become explosive, but left unhandled will only cause her drinking problem to worsen.",29Nov2019,1
518,"Hi let's start this by stating I'm a 17yo boy and the friend in question is also 17 but female, let's call her Viola, and we live in the Netherlands. I wanna state first that I had 4 years of amazing friendship, but once we entered our 5th year of high school of the 6 it all went to shit.

In the beginning of the year she suddenly didn't really text me that much, this going from texting super much to almost nothing was quite a bummer. I could live with it, less appointments together but hey I got that support. My grandpa died ending the 4th year and he was and is still my biggest idol ever. he was everything I aspired to be. so you get the loss I felt. she just started not being there that much anymore, not texting. Generally just not initiating.

We have a group of friends, and she is known to be a manipulator. she manipulated the group quite a lot ""for the greater good"" again red flags. then in November last year it was the beginning of the end. With our PWS, a big research spanning a whole year for highschool pretty important, we would partner up but last last minute she said no, like after everyone formed groups. This obviously broke me into a million pieces. I got mad and ignored her, but she got mad so I felt guilty (RED FLAG). She never took responsibility for it, but blamed on me not understanding her jokingly saying ""we must do it together"".

We would go to endgame together with a friend of the group and the two of us, but they went as a couple (they were a couple for a lil while) while I was able to join, this made me more mad. then the biggest fuck up of all came up.

We had her party a week later after the movie. I was not looking forward to it but for the sake of the group I went and tried to not spoil the general mood, I was moody all the time but I think I did well considering how mad I was. halfway through her party something about an escape room came up and they wen tlooking for one. I thought it was with the only other female friend because they do that a lot, meeting up etc. in the evening I learned what actually happened she invited the whole group except me to go to the escape room the next day. lightly said, this infuriated me. I blocked her everywhere. she started msging me through other friends phones, giving lame excuses like ""no space in the car so we didn't invite you"" or ""we forgot you"" etc. I had such a stress attack that I couldn't go to school the next day. My mom forced her and me to talk it out, and what she did was manipulate me into feeling guilty for her (crying, saying how bad of a person she was, saying how her parents did stuff etc all excuses she never took responsibility).

Later on I wasn't statisfied and I finally knew why, nothing in her behaviour changed, still ignoring me kind of outside school. So I officially said we're done. I said if you want me back, you gotta initiate that. She never did. Summer holiday came and school began and nothing changed. Later on I found out she thinks I'm in the wrong and wants ME to talk with her. So I sent her a message, and man did I fire of a bomb. It was 8 points I was really pissed about (like her going to a concert with a friend, planned in 5th year when I got nothing from her but I helped her as the only friend through the time when both her parents had cancer, which they survived). She blocked me for this and last monday she had a panic attack at school (she's the weak type who doesn't take responsibility on nothing, she gets hated on for that by the group) her mom had to come to school. This mom is highly biphobic (I'm bi for the record) and has a past of bullying me and humiliating me in front of the group. The mom tried to spit in my face and called my mom in the evening saying ""it wasn't spitting but something else not directed at him"". 

Hers mom and my mom talked for a while. What her mom said that Viola was happy with how the situation was and the text destroyed that (hint she never sat with us anymore) and bassically saying again I was in the wrong. She wasn't invited to her ex's birthday party (they also don't get along she tried to manipulate him) and said that must be like escape room (it wasn't because escape room was a thight group being torn apart, this was an outsider not being there) and also said I was immature for not letting go of these little annoyances. They accused me of attacking her behind her back, but she is the one doing it I got the suspicions, I only talk with her ex about her because we both have a big dislike for her and I need to vent sometimes so I don't wanna harm other relations.

I feel harassed, not taken seriously and attacked by her. I wanna start a talk again or anything to just get it in her mind to how much she hurt me, so my question is, what should I do?

My husband’s family is very conservative and very Catholic, so my non-religious upbringing has always been an issue for them.

Every birthday, my husband receives some kind of card from his grandparents with either a rosary or a religious book and a long paragraph about not being a good Catholic. This year, his letter stated that the grandparents were pleased he was considering coming back to the church and they hope I would do the same.

Whenever we go to family gatherings, I try so hard to gain their approval, but it never seems to be good enough.

I’m not really sure how to start this off, but in the past few months (and a few minutes ago) my sex drive has been impossibly high to the point where it’s all I think about 24/7, when I wake up and when I go to bed I’m either masturbating, watching porn, or thinking about it. 

A couple recent examples is a guy who sits in front of me in one of my classes is well over a foot taller than me (I’m 5’1) and really fit, my mind constantly wondered as my eyes wandered his shoulders and back, I wondered what he’d look like on top of me. The next day my criminology professor was giving a lecture on something I wasn’t listening to and I found myself staring him up and down undressing him with my eyes and imagining what it’d be like to blow him. 

I know its inappropriate, but I have no control over when and where it happens. That’s not the worst part. 

I live in a dorm at my university and whenever my roommate is asleep, I masturbate for hours nonstop until I can’t feel anything. At first it starts off enjoyable, but then I lose control and I can’t stop and then I feel a pain in my lower abdomen (in addition to me getting sore) that takes a little while to subside. 

I haven’t been sexually active in a few months since my ex and before then and even during the relationship I was the same way. (Just not as often during) 

I feel like I have a problem that could get me into trouble or destroy some relationships and it also takes a toll on my body.

532,"Hi Reddit,

My predicament:  I had a coworker who I worked with for 6 years (seasonally in the spring/summer).  We always got along great, we chatted outside of work on occasion for the first 4 years working together.  The last 2 years we worked together we became very close.  We texted all of the time, and hung out on occasion.  Everyone at work noticed and commented on our chemistry.  I could tell we liked each other, but for some reason we were both too shy or otherwise damaged to talk about our feelings (he was VERY hesitant to talk about any private emotions and would often push people away when they got too close).  Anyway, he decided not to return to our job one summer, and then he totally cut contact with me and everyone else from the job.  It was so strange because one day we were hanging out and the next he severed a 6 year long friendship.  There was no event that seemed to cause it, other than him deciding not to return to our summer job.  I found this extremely hurtful and I liked him very much and I know he felt the same.  We had a great connection.  I haven't heard from him in around 6 months.  We chatted a bit after he initially cut  everyone off and then he faded out again.  

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me really just wants closure:  Did you actually like me?  Why did you push me away? I also want to tell him how is actions effected me and the rest of our co-workers who were worried about him when he never responded to any of our contacts.  Or should I just let it go?",29Nov2019,1

534,"So basically since I turned 18 (23 now) I found a solid friend group that I would hang out with very regularly and since then I’ve always had steady friendships with a lot of people, whereas before I wouldn’t get out at all really and only had friends I’d see at school and maybe show up to a birthday party or two. When I started being more social after high school I noticed that I wouldn’t really stick up for myself when I didn’t like how someone was talking to me or if they did something that offended me. At first I didn’t really mind this behavior in myself because I didn’t want to step on anybody’s toes and potentially lose friends for being assertive plus I don’t want to potentially make someone feel awkward if did. But now in life I hate that quality, I constantly let people of all ages slide with whatever they say or do to me. I’m so fucking sick of it because I feel like just letting whatever slide isn’t me being who I really am and I really want to be able to speak my mind clearly when someone’s bothering me. I feel like I’m just overthinking things a lot but it’d just be really nice to hear some tips on how to become more confident in what I believe in/myself/what I want to say to others. I’m really sick of feeling small and insignificant when I don’t have the balls to say stop it.",29Nov2019,1
535,"So me [22M] has been talking to this girl [21F] for about 5 months. On Monday of this week she told me to love her(through text). I couldn't freaken believe it. I told her Yes I do love you. Nothing much happened after that till the next day we told each other i love you. It kinda seems to me like shes just messing around like being a flirt. But then again love is a pretty strong word haha. We're always flirting with each other and we've gotten pretty comfortable with each other too.

We haven't met. I asked her if she wanted to hang out this week before she goes out of town again for college but with Thanksgiving it's been tough to find time. I've told her how i felt like a month ago but i also told her i didnt wanna rush into things. But when we told each other love you, I started thinking if I should just ask her to be my gf before someone else does.

Idk Y'all i ain't good with this stuff. Help me out. Should I ask her to be my gf. Or wait till we meet which probably wont happen for a long while if we dont hang out this week?",29Nov2019,1

537,"I'm not sure if this comes across as me being stupid or thinking that I have the right to class this in a category that women go through which as so much worse... I just want to understand.

When I was 12 I met this man, named Paul. We became friends very quickly. Paul was 19. When i turned 13, he wanted to meet up and we went to a woods where we kissed a lot. This happened 3 more times at age 13. When I turned 14, we kissed again where he tried to put his hand up my hoodie. He always asked me to touch him but I never wanted to or felt comfortable so we left the night like that. 

We didn't talk for a year after that, until I was late in my 15. Me and a friend went to his and he kept making comments and hints about how he wanted some pleasure... My friend ended up leaving the room when I told I lie, stating that I wanted to talk to him alone. As soon as my friend left, Paul asked me if I wanted to see or kiss his penis...I said yes. It was the first time I ever touched or did anything sexual with a man. Twice that night I orally pleasured him. 

When I just turned 16, he messaged me. I went to his with a friend and again...Pleasured him in the bathroom...Twice. When I just turned 17, I went to his for 20 minutes before him telling me to leave when I said I did not want to do anything.

Now...This is where the emotions are talked about. From the moment I met him he made me feel so special. Made me feel like I was someone so unique. He could have anyone...Spend time with people his own age...But he wanted me, a 13 year old. He didn't want the older women, or so I thought and was lead to believe, he just wanted me. We never had a relationship, he said we were ""Special friends"". He would feed me with compliments. He would hold my hand and make me feel warm. I had a school girl crush..He knew it. He loved it, told me that it made me cute. Growing up, he messaged me a bit. Sometimes randomly after not replying for weeks just to tell me and remind me about how special I was and how much of a good friend I am, plus how he missed me. My crush only grew the more and more he hugged me, kissed me, messaged me...The more he wanted the more I wanted to give. I wanted him to not get bored of me, I was so naive. He would say how if nothing happened, it was okay because there were other girls he could have but he really just wanted me. Obviously, he lied. Though his words hurt...I still felt special. So I have him more, touching him...Pleasing him... He would make me feel like I was the only girl in his life and my age didn't matter. He said he wanted me and one day, we could be together. Every time we met, he always knew the right words to say to make me feel safe and loved.

Now I'm 22. I haven't seen him since I left at 17. I ignored the thoughts of it all..Monday night I had a dream about him and the more I thought about it...I began to cry. I couldn't stop crying. Now, I feel sad and I don't understand. How should I feel? I feel like I should have known. I don't think I have the right to be upset, because I wanted it all and I played up for it. I just...I just want to know if I was groomed or if this is something different. Maybe it isn't anything other than me being a stupid child with a stupid crush and acting on it.",29Nov2019,1

539,"Hi guys, need some advice. 

I have a pretty normal life. My mom has had some job issues (she's been unemployed and her business failed after my parents got divorced) but she is an amazing woman, super talented, and healthy. My family is a very normal, healthy family. She just broke up with this guy who was trying to quit cigs and ultimately he wasn't emotionally ready to be honest, trusting, and stable. That ended. 

I have no idea how she met this man but essentially he's a recovering heroin addict. Bad criminal history. Currently in jail. I believe her when she says he is one of the most genuine people she has ever met and has some unreal connection, but I know she's lying to me when she says she only plans on being his friend. She has gone to see him in jail, they text (however that works...?) and nonsense. He does feel sorry but I told her I am not having it if she even thinks to start a relationship with him. 

Further back, when this all started, something happened where he might have gone to jail and she called me having a full life meltdown. It was so dumb--I mean, what was she expecting? he goes to rehab, fails, gets messed up, goes to jail, here we are. 

She keeps defending him saying he's getting better but let's be real, 60% of addicts relapse, he has a huge criminal history, and plenty of skeletons in the closet. 

This actually makes me sick because she is being purely desperate and not thinking with her head in any capacity. I refuse to even listen to her have a meltdown because he isn't going to change (its been over a year since she met him) and why would she ever think to be with someone that isn't clean--esp. after the last guy couldn't even quit smoking and she wasn't having it. 

Ultimately, this relationship would literally be the end of ours, and she's my best friend. I refuse to see her put herself through this and it is honestly pathetic when she has a full life meltdown over someone who was clearly not emotionally there from the start. Her taking the chance for him to expose her to the tragedies associated with heroin is unforgivable and I think she is losing her mind. 

  
I tried to talk to her about it and she just gets upset about how hes such an amazing person (cool, still can be friends and not lovers??). I'm upset becasue if I told her I was in this situation, she would go ballistic. I don't know what I am asking but I really don't know how to have a healthy relationship with her when she makes awful decisions like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: mom is falling for someone IN JAIL and a recovering addict and thinks I'm being unreasonable for telling her I won't support their relationship. It isn't that I wouldn't support it, it is that it would be so destructive to her mentally that I refuse to be around to watch it happen when she is a smart woman and completely ignoring every red flag. I don't know what to do.",29Nov2019,1
540,So I collapsed at work and apparently hit my head (head wasn’t hurting but my speech was slurred and I was dizzy so my manager took me to the ER) I waited 4 hours in the ER and felt ok enough to go home but decided to stay in case I really did have some head injury. I finally got in and the doctor talked to me and felt around my head found no bumps or grueling symptoms of a big head injury. They ran a test on me for an abnormal heart rate and let me go. Whole check took about maybe 5-10 minutes tops. Now I’m receiving a bill from the ER for $1000. Is this something I can fight or get reduced? Seems pretty excessive for a test that took a minute and a doctor just checking my head for bumps.,29Nov2019,1
541,"My now husband and I have been together for 8 years now. We’ve been married for two.

Things have always been kind of rocky but now I’m starting to see that we just don’t love each other and he doesn’t respect me in general. He treats me like his property. He controls what I wear, tells me I can’t see my friends, or go to parties because I’ll get raped and I’m now allowed to because I’m married. Over the years I’ve slightly broken down these walls and he’s gotten a little better but at times he’s still an ass. 

Everything is always my fault. Never his. He used to use sex against me because I said we should at least have sex once a week. It’s been a month and a half since we’ve touched each other, about 4 years since we’ve kissed, and a good 2 years since we cuddled. I know that he has a porn addiction and I believe that’s some of the problem.

I’ve been contemplating leaving for over 3 months which makes me feel guilty because he owns the home—I just pay half the bills. 

Two months ago I started just talking to this guy from work who is in a similar situation. We’ve become friends but we both want more. I haven’t done anything. I’ve never crossed the line but my mind has crossed it, which makes me feel terrible. 

I can’t move out because I need to finish up my PHD. I have one semester to go. I just don’t know what to do. I am so depressed and I don’t know if I can wait any longer. I do know that I’m tired of being treated like shit and manipulated for 8 years of my life. I can’t imagine going through 8 more, let alone my entire life.

I cant have kids of my own, but i dream some day of adopting,  and when i see kids out and about, even if there screaming, i will want so bad to be a mom to them, and care for them, protect them and make them happy.

But i can never even adopt, I'm so scared of turning in to my mom, cold and angry all the time.

and i may just want to be a warm and caring and huggy mom, because i feel i didn't get that.

most of the women on my moms side have a temper (a lot of them don't talk to each other for various reasons),  and my mom is the sweetest calmest person, except when she was alone with family , then the claws came out.

I feel like if i were to do what  she did to me to another child i would be destroying something beautify and unrecoverable , but how do i know i wont? my mom had a rough childhood(her mom dint just yell, she threw things and yelled), but my mom didn't manage to keep it from repeating....

I got married to my high school sweetheart when I was 19, and obviously that didn’t work out and we got divorced 2 years ago. T and I reconnected and have been dating for a few weeks now. He knows all about my ex husband. 

Where it gets weird is, I never thought about the fact that he may not realize I kept my exes last name- simply because I have a lot of certifications at work and was in school and thought a name change may just be complicated. I was just booking us a trip and it dawned on me. He likely thinks I went back to my maiden name. Neither of us have any social media so he wouldn’t really have any way to know. 

I know this should have already been brought up but I never really thought about it til now and now I feel like it’s going to be SO awkward to be like hey just so you know my last name is still X, not my maiden name Y.

560,"Hello everyone who is reading this.
This is my first post regarding this subject.

**Please read everything before commenting. Thank you.**

I have everything I need.
A house to live in,a family,a dog,friends,enough money to feel comfortable, I'm healthy,I'm appreciated by people, I look kind of good, I know how to speak properly, I have good grades, yet...I'm still feeling alone and sad.
I feel like I don't have anyone to talk about my real feelings. I feel so isolated even with other people. This is not depression. I know it...it's something else but I don't know what. I'm still young; I'm 16 years old, why do I feel this way...I know this sound so generic like every teen wants to be egdy but I don't. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going insane inside my head. I started reading philosophy so I can have more perspectives of life. I am really passionate about the true nature of things and physics, yet I can't slove my own problem. 

The following will sound very common to you and maybe cringe, I don't know.

There is this girl I was in class since grade 1. Now I'm in grade 10 and for 3 years I have feelings for her. She is a quiet kid, she loves reading, she loves rock music, she is happy, she has friends, she is funny, she is sociable once you get closer to her...all that I hope I resonate to.

I have seen her twice since we got separated when we entered grade 9. I still do have feelings for her. I really do. I've heard many stories like this of teens having fake depression because a girl rejected them.
This is still something else. There is no day going by without me thinking about her. She modelled me, she made me more mature at a young age. Truth is without her, I would have been completely different from now and I don't know if I should be more grateful for that. Maybe I would have been someone else, and I am afraid that if it would truly happened, I wouldn't be the one I always wanted to be. 

I want to understand her, yet I'm clueless about my own person.

Music...Music is something I couldn't live without. The lyrics, the melodies, the shivers I get when listening to some songs, the feeling that everything is going to be fine and I don't need to worry about it, the feeling I get when I hear truth in words...
They all make me more and more aware of my own thoughts, they make me aware of my present and possible future, making me fantasize about a good life, where I don't have a miserable mind like now...

What is the problem, what advice should I receive? 

A psychologist can't help me. I've spoken to two already...They both told me the same.

I've come to the conclusion that ,maybe, I'm the problem...",29Nov2019,1
561,"so, I have known this girl for about 3 years and we have had our fights on and off. and been friends with her for that time, and there was 1 other guy in our friendgroup aswell. (there were more, but they aren't important for this story) and so i can say we 3 were really close friends. 

I've gotten to know some of her friends and am slightly friends with them, some more then others. But on haloween I hosted a party and later during the party she was not paying attention to our drinking games (wich is normal when you drink) and she has complained to me that people never pay attention when they get drunk and even complained about me 1 or 2 times. 

so I made a joke about it. I said ''I think I'ts funny you say that other people don't pay attention and then don't pay attention yourself'' I said that in a jokey way while smiling and winking at her, granted I was very drunk at the time so the way i said it might have been very douchy. anyway she stormed up throwing her drink all over the place and went out slighty crying.

So she went out the door, and two friends went out to talk to her, then after a while we switched places and they talked to me, I admitted that the way i said it were wrong and things like that. later we talked and she said ok and we made up. (nope we clearly did not)

The day after is normal we text and snap for a bit, and suddenly out of nowhere she stops even speaking to me. I send a message asking wahts up and get no answer, that was about a month ago and the 1 other guy wich i was fairly close to stops speaking to me (LoL), he was one of the friends talking with both of us when she got mad. 

Anyway I got invited to the same party as her by a friend of hers and someone I've slighty gotten to know and I'm just wondering if I should go or not. I want to go, but I'm not sure that I'ts the best Idea or even what I'm supposed to do. as I think that friendship is gone now, not to mention the other guy wich i guess never was my friend to begin with.",29Nov2019,1

563,"I am currently a first year university student, and I am enrolled in a variety of courses. Unfortunately, I do not have a subject that I both like and am good at. The two subjects that stand out the most to me though are Political Science and History. I know some people are going to say ""A degree in History is useless,"" but for me it's just too fun of a subject to ignore. However, I got my first essay mark back and I have to say, I was not too impressed with the grade. Plus, the midterm went super bad (we did not get our marks yet though)... writing an essay in 30 minutes did not seem like a very doable task for a first year's first university midterm ever but that's a whole other rant so-

Anyways, the thing is, I really enjoyed studying for the History midterm and love writing the essays. Despite receiving below expectations to mediocre marks, I don't feel discouraged at all -- actually, I am immensely proud of how much I learned. I find this weird because in the past, I always based off my motivation on grades, so finally finding something where learning is the driving fuel is very refreshing and less stressful.

On the other hand, Political Science has been giving me very generous marks, yet I never feel the motivation to actually complete the assignments except for the due date and the fact that I do not want to get a 0. However, we only had essays to do so far, and the prompts were on very fundamental topics, such as liberalism and youth participation in politics. When I start writing the essays, I have a lot of fun thinking about their implications and all that, but the problem is actually starting them off. I never have the self-motivation to START nor study the material. Actually, as I was writing this, I realized I struggle to grasp political concepts, which I believe is what accounts for my lack of motivation. But once I do understand, according to my grades, I can write a good essay..? I guess??

I am debating between majoring in History and French to become a teacher (competitive), or Poli Sci and French to either work for the government (very difficult to secure) or teach politics/law + French in a high school.

566,"Throwaway because this situation makes me so anxious. I’m sorry this is long but I think the detail is necessary. 

Background:
I (21F) have two best guy friends who I’ll call E and R, they’re brothers. I have been friends with both of them for three years now. E and I are closer (or we were before this) but I’ve never thought of R as second best. About a week ago I was out to dinner with the two of them, and we got to talking about relationships. E is in a relationship and has been with the same girl for the last five years. R is recently single as of a few months ago. I told them that I have been single since high school and have never really dated anyone that I’m super into. They both were sympathetic. 

It’s important to note that I am very interested in both of them romantically. When E first started talking to me he was being flirtatious and I thought he was going to ask me out. Only for me to learn later that he has a girlfriend. No big deal, they both have been great friends ever since knowing my feelings, and it’s never gotten in the way of our friendship. They’ve always been flirtatious, though. E more than R, flowers, kisses on the hands, calling me his heart, etc. At first it bothered me, for obvious reasons. Whenever I brought it up to him he said that he did it because I deserve to be loved.  He also seems to have a hard time dividing romantic, friend, and familial love. He’s told strangers that he and R (his older brother) are married. Really strange to outsiders but after a while you get used to it and that’s just how E is. He also does drugs recreationally, the happy stuff like weed and shrooms.  He’s never made an advance on me in a sexual way, or tried to ask me on a romantic date. And never, ever have I felt threatened physically by either of them. In fact we met at a concert when they protected me from a guy who was being a creep. They’ve never been anything but purely kind and gentle towards me in all our years of friendship. 

The actual situation:

After we went to dinner together and I told them about my pitiful dating history, nothing changed. Then a few days ago the crap hit the fan at Friendsgiving. I was at their house with several of our friends. It was relaxed and a great evening until it started getting later. I had noticed throughout the day that R had been getting closer to me than usual. Just little touches that he wouldn’t normally do. I definitely noticed but it didn’t bother me at all. E also noticed, and by the end of the night he was obviously really angry. E and R almost never fight but when they do it’s bad. Like broken fingers and handprints on throats bad. I’ve seen them both solve conflicts with other people in perfectly civil ways, but with each other it’s always a war. 

The evening got later and there were some alcohol and drugs going on, E was high on something, R and I were completely sober. R and I were on a couch together just talking and suddenly he was making eyes like he wanted to kiss me. I let him, like I said I’ve always been interested in him. We were kissing and then suddenly E ripped him off me threw him on the ground and started kicking him relentlessly. It took three of our friends to get him of. Then he turned to me, grabbed my upper arms hard and screamed “your mine” in my face. I was obviously shaken up so one of our mutual friends drove me home immediately after. 

Since then I’ve talked to R and he’s apologized even though he did nothing wrong. I have handprints on my upper arms from E. E has tried to apologize, citing everything from thinking that R was assaulting me, to being confused and thinking that I was his girlfriend. All leading back to the drugs of course. For the record I look nothing like his girlfriend, like full blown racial difference. She wasn’t there at all that evening. E is begging for my forgiveness and swearing that he’ll never be high around me again. He’s extremely upset and wants me to give him a chance to prove that he can still be a good friend. He understands that it could be years before I trust him in the same way again and says that he doesn’t care he just wants to make it right. He has said all of this through text and voicemail which I haven’t responded to yet. 

I’m torn, obviously what he did was horrible and it scared me a lot, but the thought if losing my best friend makes my heart break. I need someone with an outside perspective to shed some light on this. Please help.",29Nov2019,1

571,"Screenshot of Facebook comment that prompted me to ask this: https://i.imgur.com/jAMOtyP.jpg (the edit was changing about 25% to 15-25%)

For context, I answered a question on a Facebook group regarding a woman using Plan B. A friend of hers posted and said that her friend was over the recommended weight for Plan B and was curious if anyone who was over that weight had used Plan B successfully. I responded to that question with my first comment.

Someone else (not the OP) responded to my comment saying that not all people who have menstrual cycles are women so I should use less gendered language. I responded with the comment seen in the screenshot above.

The person then responded and told me that it was a non-apology. The person ended up blocking me. That's why their post isn't showing up in my screenshot.

I had heard that ""sorry **if** I offended you"" was not acceptable but never that my wording (sorry **that** I offended you) was not acceptable. It's so bizarre to me because this is how I've always spoken and I truly did mean that I was sorry. IMO it's a short way of saying ""I am sorry that what I said/did was offensive."" Is my apology acceptable or not? If so, why not and what should I be saying instead?",29Nov2019,1
572,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for 2 years now, and have known each other for 3. We love each other a lot, and I moved to Russia for studies and to be with her (I come from the Middle East). The problem is that her mom is a very abusive, narcissistic woman. Despite the fact that her daughter is already a 23 year old woman, she still controls her as if she is a child. She broke her hand when she was teenager, made her talk to people from New York to learn English, often hit her and the list goes on. Recently, she found out that my girlfriend is not a virgin through finding a birth control pill in her purse. She went insane, crying and constantly telling my girlfriend words like ""dirty whore"" etc. So we decided that she will run away and we will move in together. However, I am really worried that the mother will commit suicide. Horrible as she is, she is very lonely, depressed, has nobody else, and has shown suicidal tendencies many times. This might get me to jail or get me deported, since it is Russia after all.

574,"I'm from Singapore. So the people are different, but the vibe should be the same.

Just a quick overview of myself, so that it will be easier to understand. I'm in secondary school, the Singapore equivalent of High School in the USA. I'm 15. In my school, I am part of the debate Club, and started a chess interest group in my school. 

My personality is very quirky and eccentric (I am interested in fields others don't care about), but I mean no harm. I go for science events in the country, and have represented my school in them. I am also trying to work for the school itself. A goal that I have set for myself is to be the Valedictorian for my cohort when I graduate. 

I am trying so hard to survive in secondary school with the social status. I'll break it down to two points here: social standing and competition. 

Social standing:
I am a very eccentric student in school. That is for sure. But what I don't like is how my peers are looking at me. I have people making fun of me, cursing at my face for no apparent reasons, and no one seems to care. I am not taken seriously for anything that I say. Then when I shoot back at them, saying how I am sick of their attitudes towards me, I am confronted with their tears, and with them putting me as the bad guy. And this is with everyone, regardless of their positions.

Here's an example: A prefect in school (basically a student role model) that was my classmate too (so basically Singapore is different in the way that all students have standardised classes and students wait for subjects teachers to come to class, than the other way round.) called me out in recess when I was sitting in the classroom, when I was using a FM radio-connected headset, citing a rule of 'no electronics in the classroom, whether it be recess or not'. When I refused to keep it, she rallied the other prefects to outnumber me. 

Here's the problem; that rule was in the case of communication devices, like phones and laptops. Even the year head said that it was acceptable.
But I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she, and the other prefects, didn't know.

Fast forward a few weeks later. She and her group of friends were talking, LOUDLY, in class. Feeling annoyed, I asked for them to quieten down. The response? ""Put on your headphones. Then you won't hear us.""

I was in shock, hearing the hypocrisy. How can you stand for something, then go against your stance for your own convenience? This is just one of the many injustices I have experienced. 

I feel a large sense of hatred, from all the injustice. But I don't know how to keep myself from falling apart, when no one takes me seriously, and when I'm looked down upon by everyone.

Competition:
In my school, competition is high. In order to make sure their school-issued testimonials when they graduate is good, they do many things. 

I am trying to contribute to my testimonial by working to make a name for myself in the school. Others, I can't say they stand for the same things. Many suck up to teachers, many spread rumours about their opponents. I pull myself up, they pull others down. And for those that I find a serious problem with, I can't even report to a teacher, as they have all been brainwashed.

Here's an example: In the debate club, there's me, and the others in my cohort. I have a serious problem with them, as they drag my head in the mud. The coach had told us to do research on our own time. OK sure. I did that. When the coach asks us questions on current issues and answers, and I'm the only one to answer because I DID MY HOMEWORK, what do I get from them? Scoffs and eye rolling. That disrespectful behaviour is disturbing to say the least, but I could live with it. What I cannot live with, is that my juniors are acting like them now when I answer a question from the coach, and I suspect, it is because my peers have been spreading rumours to my juniors behind my back.

I mean, is it my fault that they didn't do their homework?

But that is not the only case. There are two other male peers in my cohort. Let's call them David and John. They have not shown much, if not any respect to me throughout the year. And this is basic respect that I'm talking about. Just acknowledging me as a person.

But sure, I could live without their respect. What drove me to really hate their guts is when they told me that they had a problem with me, and wanted me to stay back after school to talk about it.

From that, I already had a problem. How can you say you have a problem with me, when you haven't taken the time to know me? Also, what gives you the right to judge me, when you have not given any respect to me from the start?

I grudgingly agreed. Maybe they had something to say. I'll save you the details, but it wasn't feedback at all. They were nitpicking every mistake I have made, and giving judgement of my character based on that, forgetting that they were no better. All the mistakes I made, they have done before. Not only that, but they also wanted me to change myself to fit their standards. NO WAY IN HELL AM I GOING TO DO THAT. The worse part was that they were taking my own internal affairs, which they only heard from rumours, and judging my character on that, when they have NO RIGHT to interfere. There was no way I could fight back from this, because there no moderator, and I knew that if I just left, they would just spread that story across the debate club too. I could only sit back and hear what they had to say.

I feel a lot of hatred from this, and I just don't know how to move forward. I am falling apart, and I don't know how to pull myself together.",29Nov2019,1

579,"So it all starts with my friend Will and my friend Ellie. Will is dating Ellie and I am really good friends with both of them. They’ve been dating for over a year and this is sophomore year of high school.

Throw back to June 2019 when it all started. I helped my Will deleted Ellie’s nudes off of a guys phone by myself. Due to this me and Ellie started talking. Over time our bond grew stronger and stronger and eventually I got to a really personal level with her. I could tell her everything she could tell me everything.

We kept growing this bond to the point where Will asked Ellie why me and her were so close. He thought I was hitting on her. She said we r just friends and told me about it. I told him myself I would never go after his gf and that I don’t like her. It seemed as if he believed me.

Fast forward to November me and her were both gonna buy Christmas presents for eachother bc we were joking about it. I then bought her and her friend Marie matching hoodies. Will found out and wasn’t happy. He told another friend about how he thinks it’s weird and is suspicious of me. I heard about this and told him I didn’t like his gf and that we r just good friends for the second time.

Fast forward a week. My friends and Ellie and Will come over. Will sits on the couch and I was already on it. Ellie comes over and sits with me where there was no room so she was basically on top of me. I got a horrible look from Will but I didn’t confront him about it bc I can’t do anything about it.

But this is the final straw today on Black Friday I went shopping with Will and he was getting Ellie PJs and was picking out a bad one so I told my other friend who was a girl to tell him they aren’t good since it would be weird if I did, but she failed at that. I then have to butt in and say she wants long white patterned ones that are fluffy. Will then goes “what the fuck” “why do u know that” “that’s creepy the fuck” and I was so confused because all I was doing was helping and he just kept getting mad at me. I don’t know if it was because he got literally 0 sleep or if he just unleashed a ton of anger, but I tried to clarify the problem and I couldn’t fix it so I just left and went outside to listen to music. He then came to my house after shopping and I ignored him for a hour and he left. I don’t know what to do now and I want a solution to fix the whole problem.

TLDR: Friend accused me of hitting on his gf 4 times and then we ended on a bad note and I don’t know what to do because I haven’t hit on her once and don’t like her.

Question: how do I fix the problem and my relationship with my friend and his gf.",29Nov2019,1

My close buddy for years recently started talking to this chick about a month and half ago. This particular girl has a rough history in terms of # of guys she's been with, and last night she came out and told him that she has genital herpes. 

At this point my buddy is completely head over heels ""in love"" with her because they do have a good connection and good chemistry, ect., and he feels like he's way too deep in the woods to turn back because of this. 

The worst part about all of this is that I called it, I brought up the possibility of this very thing happening several weeks ago; she would get him wrapped around her finger and then drop the bombshell once he is reeled in. And here we are, and he's letting it happen. 

I keep telling him that this is literally a terrible mistake he's making, and he keeps going on about ""research"" he's done and how he can't contract it from her if she's not having an outbreak and this and that.

584,"I grew up with pretty humble beginnings. Most years my family didn't have a Christmas tree. Our Christmas gifts weren't extravagant.

I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for over a decade. As we prepare for our own future, it's made me think of how I would like to spend Christmas.

My boyfriend's family puts a huge emphasis on Christmas gifts - the amount spent on them. Because I grew up with humble beginnings, I didn't know $50 was the appropriate amount to spend for a gift. I thought $50 was so extravagant. But, now that I'm older and have met more people in my life, I have discovered that lots of people spend between $50-100 on one Christmas gift.

I want Christmas to be about togetherness, being grateful, and not about the amount spent. Feeling loved and being loved by those important to you. And, giving.  


With my boyfriend and my own different monetary upbringing, I'm not sure how to accomplish that. I like the idea of good food and decorations - I just don't want the materialism and glam of everything to be the most important thing.

But as is the case with most people with depression, the ugly side tends to rear it's head at those closest to them.

This girl really is important to me, we have had some incredible times together and we genuinely click in a way I never imagined. 

The part I'm find difficult is how up and down it is, and it's proving to become incredibly exhausting for myself, I'm either on top of the world with her, knocked flat on my ass by the lashing out, or left in some kind of limbo state.

I have tried talking to her about doing something to help her, such as therapy, or medication, even coming of off birth control since I noticed the change was most prominent when she started taking it. But she doesn't seem to want any of it, she tried group CBT for a short amount of time, but said it didn't work for her and doesn't seem to want to humour the idea of trying it again. 

I feel awful because I'm really struggling to keep going with someone who means so much to me, but I can't keep going if it is going to go round in circles like this.

A task which seemed impossible to my old self was two weeks of work for the new me.

I decided to apply the same principles everywhere, including my work. The cream rises to the top after all right? Wrong.

I have been killing myself for the last ten months. I finish a task as quickly as possible and pickup the next without wasting time. While some colleagues are waiting for the next day to pickup new tasks, I pickup a new task as soon as I finish.  If the tasks are finished in the sprint I pickup tasks from the next sprint. In the current sprint I did more than three times the work compared to  other members of the team. I do things quickly and believe it or not I am the reason that we have always been ahead of plan in the last 10 months.

Two weeks ago there was a planning week at my company. No one was doing work on the planning days. I squeezed in 16-20 hours of work in between those meetings.  That was the reason that at the start of the sprint I had already finished most of the work.

In the evenings I workout and read a non-fiction book to improve myself. In the last two weeks I was so tired that I had no energy to workout or do anything. My body was crushed with tiredness and in pain at the end of the day. I tried reading books but my brain was blank and I couldnt retain anything. Yesterday I didnt even want to entertain myself. I hated the idea of watching my favorite tv show.

Now here is the sad part. No one knows or remembers what I am doing. Last week I even went to the team lead to tell him what I was doing. Today during the standup People said ""Hey Our planning isnt going so great. We are over-estimating tasks. Look we have to pull tasks from the next sprint into this sprint. We are doing so great"". 

No one mentioned or remembered the hours and hours of extra effort I put. Infact the planning was wrong and we are overestimating the tasks. I was pissed. Later I asked the team lead for a short meeting and told him I didnt like the discussion this morning. Asked him why he thinks the tasks were being finished so quickly? He told me because they were underestimating the team. I told him that the tasks were finished because I was working outside of the sprint. One the first day of the sprint I had finished a major part of the work. I even told him and he didnt remember. He told me that he appreciates that I am motivated and he does not want me to slow down. 

Sad that no one else cares or remembers. 

To top it all off yesterday I found out on the /r/Netherlands subreddit that [I maybe underpaid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/e2zd26/is_4k_a_good_bargain_to_work_in_the_netherlands/f8zv579/) for my age and experience. I am a contractor so I sent an email to my contracting company about this and they ignored my email. This is the tenth time in the last three months they ignored my email. This is driving me nuts.

This is a matrix organization which means I have another manager. I will share my opinion of how things went and for my contracting company I will soon setup a meeting with them to give them a piece of my mind.

I dont know the symptoms but I may be getting a burnout. The sides of my head feel heavy and there is burning sensation there. It also feels like there is pressure on my head and my body feels tired all the time. 

What is the best way to recover from this possible burnout going forward?",29Nov2019,1
613,"Hey! I'm a new time redditor so I'm not very good at this but basically my story is: I'm almost 15 and I have no friends, no education, and no life! (TLDR; at the bottom)

So first off I have a lot of siblings so school doesnt really work for all of us but recently I've been starting to think that I need it.

I went to camp this summer and made a group of friends and we talk all the time but they all live hours or states away from me. I also find it hard to relate to them because they all go to school and I just sit around the house all day watching TV or playing video games.

My mom and dad and stepdad all work so nobody has time to homeschool us and when they do it's always like ""read this book, that I'm already reading but is way above your grade level because I dont teach you"" I do math on a 3rd grade level and read on a 7th, my grammar is terrible (which I'm sure to be noticed by now).

The worst part of it is that I dont have any real friends. My family is poor and we only have one car so and a thousand schedules so I can't go to any sort of group or ymca program or anything. School is usually an outlet for kids but not me. I feel so lonely and depressed and it's even worse when I bring up going to school and everyone just tells me I won't like and people will be mean to me and stuff.

My new years resolution was to be to study and work hard enough that I could go to school but i have so much trouble motivating myself and my mom cant afford paying for teaching textbooks anymore. I'm really afraid that my life is going nowhere already.

TLDR; I'm uneducated and need friends but dont have the means to make them",29Nov2019,1
614,"I hired a friends fiancé as a personal trainer. It’s 3 sessions a week for a month.  I’ve only done it for 1 week so far. The last two sessions I scheduled with him, he did not show up. Both of which I waited 10-15 minutes for him to show up and he didn’t. First time, he said his girl had the car, which is fine. Except he knew ahead of time she was going to have it... Anyway, he asked to reschedule to the following day. I show up the next day and waited 15 minutes past the scheduled time, messaged him asking if he was coming... he replied pretty quickly saying that he passed out, asked if I was there and then told me to do 45 minutes on a treadmill. I paid him for the month and I don’t know what to do. Should I give him the benefit of the doubt, or ask for my money back?

617,"So I’ve(22m) had a sneaking suspicion that my step sister has a bit of a high school crush on me. Just from body language, to how and what she talks about to me, including talking more privately fairly often, it seemed pretty obvious to me but I thought I might’ve just been thinking too much into it and felt creepy about even suggesting it to myself. The suspicions were seemingly confirmed when yesterday, she told me in private that she had pierced her own nipples. Now as someone who has been with girls with the same piercing, I’ve never been told about them unless the girl was trying to get with me, or unless they were really close friend that was proud of them. Seeing as she’s my step sister I thought that was kind of weird to bring up, especially in private to me. It caught me so off guard I couldn’t even think of anything to say back, I feel bad that the thoughts even went through my mind. It was so unexpected and I’m ashamed to say it, but I seriously thought “maybe when she’s 18” and after I felt like a creep. I guess what I’m looking for advice on is this, what do I do about this? What do I do about my step sister apparently having a crush on me? What do I do about having a thought like that?",29Nov2019,1
618,"
Few months ago, I started a new job. My boss and I hit it off, and we sorta got involved on a personal level. (No sex, but some physical stuff happened.) There's no love involved (at least for me), but I care about him a lot and I do respect him. He's a very toxic and moody person and has been horrible to me on several occasions, and we're not on the best terms because of it. We do still work very well with each other, and im still very attracted to him, but I'm now to the point where I feel like I can't work with him anymore. I feel like if I stay, it'll only get worse, and I'll fall for him over and over. I am planning to leave, but I don't know if I should tell him or just not say anything, turn in my resignation and disappear without a trace. If I should tell him, how should I do it?

621,"Hey, so I made a post here earlier about fake friends, and while I'm not going to delve into that topic, I just had a quick question. Sometimes I just don't feel like going out a certain night, and whenever I say I can't hang out (usually I just say I want to chill with my family at home) they always lash out and say stuff like ""fuck you, you are definitely lying"" and ""you would make time if this was important to you"" and calling me a fake friend and stuff. My question is, is this normal? I feel like they are joking around but it still kinda hurts. Are these friends toxic? How should I go about telling them I don't want to hang out? Thanks in advance.

623,"I (M36) met someone (M52?) a few weeks ago, had a few get togethers and we get along very well. I discovered from a mutual friend that he lied about his age, shaved off about 8 years, and it makes sense now that I think about it. He did look older than he mentioned.

Obviously it doesn’t matter to me, but it seems to be an insecurity with him. He’s mentioned the fake age each time we’ve met up, and I wonder if I should just say something and get it out of the way. If this was a casual acquaintance it would be different, but because I see this friendship developing, he’ll more likely admit it in the future and I wonder if even then I should say that I knew.

There is zero romantic angle to this, I think he’s just been saying the fake age for so long that it’s a natural answer. Have you had friends who lie about their age and you just went along with it?",29Nov2019,1

Backstory: My family (Me, Little Brother, Mom and Dad) moved to Florida in late July. They’ve wanted to live here for a while, but we had problems when we were down here and now we’ve bought a house that is way too expensive (by about $50K) and my mom can’t find a job.

My little brother has been acting out a lot lately. Breaking rules, nearly destroying our microwave (forgot to put water in Easy Mac, 2nd time now), etc. He’s 9. He’s had video games as a crutch since he was about 4, and they’ve rotted his brain. We all agree on this. However, my mom thinks it’s my dad’s fault that he is the way he is because he never enforces her rules (semi-true, not entirely though). She’s been yelling at him a lot lately and keeps telling him he’s gonna end up being a delinquent and in jail when he’s 18 (a bit of a stretch), and so today I told her that it’s her fault as much as it is my dad’s because she’s simultaneously coddled and traumatized him since he was little. 

For example, my parents always make his lunch for him and gave him baths until he was 8. However, there were times when he was littler where I’d wake up in the middle of the night to my mom screaming at my little brother to get in bed (think toddler age). 

She’s absolutely convinced that this is not her fault, but the truth is that it is as much her fault as it is my dad’s, and if she keeps telling my little brother that he’ll end up being in jail, he’s gonna believe it. My brother’s belligerence has gotten so bad now, my mom and dad get into yelling fights about it almost every day, and my mom wants to medicate my brother for ADHD to calm him down. I feel like she’s being unfair because he’s 9, but I want to yell at him for being such an idiot and not using common sense to prevent himself from getting in trouble. 

Next:

My mom not finding a job is a problem because she hates being at home doing nothing. She had a serving job back in TN (used to live there), but she lost it due to a discrepancy with the awful manager. She keeps looking for jobs like that one here in Florida, but my god the service industry down here is TERRIBLE. 

Anyway, she had a meltdown about it a month ago, and I was sure she and my dad were gonna divorce and she was gonna move back to TN (which is unfair to me since I didn’t want to move here). She ended up staying and has been through 3 terrible jobs so far that ended up not working, mostly due to bad management or the job not comparing to her last one. She found a new job 2 weeks ago that could’ve been okay, but she hates it now. 

Lately, she has been complaining to me a lot about it because she can’t talk to my dad (it’ll stress him out since he has to work from home), but I’m a Junior at an IB school and I’m stressed enough as it is. She keeps telling me that she’s a failure, but no matter how many times I tell her she isn’t she keeps refuting me. 

What all this adds up to:

Basically, my mom is falling into a depression, My dad is really distant now, and I feel like they’re gonna get divorced anytime. This would cause me pain for obvious reasons, but I’ve seen it coming for a while. Also, my mom told me today that we’re not decorating for Christmas because she “hates our house” (that pissed me off) and she thinks our living room “looks like a trailer” because they can’t afford furniture to put in it. She says she hates it here (funny because she made us move down here to be happy) and she hates the holidays because she can’t find a decent job to help us survive (she doesn’t even really need one). 

I feel absolutely helpless. I can’t talk to anyone except my girlfriend, but I have too many emotions running through my head right now. What if they get divorced? What if my mom ends up leaving us? What if my brother becomes depressed? How do I deal with my fear and depression? 

I need help on how to deal with this situation. Idk how to talk to my mom rationally or how to fix these problems finding a job or with my brother. I’m open to any questions anyone may have. 

TL;DR Mom can’t find a job after moving to FL, and my little brother is being an idiot a lot, and it’s causing conflict between my parents",29Nov2019,1
661," There's this woman I've been seeing for a while now and I have a crush on her. A couple of days ago, she invited me for brunch post Thanksgiving and it was supposed to happen either today or tomorrow. The thing is that she's back in town for the weekend from her internship in FL. If I try to remind her, I would probably pressure her and maybe push her away. I spoke to my bro about it and told me to let it go because in his opinion, if I care less about the possible cancelled hangout, there's a chance that she'll like me back down the road since I wouldn't pressure her. In the meantime, she really appreciated my Thanksgiving greeting to her yesterday and we've talked a lot via social media in the past couple of months.  It's one thing for people to tell me that they have stuff going on before I make those plans happen. It's another thing that after I attempt to follow up with some people on them (even if they initiated the idea in the first place to me), they never responded as such and go on about their days and it's not the first time I had faced that in my life. Trying to do better.  \* In addition to that, she hasn't given me the time/day to me as of this writing so I can plan my route(edited)",29Nov2019,1

666,"Hey everyone, first time poster here. So there's this guy in college I have a few classes together. He's social, friendly and helpful, an OK person overall. Since sometime after we met a year ago, he's been asking to meet up with me persistently. Almost every time we end up in a conversation, he would ask for me to come over to his place to play video games and hang out, meet up outside of campus for a drink and hang out, anything along those lines.  


Now, I'm not the most sociable person. I don't like to ""go out"" if I don't need to, nor am I looking for friends or anything more than that. I feel dirty and my gut says ""run"" so I end up saying ""haha, sorry can't"" or just changing the subject/ignoring.  


I talked to one of his friends and hinted at how uncomfortable he's making me, but he just brushed it off saying ""oh, he's like that with everyone don't worry, he's a good dude"". But I haven't seen him treating anyone else like this. He also ignored me during the time I had an affair and started talking again the day after I changed my relationship status.  


Maybe I'm looking too far into this, but he's making me very uncomfortable. This is a vague grey area where if I said ""chill out"" it would turn against me, making me look like a weirdo because ""he's just being friendly"".

669,"Hey! Some of you might remember me as the guy who asked about someone who was super eager to meet after we matched Oman online dating site. Anyways it turns out that wasn’t really relationship material, but finding a new friend I guess. The problem is, when using these apps (the main stream ones) everybody seems to be on there to hook up, trade pics, or get off. Virtually nobody just wants to meet, have a date, and start off slow. Also I’m 18 and in college, but my classes this term are online so I don’t get out much. I was mainly looking for advice on how people tend to meet each other, and if there is a way that people find themselves without putting out a little. Especially today, it feels like if you don’t wear tight enough clothing, or have a super ripped body (I’m fit but not ripped fit) that it’s hard to find someone decent and willing to stick it out. Yeah so I guess I’m just looking for ways to meet new people that would like a relationship but don’t need sex as a motivator. Also I don’t drink or smoke.

674,"I'm co-renting a house with my wife and my brother-in-law.

We have a dog, a little jack russell terrier mix, which we rescued from an abusive home.

In its former home, the dog was allowed to roam free and it would walk miles and miles away from its home and still find its way back. My brother-in-law finds this endearing because he grew up in a farming town where dogs were allowed to roam free without much supervision.

When we adopted the dog, it would still run away very often and eventually find its way back, not always without getting hurt.

The dog is indeed very smart, but here's a list of things that have happened to it:

&gt;It's been hit by a  car more than once
&gt;It's been attacked by pitbulls twice, the second one was very bad and he's still full of scars from it
&gt;It got sprayed by a skunk
&gt;It was fed tinfoil and twine

The dog now is very obedient and won't run away unless somebody leaves the door open or literally takes it out without a leash, both things my brother-in-law does often, because ""it's only a dog, it won't run away, nothing will happen to it, etc"".

I like the animal very much, more than I've ever liked any other animal. I don't want to wait until something fatal happens to it.

What else can I say or do to my brother-in-law, who's convinced I'm being overtly dramatic about the dog?

Honestly, at this point I even find it hard to approach the subject with him or my wife without getting heated about it.

Any advice?",29Nov2019,1

He never even told his family about me and our daughter for almost 2 years. He told me he regretted getting married (he later retracted the statement and said he was just young and stupid when he said that), honestly its stuck with me since he said it. I have been so insecure about it since then that its driving me insane. He was in the military at the time. He decided not to reenlist, I told him it wasnt a goof idea since I was due with our son at the time. So he got out. 1 week after our son was born by emergency csection. I had to find a job one week later barely able to walk. Couldnt find a job, so we had to move cross country to his nasty horrible parents house. His parents are very racist, and not accepting of me. Got in a fight with the parents because they were treating me like crap and my children. My husband never stood up for us. So my aunt flew us back home. He decided to come back to us-leaving all of our belongings that I bought throughout the years in his parents storage. He came back not very welcoming. I ended up having to take out 30k in student loans so I can rebuy everything to get us by. I was still in school working because I couldnt find a good job not being done with my degree. We then had to move in low income housing which was infested with bed bugs-again losing every thing. My husband decided to reenlist in the army. We got better with our finances etc, got my degree done. Fast forward a year later I got very very sick. Had to have my gallbladder removed-ended up with severe complications and ended dup with chronic pancreatitis. I can no longer work and am disabled.  Fast forward all this. We got into a fight 2 weeks ago and I kind of unleashed. I told him how angry I am for making us lose all of our stuff because of the decisions he made, then making me have to take out excessive amounts of student loans so we could survive which is making us struggle even more. We havent been doing well financially because I cant work. I called him a child, and that hes acting fucking weird like hes sleeping around or something.He has been distant, not very loving. It always feels like theres an awkwardness in the room the last 2 months. I feel like he isnt telling me his true feelings or hes simply not happy being with me.

People started to notice how often she was in my office and how well we got on, People started telling me I should ask her out as its obvious she likes me.

She goes quite red in the old facial region and says yes and goes on to say that she hasn't been on a proper date before (She brought the date word to the party). Overall she seemed quite chuffed.

So the next day I get a text saying that she is really sorry but she doesn't think she can go on a date with me because its a bit too soon after her break up with her ex and she is not ready yet and thinks it would be unfair on me if she feels this way, Also all the usual stuff about staying friends. I reply saying that I understand, thanks for telling me, of course we can stay friends etc. This all happened about a month ago now

Since then things have been up and down. For the first week or too we barley spoke but when she found out I had the new Pokemon she come down and things seemed like they are were back too normal, However this week in particular she has be very distant with me and I not wanting to appear needy have only been interacting with her for work purposes.

It’s just weird I just feel like I have terrible memory, I honestly just don’t know why I’ve always struggled so much in school. My parents are pretty smart, my mom graduated college, my dad own a business. My sister is in the last year of college, my brother is a senior in high school. Brother is super smart probably going to a very nice college. It’s been 2 years since I’ve graduated high school.

In high school I was just straight dumb, I just didn’t have the willpower to study. So my grades were terrible, and my parents never really knew. By the time I got to senior year of high school I had 2.4 gpa. Keep in my mind my parents thought that my grades were fine, they just believed that I was doing good. 

I was afraid that my parents would kill if they found out that I did not get accepted into college, so I made the biggest mistake of my life by saying that I got accepted into college. So that where my life just starts becoming a complete lie. So the college they think I’m going to is not too far from house, and they’ve been thinking that I’ve been going there for the past 2 years. They literally think they are paying for my schooling and everything. I have no fucking clue what to tell them. It’s also believable that I go to school because I have job during the day and they think I’m at classes during the day, but really I’m just working.

I have lied to every single fucking person in my life that I go to college. Including my best friends that I’ve been friends with since forever. I have no fucking clue what to do. Some days I just think what the hell am I doing, I am literally living in web of lies. I’m at the point where I’m too far into lie, where my parents would legit get mad at me for lying for 2 straight years. I’m afraid they’d kick me out, because I’m just living in the house for free right now. 

Also it’s weird I hate that I living my life in a web of lies. BUT, honestly I don’t completely hate my life. I have such great friends and siblings and honestly my parents are amazing too. I’m just so afraid what they’d think when they find out that I don’t go to college, and that I’ve been lying for so long. This just completely kills me inside. I have no clue where I’ll be 5 years down the road, thinking that just scares me to death.

This might sound stupid to you guys, I try to explain as much as I can, if you guys have questions just ask. But this lie just fucking kills my soul honestly, and I’m so confused about life currently:(",29Nov2019,1

I feel like I’ve completely lost hope of getting my license and being able to start my life because they refuse to prioritize it.

707,"Hi all. Long story short I suffer from very bad health anxiety and my main worry currently is having sudden cardiac arrest. My brother had Wolf Parkinson White syndrome (an electrical heart issue) which made him have increased risk for SCA. I have had 3 EKGs, 2 CTs, a chest x-ray, and lots of bloodwork done in the past couple years and everything has come out normal, but I still feel like they should run more tests. I want to do a halter monitor and echocardiogram but they haven’t referred me since my EKG looked fine. I’m 21, my resting heart rate is 70 BPM and my walking rate is 120. I don’t exercise but I’m not overweight. I have symptoms like heart palpitations, sweating, and dizziness (all symptoms my brother had with WPW). They chalk it up to anxiety but I just feel like they’re missing something. Should I push for more tests or would they have found anything worrisome on the EKG? Thanks!",29Nov2019,1

710,"Last year my girlfriend and I of two years broke up since she had found somebody else. I had later learned she cheated on me with him and with another guy while we were dating. 

Fast forward to this past September and I received a phone call from the police at her university accusing me of harassing her via text for several months after breaking up. I don’t know specifically what the texts said, but I was told they were threatening and all around disgusting. I was also told I am legally not allowed to contact her or go to her campus, not that I ever would anyway.  I definitely understand that given how we broke up that I would be prime suspect but I did not have any contact with her since we broke up and I have no idea who is actually harassing her. I did speak to the police at my university and I spoke to my ex’s dad and supposedly they don’t think it is me, idk if that’s true though. I would have liked to attempt to resolve this with my ex but that option is not available to me. Lots of things do not make sense to me, like why she hasn’t just changed her phone number, or why I wasn’t contacted by her or her parents prior to going to the police. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was sending these messages to herself, however I doubt that. 

A couple months have gone by now I haven’t received any updates on the progress of the investigation. I would like to know who is sending these messages to my ex since they made an attempt to frame me. I’m extremely uncomfortable knowing someone out there wanted to get me arrested. My parents fear that the texts may continue or get worse and I get in trouble. I’m worried having something like this around my neck could affect me when I apply for grad school or try to get a job. I’m also afraid to contact the police asking for an update because I don’t want them to suspect it is me, also I’m scared I will say the wrong thing and they’ll use it against me. I know I have nothing to hide but I’ve been told not to talk to the police unless I have to. Any advice how to resolve this situation?",29Nov2019,1

My friend (let’s call her Katherine) is really happy with my other friend (let’s call him Roman). She always talks about how perfect he is and how glad she is to be dating. Roman has always seemed to be a little less enthusiastic about dating her, but their relationship has seemed to be really steady up until today.

Two hours ago, I was texting Roman. He told me about how unhappy he was dating Katherine and how he was going to break up with her. When I asked when he was going to break up with her, he said in a few weeks. In a few weeks is her birthday and Christmas, Katherine’s favorite holiday. 

I need some advice on whether or not I should tell Katherine that Roman is going to break up with her. I feel really guilty that I know that Katherine is going to be broken up with, but I don’t want to interfere with their relationship.

Must have gone to a Texas college

Must have gone for some degree with computers

Background: it’s my senior year and I *still* haven’t decided on a college. I want to go to a college to study game development, but any career in programming I’ll probably be satisfied with. We’ve decided it’s probably best to stay instate because tuition would be cheaper than an out of state college, and preferably a 4 year college because my mom is still unable to get promotions due to going to a 2 year. Right now I’ve toured UT Arlington, and my brother went to A&amp;M so that’s always an option.

I was talking to my friend and explaining to him that I still wasn’t sure where I wanted to go, and he advised that I talk to someone who’s doing what I want to do and see where they went to college and ask them about it. Problem is, my mom is the only programmer I now and she went to a 2 year college, so I can’t really ask her. So I’m doing the next best thing and turning to strangers on the internet.

717,"Sorry it is a long one and it happened recently so I (17F) am still really crushed because of it. I am not a native english speaker so sorry for the mistakes.  

I was planning to tell my mother that I suffer from depression and anxiety for a long a time. I was planning it for like 2 months because I did not have the guts to walk up to her and just say it out loud. Yesterday I felt somewhat good, and the day just let me think about things optimistic. At this time I decided it's time to go to a psychologist because I know people who claim that it helped them. The only sentence in my head was ""you can't help to someone who does not want to heal"" and it became my inspiration note because if I can't help myself no matter how I try it is time to ask for help.

My mother is a really nice person, I can mostly talk about anything with her but because she had a really bad childhood (her parents did not treat her well and they lived in really really bad poverty) she can't understand that although I live in a really good family, I have what I need and etc. I can feel sad and depressed too but just not in the way she did years back. My depression is all about myself. I was bullied for a long time (it was a long time ago though)  and it was the start of everything. She knows it well that I can't forget about this time of my life but she does not know that I took my life sever times in my imagination, I just could not make myself up to it because I have a sister and it would mean the end of her if I would be gone.

Today I told her that I need therapy and she became really angry that I have a good life why does it not enough for me, why I am making this to myself and that I do not know what depression even means because her childhood friend was depressed and had to go the hospital because of it and she took her life in that place and SHE had depression but I do not have. She says that I am constantly smiling and happy and she would see if I would be depressed and I am just lying to myself and I should have born to a bad family because that would have make me tough and I would not feel sorry for myself when everything is fine. I am just not ready to tell her everything I feel starting from that I do not really have true friends and each day just feels so hard to me.

718,"tw: suicide, mental health

so, for context, this year my mom was pretty violently attacked by a dog which ended up causing nerve damage and infection in her leg. the antibiotics she went on caused her to get c diff which led to her having pretty severe ibs and debilitating abdominal pain. because of this attack she ended up being diagnosed with ptsd from the attack as well as from her past physically abusive relationship with my father. officially she’s been diagnosed with ptsd, mdd, anxiety disorder, and she’s experiencing suicidal thoughts frequently. 

she’s going to therapy and is seeing a psychiatrist, she’s on over 10 different medications for the physical and mental problems this attack created. so, she’s doing what she can, but she’s also recently not been able to leave the house because of fear, she hasnt been taking care of herself, and she’s been on edge or freaking out over minor things constantly. 

today she told me she drew something and she didnt remember drawing it, she said she was scared. eventually she showed me the drawing it was a drawing of her getting torn apart by crows with help me written all over it and a line that went down and had a list of things like “pain, kill, abdomen, sad, trauma” and in the corner it said “happy thanksgiving 2019....(PLEASE) help me...”

i know she’s been struggling hard but seeing how she felt on paper made my stomach drop. 

right now she’s been living alone and has no source of income. i moved about an hour away so i could go to school for the semester and my brother is pretty severely mentally ill as well so he doesn’t really understand that he needs to be here with her, or at least check in with her every so often. her phones been shut off because she cant afford the phone bill and her computer doesnt work very well, so communication when i’m away is limited. no extended family cares about what’s going on. essentially, i’m the one trying to take care of my family when i come home on the weekends. 

with being away, no one around, and her health getting worse and worse i’m afraid she’s going to commit suicide. 

i don’t know who to turn to or what to do at this point. i’m thinking about reaching out to my therapist who is the head of the practice we all go to but i don’t know what he would recommend, she’s doing everything right. 

so, what can i do?

tl;dr i’m afraid my mom is gonna kill herself and i don’t know what to do.",29Nov2019,1

There was some talk of it being fake so I fabricated text messages and included pictures of my actual cousin because I was scared of everyone finding out. 

A small while later I realised how unhealthy this all is for my life and didnt start any conversation about it. But by then the lie was so thick that I couldn't turn back. 

Having been the only guy at the time to have 'had sex' in my friendship at the time, they were all asking questions and I had to make up answers and change the topic. These were my best friends so it came up every day. 

Fast forward 4 years and all this time I've been trying to make everyone forget about it and move on. 

Now we are all older my mate called me out today for bullshitting back then and i couldn't say anything. He actually said 'at least I didnt say I fucked my cousin for attention you virgin'.

Do I deny what he is saying and claim to have fucked my cousin? Or do I face the embarrassment of pretending to have fucked my cousin?

My other two friends who still believe my story are even more friendly with him now so I think he is inches away from telling them. This would be terrible because they have been my friends all my life and they will lose all respect for me, their parents are good friends with my parents so that could really bad too.

Then I hopped back to php, sql and learned the whole package of web development, created sites, had a big eCommerce store that made like 30k. 
Developed mobile games with Unity, then I designed stuff and sold it online, some were top sellers even. 
As of today, I work with one of the biggest companies in my country as the marketer on a few mutual projects.

Seems like it’s kind of shady, but I could really use at least an extra $200/month to cover my basic expenses (I only make around 1200 a month, but I need at least 1400 to cover the most basic expenses) and this seems less time consuming and much more immediate than taking on a part time job. I’m also young and fit, so the physical part might not bother me so much, but I do work at an active job. Would donating interfere with my general life by making me lightheaded? How does donating plasma affect the person? What is the process like? How is the money owed calculated? 

Even if I have enough to cover basic expenses, it would be really nice to have some disposable income to spend on things I like such as strawberries or art supplies.

I just ignore her, cause I'm an introvert and socially anxious, and pretend that I don't care, but she keeps doing it. But if I were to talk to her, like on topic of what we would do after finishing school or borrowing something, u know something casual, she talks back to me totally fine, as if nothing happened.

734,"I have spent the last year doing a language exchange with an ESL student. She has become one of my best friends. She is going back home next week. We hung out a couple days ago so I could help her study for a speaking test and because it was probably the last time we could meet up because she has family friends to say goodbye to early next week before she leaves.

Our goodbye was quick because we were talking outside her test room, and she got called in. So it was a quick hug, ""goodbye"", and we parted ways. We have already talked about keeping in touch, and we both really want to and plan to stay friends, but this is really hard on me. I have never been good at goodbyes in the first place, but this has been one I've been dreading for the whole semester. 

I've cried texting her, when we said goodbye, and she broke me with an early Christmas present where she wrote the ""the ones who love us never truly leave us"" HP quote in my card.

She's assured me that everything will be okay, and we'll see each other again, but I can't seem to get over this. If I get accepted to be an exchange student, I'll see her there, we want to text, send letters, video chat (possibly introduce me to her friends that have always asked about me), worst comes to worst, we (while both being single) have already invited each other to our weddings, so we at least have that. 

If her flight wasn't leaving at 5 am the day before a lab exam, and if I could actually drive (not in high school, just still have my learner's because I'm freaked out by driving), I'd send her off at the airport. But that's not happening- cabs are too expensive, and I'm not waking up my parents who both work that morning to drive me.

I'm seriously truggling to get over the fact that she's going. I've literally just been typing this out while crying in the hallway on campus. Today is when we'd normally meet, except she has a mandatory grad party to go to, and I think knowing that I'm not going to meet up regularly with her again has just made me depressed today.

737,"My landlord started putting traps out about 2 weeks to catch stray cats. They're the type of trap that an animal walks into and the door closes behind them. I love cats and I hate to see them trapped. I'm also certain they'll be taken to the dog pound where they'll be put to sleep. It also bothers me to no end that people don't spay and neuter their pets, which would prevent this problem. The issue is that it's freezing cold and has been raining a lot here lately. The first cat he caught was a kitten. I noticed it about 5am when i took my dog out to potty. It was cold that day and supposed to rain that night and by about 2pm the kitten was still in the trap so i released it and reset the trap so it wouldn't be obvious. I don't want to get in trouble with my landlord. The next day the trap caught the kitten's mama. This time I waited until 6pm to release the cat. It seemed by that time that the maintenance man would be off work for the day and I wasn't going to leave the cat all night in the wet and cold. Today there is another cat in the trap. It's been there for 10 hours at least. It's drizzling and cold and supposed to storm tonight. I thought about calling the landlord to let them know but if they don't come get it today I'm going to release it and then they'll probably suspect that it was me. I even thought about pretending like I hate cats so they won't suspect me.  However my apartment is one of only 2 apartments from which the trap is visible. I'm pretty sure I heard the maintenance man cursing after I released the second cat. I've set traps before to catch raccoons but I always checked them at least once a day, more if the weather was bad. I think it's extremely cruel to leave an animal trapped in the elements. I'm afraid if I keep releasing them I'll get caught and could jeopardize my rental. I've tried to find homes, and the humane society won't take them. Any ideas? I'm not going to call the police over this.",29Nov2019,1

744,"Im not sure if this is the right place to post this, but me and my wife are at a loss. Our 5 year old has been increasingly stubborn and hard headed about doing things we ask her to do such as clean her room after she brings out her toys. 

I dont want to take away her toys because while that does solve the problem of her leaving them out, it doesn't seem to teach her anything. When I took away toys before, i explained why I was taking them and told her that if she can straighten up her behavior then she will get them back. She was okay for a bit and then went straight back to refusing to clean them up.

750,"So I'm currently a 21 years old and a junior in college. The fact that I'm in my third year is making this an incredibly hard decision because I've already gone so far and invested so much of my time and money. But I'm seriously at the lowest point of my entire life and I'm pretty sure I simply don't have the mental strength to last another 2 and a half years (I have to take 5 years). For 3 years I've been struggling with depression and crippling social anxiety that has resulted in my current state of complete apathy towards life. I have no friends and I've been suicidal lately, but I really don't want to be. I want to regain the enthusiasm I used to have for life. But college is an absolutely fucking miserable experience and I hate my life so much. Engineering classes are fucking awful and I don't even know if I want to be an engineer. 

I have no idea what id do if I ended up dropping out, but I have a huge amount of experience in the service industry and can easily find a serving job making roughly 15-25 an hour depending on the restaurant. My last job at Olive garden I averaged about 20 an hour with tips, which was actually amazing. I could do that until I've paid off my current student loan debt and finally be financially independent from my parents who have been helping me pay tuition. From there I have no idea. Maybe I will end up going back to college or maybe I'll never want to go back.

759,"Thanksgiving has come and gone, and after a very weird family meeting, I’m left feeling very eerie about the following thoughts: 

My uncle Ken was remarried 3 years ago. With his first wife, he had my two cousins (Tanner &amp; John) . Jessica has 1 daughter from a precious relationship (Mary). Since the new marriage, he has become a completely different person. My Nana (his mom) has noticed such a shift in his personality (from getting belligerently drunk and, ‘borrowing’ over $500 of my uncle H’s money on his wedding night, missing holidays / mother’s / birthdays, not allowing my Nana to see the two boys, causing very unnecessary tension between him &amp; the first wife - who was adored by our family, and so on). The boys have shared custody with the parents.

The new wife Jessica is very odd. She is highly sexual in nature speaking and behaving very inappropriately towards anyone and everyone, which very clearly makes the rest of my family very uncomfortable. She sits on Ken’s lap at the table, is constantly rubbing and touching him, saying suggestive things.

At dinner tonight, she was telling everyone how Tanner has been an awful teenager in their house (taking extra long showers, claiming that he told Mary to “come on in” on him in the shower, being too sexual himself). That was a huge ordeal, with her claiming him to be a sick pervert. She puts him down, and treats him like he’s disgusting.


She claimed that one night around Christmas last year John had gotten “egg nog drunk”, and had managed to mistake which room was his, ending up in Mary’s bed naked, and unable to wake up or leave. He doesn’t remember it, and was visibly uncomfortable and confused when she brought it up. He’s very soft spoken, and barely said a word.

My Nana has told me additional stories including one where they went to a pool party with all of that family. Jessica was wearing a very revealing swimsuit, trying to climb on Tanner’s back, and play with him in the water. 

She made a comment to my grandparents about a romantic getaway they had for their 25th anniversary, and was asking questions regarding “sex swings”, making them wildly uncomfortable. 

She let Tanner take a sip of her cocktail (Jameson &amp; soda water if it matters), to which he responded that it “tasted like medicine” and that all alcohol “even wine” tastes like medicine. Now he’s 16, so I get that it’s not absurd to let him try a sip at home in a holiday, but just very off putting for them to normalize it.

Ken, Jessica, and Tanner were “wrestling” in the living room, trying to tackle each other, and give each other “purple nurples” - okay not necessarily outrageous on its own, but with all of this context...

Ken &amp; Jessica live in Chicago and I have seen countless photos of them on Facebook partying and looking absolutely trashed. She made a joke stating  “big pharma will need to make a new pill to let me live through the rest of the teenage years with these kids”. 

I may be looking into this behavior too far, but often predators have been known to groom their victims. 

Inappropriate touching, putting them down, instilling guilt, placing blame. I’m extremely concerned about the possibility of them being drugged? I don’t believe she would or could fully rape either of them, but it doesn’t have to be that to be considered sexual assault. I think she may be preying on his sexual vulnerability for his age, and the lack of sexual boundaries with their relationship. 

Women predators go overlooked so easily, and I can’t help but think if this was a man, we would have already called the police. 

Everyone has thought this is completely eerie.

771,"I (17F) think I'm a lesbian. I already knew I was at least bi/pansexual (I use bi if people ask bc it's more recognizable but either one works), but now I don't know about guys.

Also, sorry if this is like...weird?? Idk who to ask about this anymore bc my (very accepting) friends say it's whatever but I feel like I need to know myself right now even if it's just by using a label.

I've had one boyfriend (19M now) and I'll admit (shamefully) that it was LDR and online. He was really attractive ngl, and I crushed on him briefly, but whenever he would say/do sexual stuff it felt really uncomfortable and just...not right. But I really did like him. We didn't work out for other reasons (aka he was an asshole and I couldn't handle his mood swings), but idk...I feel like if we had met in person it would have been terrifying for me. Then recently this dude at my school kissed me (tried for lips but I turned lol). I think it was mostly bc he didn't ask (I was assaulted when I was 8 by an older girl who forced me to kiss her so I'm really REALLY touchy about people not asking), but even though I enjoyed talking to him and thought he was decently cute there just wasn't any spark and I was, again, pretty uncomfortable. Other than that I've never kissed a guy. But when I see a hot guy walking by I'll be all *ooh he's finnnne* and blush...the idea of actually, ya know, doing anything sexual with a guy is kind of off-putting; it's like I think of it sometimes but if the opportunity came up I don't think I could take it. 

2ish years ago though I kissed some girls (it was a hoe phase dw bout it) and it was, like, natural. I felt comfortable and confident. But I don't turn all gushy and whenever I see a cute girl I'll *look* but I don't really think of them romantically since I assume they're just straight and the majority of my friends are straight girls so my brain doesnt even flip that switch. I'm not envious either I think I'm pretty enough. And one time this (super hot!!!) girl I kissed asked me out too those 2ish yrs ago and I said no. I still don't know if it was because I didn't feel romantically toward her or if I was (and still am) a closeted little rainbow rat. If a cute, nice girl walked up to me right now and asked me out (romantic stuff and all) I would probably say yes without hesitation. 

Do I just need to find a dude and a chick and compare? I think my biggest issues are that one of my best friends is a lesbian and she's known since...before I met her freshman year. I feel like if I was 100% a homo bromo I would know already? Plus the thing where I was assaulted. I never really got counseling and it was never addressed (I might have downplayed what happened bc I was afraid of getting in trouble for some reason so I dont even know if my parents remember it). Am I just tryna, like, compensate for...something? Is that making me afraid of intimacy with dudes? I feel confident identifying as gay/lesbian, but what if I'm not? I dont want to mislable myself--and as a typical teenager I do love and cherish my labels so I feel like I have to have one. Is there like a way to find out. I dress more like a femme and I don't ""act"" gay (is that even a thing), so I have no idea what I am anymore.

I never did anything very serious to him. But I got my friends to dislike him. I never told any lies about him just the truth. He was a Mildly autistic boy who followed me around break time, and no it wasn’t because he wanted to be my friend. He knew a secret of mine, and to be honest even after everything this kid has been through. I was jealous of him and I know it wasn’t his fault and he didn’t do anything wrong. But I was so mad the only thing I wanted in life that was taken from me before I could even truly have it. He had. In the past I had nothing against him I mean we weren’t friends but we just didn’t talk. But then It all changed when one day my mother got pregnant. But the baby didn’t make it. Then just a couple months after the baby died. His mom got pregnant except his brother did survive, and was born a beautiful baby might i add. I was fine with it at first I was happy for him and his family of course. His family was now a family of four boys. Then one day I just snapped when I saw all of my friends ditch me to be with him. I wanted to know why so I followed them. Then I saw the him bragging about his new brother. I wanted that. I know this makes me sound so terrible. But THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ME TOO. I was going to be the one that would be able to tell others how much I loved my sister. What they did today. What there first word was. So everyday when I saw how happy he was with his new brother I wanted to cry. I couldn’t even tell him not to bring up the baby around me because after my sister died my mother said to keep it a secret. So how could I tell him. There he was holding his beloved brother in his arms, as I was crying I a corner of the bathroom. Ever since that I teased him about how he followed me. I also got my friends to make fun of him calling him a stalker, and I also got them to tease him for his mild autism. Then when he was around I tried to make it look like I was sticking up for him telling them to stop after a little while. I know how terrible this makes me. I feel so bad to today, eventually I stopped doing this when I graduated and left the school. I’m in high school today just started grade nine, and I feel so terrible. HE DIDN’T DO ANYTHING WRONG. How could I be so cruel. He was just a kid simply talking about his brother who he loved, and I was the jealous jerk. I never physically hurt him or anything but I feel so bad today.

781,"To start off with, we had been dating for 8 months, and it was my first ever relationship and his second long term one. His first had ended explosively and had been widely regarded as extremely toxic due to *his* ex, who I'll call Abbey. However, he himself has a lot of issues, especially regarding anger.

For example,

1. He would often blow up at me whenever I made a mistake, calling me ""baby retard"" or ""spoiled"" or yelling at me for crying. One of his common things was to say that I had never had any real problems so there was no reason for me to be upset. He would also frequently tell me that my depression was fake and stupid and that I had nothing to be depressed about. However, this issues only occurred when he was very angry. My friends despised him for this, and still do. In the later months of our relationship, I hid the fact that we were dating from them. He had the mindset of ""eye for an eye"" and that if he was hurting, then I should be too.
2. On a few occasions, I caught him texting Abbey early on. I didn't think much of it, just reminded him that he said he had no contact with her. She had told the entire school that they were still dating and having sex whenever he and I initially got together. However, he insisted that this wasn't true and that they had broken up a year ago. Most people labelled her crazy and moved on, including me. But in July, when I was in another state, one of my friends coincidentally drove by a restaurant to see him having a meal with her on the patio. When I confronted him, he lied, but then ultimately broke down to say that she had wanted to meet up to apologize and he felt he couldn't tell me or I would break down. Admittedly, I had made a big deal of her in the past and was very insecure about her and their relationship. Soon after, his location showed he was in her apartment complex (yes, I feel dirty for checking), and when I brought that up he turned his location off and berated me (probably fair) and said that his family friend lived there as well.
3. We were long distance in the end and he forbade me from having male friends and going to any parties (which is probably fair). He also exploded when I told him an old friend was visiting (probably fair too, as the friend used to have a crush on me).

Now these issues paint him in a terrible light and that's all that my friends see when they look at our relationship. However, I know that he went through the worst. He was frequently beaten, told he wasn't good enough, etc... And he knew he had issues that he needed to work on and resolve. He wanted to seek treatment and, in his words, ""get better."" He loved me and wanted to be together forever.

Now I feel as though I abandoned him and downplayed his issues. Maybe I was at fault as well. I was very insecure and extremely clingy, especially after discovering that he met up with his ex. He sacrificed a lot to be with me in the beginning and when we were long distance in the end, he forgave me when I went to a party.

There are tons of success stories in relationships like this. Stories of people working through their issues to have long, beautiful relationships.

Did I give up too soon? Did I overreact to certain things? He tells me I was just as at fault as him and I'm starting to believe that, due to my high expectations.

I just want an outside perspective, as I tend to be overdramatic.

Tl;dr: I left my boyfriend because of his anger issues and now I feel guilty because I was at fault too and I abandoned him when he needed me most. Should I contact him and give it another shot at discussion?",29Nov2019,1
782,"**DAD:**

Anyways, listen l have a feeling  you want to answer my calls or messages. I Think I have a good idea of what's going on here. I believe its Rachels opinion of me. I say this because I got a message from her via messenger a while back. The message was that I was being more or less ungrateful for not accepting your invitation. She called it a ""second chance"" I understand that she is your girl and she loves you and csres for you deeply and that she looking after your best interest.   She doesn't want to see you hurt and I respect that. See everyone is in titled to there own opinions. I hold no ill feelings towards her. But I do have things to say in regards to this if you don't mind. First she needs to get her facts straight. I lived with this for 20years and it wasn't easy. The only way I could live with it was to  completely detach myself from this mentality. She made a statement that you are giving me a second chance. Okay, call it that if you want to. Truth be known I didn't get a first chance. You both have been told a story that fit your mothers agenda and lacks in facts. If you both would like the real un edited version of events then ask me. I was there and lived every minute of this event. You have absolutely no idea what I have gone through also I'm not the only one who has suffered this. You my son have been put through something that you should have been put threw. I accept full responsibility for my choices but you need to understand fully and truthfully  everything that went on behind closed doors.I feel you are intitled to the full truth. I am intitled to tell you this and why do I say this? We both are the true victims in this. So, if you want things to make sence and finally get some closure then I will be glad to close this chapter for the both of us.. As far as the way I have handled this since I extended the olive branch. Well it could have been better. This I will admit and take full responsibility for my actions. I would like to add something to this if I may. I didn't see the events unfolding the way it did. I couldn't focus on you or myself for that matter. I was dealing with a very bad situation and it took everything out of me physically, mentally and spiritually. Im still not 100% and there are other factors in this that you are unaware of. So before you both want to pass judgment then I want a far trial.. I didn't plan for this to happen. I want to give us a fair chance and to be able to do this without interference for the first time in decades. So I am here! Let's do this!  Love always! Your Dad...

Yeah you see me

No worries

Do you understand! I got it..

Talk to me

Look im not smashing on you or your girl.. She is entitled to her opinion.. I need to set the record straight here and you should listen to what I have to say.. But whenever you are ready!

**ME:**

If you want a fair trial then you probably shouldn't blame my wife for any of this...AT ALL.  And honestly, how dare you... one of the few people encouraging me to give this a chance is her and thanks to her relationship being repaired with her dad...she felt hopeful about us. Yet you just made her the reason for our problems and why I didn't answer and yet she literally did nothing but try to help. Her message to you was strictly to say how you have an opportunity to do something different and you're pissing it away. She was simply looking out for me. Something you haven't done in many years. And as far as what I need to understand for ""truth""....I don't need to understand what went on behind closed doors. Your beef with my mom was not and is not my problem or fault. That was your business. What I needed was a dad. Yet instead of finding a dad...I've only found excuses.",29Nov2019,1

786,"I don’t want to go back to college I just can’t. I’m dreading the drive and returning to that tireless grind day in and day out. That awful town that’s so foreign from my own way of life. The shitty job of being an RA where it’s thankless and never ending as part of the department that couldn’t care less about me. I love my friends and coworkers but I put so much into them, my support and love and affection and care, that I run myself dry. 

I sometimes wonder if I’m going to class just because it’s what I’m supposed to do or if I actually care.

I don’t want to move home, this place is so small and dying and there’s nothing here, add on the fact that I don’t have anywhere to stay considering both of my parents have moved and I don’t have a bedroom to call my own, nonetheless I wouldn’t want to. Being back home, able to be free and drive without a care, explore for hours, ditch my car and walk trails I’ve never found before, it’s so nice and refreshing and freeing. 

I don’t want to go back to being isolated, both on campus and in that town. West Virginia is such a backwards way of life compared to my own and I don’t understand it. The mountains enclose you and feel claustrophobic. 

I’m so deeply unhappy and I distract myself from that through my friends and movies and video games and I just let that discontent bottle up and hide away and it’s only when I can finally get a small taste of the life I want where I truly realize just how much I actually and honestly hate my life. 

I feel like the only thing stopping me from actually just taking my car, some hiking gear, and withdrawing whatever money I have, is the fact that my parents would be left with my debt. I wouldn’t miss their connection, I’m not close with any of them (parents and step parents), and even my friends I would be fine leaving so long as I know they’re safe. 

What the fuck am I doing with my life?

It’s going to take everything in me not to just drive away tomorrow to some town I don’t know.",29Nov2019,1
788,"Ever since I've been able to walk, my dad has always loved hugging, tickling, and wrestling. He would constantly do this with me and my sister whenever we hung out with him. This alone isn't anything too abnormal, many parents play with their kids, however I have always felt like he took it too far. Now, when I say this know that I am in no means being untruthful when I say my dad is a heavy person and a little arrogant.  He never likes being corrected, and one time flipped out on me for asking him to throw away egg shells instead of putting then back in the carton. He is obese weighing 300 to 400 pounds, and has been this way my whole childhood. It's important to note that despite his size, he has always been stronger than me. Whenever he would hug me or wrestle with me I always felt trapped. I was suffocated and he wouldn't let me go no matter how hard I struggled or told him to stop. It made me feel like my objections meant nothing to him, and he thought the whole situation was just funny. There have been other times in my life as well he told me to listen to him, and he always new better.

 As I grew up and became a teenager, he continued still do this. My dad loved to play video games and watch TV in the living room, but would always sit in front of the TV instead of the couch. When I would walk past to go to the kitchen, sometimes he would grab my leg and make me trip, or pull me down so he could wrestle with me or tickle me. There was never enough space to get around because of how small our house is. I always hated it so much and told him such, but even as a older teen he wouldn't listen to me. I would sometimes climb over the couch just so I wouldn't have to walk past him. 

I know this all sounds a little silly and extreme, but this has made an impact on me. It has made hugging people a challenge and I can't lay on my stomach without feeling like I'm choking. I had to force myself to like hugs from my friends because I used to get a sickening feeling from it. Right now, I am currently 18 years old and my parents are divorced. Due to some other problems in me and my dad's relationship, I don't communicate with him at the moment. The reason I'm posting this now is because out of nowhere I had a nightmare that he was back in our house and he tried wrestling me again. The dream ends with him suffocating me and I woke up feeling choked. I have mentioned this before to others, but none of my friends and family. People tend to say I am over reacting a bit about the situation. I just really want to know what everyone thinks. I personally just don't get why it's still affecting me now, and maybe just hearing what you guys think will help. Please be honest, and thanks for reading.",29Nov2019,1

Money: I can't find a single damn job because my country, which is pretty fucking picky when hiring. ""We're looking for young people BUT WAIT, you also must have minimum 1 year experience"". The thing is, how do you exactly want me to get that 1 year experience if you aren't fucking hiring me? Talk about logic...

I need money not only to help my family, but also for personal stuff (I've always wanted to get a grade but since I can't afford it...). Also, I must add that I'm placing my CV almost everywhere, even after being updated.

Independence: Turns out that I'm kinda sick of my family and I just want to feel free for once. Not only that, but I also have been wanting to go abroad, staying and making a living out there. And as the time passes, the stronger the feeling is.

Asexual?: This may sound personal to you, but I can't find anyone to ask this. Basically – I don't know if it's because of my situation, but I've never found myself into someone. I feel pretty much empty. This causes me to be even more depressed as I've always lacked of interest for a relationship...

She works a traditional 9-5 M-F so we have trouble seeing each other. I took the job without confirming the schedule so that was a mistake on my part. 

We have dealt with the bad schedules for the last few years together but this one has been the worst so far and there is no end in sight. It’s a seniority based system so I basically have to wait until someone in my department quits to move to a better schedule. I’m also just tired of having to take off to go to special events that normal people can just go to after work. 

I’ve only been at the job for about 5 weeks and every day I dread getting up and leaving. I think it’s time I try to get a 9-5 somewhat related to my field even if it means a pay cut.

schooled by abusive father (and anxiety ridden mother, to whom I sympathize with) away from home (normally we go to school, but we went on a ""vacation"" against literally everyone but my father's wishes). I kept the previous months busy wrapping my head around new info because I spent most of my time at home living on a different floor and didn't hear what stuff my father was saying, and had previously gotten manipulated into thinking that my mother was the fault (I pray for forgiveness for having done this, the poor woman had enough to deal with with only my father berating her), and trying to help my depression.

801,"Some background: My husband (23M) and I (22F) moved into the house 2 years ago with 2 roommates before we got married (We only recently got married at the end of October). Over time they left and we allowed my brother (20M) move in and his sister (19F) and her BF (21M) move in with us so they could get on their feet with a cheaper rent that what is average for our area. The sister and her BF took over for another roommate of ours that has since gone into the military. I made sure to lay everything out expense wise before anyone moved in so that way nobody would be surprised by expenses when the time came. I also have 3 calendars with the dates of each bill and the amount, 2 in the house and 1 online. My brother pays on time for bills and so does the BF, but she has only paid on-time a handful amount in the 7 months they have been with us. She also can't hold a steady job. Everyone does their fair share of cleaning, except her, who says that she is either ""too busy"" or ""forgot about it"" or was ""sick."" We have confronted her, nicely, about cleaning up after herself and at the very least warning us about late payments.

809,"Hello reddit, I am concerned that my son will be alone his entire life after me and my husband are gone. He is 21 years old, still lives with us but attending community college, however we live in a very rural area and his college is 2 cities away. He has been there for almost 4 years (due to poor advising) and doesn’t attend any clubs and has made no friends since moving to the area 6 years ago. When the various breaks in between semesters occur, he either never leaves the house or goes to a gun range 5 cities away and is gone the whole day. He always says that he was only at the gun range the entire day and did nothing else. When I ask him if he ever makes conversation there since everyone there has a common interest, he always says “I’m there to shoot, not to make idle chatter. Plus how can you do that with loud rifles going off all the time?”. I know that when me and my husband are gone, he will have no one because we’ve stopped talking to our extended family due to some serious infighting that happened a few weeks prior to ceasing communication with them.

I know that he has a steam account and still has zero friends on there and I found his reddit account and discovered that he has made zero comments in the 3 years that it has existed. And yes I know for a fact that he has used it recently because of his internet history. When I asked him if he’s ever had any friends on steam he said “I did… once. Everyone on there are just a bunch of assholes and are not worth the time.”

To be totally honest, I think my son has developed some serious trust issues because he made a statement saying if I say “that sometimes people who you think are your friends will betray you then they aren’t a true friend.” then what’s the point in wasting time on someone who may betray or hurt you. He’s also said “why make friends when without fail friendships fade away over time. It’s pointless to do so if that is always the end result.” He has similar views when it comes to forming relationships as well. I know that the amount of isolation he subjects himself to bothers him a lot even though he will deny it, sometimes you can see it written all over his face.  

How can I possibly help him? I don’t want him to be so alone for the rest of his life.",29Nov2019,1
810,  So I am going to explain this the best I can.  Been with my wife for 15 years and we have been married for four years now.  About 8 years into our relationship she dumped me because she felt trapped and didn't experience enough of the single life.  Literally the day after she dumped me she slept with another man.  We stayed broken up for about six months during those six months she had partners and I started seeing someone regularly.  We got back together and eventually married a year later.  After being married for two years she left me again.  During our seperation my wife became basically a prostitute to pay her bills as I was always the bread winner in our relationship.  After being seperated for a year we started contacting each other again.  For the past six months we have basically been a married couple except we live apart.  I spend days at her place and she spends days at my place.  The only stipulation of us staying together is she wants an open marriage.  She sees another guy one or two days a month an I was seeing another woman the same amount of time.  Now I am no longer seeing the other woman and my wife keeps pressuring me to find someone else.

812,"Hi

I don't know if that fits here but I think I forgot how to cry.

During my childhood I was beaten and talked down to a lot by my parents so I learned how to lie, not show emotions or show the one I need to get away from any interactions with my parents.

But now this ""skill"" is hurting me more than serving me. Here's why.

Recently a friend of mine came from the other side of France to visit me( yes I live in France, no it's not as fun as you think, no I don't live in Paris). That friend happens to be a girl and I have feelings for her. I managed to tell her and she said it wasn't reciprocated, it's fine I'm a grown man I can take it. In comes another friend that she didn't know before coming to visit me, not even a week after they meet they're together. So in less than a week I got friend zoned and she got with one of my friends that I basically introduced to her. And now I feel like she's ignoring me like she doesn't even wanna be friends with me anymore.

I thought to myself that's fine I'll get over it let's sleep this though like most of my pains and that'll be that. Well I was wrong it's now more than a week since they're together and my mental health is just spiraling down faster and faster. 


At one point I just wanted to cry but I couldn't I just literally couldn't only thing that made me cry was onions and sharp physical pain (no self harm just pulling nose hair and things like that to produce tears) but those cries didn't help I need to cry real emotional tears but I just can't I've tried for a few days now but I just can't. Last time I remember crying was when I was 13 and my cat died. It's been almost 9 years I haven't cried I just endured and walled off the pain and now I want to let it all out, to really deal with it. I can feel myself going down and I don't want to reach the end, last time one of my emotions exploded it was anger and I don't even remember what I did but I scared the living shit  out of everyone and got myself into some big troubles, now I have very good anger management but if my sadness is too much and exploded like my anger back then I don't know what stupid thing I would do.

So I'm asking advise on how to deal with 9 years of sadness sealed behind a thick emotional wall, how to deal with my current situation as well I don't even know what I want to do in that situation, and, maybe the one that'll fix both, how to cry I feel like I've tested everything but nothing worked.


Also sorry for my English as I said I'm French, sorry for formating I'm on mobile and sorry if it doesn't fit here.


Anyways thank you for any help you can give and if you can't help thank you for reading, writing that already helped a bit",29Nov2019,1

815,"I’ll try to keep this short and to the point. We have a friend who’s brother likes to come over our house. He’s 20, but very nice and kinda immature, so he gets along with our 16 year olds. The problem is, when he comes over he won’t leave, he’ll stay for 3-4 days until he has to go back to work. He luckily lives 45 minutes away so he doesn’t do this very often and most of the time we say we’re busy. Our kids like hanging out with him, but 3 or 4 days in a row is a little much.

816,"Me and my 2 roommates have been rooming together for about 5 months now, and have signed a one year lease contract. This isn't my first rodeo, I've lived by myself for about 2 years before this back when I was out of town for college, but my roomates are new to this. One of my roommates is my best friend, for about 4 years and going on. He's been talking about how he is depressed, and just sad to be alone living, and he's a huge extrovert. Although this is occurring to him, he's actually seeking professional help with his mental problems, and understand that he is gonna tough it out since it's just apart of growing up and moving on. The other roommate is one of our friends, not too close but a good friend of ours. The reason for his leaving is for somewhat the same reasons. 

He admits to being excited about first moving in, but has started to feel anxious and depressed about being away from his family. He also says how he has to drive far away to visit his family often, and how he doesn't get to see his friends often since its far from where he used to live. He didn't text me, as he texted my best friend first about wanting to move out. He's pretty much a hermit and keeps to himself, and he does have anxiety and maybe other problems. 

I don't really know what to do or what to say to him to convince him to stay, as leaving will be a huge problem especially on our credit. Even if he did leave we would have to find another roommate to replace his spot. Any advice I can give him? I feel like he is still holding on to other things and is afraid to be by himself and grow.",29Nov2019,1

820,"Today I got yelled at 2 or 3 times by my parents. 1st time I got yelled at for feeding my puppy a piece of cooked pasta, even though yesterday I fed it to him and I got yelled at. My dad said “we need that for pasta salad” even though it was a tiny bit of one piece of pasta. I said “are we that broke that we can’t feed the dog 1 piece of pasta?” My dad said “no, I never said that” I said “you always act like we’re poor but you buy things all the time” my mom then sent me to my room.  Next I got yelled at for eating an orange in my moms rental car. My dad said “why did you have to bring an orange into the car?” My mom said “they’ll make us pay if the car gets stained” I said “yeah right, and orange peel will stain black seats” they both said “it will!” I said “all I had to eat was a sandwich” I still got yelled at. Next we were in bath and body works and I said I want something. My mom pulled the “Its almost Christmas card” I said “please, why not a lotion or a hand sanitizer, it’s cheap.” My dad said “stop asking for things, we don’t have enough money” I said “for what a $1.75 hand sanitizer” my mom “said hand me that spray” and I said “no” my mom said “then get out of my way” I said “wth that is so rude, you’re acting like your the most important person ever and I’m just your peasant slave” my mom said we are leaving and I started crying. My dad yelled at me because I am acting like I am 2. I am frustrated over this. I just wanted a $1.75 hand sanitizer. Crying was an instinct, it was in the moment, the only thing I could do was cry. They never apologize for these things. I am also 12 so hormones happen and I get angry. I told them that and they said “well we never acted like that” and it just made me madder. They are sort of mean and strict and harsh on me sometimes. I sometimes watch TV shows on Disney or whatever that have families in them and the kids are not yelled at very often. They have such nice lives where their parents never yell at them and their parents are nice to them when they’re sad.

The spa wants me back now that they’re opening back up, and I’d love to go back. The only problems:
1. I was offered a supervisory position, which fell through. 
2. Someone from another department, with no experience, is being considered for the position. 
3. I’ll only make $8 an hour. 
The supervisors have tried to give me 60 hours a week, and blamed me that I got overtime. Then, they lied about when i told them my last day at the clubhouse is. 

Keep in mind, this company has screwed me over NUMEROUS times. Also, I am constantly bullied and harassed at this company. 

I’ve just been hired for a new job, with 25 hours a week and starting at $9 an hour, which is almost exactly what I’m looking for. The only problem is that I’m afraid to leave, just in case something falls through at the new job. Also, I’m afraid it won’t be all I’ve hoped for.

822,"First time posting and this is a bit of a long post but I need some advice. I joined a discord group back in the spring that was related to an anime i watched. we had a lot of fun and i became an admin. I thought everything was dandy...up until recently where i confessed i was a furry. Or at least enjoyed furry things like fursuits and etc. This is also a good time to mention that I have a history of mental health problems and anxiety runs in my family. Anyways..
  
I said I was a furry and this one girl who was also an admin said that it upset her. I said that it was okay and I was used to people not liking it. She then stopped talking to me and so have the other admins. I ended up leaving temporarily for a different reason involving my depressed state and the situation was not helping. I tried to send some of the admins messages and only one seemed to be relatively on good terms with me. The other would just give really bland answers and the girl stopped talking to me. I gave them updates and sent them memes, but I got nothing in return. 
  
This didnt help my anxiety as it only grew thinking of what I could have possibly done wrong. I was kept up at night thinking about it. I talked to my therapist and got resources that helped me out. I ended up feeling better so I went back to the server, which was today.
  
Lets just say I was not welcomed back at all besides a “yo” and a “hey” and absolutely nothing from the admins. I was also put into the non admin role on discord. These people were very eccentric people and I just got brushed off. 

I have been super stressed. The admins were my best friends and now ever since i confessed I was a furry, They act like strangers. I have a theory that they put me in the non admin chat to talk about me, since they do that to people often. All theories aside, lets just say, I miss my friends. What should I do?? This happened to me last time except they used and abused me. I still have trauma from it. I really dont want this to happen again. As it really fucked me up mentally. What should I do?

824,"I was brought up very catholic and was taught that virginity is the greatest gift you can give to a man. One that will never make him let you go. I held on to these beliefs until one drunken night at 24 ( 3 years ago) I lost my virginity to an ex. 
He wasn’t the right person for me but having been avoiding relationships for so long I fell for the wrong person. 

I had one more sexual partner in between because I thought ‘ f it ‘ my virginity is gone now. 
Fast forward to a year later I meet my now boyfriend. We have been together for coming up to two years and things are serious. Very early on in the relationship he suddenly expressed that he hates that other men have had me and wishes he was my one and only sexual partner. He quickly apologised a lot and has never brought that up since. 
The problem is that, because of the things I was fed growing up, those words have stuck with me. And I’ve never been able to truly let them go. It makes me feel so bad that I wasn’t able to give him my virginity. Even though I’m now 27 it still haunts me. 

The bit that sucks the most for me is that his ex of four years lost her virginity to him and he has in the past said that ‘ had they been older things would have been different and that they were too young ‘. It makes me wonder if in his head he’s wishing he never let her go and I’m just here as second best. Whenever I’ve brought that up he says that’s not true and I’m just being insecure but I can’t help feeling this way and to be honest, since his comment at the start of our relationship I’ve never been able to put my past to rest properly. I guess what I’m asking is how do I move on from here? Is he secretly pining over her and I’m second best because I wasn’t a virgin like she was?",29Nov2019,1

Hey guys, I’m in a strange situation

About a year ago I had an awful breakup and an even worse friend breakup. Like I’m talking worst I’ve ever been through. It took me about 9 months to move on from it and I was relieved that since I had a new group of friends and a new girlfriend who treats me awesome I would never have to face that painful chapter of my life again.

Until my best friend became super tight with my ex a little before I got over her.

I would be ok with my best friend being tight with my old group and my ex if they didn’t still treat me like garbage and he didn’t keep destroying boundaries. While he was becoming friends with them he suggested I do whatever I could to mend things with them since it was “my issue” so I reached out to apologize to everyone. Only one person answered and that’s fine. Ex and I briefly became friends again but I realized I wasn’t ready so we stopped. Our junior year in college starts and he becomes closer with them than ever. He goes to parties with them, hangs with them all the time and barely makes time for me. So after discussing it with him he suggests I try and be as nice as possible to them to fix things.

We throw a housewarming party, I let them come but they leave before I show up. They try to argue that I “beat my current girlfriend” despite 0 history of any kind of domestic abuse because of something they heard. This offends my girlfriend. Best friend stays quiet. They constantly say “You should live with our close friend instead of OP next year”. I get sucker punched in a club because a guy thought I flicked him off, friend jumps in and defends me, but when I need someone to take me to the hospital we argue and he leaves to sleep with a girl who’s in my old group while I Uber to the hospital.

Things finally came to a head after I notice the extent of how close him and my ex are. I decide we need to talk to her in person so we can figure out how to be amicable since we keep running into eachother. She turns it into a 3 hour session of how it’s “my problem, it’s all my fault, and I was an awful boyfriend” to which I continually apologize and explain my reasoning. She then tells the old group I’m still an asshole after agreeing to help us. Halloween comes around, we’re at the same party, my best buddy gets blacked out and my ex who’s not blacked out makes out with him, to which my girlfriend takes issue with, my ex notices and makes out with him harder. My other friend split them up and I make sure my friend gets home safely.

My friend and I ended up mending things, though my ex said “She felt bad for nothing and it’s not even a problem”, but I just wanted him to show me he could put me first instead of her for once. He does well for about a week, then goes to her 21st after I asked him not to because her being around so much made the day more sensitive and he said he wouldn’t. He the goes anyway and gives her a lap dance in his boxers.

I know my friend isn’t doing anything inherently wrong, he can hang with whoever he wants to. She’s my ex and I get that. But the fact they still actively exclude me and stonewall any attempts at at least being amicable and my friend does the bare minimum and argues he did nothing wrong sucks. These people bring back bad memories for me but I care about my bestfriend but I’ve tried as hard as I can. What do I do?

**TL;DR** Best friend became friends with my ex and old friend group post breakup. Try to make things amicable with my ex and old group but they refuse and still treat me badly. Friend keeps pushing the boundary of how close they all are and argues he can do whatever he wants and I shouldn’t ruin our. What do I do?",29Nov2019,1

834,"A guy I’ve known for years and have admittedly had feelings for in the past confessed a few months back that he had feelings for me. I was hesitant about this since I was in a really rough situation at the time, but explained that to him and he was really understanding and willing to see how things played out. For clarification I specifically said I did not want to date anyone at the time.

This lead to where things are now, every week he asks me if I want to do something like clockwork. I find myself making excuse after excuse to not go out. When I do agree to do something with him, he just sort of picks what we do without asking for my opinion. That leads into a pretty dull time for me as it’s often not what I wanted to be doing that night. It sounds silly, but if he does not seem to care about what I’d like to do then I don’t want to try and start an actual relationship with someone like that.

Other times it’s just that he’ll call us hanging out with friends a “date” or make little comments as though we were together. After everything, and seeing how he acts when he seems to think we’re ‘dating’, I have no feelings for him anymore and have no idea where to go from here.",29Nov2019,1
835,"(If this is the wrong sub, I apologize.  I just couldn’t think of where else to post.)

On March 1 of this year, my father had a massive stroke. For the last 9 months my dad has fought with everything he has and has essentially made that stroke his bitch.  He’s walking, talking, and even got his license back.  I’ve seen the definition of grit and determination in the face of my father. My mother has been amazingly strong and supportive and the two of them have kept their sense of humor through this entire deal.

This last weekend Dad had a seizure.  We are still in the process of doctors and follow ups and trying to determine the cause and what comes next.  But to say that this really knocked him down a peg, is an understatement.  

To work so hard - and make an almost full recovery, and then handed this new thing.  He is having a hard time. 

Both stroke and seizure - the quick thinking of my Mom and the amazing EMT’s, saved my fathers life - which I am eternally grateful. 

However, they’ve cut off three of his favorite shirts.   Please understand - I AM NOT COMPLAINING.  

The stroke was his favorite Disney t-shirt that was probably 15 years old.  This last weekend was a Panama Canal tshirt from their cruise, and his favorite LL Bean button down.

It’s shredded - I can’t sew this thing back together.  [Dads Shirt](https://imgur.com/gallery/y4ULBnl)

I am throwing myself onto the mercy of Reddit.  I’ll contact LL Bean as well, but the same shirt isn’t available online anymore.

850,"So I'm the only girl (15) in my Scouts BSA troop. I'm going to join a linked girl's troop once it starts up, but since nobody else has joined it yet, I'm meeting and going on campouts with the boys. Since I'm the first to join, I'm technically the leader of the girl's troop, so I'm on the youth leadership committee with three other boys. We've been working to plan meetings and camping trips.

I'm usually pretty quiet, and I keep to myself during meetings and stay out of the chaos. None of the boys ignore me, but they don't really seek me out, either. But one day, one of the guys (16) on the youth leadership committee randomly came up to me. After the opening flag ceremony, he just turned to me and said hi, how are you? I was so taken aback that I blurted out a response, and then he walked away to start the activity.

He did the same at every meeting after. Just coming up to me, saying hi, and walking away again. It's just this one guy. The meetings are so chaotic that there's no time to talk more, but I started paying more attention to him. I usually work on some advancement requirements with the soon-to-be leader of the girl troop, but occasionally I would look up and see him looking at me across the room.

This guy seems to pay a lot more attention to me then any of the other boys in the troop do. The meeting after the camping trip, everyone else went outside to play a game and I opted to stay inside and work on requirements. He stayed inside as well, even though we were the only two scouts in the room with the leaders, and came over to me and helped me work on some requirements. He definitely could have done other things, but he chose to help me. There's been one more meeting since then, and again he was the only one to say hi to me.

I'm homeschooled, and this guy goes to public school, so I don't see him outside of an hour-and-a-half meeting once a week. But the fact that he's paying more attention to me than everyone else makes me think that maybe he likes me? But the problem with that is that he's a youth leader, and maybe it's part of his job to be friendly with everybody. But the other two guys on the youth leadership committee don't do that. Sorry for the rambling, but I have no experience with anything like this, and I just need some advice. Does he like me, or am I being crazy and he's just being friendly and doing his job?",29Nov2019,1
851,"2019 was supposed to be the best year of my life. I was landing the dream job. My live in boyfriend was proposing on Christmas. My family was moving towards tremendous prosperity and blessing. 

Then in May my boyfriend told me he wasn’t sure he “loved me enough to promise an entire lifetime together.” I moved out and went back to my parents to figure things out.  While I was there my father died in his sleep.  Without life insurance. 

Now my family is struggling to make ends meet.

I did end up landing the dream job. And that has been a blessing because I’m now responsible for the debts (2 mortgages, among other things, and a kid in college) my father left behind.  

But. I’m single. I’m fatherless. My family is heartbroken. I’m heartbroken. 

How do you even go on? What is life even really about?  Please help me.",29Nov2019,1
