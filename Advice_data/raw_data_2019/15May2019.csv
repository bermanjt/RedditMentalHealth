1,"This is part of my realisation/dealing with my relationships in my life. I want to make huge changes in my life but it begins with accepting things as raw as they are. Basically a rant. 

My best friend is M(21) and I'm F(22).

Okay a little back story. So I moved for college four years ago and became friends with M and his other female friend. I only knew a few people from home at college and had no real close friends there. He was in the same boat. 

He's a charmer, he can sweet talk and have an awesome conversation with you from the minute you meet him. He made me feel instantly comfortable. I thought he was great fun and we managed to build a fun outgoing friendship. 

We used to party all the time. I wanted the whole freshman experience and I definitely got it. The good, the bad and the ugly. 

Pushy. He would encourage me to drink drink drink. He would encourage the worst habits and have a very nonchalant attitude towards everything in a ""carefree"" way. He would smoke, snort, drink, fuck, swallow, basically do anything that is bad he did and so did I. 

He's manipulative. He will guilt me when I say no. I'm a people pleaser and I find it extremely diffuclt to say no. He wi try and say ""but I have no one else"" and he knows if he prods enough he will eventually get me and convince me. He is the person who could charm or guilt me into licking an asshole. Its that much influence he has over me. Only lately I've developed a bit of a backbone and have managed to escape his grasp as he has other people to convince. 

Drunk. When he drinks (more so now than before) he turns into a weird man child mixture of entitled cuntiness. It's so weird. He will try fight anyone for anything if he's not in the right mood. He will get angry and sulky if he doesn't get his way. If anyone insults his ego he will go on a rampage. One night he went around screaming ""my parents own *club* I will get you kicked out"" to strangers at the nightclub because someone was giving him funny looks. It's incredibly harrendous behaviour. And I'm not any better I can tell you that. He will get incredibly drunk every time no matter what happened the last time. No matter how bad the situation gets he will continue to drink at the same rate each night. Only a few nights ago he got robbed at an ATM because he was drunk but he's out tonight with someone else. 

Excessive behaviour. We were out one night and we kissed. We thought this was  fun and we're in the moment. I never had sexual or romatic feelings for him and he never had any feelings for me. But then we started kissing every time we got drunk up to the point where we nearly slept together one night (again no feelings involved simply acting like drunk fools) this was getting so out of hand that people around us were convinced we were in a secret relationship. We've had issues most recently when I was single and would speak to guys on nights out he would scream at me and call me all sorts of names (wh*re and what not) and I have done similar things when he speaks to gals (not quite as intense) 

Each time we went out we would get worse and worse drunk. Lose everything, get into arguments with strangers, get into arguments with each other, it got BAD. I've been in so many dangerous, weird and possibly criminal situations because we took things too far. In the last year (year 3) I began to really honestly take a look at myself and realise that it was A HUGE problem. I cut down an awful lot of this but it still happening to this day. 

Compulsive liar. He lies aaaaaaaall the time. He will change up stories. Make white lies up here and there. He will cover his own ass as soon as he feels uncomfortable or that his character is being attacked. 

Opportunist. He will use people for things. The more he can get out of someone the better. Stay at their house, use their status or connections to advance himself. 

Grandious view of himself. He wants to be famous. He wants to be an influencer and have everyone love him. But he wasn't the get rich quick ideals instead of really working for what he wants. He also thinks everyone loves him and would do anything for him. This is where drunk M pulls his twisted entitled behaviour when he starts screaming ""ill sue"" to security at a restaurant for telling him to stop speaking loudly. 

Now

He's not an evil person he's also kind, generous and fun. He will be there in a second if I needed a shoulder to cry on and some loyalty. I exhibit/behave very similarly to this although I bring a lot of my depression and negativity into our friendship.

I don't really know what I want to get out of sending this to strangers but after a huge breakup with my ex I am now revaluation absolutely everything in my life right now.",15May2019,3
2,"So I’ve been having a lot of problems with my girlfriend for a while now. She’s a year younger than me and is very very sensitive, is kindve needy and scrutinizes a lot of what I do. I’m 18 so I want to be a lot more care free but she kindve restricts that. I also think that she suffers from depression and definitely severe anxiety, I saw my brother go through the same thing so im extra soft on her in that regard. I’m not in love with her anymore but I still love and care about her. Idk if that makes sense, but despite all the anger she makes me feel I still just want her to be happy but I’m not anymore. I don’t know what to do",15May2019,1
3,"Hi. I was writing a post to explain my story but it was getting too long. If I break it down to the most basic question it would be this:

Does anyone have recommendations of places to visit for people who have severe social anxiety? I really need to get away. I've had a horrible several years and am trying to heal from illness and abuse. I don't have any family or friends to go with. I haven't been able to work for 2 years and have been living on savings. I will need to go back to work very soon but I want to go on an adventure so much. I need it so I can feel some kind of excitement in my life (going to a new place, doing something new). I'm wondering if there is any affordable place I can get away to for a few days for a really relaxing time but not be put in situations where I have to socialize. I'm working on the social aspect of my life but this trip is just for me and social interactions are emotionally draining. I live in Ontario. Thank you.",15May2019,1
8,"I'm really confused. Some months ago I had a hard crush on her and then kinda forgot about it. I've always found her really cute but all urges I had were to hug her. Maybe a kiss on the cheek when saying goodbye. 

But now I don't know. I'm so used to having her as a friend and while I deeply appreciate our friendship, I still occasionally think how it'd be like to be with her. 

Whenever she messages me I get really excited and happy. My heart may even skip a beat. I wouldn't say I think about her all the time. We talk pretty much everyday and we're comfortable with each other. 

Actually I have two best friends and we're a trio. I find both really attractive, but I'm not sexually attracted to either. Maybe I don't have experience in that regard or maybe I'm demisexual idk. 

What I do know is that I love her as a friend and would do anything for her. But I'm really confused as if I'd date her. She doesn't want a relationship and I have no chances with her I know. I'm just puzzled about this because I don't have extreme feelings for her, but it definitely feels more than just friendship. Maybe I just want to hug her more, I'm not sure. Anyways sorry for the long post

And I'm perfectly fine with being friends with her, but I think if she were to confess to me, I'd say yes with no hesitation",15May2019,1
9,"Long story short, I grew up in this crazy rich country where there are no problems whatsoever. I have a very loving family, supportive friends, and had a great childhood. I am very grateful for all of this.
But...
I’ve been told offhandedly during conversations with adults that the world freaking sucks. That once I get out of this bubble that I’m living in (I want to go to Canada for university once I graduate) I’m gonna have to deal with a lot of shitty times and a lot of shitty people. 

There are so many things I haven’t experienced so I’m not ready for.  I got bullied, like, once recently and it made me feel down for the rest of the day. I’ve had approximately one reciprocated crush that died out quickly (long story). I’ve never dealt with genuinely bad people, only girls with self esteem issues, etc. 

Now I’m just.....uncertain of how to handle things in the “real world.” I don’t know how to treat homeless people or beggars, and if i work in the service industry I feel like I’ll become very upset by rude customers, etc etc.

I was wondering if you guys, whether young adults or middle age or whatever can share your experiences with me? What I should be ready for and how to handle it and so on. It would be really helpful.",15May2019,1
10,"Ok, so I matched with a woman on bumble who after some talking asked me to take naked pictures of her. I’m sure some of y’all are like “WTF could you possibly not understand about this??” 

We haven’t talked about casual sex so idk if anyone thinks this is where it’s gonna go and I kinda suck at taking hints, so I’m asking advice about where this is going? 

Also, the pics came up because I do photography, more nature/landscapes than portraits. If this matters.",15May2019,1
11,"Dudes, i'm 16 and i am naturally always looking for growing as a person, i suddenly want to learn how to do this thing and this and this other thing, etc, got me? I always do things that make me grow as a person and when i find myself enjoying them i fucking love it and i stick with it (workout, playing guitar) and i'm pretty aware that being interesting as a person is a really attractive trait for women but the problem is that no matter what i do or how masculine and confident (Literally almost every person i know tells me that i have such a nice presence and i am really masculine) i act or whatever i do, i can't get ONE person interested in me in a romantic way, literally no one, i am 6'1 feet tall and slim but not scrawny (i have an kind of athletic shape because my shoulders are wide and my waist is pretty narrow) but there is a problem that i feel that is the root of most of the problems i have and it's my face. My face is too damn ugly dudes im pretty sure, big nose, small forehead, my eyebrows are weird af, my eyes look tired all the time, my bone structure looks weird despite of having a strong jawline, my lips are weird shaped, etc. I'm not bitching about it, i am just telling you. I always act as confident and assertive as i can, i workout as hard as i can, etc but it doesn't seems to have results, i'm not saying i do all this things because i want to get laid, i'm like that by nature, all my life people had been telling me that i am like that. I am really really frustrated with this anyways because no matter what i am or do i can't seem to have one girl interested in me and that feels like garbage. I'm not trying to sound narcissistic here, actually on the contrary.",15May2019,1
12,"So my employer pulled me into his office today and informed me that their auto insurance had dropped me from the coverage. This put them in a really tough spot because they had invested so much in me and I am doing very well there.

*backtrack*

2.5 years ago I received a DUI. I dont drink any more and took a jump into a field I really was interested in joining for a long time, HVAC. That being said...having my own company van is imperative.After schooling, I have been there for 6 months now. They are a smaller company and decided to take a chance on me (30M) making a career move and starting over. I have done very well there and am surpassing even my very high expectations. They knew upfront about the DUI and said it wouldn't be an issue since it was over 2 years.

The insurance company called them and said they reviewed it ( keep in mind I have been on the policy since day 1) and decided they would not approve me to be on the policy anymore.

My employer assured me they were going to do everything they could and not to worry, going as far as saying they would take a single policy out on me making it vehicle specific to cover me since I am not covered under the fleet insurance anymore. I offered to pay it myself but they said they weren't going to make me do that. I thought about buying my own van and getting it company wrapped like the fleet but still, if anything would happen it would be back on the company. 
By making the career jump, I took a pretty big salary cut to pursue this move so money is pretty tight.

Looking for some advice here and any outside the box thoughts",15May2019,1
13,"This has been ongoing with no solution and it's breaking my heart. It's been a long and bumpy road. And I haven't been successful in making things better.  
I started dating my boyfriend, we can call him Andy, six years ago. Things started out slow with meeting the parents, mostly because they live 4 hours away. But they did meet him briefly a few times when we were just starting to date. My dad was cautious around him at first. But when we got into a car accident and Andy's car got totaled, but we were okay, my dad is on the phone with me trying to tell me how Andy should deal with insurance claims and personal injury protection and possible lawyers. My dad showed his true colors to Andy, which I have always known. My dad cares about me, but thinks he can tell me what to do at when I'm in my twenties and moved out of his house since turning 18. He's also money hungry, wanted us to push for a settlement. Me and Andy didn't want to go down that path, we didn't know what we were doing in that regard. My dad got me upset over the phone as he has many times in my entire life. He gives me major anxiety when he gets mad. Andy saw me crying and arguing with my father and took the phone and told him to back off. Very short conversation. The next day, my dad doesn't ever want to see him ever again. Over the next few years of my relationship with my boyfriend it would consist of me visiting my parents without him and them ignoring the fact that I have a boyfriend. Claiming that they care about me, just not him. 
Finally, me and my boyfriend move in together after 4 years. This was sparked by the fact the Andy's mom lost her tragically difficult battle with brain cancer. He was living with her and no longer needed to take care of her. His dad passed before I met him. It was time for him to move in with my since I was living by myself. I thought that all this was happening that I would plead to my dad to give it some effort to let things go. He told me very seriously that he would be in my life less now that Andy lives there with me. Heartbroken again. Then, soon after we are living together, we were victims of a crime at the house. Coming home late from a movie, two guys literally followed us home and pulled a gun on us to attempt to rob us (or worse?). We will never know because my boyfriend shot the guy pulling out the gun. Self defense. Again, we are okay. My dad calls him that night and thanks Andy for saving my life. You would think that would have fixed that problem? Wrong. There are some small attempts to get together my boyfriend and my dad. We go to the beach. Meeting in the middle of the two towns. Then my dad and I get into a fight. I told him I sold the car that I had bought as intended to be a fixer upper because me and my dad were going to work on it. He did not like that. I bought the car with my money as my project. But I watched it deteriorate for a year with no plan in place for me and my dad to get to it. I got tired of it sitting in my driveway and made the decision to sell it to someone who would fix it in order to break even. This fight had nothing to do with Andy. But I hung up on my dad and went crying (again) to my boyfriend. I thought I hung up. I was so upset that I couldn't properly hang up on my dad, I just thought I did. Put the phone down on the table and talked with my boyfriend about how much of an ass he is and how he has no right to be mad and that I did the right thing. Dad listened to everything. Listened to my boyfriend tell me that he is an ass. That kinda brings us to the present because now he won't get over being called an ass and again wants nothing to do with my boyfriend. 
My relationship with my father - I have had plenty to fights with my father way before meeting Andy, this affects me most. My father is the type that he change the oil and replace the brakes on my car for free, then think he can tell me that I'm putting on some weight and that ok should eat better
My relationship with my boyfriend - I have changed a lot since being with him. Honestly I have. I think it's because I grew up kinda sheltered, then went to college living in a dorm and had my eyes opened more to the real world. He taught me to stand up for myself more, whether or not that makes things easier.
Why my father is pissed - He can't handle disrespect from anyone. He doesn't talk to his sister anymore because he feels she disrespected him years ago.
Why my boyfriend is pissed - He calls my dad out on some subtle but manipulative behaviors that my dad has with me.
What my mother says about all this - she is passive, does not want to jeopardize any relationships in her life, has no problem with Andy and tells me that it's not her causing a problem, it's my father. I see my mother less only because of my dad.
How this affects me - I have to play both sides and now I'm going crazy, like tempted to tell my dad that we were pregnant even though we are not just to prepare for when it really happens because we would have gotten married already if things were okay with the family. At the end of it all though, not talking to my father is not a solution. I need my mother on my life. And they come as a pair.",15May2019,1
14,"I have three cats and I live in a fairly small house. For most of my life, ive struggled with ADD and now, i was diagnosed with severe depression. Im never motivated to do anything, and cry whenever i have the chance. For some reason, I decided to tell my parents about wanting a dog. Ive always wanted one, but they’ve never taken my request seriously, so i just kept this wish to myself. I dont want a service dog, I want a regular dog, I can’t explain how happy i feel when im around dogs and i know it can inspire me to get out of the house. Ive done so much research and ive invested my time in looking up breeds and basic things about  dog care. When i told my mom today, she rejected my proposal, and im just so pathetic that i walked myself into my room and i burst into tears. I dont know what i can do to convince them. I already have 3 cats, and i love them so much, but i cant explain my euphoria when im around a puppy. I know that its almost like having a child, but i am very motivated and i will do anything to keep it healthy. I really want this. A golden retriever.

15,"For one reason or another, I am the type of person who others regularly solicit for advice. I never pry into my friends’ (or strangers’) lives at all, but yet I’m often on the receiving end of some pretty heavy personal information. For example, I’ve talked down dozens of acquaintances from suicide and other risky decisions because I just happened to be the person they went to first. But lately I’m starting to feel overwhelmed by having this level of responsibility with absolutely no training.  I shouldn’t be doing this. In the last 24 hours alone, two friends of mine messaged me out of the blue explaining that they want to die. One is a close friend of mine and I felt comfortable suggesting that she seek professional help. She said no, she needs to talk to me. I love her dearly but I don’t want a life in my hands like that. My question here is, what’s the responsible way to handle these type of situations when I’m faced with them so frequently? Do I call the cops on everyone? Do I tell them all to call a hotline? Should I continue to engage on this level? It feels really risky to be giving out mental health advice as I have no psych degree to speak of... just a lot of love and empathy.

17,"Im not a doctor, or an oral surgeon. Im just speaking from experience, Here is some stuff i think might help you when you get your wisdom teeth out :)
(Sorry for any spelling mistakes)

1. They might tell you to do salt water rinses or take a syringe and rinse the area, yeah it SUCKS and trust me nobody wants to do it. But for the love of god take the advice you are given because dry socket is a whole other story and trust me it is NOT FUN.

2. Yeah the first while kinda sucks, but I found that if you get about 3 ice packs and keep 2 in the freezer at a time while you use one, it helps a little. Buying reusable ice packs are a good idea before the surgery.

3. Try and buy different flavors of soups instead of just a ton of 1 type, it doesn't matter how much you love just 1 flavor, it WILL get boring and you'll probably begin to dislike it.

4. Dont let this scare you, but you might throw up. Keep a garabage can where you are going to be sleeping or laying.

5. Be patient. Healing takes a while and it gets annoying not being able to eat properly.

6. Have a glass of water or whatever other liquid you are drinking and some pain medications next to you, and write down when you had what. Keeping track of that just helps you keep a schedule. 

7. For people who do get dry socket, dont be afraid to contact the person who did the operation. The longer it's there, the more it sucks.

8. For people who are afraid of going under, thats perfectly alright to feel scared. Take some deep breaths and know that you are going to be okay, pain is only temporary and pain medications help a lot. Coming from somebody who had a panic attack in the OR haha

9. For those of you are in school, take the time to let your teachers know that you are going to be gone and ask if there is some way you can catch up once you are back in school or ask if you can take any work early. You may miss up to a week of school if you get all 4 teeth out and trust me the last thing you need is to come back and have some ungodly amount of homework.

Good luck to all of you getting your wisdom teeth out :) 
These are just some things that helped me personally, sorry it's so long I just wanted to make sure that I gave as much advice as possible. 
I wish you all the best!",15May2019,1
18,"My parents have been divorced as long as I can’t remember. Both of my parents are narcissists and are extremely controlling. I currently (22F) live with my dad. Over the course of the past two or so months, I  broke up with my boyfriend of over 2 years and began seeing someone else. My dad hates the new guy I am with and refuses to give him a chance. He doesn’t like me seeing him or going to his house. He lives 30 minutes away and my dad won’t let me drive to his house. He has to come pick me up in the town I live in and take me there. My dad refuses to meet him. I have tried to talk to my dad about it and just explain to him how I’m feeling and that I want to be treated like an adult and I can’t get it through to him. Today I told him I was hanging out with new BF tonight and he immediately threatened to take my car away and told me I’m “getting close to burning the bridge with him.” His name is on my bank account and I don’t know what to do about the money that is in it or how to go about getting all of it out without him noticing. 


I was considering moving in with my mother, but after talking to my siblings who have lived with her in the past, I don’t think it will work out because of how controlling she is, as well.

We end our dates with hugs as we have not kissed yet (like I said it's really early). So I'm asking for what things I can do at this stage to let her know how much she means to me and what things that guys do that very girl secretly loves and don't want to ask for it.

22,"Long story short, I don’t know whether or not to include my oldest brother as a groomsmen in my upcoming wedding. He has been battling drug addiction for the past 10 years, and the last 5 have been very hard on the family as he has consistently chosen any and all drugs over us. He has been erratic, untrustworthy, hateful, and full of drama (and that’s putting it nicely).  

Growing up I’ve always envisioned him being up there with me. But he has betrayed multiple members of my family, destroyed relationships, and he acts like he doesn’t give a damn about keeping in touch with me or anything about my life. He is over 30 and lives with my parents and he is making every day of their lives miserable. The worst part about my brother is how he treats my parents, and particularly my mom who is the greatest and nicest woman on this earth. That is what I hate the most.

He has turned into a completely different person then who I grew up with. But I want to believe that my old brother is still in there somewhere. Do y’all think I should look past everything and include him?

24,"Hi, I’m 32F, I live with my grandparents and help take care of them and I work a full time job. My grandparents are stubborn and are set in their ways and it can be very frustrating. My grandpa just got out of the hospital today and is now on oxygen and has a catheter, both are temporary. He was supposed to go to a nursing home to build his strength, but opted to come home instead. My grandma has her own set of health issues as well. Taking care of them is a lot and if definitely tests my patience. My mother, on the other hand, has the worst coping skills of anyone I’ve ever met. She is very upset at having to help take care of them and keeps saying how everything is falling on her and she can’t do it all. She yelled at my grandma so bad the other day, my grandma threatened to call the cops if she didn’t leave. She talked to a social worker today to try and make my grandparents comply with what she wants them to do, which is make the house more handicap accessible and have more outside help. My grandparents are competent to make their own decisions, even if they’re not ones I agree with, they are still adults.

25,"Hey guys, I need advice and I had to do this throwaway account cause it contains a lot of personal information and I know lots of my personal friends hang around here so I might as well be a little cautious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to be a straight and honest as possible without extending myself too much. I've suffered depression my whole life. Had a couple suicide attempts when I was a teen, I was able to manage this for a couple of years during adulthood (I'm 24 atm) and I recently I ended a 5-year LDR that basically triggered me into a depression spiral that I haven't been able to get out of.  She told me there was someone else, and that she had been dating him for a couple of days now. After we broke-up, we were in this chat group together where she started asking things like if it was okay to have sex everyday with your partner. Keep in mind, before this relationship I was in another relationship where I was cheated on and this a very delicate situation for me.   


Fast forward a couple of weeks, I tried to brush this off like it wasn't a big deal, specially because I had just started a new job and things were starting to look really good. I started making three times as much as I was making previously so I started going out more. Met new, wealthier friends who introduced me to other wealthier friends who really like to party a lot. I've been smoking weed for around 10 years now, and I used to drop the occasional acid tab every once in a while. This pattern changed almost immediately. I've been doing psychedelics almost weekly now, and lots of coke. I had a cocaine overdose around February and not even that could get me to stop. Now I feel like I like it more. So right now I'm doing cocaine almost everyday, and dropping psyches every other weekend. I'm overweight and I've been losing a lot of weight because I'm basically not eating for days at a time, I can barely sleep, and when I do I get lots of nightmares. So the idea of suicide gets more and more attractive every time. I feel like I'm in a loop and I can't get out. The hardest part is, all of my friends think I'm doing better than ever because, technically I am. Eventually I quit my new job because it was so overwhelming to do this while emotionally exhausted that I wasn't able to pull it off anymore, and I got called by another company and they gave me an even BETTER position with a better salary. So everyone thinks I'm killing it, when in reality I feel like I'm at my lowest. But that doesn't reflect on anything around me.

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, of course I've tried to talk to friends. None of them really seem to understand what's going on and most of them give me the old ""Look at the bright side, your career is doing better than ever and your making lots of money"" script, and when I try to explain to them why I think this is so urgent they just say ""Go to therapy"". And yes, I tried going to therapy for a few months, and I went to a psychiatrist who gave me some sleeping pills and antidepressants. But none of that seems to be working and I can't notice any progress. Actually, I feel like things are getting worse everytime. But no one, not my therapist, not my friends, no one seems to understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm literally on the edge of killing myself and no one seems to bat an eye. I've been thinking about going to rehab, but I can't afford to lose my job. But I feel like things get weirder by the hour and I'm losing control over myself. I've been depressed for a long time, but never like this. I feel like time is running out, and I don't know what to do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question to you is, how do I -actually- make it stop? Everyone seems to think I'm doing amazing, and the more I try to end it, the crazier it gets, and at the same time I get more and more money and that helps me keep up with my habits. At this point, I'm 100% convinced that no one can help me or actually understand my situation because I haven't found anyone yet that has been through the same, or even a similar case.   


Sorry I made this so long, but I really wanted to make everything as clear as possible. Hope you guys can help.",15May2019,1
27,"I (18M) am typing this an hour before my second to last pre-calculus exam (the final is the day after tomorrow) and everything in my life just seems to frustrate me in numerous ways so I thought I would share.

I am a senior in high school who is college bound, but I also take pre-calculus at a city college near my school because my high school doesn't offer the class (we are a small charter). This isn't my first college class, but it has been a huge challenge for me primarily because I haven't been studying. I have very good grades in high school (I have only gotten one B which was in an elective last semester) but my insistence on not studying will probably land me a C in the class. This is really new territory for me, prior to this, studying was a constant in my life. I was more than capable of completing work regardless of my interest in the topic, pure discipline was always sufficient for me. My sister has told me that my reliance on discipline has probably caused burn out.

Playing piano has been a hobby of mine for about 4 years, I really want to improve, but I can't seem to get myself to try new things, like interesting rhythms, new song selections or genres, etc. I am very frustrated by my stagnation as a whole and don't really understand how to begin caring about success any more. This is also affecting my ability to think about where my life is gonna go. If I can't find enjoyment in anything how am I going to select a major or job interest for my future.

I play a lot of video games, but I am not sure that I actually enjoy them that much. I think I only do it to fill time rather than because I feel challenged or engaged in the activity. For a large portion of my life I have acted out of fear rather than out of a yearning for success and I think the consequences of that way of life are coming to a head in a really scary way.

Looking to my parents for help isn't really an option for the following reason. Since I started high school I have basically never asked my parents for any serious assistance in regards to studying, I also avoided talking to them because I didn't think it would help all that much. They wanted results not complaints so I just tried my hardest (BTW my parents don't look down upon conversation but I myself realize that more often than not, complaining doesn't really get you anywhere). This independence in regards to studying and piano practice meant that my parents don't really know how best to help me and they feel as though I am of the age to help myself with these problems now that I am 18. This is really frustrating to me as I feel like I missed out on my chance to receive help from family. This is made worse by the fact that when I have come to them with concerns about my academic success they are quick to ignore me as they assume I am exaggerating or that I will solve the problem myself (I have been known to cry wolf in the past but this is because I was a worry wort in regards to my grades).

It is probably too late for me to improve my grade in the pre-calculus class however, I am very concerned that my habits in the tail end of high school are going to bleed over into college and am unsure of how to prepare for the challenges of not living with my parents, accepting monetary responsibility, multitasking and a whole host of things I am sure I haven't anticipated. Is this a case of me not just sucking it up and getting things done or is there something I haven't accounted for? thanks in advance for any advice.",15May2019,1

29,"Okay so let me explain, I have an online friend who I've been best friends with for six years. Over the years her parents have been strict to the point where it's making her depressed and anorexic. 
She's 19 now and her parents are more strict than they've ever been. She's only allowed to watch kids movies, they're forcing her to become a lawyer, she's not allowed to go upstairs or to her room until she goes to bed, she can't go out, she can't take medicine, she can't go to a doctor or seek help, she's not even allowed to act sad or anything and I just do not know what to do at this point. Unfortunately we live in different countries so I can't help her by seeing her.

32,"so, I am 27, I have never been married, I have no kids.

I had a 6 year relationship that ended about 3 and a half years ago.... it was a long relationship and honestly I paid a heavy price for it, I am not pushing blame on to her by any means, it takes two people to have a relationship, but the toll that was paid on my half for it was rather high. She had crohns and was always sick, I honestly did love her, and I tried too always be there for her, but she ended up ending the relationship, the reason I was given was a partial truth and it was that she stopped being able too see me as a lover and started too only see me as her best friend, but I know that she also had a lot of guilt for all the things she had put me through by virtue of always being sick. 

I didn't move away from the town we lived in, I didn't pursue higher education so that I could work and be there when she needed it, I tried my best to support her and outside of that, slowly the gears started to jam. I am nerdy, I enjoyed video games, I still enjoy them just not as much, I still enjoy anime, I read manga.... she hated all of those things about me to be honest, and I don't judge her for that, I don't think about her almost at all anymore to be honest, I hike, I cosplay, I worked out, I stopped partying, I work, I studied... I am and have been going too school off and on for a long time now and im almost done with getting my degree, but I am 27....

I have so many fears.

I fear not being able to transition into the career path I want too be in.

I fear a lot.... and mixed in with all those fears... I feel as though I shouldn't get into any relationships.

not because I am afraid of letting anyone in like that, I am afraid of that, but that isn't why.... 

I think that, I am not the best me I can be, and I don't want to let anyone see this less than worthy version of myself... I know my standing, I know how low on the bar I am, I know that I may be someone capable of giving my all, but I don't think that in all honesty.... anyone should have to deal with me burdening them, I don't feel as though I could be a complimenting part of another persons life.

she hated things about me, and those things I think are key parts of me, and I think I have come to terms with most of the bad in me, but I also know that I haven't been on a date in so long I don't really know how to even approach the topic of asking someone on a date, or the right way to handle a date in your mid/late twenties.... I don't date unless I actually feel something there, I have had about a year after that ended, but things got complicated, and I backed out, but that was what it was going in, and I am not the one who started the dynamic.... I am not unattractive physically, I know that, I just lack a lot of social ability......

I tried to become someone who would be worthy of the special person I would meet one day, but now I am afraid that with the way I am I won't ever meet that person.... and if i did I wouldn't be capable of talking too them :(",15May2019,1
33,"So, I'm just a part time cashier &amp; customer service associate at a home improvement store. Just about to finish up a degree in applied sciences, cyber security major. I want a new job that utilizes my degree, but education and actual work are two different things. I'm afraid of jumping into an IT job and then finding out I didn't not know as much as I think I do.

I've been part time because I go to school full time, and now that school is over, a full time position just opened up, perfect timing. Except that I also just got an email from one of my advisors saying he just got some internship opportunities in, and he was asking if I was interested in being put on the list for consideration. I said yes, but now I've got a conundrum. 

Either get a promotion at my current job, and either be working an internship and a full time job, or declining the internship and having a full time job. Or I keep the part time job, and use my more flexible schedule to fit in an internship to further develop my skills.

As of now I do not know the pay grade of the internship (yes it's a paid internship) nor do I know if my full time status comes with any pay raise ( I know I make @ bit less than some other full time people in other positions)

What would you guys/gals do?",15May2019,1
34,"TLDR: I was slated for a promotion to full-time from a part-time position at a job I love, but my unusually dark depression over the winter rendered me completely unfit at the time. Now they are keeping me in the dark about whether or not I am even up for it anymore and throttling my hours—down to only 4 a week sometimes. Should I just quit and find a new place? 

I have been working at this job for almost two years now. It’s very personal, hands-on tutoring for students/people taking standardized tests, classes, finals—you name it. I’ve had a lovely time working there, I’ve trained so many new people, and my coworkers are incredibly talented and kind. 

I was slated for a promotion to a full-time position as assistant director of exam prep. I’d help the director get the students’ days planned out, write notes to tutors, etc. It was gratifying work, and I was happy to help. I had a trial run for a few weeks, and managed to put together and organize curriculum to make it easier to find. 

I have depression and seasonal affect disorder, but usually I can keep myself in check with my medicine and a regulated schedule. However, over this winter, my depression became incredibly severe—I was seriously considering committing suicide on the way to or from work sometimes. I had a dark breakdown in the middle of one of my shifts, thankfully out of sight, away from my students, but it got to a point where all my superiors knew, save the franchise owner. They were all so sweet and I was so grateful for their help. They sent me home early, and I thought I was okay. 

My boss (the franchise owner) called me in the following Monday and sat me down to talk about how I was doing, if I needed to slow down on my hours, and we reached an amicable arrangement that I didn’t work as many nights anymore, so I could spend more time with my family and friends and just recuperate. I was so humbled by how nice everyone was. 

Cut to me now, a few months later, and it seems as if my boss is trying to slowly cut me out altogether. My hours have been reduced (sometimes to only 4 a *week*) and I get weird looks from coworkers. I asked the director of exam prep if he could ask if I was still up for the promotion, since my boss was weirdly nowhere to be found, and he made it clear he wanted me as assistant still, which I was grateful for. A week later, he tells me they aren’t looking for someone to fill that position anymore. A week after that, a new hire does what I had been tasked to do before. 

I get not wanting to stir the pot, but if I’m not cutting it or if I have proven to not be strong enough to fit the bill any longer, I would appreciate my boss telling me so, instead of sneakily pushing me aside and hoping I don’t notice. Now I’m in financial trouble, as I now make less than I need to pay off my student loans *alone*, let alone other necessary payments I need to make. 

Should I just cut ties and run at this point, or what? What would you do in my position? I honestly keep having dreams I have quit or gotten a new job, and I feel so much *relief* in them, but my fiancée has told me not to take too much stock in them. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t have a new job lined up after this, either. It’s square one from here if I do quit.",15May2019,1
35,"*Dates at the bottom*

I have worked for a really great corporation for the last 5 years, and I’m trying to figure out how to quit my (9-5/M-F) office job in the best way possible for everybody. I have a really great relationship with my bosses and coworkers, it’s a small tight knit group, and my boss is very helpful and easy going. The big problem though is that I am closing on a house on 5/30, so I can’t tell anyone at work yet because the lender will call to verify future employment, and I don’t want to fuck that up. If the lender calls HR though it maybe wouldn’t be a huge deal because they are in another state, and if they aren’t aware yet, then no problem. If they called my boss directly, I would have to ask him to lie to the lender. Can I just ask him to keep it quiet from HR/the lender until my house closes? That way they have a 4 week notice, first 2 weeks nobody knows except us, third week is last week, 4th I use my vacation, possibly come work a few days in the third week of June if they need it, but that doesn’t seem like it would be helpful? I’ve earned the vacation, I should just take it, right? I want to give them enough time to find my replacement, but I also have family coming in mid June that I have to be available for. I have 15 days of vacation, how should I use that? It seems really rude to give two weeks notice and use the last week as vacation time. I could tell my boss now, in May, so they have more time to begin finding the replacement, but again, mortgage needs to close first. 

5/14/19 is today’s date 

15 days of vacation available 
House closes on 5/30 
Family visiting 6/8-6/15

39,"Some backstory so please bear with me: I've had several lunch sessions with my history teacher before. It started when it was obvious I was having a bad day and offered to have lunch with me if I ever needed to talk. We've gone over my ""depression"" (her words, not mine), my struggle with an eating disorder, etc. She's been nothing but thoughtful, caring, and a great listener. However, I feel like I've just been annoying her and being a burden. She hasn't hinted at feeling that way, but I keep thinking that she probably hates me at this point because I'm such a crybaby. Also, I've talked to my school counselor about my problems, but of course she's not much help. It doesn't help that I don't feel comfortable talking about my feelings to someone I barely know. When I talk to my teacher, she sees me every day and has a better understanding of who I am. I have more trust in her and overall more of a connection I guess.

Anyway, shit hit the fan over the weekend. Full on ""I hope I cry myself to sleep and never wake up"" kind of mood. (I don't know if I'm suicidal, like I've definitely wanted to end it, but I *know* that I don't plan on hurting or killing myself.) It was really rough, to the point that I had to stay home yesterday out of fear that I'd be a wreck and break down during class. I talked to her briefly in the hallway today and I could tell she knew something was up. 

I want to send her a quick email saying ""Hi, can we have lunch sometime during this week if you aren't busy? It's more on the serious side this time, and I don't feel comfortable talking to the counselor about it."" But I can't help but feel like she's tired of me being an annoying, whiny brat. I also just don't want to ask too much from her. I'm sure she wants to enjoy eating lunch with her co-workers, catch up on grading, and just get a break from students. I don't want to take that away from her. I'm just so conflicted on the whole thing. I want to get these feelings out to someone who I know will be empathetic and listen, but I don't want to become a burden or ruin her day. What should I do?",15May2019,2
40,"My friend is a terrible person. I'll just, say that. It's not nice and I could use better wording, but I am pissed.

Now, this friend of mine is part of a friend group. The other girls can be mean, but everyone can, which is the excuse I've given for this friend, but they're overall pretty nice. I need help because she pushes people into stuff they don't want to do, she gets mad when people stand up for what's right, and.. she's just overall a pretty nasty person to everyone. What do I do? I want to just be acquaintances with her, and be friendly but then, she talks shit behind my back, I risk losing my two best friends, and after all of that, I'm the newest addition to our class, so I don't have much room for dropping friends left and right. When I try to stand up for others the nicest way possible, with proper reasoning, and taking responsibility for my actions, she gets mad at me, and then she fucking blames it on people who didn't have anything to do with it. Like, she literally blames another person for me standing up to her, not even someone I was talking about. I need to know what to do about this stupid situation, I don't have many options from what I can see.

45,"So I’m pretty sure this girl (named T) likes me. There are many things to support that and a few major clues to deny that. Let’s take a tour, shall we.

We are 15

The positives

-She has told me she loves me

-She has called me a snack and a full course meal

- She will touch her hair around me

-we are besties on snapchat (nvm I just lost it)

-A year ago her friend said she likes me

-Her Favorite time to talk is at midnight

-She glances over at me during school and once even took a double turn to look at me

-She smiles around me a lot

-She laughs at all my jokes even things that aren’t remotely funny

-She sends snaps with kissy faces

-She has sent a bra pic

-She sends a lot of pics of her in her undershirt

-She definitely tries to look good in her selfies

-One time she had me pick her nail color

-She never has said she likes another boy

-She usually will want to continue snapping me even
 after our conversation died out, but not always
-She took a post shower towel snap

-She once sent me a mirror selfie of her in this hot crop top

-I stoped texting her August and then in December she texted me wanting to become friends again and then immediately asked if I had a gf

-A week later I forgot to text her again and then we didn’t talk until February 25th and we’ve been in constant contact since

The neutral
-She usually will leave me on opened at school after maybe like 10 snaps while at home she’ll leave me on opened after like 80

-Some days she will barely snap me (usually the days after we have big conversations) (I’m also not in the mood to snap her during these days)

-She is super shy in public (so am I) 

-She claims to have social anxiety 

-We don’t have classes together

-She said to me “boys suck” which I don’t understand what she meant (she’s straight btw)

-Other boys have tried to make advances on her but she told them she isn’t interested


The negatives
-I’ve asked her out twice 

-The first time was a month ago when I asked her to go to the zoo. She wanted our friend to come along. (Her friend wanted to set us up last year) and then she asked if i had a ride and I said no. After that she said maybe but we didn’t go

-The second time I tried to ask her to bowling like e weeks ago and she didn’t see the snap until the day before (I sent it Friday night she saw it Saturday afternoon) she said it depended if she had to workout and then I told her to update me the next day but the next day she had to go to the ER so she didn’t bring it up again

-She wanted to matchmake me like 2 months ago and I was hesitant and made an excuse not to do it so then like a week later she tried again (I AM NOT SURE IF THIS WAS A TEST OR NOT)

-She hasn’t FaceTimed me in 3 weeks (prob because she knew I didn’t like them)

-Recently she asked me if she should go out with “a friend” I said “wut” and she replied “never minddd” and I am not sure if I was the friend she was referring to or not

50,"Hey guys, 

So over the past ~4 months I’ve become somewhat of a doormat in my close friend circle; their jokes about me are mean (and thinly disguised insults) and nearly everything I say is ridiculed. They gossip about me, and I’m pretty sure they’d prefer if I wasn’t hanging out with them (they’ve hinted I’m deadweight) even though they pity-invite me to most things (we’ve been friends for a really long time). 

I’ve told them to cut it out twice before after they took it too far, but they apologized and started again within a week . I’ve tried to change some of the things that bother them about me but it doesn’t seem to do anything. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even be in their presence without feeling upset. 

About a week ago, it just became too much, and I essentially stopped most speaking/communication with them. I just can’t bring myself to be actively engaged in conversation or group message with them anymore (although I’ll still reply if I must). So far all that has happened is that they don’t message/talk to me either and are no longer discreet about me not being invited. 

I’m not sure what I’m doing- I really want to just completely leave and make new friends (and I’m trying really hard not to be bothered that they couldn’t give a **** about me), but we only have two more weeks of senior year left. There’s stuff like prom and our amusement park field trip that I’m already paired with them for, and I just don’t know how I can handle that. 

Any advice??

Thanks for listening to all my rambling lol",15May2019,8
51,"so i’m 15 and a female and i recently tried smoking for the first time. my friend group is rlly against it but my best friend (who is not in my group) did it with me. i’m not sure if i should tell my friend group about it because a lot of people are talking about how me and my best friend smoked weed and i’m worried my friend group are going to hear the rumours.

52,"I was a a bratty troubled drug addict in high school.  I've since turned my life around and I am doing pretty well and I work really hard for what I have.

My best friend from high school contacted me recently. She was the goodie two shoes and I was the bad influence. Well she is not doing good, she called me telling me she really messed up and was on a lot of hard drugs and was with this guy we knew back in the day and they were getting married.  We had a falling out like 8+ years ago but have since made up, I saw here maybe 4 yeats ago last.  She was with this guy and they are no where need home and have warants and are out of money.  She mentioned getting their mail and some other not so good stuff but they would pay me. I said ok because I was paniced and shocked.  we joked that the tables had turned and im the goodie two shoes. I'm not going to do what they asked, I'm not risking what I've worked so hard to get for anyone.  

What I need advice with is should I contact someone close to her? Should I try to convince her to just come home? She mentioned going to treatment the second she comes back in my heart I feel like that might be too late and she wont ever make it home.

She knows I've been in some very messed up situiations and I feel like this is a cry for help. Or maybe she was hoping I fell apart and was in the same place in life?? 

What should I do?",15May2019,1
53,So I’m a senior in highschool graduating next week. I’m in a engineering class and we have a end of year project. In my group we have 3 people me a junior and a sophomore. None of us are really friends but they are nice when they talk. Key word when they talk. They don’t communicate unless I talk to them first. They won’t even talk to each other really like we chose groups so it’s on them if they have beef which each other which I don’t think they do. It’s hurting our project cuz they are off in ther own world working on their own part  of the project and we are behind. I have to go in tommorow morning to work on it a little because they won’t. I have to pull everything together because they won’t communicate so our project is all over the place. What should I do should I bring my teacher into this should I just push through and deal with it? How do I get them to work as hard as I am so we can get this done?,15May2019,1

55,"Hi, for some backstory, I play on a competitive Overwatch team, and we are an extremely strong team. We have a big tournament coming up that we have a real shot of winning and making us more well known in the competitive Overwatch team, and the tournament runs for 12 weeks. We have a few other tournaments that we will most likely win as well, so in theory, everything is looking great for my team. 

The thing is, I cannot stand playing with my team. I'm the owner + captain + manager of the team, so I run everything, including getting us practice games every night from 7pm-10pm, and organising when we possibly need substitutes, etc. It's alot to do, and alot of pressure, but I handle it well because I love this team and we have alot of potential. But playing with my team every night is becoming extremely stressful. I feel like my team members don't respect me, they constantly belittle me, it's become a joke in our group to annoy me and attempt to piss me off where ever possible. 

It's not the entire team doing this, it's only a handful. So, the answer would be to kick off the people that are stressing me out, and find replacements, but I can't do that. The rest of the team have said that they would leave if anyone from our current roster left, as the synergy + friendship of all the members wouldn't be the same anymore. Therefore, the only real option is for me to leave, but I really don't want to do that because we are an extremely strong team. If we win this upcoming tournament, my team and me as well will become much more well known and get invited to much more prominent and harder tournaments. This could be a huge leap in our esports life for all of us.

But playing with my team every night is just too stressful. I was in tears last night at the thought of having to play more games with them and have to listen to them ignore my calls, blame everything on me and give them more dirt on me to talk about behind my back. It just feels like no matter what I do, I can't please them.

I want to leave, I really do, but I don't want to start at square one. We've worked so hard to get to this point, and me leaving would cause the team to fall apart, and all our hard work for months will be gone. I'd have to join another team (if any other team would even pick me up) and I'd have to get to know an entirely new set of people, and I'll practically have to restart everything I worked so hard to build. But at the same time, even being in the same call as my team is stressful and frustrating. My current plan is to just play our games, deal with my team, and not talk to my team outside of games at all, but I don't know if this is the right call. Sorry if this isn't the right place.

Thanks.",15May2019,1

I’m very helpful yet very cynical but I certainly am very kind towards everyone I know— alot of people say that their interactions with me reminds them of Roseanne in terms of humor but also Larry David.
My issue is// I hardly ever find people who like my personality— but sure if zodiac is in play but I am a Capricorn. 

Ever since I was in middle and high school, people tend to left me out of groups. I certainly am very bad at small talk— and I usually ask people abt themselves more, and usually relate the convo to myself so I can be relatable to them (not on purpose)— just a way I noticed I interact. 

Im now 25 years old and I dont have a consistent friend, I’ve known people for years but we only hang maybe 3-4 times a year. My roommates tend to leave me out of group chats and I thought that was rude until my new group of roommates started doing the same— also to mention tht when I text them, no one responds.

I dont have any work friends because again, no one invites me out to their group lunches etc— 

I’m just unsure of why no one wants to talk to me. Even while dating— guys usually just try to screw then disappear and never take up my offer of being friends.

I dont smell, I certainly dont come off as if there  is something wrong with me. I dress nicely and am skinny and tall, Alot of people have told me tht im attractive/- I’d put myself as a 7/10 on a good day. 

I have a feeling I may not be a personable character— but I certainly have the confidence to talk and have fun with people— yet no one ever sticks around, how can i fix myself?

63,"this is my first post, please bear with me. lol.

I need others perspectives to see if I’m not batshit crazy or I’m really something else. so some lovely advice would help a bean like me.

all families are dysfunctional, I get that, in their own unique way. 
and also, people always make mistakes that they are not to proud of.

how does one cope with an alcoholic and suicidal mother, who keeps bringing up one’s past mistakes to “add fuel onto the fire” and never wants to give one a chance if they make one.

but I gave her many chances to prove herself that she won’t drink or go to those dark thoughts again.


I got a speeding ticket, and I smoke weed.
(If you don’t like that, my bad, but I have huge anxiety due to my rough childhood, this just seems a little escape for me)

My mother has Facebook, I do not, I don’t really do that drama shit.

She likes to post things about me and exaggerate it enough to make me look like the worse being possible.

For example. I called her for help when I was a drunk college girl, my friends left me.
She’ll use this chunk of info and post to everyone that can see and say “oh I found her shirtless with four other dudes I didn’t know”

When I have self-respect for myself as a woman to not even do so like come on now.

Long story short, my mother lashes out in crazy manners where things are thrown, I’m verbal abused, I helped her save her life when she tried it, and I sit there getting contradicted my whole life by her.

So everything just basically adds fuel to the fire.

Finally, I’m homeless!
Yes I go to college, but it’s summer and I can’t stay on campus.
Plus it’s pricey to even live there in general, I’m local, I wanted to save money, I lived at home.

She decides to drop me. 
with no money, that I had to pay for speeding ticket and items. (I smoke, plus I’m a girl, I like my clothes and video games.) 
I really was reassured to the point she told me I could live there until I graduate.
She decides to move and drop me with nothing over my head, I sleep in my own car, I have nothing, no money, and I’m here basically crying myself to sleep every night cause I really haven’t been in this situation before.

I know I was brought up with a difficult family.
But I didn’t know I was that such a burden to my own mom, who “adores” me, and now I’m here.

71,"for context, we're all in high school. i'll call my friend a and her boyfriend b. 

me and b were friends for a couple of years until last year when i kind of starting to avoid him. i started dating someone else and then b thought i would leave them for him if he had chosen to tell me about his feelings. he had big plans to, but he never went though with it. i heard about it and i know it was a definite thing but it made me feel uncomfortable and i didnt think he respected my relationship so i stopped talking to him as much.

b does not come from a good family. he constantly trusts his mom, and then she betrays him and he's left desolate while none of us really know what to say. he posts on his spam account all the time and while i understand he wants to vent it just generates pity comments. ive given him advice multiple times to not trust her and he doesn't really listen to anything. obviously, i'm not in his position to judge but he flip flops about his relationship with his mom all the time and it's just uncomfortable to see. 

last year, i offered to pay for his ap exam, which was like $9. the money he got around the time he blew on weed instead. he literally has a drug problem and its actually so bad. when the girl he was dating before (which i'll get to soon) turned 18, she enabled him with juul all the time. i don't have a problem with people who smoke weed, but juuling is so stupid. the health effects and the second hand affect to it aren't even understood and people still do it. i understand we all don't come from privileged circumstances but i don't think spending the money you have on drugs and then complaining about the lack of food at home is acceptable. his parents are never around which has impacted him but he is not a good person to be around because he manipulates people the same way they manipulate him. when he had a falling out with a friend, he told people ""i'm just friends with them because they buy me food"" and i don't understand how that could be taken positively. 

he last got dumped less than a month ago, and then was ""in love with my friend"" two weeks later. when he was in this relationship, they were good friends and then he pressured her to be in a relationship and then it got awkward when it ended and she realized she didn't really like him. this girl, a, and b hung out together all the time and i think it's because of b that they don't hang out as much. yesterday, i confronted him when i found about their relationship to say that i wanted him to be careful with a. i said something to the effect of ""please be careful, you seemed to be really hung up over the girl and now you're suddenly rebounding with a, just make sure your feelings are genuine"" and he responded with ""me and that girl didn't last for a reason man and i love a now""  and also said ""i don't have the ability to look at that girl the same way because she also hurt me."" this literally reeks of bs and it's very clear that because he didn't get the relationship he wanted, a was his backup. i don't know how to bring it up to her and this is actually her first real relationship. she's a sophomore and he's a senior and i know after he graduates he's still going to hang out here. 

i've noticed a real change in her after they've become such close friends. she is quick to defend him no matter what he does and it scares me. me and my friends were talking about this guy who lied about his parents both being gay and then his mom being a vs model and we talked about how when he was in art class and went to present something he was like ""the fact that i made nothing reflects how i feel nothing about my family."" in fact, he actually has a relatively normal life and just lies to get attention. our art teacher is very understanding and privately talking to her before hand would have been fine. a stormed off when she heard us because she automatically assumed we were shit-talking b. a and b weren't dating yet but it was really uncomfortable for us to talk to her like no...not everything bad we have to say is about b.

i love her very much as a friend and i don't want our friendship to suffer, but it's evident she knows i don't like their relationship. she asked if it was ""okay"" and i kinda was like ""yeah ig"" because i didn't know what else to say. she is such a smart bright person and i feel like he isn't any good for her. he's started to deal drugs more as a way to make money and i don't want my friend to be dating a drug addict. i didn't feel comfortable being friends with b because of this but i just feel conflicted because i don't want to stop seeing a. i don't want to lie to my friend and say i approve or whatever because again it's not really my place to say that but i don't want to lie about my feelings. i just want her to be safe and happy and i feel like this guy has no future compared to her. at the same time, i feel guilty because i know his circumstances but i don't really consider them excuses. should i tell a how i really feel or should i just let her figure it out from here?",15May2019,1

78,"17M here. Throwaway for anonymity.
I live alone with my singular mother, and it has been that way for a few years.
My mom and dad have a strained relationship, he would often work, and was more of a caring, yet distant father that has improved over the years. He and my mom do not get along very well. My mom tells me and my siblings that our dad doesn't love us. He doesn't care. All we have is her. And makes us turn away from him. 
My mom is particularly controlling. She orders me around, never small talks. Yells at me if I am trying to enjoy a day off from work around the house. And in our arguments she ends up trying to overwhelm me, via commands and insults. She never says please, thank you, or sorry, unless you really try to drag it out of her.
In the past I was diagnosed with depression, and I was hospitalized. When the nurse asked if my parents abused me, I didn't know what to say. I had gotten to the point where I no longer will take the beatings my mom used to deliver out of anger, only stopping when she got tired. But she is often degrading, and manipulative. One of the happier 
So I said no, because I thought that's all I had in this life of mine. My mother. And spending a week in a hospital was one of my happier times back then.
But lately, I can't handle her shit anymore. I caught her with a married man, even though after my parents separated I was not happy. I told her I was ashamed, and I wasn't happy so she got angry at me, started attacking me with her own words. And I don't like living with her. It feels draining. I feel like giving up. I want to leave this place behind, but it feels like it would have to be via military or when my dad moves some place where I could stay.
My dad on the other hand, tries his best. He doesn't yell at me as easily, but he is often more forgiving, more lenient, and is willing to treat me as an adult and let me have some more indepedance then my mother.
Overall, I sort of feel lost, as I just feel as I am just becoming angrier and more anti social the longer I live with her. She started yelling at me again to do yard work and I put up a fight, saying I'll do it later leave me alone, and then she turned to insulting my clothes and my hair style, and I told her to shut her mouth as she didn't have anything nice to say
I know have to figure out how to get to school and work tomorrow due to lack of car. And she won't even speak to me.

Everything was going great until 2027 when he tore his back CCL (cruciate ligament). We got the (very expensive) surgery and he healed well considering his age. The next year he started developing immune issues and has been cycling through eye infections, ear infections and skins infections (and tonnes of antibiotics, lotions and potions) ever since. Then almost a year to date of his first CCL surgery, he tore the ligament in his other back leg and required the surgery again. He healed slower this time but still amazingly well for his age. 

A few years ago he was also diagnosed with a grade 4 heart murmur, which was recently been upgraded to a 5. We got xrays done and his heart is only slightly enlarged but the scan revealed that he has a collapsed trachea. Neither condition seemed to affect him unless he had a collar on or had pressure on his chest, which caused a bit of coughing and hacking (dry vomit).

That was until yesterday morning...when he had a severe coughing attack and was struggling to breathe. He flopped to the ground and couldn’t move for about 10mins. I was in tears. I had the day off work to monitor him and he had sporadic coughing throughout the day and then one more horrifying attack at midday. It was so bad that I organised an at home euthanasia appointment for today. But since last night he’s gone back to his happy lazy self (only a couple of small coughs in 12 hours) so I cancelled the euthanasia appointment and instead have an at home vet appointment booked for this evening. 

He has lost most of his hearing, but still can see very well and has an amazing sense of smell. He sleeps most of the day, but seems quite content otherwise. He is still eating and drinking fine and has total control over his bowels and bladder.  He is still very happy to see his humans and loves snuggling up and sleeping with me.

83,"I have a situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my final year at university, writing my dissertation (thesis). I have plans to enter into a masters degree in September, yet to apply. In order to be accepted I need at least a 2:1 overall in my undergrad (60%). I was on track however this year things have gone downhill, I've been dealing with depression and my attendance and grades have plummeted. I'm on the brink of falling off my baseline of 60% overall. Basically, the modules I've already completed this year are averaging just below 60%, so my dissertation needs to pull my grade up. I also still have one more exam in a few weeks time.

&amp;#x200B;

I started counseling with a service my university operates a few weeks ago, from this I realized how my mental health was effecting my work, so applied for an extension on my dissertation. The extension was granted and my deadline was pushed back. It's in 2 days time, however I'm still far from being done and what I have done is not reflective of my true work, and I believe it's more than likely if I can complete the dissertation then it will be well below the 60% I need. I have spoken to my faculty and they have told me that I can submit a second extenuating circumstances form to try get a referral summer submission which is not capped at 40% since it will technically still be my first attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

The question I am asking myself is - by relying on a summer submission, will my chances of being accepted into the masters degree be significantly reduced? I'm weighing up the possibility of getting less than 60% with the chance that my application may be compromised by a summer submission. (I have a house booked for the next academic year, as well as a presumed graduation planned.) - Which option should I lean on?",15May2019,2
84,"My father and I use to be best friends. I even had a great relationship with my stepmother. When they moved out of state however, they became addicted to heavy pain killers. My stepmother takes a plethora of pain medicines, benzodiazepines, and drinks at night. 

My dad has only seen my daughter (his granddaughter) 2 times her whole life. She is 4. He makes no desperate attempts to be in our lives other than the occasional Birthday Card or Holiday phone call. My stepmother has said some very hurtful things about me and about my mother who passed away 4 years ago due to an accidental drug overdose. My stepmother is a ""Christian"" and very pro Trump and has accused me of stealing her xanax the last time they traveled here. She has also admitted that her and my father do not like my husband in which my husband just says ""good riddance."" But i really feel bad about that because he is such a great husband and father.

Anyway now that you know the backstory,
I am pregnant again and my blood pressure is a bit high lately. I know one thing that is contributing to this is the fact that my dad and stepmother are planning to travel here for July 4th. My grandmother has already put a guilt trip on me... telling me I better be around to see them and not to leave her alone with my stepmother. But my grandmother invited them to stay in their home.... I love my grandparents and they raised me, and now I won't feel comfortable going there when my dad is there. They are toxic people and I don't want my stepmother around my daughter...i am also hormonal and feel like I might go off on her if she makes her usual passive rude comments...especially about my pregnant body or trying to give herself credit as a grandmother!!! God help me.

My husband and I are trying to think of an excuse to get out of this. 

Any ideas?",15May2019,1

I am a college kid home for the summer and I work at a restaurant as a hostess and am now training at a gym to work at the desk. I make more Money at the restaurant and was just offered a position as a waitress making even more money but I wold be working 6 shifts a week. The gym needs people and my sister also works there and got me the job. The gym is a half hour a way and I make minimum wage. I have worked at the restaurant for 5 years and they are like family to me there so I defiantly want to keep all those shifts. I feel like I cannot work basically three jobs.  I would be making a ton of money this summer but would be killing myself and not having any fun while im still young.

I’m really lucky because my husband makes good money and if it where up to him I would just stay home (we don’t have children). I won’t do that, though.

I am not complaining, i own my own home and have more than one car. I never go without but sometimes I feel like I could be better and do more.

It's very loose, and dying (to where he doesn't seem to feel it much when I wiggle it gently, and it's now dark brown/grey at both the root and tip).

He's apparently too old (he'll be 21 in a couple months) to go under anesthetic to have the tooth removed, but at this point it's so loose, I'm almost tempted to try to pull it myself sometimes to see if it will just come out.

He's still eating his crunchy food as he wishes throughout the day, though I've opted to give him a small portion of wet food at the end of the days now, just to prevent him from loosing weight (which he's currently healthy at) just in case it hurts more to eat the dry food than he's let on. He does still seem to do good at grooming himself too, so while it can't possibly be too comfortable, he's also not so uncomfortable that I'd consider such a high risk to his life to fix the issue.

102,"I know many people would simply say to avoid that family member. That or are curious as to how they are manipulative. I don't want to make this a long post. Just want to know if what I am doing is right.

I have a cousin that I used to consider my best friend. Over the past years it seemed that we are drifting farther apart. Although when asked I have to put on a smile and say that we haven't changed. 

She firsted started with secrets. I don't mind if you keep secrets from me. I have secrets of my own and I understood that some things she liked to keep to herself. Family issues and simple struggles that she faced emotionally were among the few. I told her that she can talk to me if she need. And that I would not judge her for any of it. However as time went on she stopped talking. She kept everything a secret. Days she was busy, events that she attended, and even her medical issues were all kept from me. 

Now I will explain why this confused me. I don't want to be texting her while she is spending the night and hanging out with her friends. That should be their time and I know how it feels. I would hate to do that when she is supposed to spend time with them. Many of her friends would get mad at me because of this. Which is completely understandable. The only issue was she never informed me. Secondly she was getting a surgery done on her nose. I learnt from her mother and my other family members that she had a deviated septum and needed surgery. I wanted to be supportive and not knowing made me feel like a failure.

She would receive honors and awards. Only for me to find out as I went to visit. I was proud of her but confused why she left that out. I would love to have went and seen the accomplishments but again she never invited me. Only to have her mother boast about it.

Secrets I understand. And I was assuming that she wanted to grow up and leave me out on those things. Which is understandable. But then after awhile there was bullying. And I mean the genuine emotional and verbal abuse.

She would laugh at my mistakes. When I stuttered she mimicked me. When I spelt something wrong she would laugh and make fun of it. Then bring up to everyone. When I said a word wrong she would repeat that word over and over again. I became insecure and felt stupid around her. But because she was my cousin I forgave her.

Then it got worse. And I mean way worse. She blamed me for her depression. That I stress her out and that when I talk to her all I do is make things worse for her. When I would cut myself I never showed her but it would show itself from time to time. She would tell me that I hurt her when I do that. That she doesn't understand why I would cut when I was stressed. 

Afterwards she would then proceed to change subjects and make jokes. She would tell me how ugly I was. And when I would have panic attacks she would stand and watch me. She would not look concerned but rather confused. 

One day I told her that one of her friends was bullying. That she started spreading rumors that I slept with her and how I was a lesbian. She would make fun of me and say how I was crazy and controlling. She only said I didn't know that and that was it. When her friend proceeded to bully me I ended up walking in on the friend and my cousin. This friend proceed to make horrible jokes about how I was fat and ugly. Only to see my cousin do nothing. I asked why she didnt stand up for me. Her excuse was that she promised to stay with this friend forever.

I was hurt that she would let this happen and said that I didnt appreciate that she would let someone say that about me and her not defend me. And that if she wanted to be around her friend that is fine but I don't think I could handle it knowing that she said the things she did. So I won't be hanging out with her at school. After the talk my cousin decided that she only wanted to sit with me on Tuesdays and Thursdays. While the other days she would be with her friend at lunch. However I found out that Tuesdays and Thursdays meant her friend would be sitting with us as well. 

I understand she has friends but being forced to sit with someone who clearly hates me just to keep my cousin and her happy was a bit much. However the lies was what really broke me.

Recently I had found out that she has been lying to me for a year. She would tell me that she was gay and that she understands my struggle. That she also had anxiety and depression. That she would not shave in fear that she would cut herself. She mentioned that she had to stop seeing her counselor because she also hated talking to her counselor. And that she was no longer friends with the girl that bullied me. 

All of which were lies. I found out that the guy she said she would never date was her boyfriend. And that they started to go on dates. And the counselor that she supposedly stopped seeing was still seeing her. And that she had never told my cousin she was ok.

Now this may seem stupid to a lot of people but she also has no care for me at all. She says she cares but when I have days of extreme depression she says to get better soon and avoids me for days. Only to text me a few days later to talk about some random story or idea she had. 

She only seems to need me when it benefits her. When I get upset and stop texting she gets upset and makes a huge text about how she is sorry for whatever she did. She never apologizes for anything she does or when she hurts me. When I cry she just sits there and changes subjects. She knew one day I had it rough and snickered at me. 

I cant avoid her since she is our neighbor. When I stop talking she gets upset and then I get in trouble for avoiding her. When I talk to much I get called controlling and forceful. I just don't know what to do. I have had so many things happen to me thanks to her. She has done many more things to me. Many of which I can't talk about. She has done things to me that I have never told anyone but my sister. And yet I am forced to pretend she doesn't hurt me. 

I want to know what to do. Should I go to my counselor and talk about everything? Should I just forgive and forget? Or am I really in the wrong? 

Thank you to anyone who read all of this. I know it is long and has errors but I am just so confused. If you have any questions I am willing to answer. Thank you again.",15May2019,1
103,"For some background info., my boyfriend has a lot of baggage from his past relationship in which he was cheated on. He has some trust issues and I got out of a controlling relationship so I struggle to give him the things he asks for, like going through my phone, etc. I'm not hiding anything, I just think he should trust me and that him going through my stuff continually isn't healthy. To me, he is really emotional and needs a lot of emotional support that I just can't empathize with or understand.

109,"Hello fellow redditors, if you are reading this the something is really wrong with you. Anywho, I came today to find some reconciliation within some of you; truth is, I need help.

See it all started way back when, well 3 months ago, when I found out that my brother's father was a murderer and killed a family of 3. Things have really gone downhill since then, hell, I didn't even know the guy, neither did my brother. Yet, it still hit us a like a ton of bricks. Never had a seen or heard of someone near our family that would do such a despicable thing. That didn't bother me, what did bother me was my brother. He is normal the resilient one, but not this time. It was sad to hear, but it hurts to no end how he almost committed suicide. He told my mom, ""I think I'm just going to go home and shoot myself,"" god damn, it hurts to write. I couldn't believe it when I heard it, nothing had ever jeopardized our brothership quite like this. I was speechless, it hurt me to no end, how one person you see and love could be gone the very next day. A couple months before that didn't help either, when I head that my best friend since I was little was going to commit suicide himself. He had even written a special note just for me, take his life in a closet to not be seen.

On top of that, I have been having issues at school. I can't seem to make friends; I find that my weird just draws people away. Honestly, the world is kinda screwy right now. For the first time I am actually confiding within someone, maybe a therapist here and there, but I can't seem to find help. Stress has over taken my life to the extreme, I can't seem to find happiness in anything.

 Don't even get my started on girl troubles, never in my life have I experienced such a mental strife. I try my hardest to get someone to like me, but nothing seems to work. Honestly, I think I am starting to develop a inferiority complex. It's not the confidence, it it about finding the right person, no-one seems interested in me in the slightest. I try my best to impress, but to no avail. 

Don't even get me started on the other guys, nothing ever works to make myself seem valuable in any way, and it is starting to get toxic. It is hard to keep up with friends, I can't feel loved, my family doesn't believe in me. Mostly my father, he doesn't think that my opinion matters in any way, everything is my fault, all of my other brother and sisters are perfect angels while I sit and rot. Even when it is the tiniest little gripe, he will bring it up somehow.

Sadly, for the first time in my life, I don't know where to go. Everyone tells me to be myself, but if they don't like my real self then where do I go? You want me to be myself yet, you hate who I truly am. Why? Why do people constantly do this to me? Never have I felt so alone then now, so, where do I go?

To summarize, I need help with girls, life, and stress, that's all. No, if you are wondering, I'm not thinking about committing suicide myself, trust me it is a dark path I will never follow. I have more stories if you are interested, anyway, thanks for wandering by and reading this.

When it comes to music I would say I am pretty good but I just do not know where to go from here. I am currently in a band working on making music that I would say sounds really good, but its rock and I do not know if the dream of making music is a reliable career due to it being rock music and the career of music being so rocky. My parents are really pushing me to go to college but I have no clue what to major in. I enjoy math and science but I loved music and creating music since I was kid I just do not know how financially stable of career that is and have been made very aware of that since I started to take it seriously. I feel like music school is a waste of money and in a regular college I feel like I would not be smart enough. On my first SAT I got an 1160 and my grades are below average due the stress of taking mostly AP classes and balancing time management between sleep social life which I cut off this year music pretty much everyday of the week (I am in a music program that plays shows and practices for context) and school.

First of all, I am in need of this vent right now. I dont have many people to talk with on these types of topics.

Me ( 19 ) and this girl ( 19, way out of my league ) have been lowkey liking eachother here and there since about 2 years ago. At first glance it was played off as a joke, but then got serious when we were drunk and almost hooked up about 5 months ago. Social pressure also helped alot in our class. Here and there at parties we would start to make out regurarly. Here is where I started to really like this girl. I even invited her on to a date, but it really came off as a friends thing. Whatever.

There was a dry period for about 2 months but then last week we both went to a party again and made out alot and she finally blatantly asked me if I wanted to have sex with her ( holy shit ). Stupidly enough, i declined because i was too drunk and couldnt drive home. Missed my second shot, but whatever. Atleast I got what I wanted, now just needed to invite her over some day and just do it.

The whole week after that party we were really into eachother, like a passive aggressive type. In class she would just stare at me and I would stare at her back and sometimes we would just stare at eachother and just smile. We then moved on to playful blowing kisses and moving eachother out of the way, again in a playful way.

Yesterday, i did not go to school because they were just doing a fashion type day where everyone dressed up funny and took pictures with eachother, i decided to stay home to study for finals. I then just looked instagram and she had posted a picture with one of my best friends. Not like a normal picture.. like one where you could just see through her massive smile and the way he grabbed her that something else was just going on. Also captions full of love emojis ( but she does that in every post. ) In the comments though, my friend also blatantly posted a red heart ( which is, for us teens, a serious emoji ( i know, lol )).

But before i proceed a little backstory. In the beginning of our 2 years, the girl i love and my best friend used to sit together in class and talk all the time, nothing serious. About a month ago she started to openly make jokes about her wanting to do a threesome with me and my best friend ( thats when i thought that it was a little out of line ). Even after that, month and a half ago she also started to tell my best friend how cute he looked with a grown beard, long hair, etc.

Now, both are the type of personality that dont really care about others feelings, they strive to their own interest. If my best friend had a chance to have sex with a cute girl such as her, he would do it in an instant. On her side, im not so sure, but she also really does not give a fuck and is really sexually driven.

Im sitting here now, actually the saddest i felt in a long time just staring at the damn instagram post. The way they smile together. The comment. Thinking about how the jokes she made in class actually mean something. Thinking about how eeven though my best friend knows i love her, and even gave me advice on it all, just doesnt care. Thinking about how even her, that also knows that i have feelings for her and asked me a week ago if i wanted to have sex with her just moved on from me already or just ... . I cant take it mentally. I have wasted 5 hours just thinking about all the things we did together, about how i thought we had a little thing going ( relationship was not gonna work ether way, but we knew that ), a casual thing. And just before we might actually have sex together, just.. dont care for me anymore. Dont care about my feelings? You gotta understand, im really more dependant now, than i think she is to me. With every moment we shared i got a little more dependant. And now im just. I dont know, i feel like ive been in a non official relationship with her for a while now but she just. I cant come up with words at the moment.

116,"Hi all, I have an exec that runs the other team in our department and he has been very kind to me. My manager started by setting up an intro for me to meet him and Ive taken it from there. Ive been to his office a total of 4 times out side the initial meeting in the 6 weeks Ive been here. One was to share some ideas I had. The next he told me to stop by his office because he wanted to open me up to an opportunity within the company and told me to contact 4 people to ask some questions. That was last Thursday. 

Since then, Ive been in his office twice. Once on Monday and once Tuesday. Monday I stopped by and let him know that I had spoken to all but one an would follow up with him tomorrow, then Tuesday to let him know I spoke to all and was ready for him to set up the introduction with the program director which he said he would do. After leaving his office today his admin assistant (very nice girl) stopped me and said if I wanted to keep meeting with him to just set up some actual mentoring times because he is a very busy person. I don't think she knew about the situation but I just said I okay. I've been thinking about it a lot this afternoon and have thought, maybe I have been overstepping my boundaries just knocking on his office door like that. That is always something I am cautious of because I know how busy people in general are, especislly him but thought with this opprotunity I had to keep him updated on my progress to show I was taking the initiative and this opprotunity seriously. Anyway, reddit, am I overstepping my boundaries with this exec?

119,"Hi guys. So, roughly a year ago, I took action on my sudden interest in guys and decided to 'come out' to my friends and family as gay. It was all good, and no one was really against me being gay. All is good.

Except now I'm here, a year later, rethinking on my decision on what sexuality I... 'am.' The problem isn't gay or straight, because I know I like guys and that isn't seeming to change. I have romantic interest in guys and it's obvious, plus I've persued relationships with guys before, so people for sure know I'm not straight.

In fact, I was told I had like ""gay energy"" radiating from me, aka my coming out was expected by everyone, including my parents. Which might explain why everyone was so chill about it.

So I know I like guys, but my real orientation issue here is if I swing both ways or just one. Gay or bi? I came out knowing full on that I was young, and that this all could be wildly different in the years coming, everyone (including my school counselor) told me that could happen. I never denied it was possible, but I denied it'd happen to me.

Kinda wish I took that advice and just said I didn't know quite yet.

My big issue is that I came out early. Prematurely. I didn't give myself enough time to fully plan out and think out who I was and who I liked, and I gave myself a deadline. April 1st, so I could claim it was an April Fool's joke in case anyone wasn't 'pro-gay.' 

But since I came out early, it's biting me in the ass and it's not in the most attractive ""biting ass"" manner either. I deeply regret not giving myself sufficient time to think and also not putting in sufficient effort to finding myself out. I just assumed since I had romantic / sexual interest in guys, I must be gay! 

Except I was wrong to think that.

I'm 80% sure I'm bi. Hell, I still don't have a clear idea on what's going on. I'm young, so of course that's happening.

Now I'm on the edge of either living like I'm actually gay or just coming clean to those who know me well. Coming clean to friends and family alike, and telling them I can't make any finalized decisions yet.

Problem with coming clean is that it's been a year where I assumed I was gay. I had a little bit of unsureness with bi vs gay but I mainly ignored it, as my sexuality was just nagging on me and all I wanted to do was come out and let that be the end of it. I know now I shouldn't have.

I feel like it's too late to do anything about it. People mainly recognize me as the gay person in many friend groups, and people very plainly admit I act incredibly '''gay.''' I feel like saying I may or may not actually be bi would be, like, lying to them. I feel like they would think I lied to them about being gay, which I wasn't intending for things to change. 

I also worry that I might (somehow??) lose friends after they realize I'm not full gay but like, half assed gay. I worry that some of my close friends were just using me as a gay best friend, because I KNOW people do that.

Please help. I want to post to my snap story and come clean in a short, concise, and very relaxed / nonchalant manner to make things as smooth as possible. But I worry what might happen...",15May2019,1

121,"I feel really bad about something that happened tonight. Me and a friend were skateboarding around tonight, it was close to 9pm when we heard someone screaming for help on the road we were on.

A older man was screaming “help!” next to his motorcycle when he saw me and my friend and yelled “help me lift it!” a few times.

He did not reply to me, so I sent him a reminder the day before but still he didnt give me a time. On the day at 12pm, he sent me an email and said ""are we okay for 2pm?"". I told him that I couldn't make it and that if I had known before I would have arranged.

We tried to arrange for another date, we didnt manage so I didn't get to have the interview. Fast forward a couple of weeks later, I get a phone call from a different person in the same company. He asked me to come in for an interview so we arranged the date. 

I went for the interview and they told me that person who I spoke to and was supposed to interview me did not come in because he was sick. I was angry that I was not notified about this and went there for nothing. 

Now, he contacted me saying sorry for the inconvenience and that his calendar did not sync or whatever and asked me to arrange for another day.

129,"I’m an 18 year old male. Yesterday I went on Omegle and entered “Snapchat” as an interest. Someone said she was 18f so I added her. Her first message was a topless selfie showing her face and breasts. We began sexting and I sent her a dick pic and she sent me a picture of her vagina. Then she said “mirror for mirror?” and sent a picture of herself naked in a mirror. So I took one of myself and sent it back to her. She screenshotted that snap, and I immediately regretted including my face. I did not include any identifying information on Omegle or Snapchat, but if someone who recognized my face or my room saw that picture they would know it was me. After she screenshotted the message she said “wow daddy so hot” (which seemed a little weird to me because I’m pudgy and she seemed pretty hot) and then she left me on read when I asked her to keep the screenshot to herself. Several hours later I said “So are you a catfish or something? I’m just trying to figure out what your play here is.” And she said “Nooe I am horny” which kinda seems like a message a non-native English speaker would send but idk. So then I said “So you’re not planning to do anything with that picture?” And she said “Nooe” (again with that odd spelling). Then I said “Just so I know it’s you, do you mind taking a selfie holding 4 fingers up?” And she left me on read. Today I said “Sorry for freaking out yesterday. I kinda regretted sending my face.” in an attempt to reopen contact. She left me on read again. I didn’t screenshot any of her messages or save my own messages, so I can’t use reverse google image search to find out if the snaps she sent me were stolen from someone else, or find out if she has uploaded the picture that she screenshotted.

I know I made a big mistake sending my face, and ever since she screenshotted it I have been feeling anxious about it. I just don’t know if she really is the person in the pictures she sent me. Her pictures had the red Snapchat icon, indicating they had been taken in the camera, not uploaded from the camera roll, although that can be spoofed. I just want her to keep that photo to herself, or better yet, delete it, but I have no way of knowing if she will, or if she’ll share it around.

So, I'm about to end my year 2 in High school out of three (In México there's only 3 years of High school). I Also have a Mother with bipolar issues and a gambling addiction. She is a very toxic person in my life and constantly gets off in letting all of her anger out with my brothers and myself. This (obviously) has proven to me multiple times that that kind of environment is gonna end up either damaging me for life or killing me.

Since I've known them, I've been a good and trustworthy friend of the whole family.

After my friend heard what happened (and had been happening Since we met around 2 years ago), he gave me the serious offer of staying with him and his brothers in his house when their parents left. He later told me that he asked one of the two siblings And said that she would love to. He would only need to ask the other sibling if he was cool with it or not, but that he probably would be okay.

139,"To put a long story short, I’m 20 years old and my life is extremely fucking boring. To understand what I’m going through, let’s jump back 7 years to when I was 13. I realize how ripe of an age this is for most people, and maybe this contributes to why I am the way I am now, but my life was exciting as fuck to say the least. 

I was dating and having sex with beautiful women, some of them almost twice my age. I had a big circle of friends that always had something going on, and I was attending either a house party or a local club as a VIP guest. It’s also probably helpful to mention that I was doing a lot of drugs at the time.

It’s easy to say that my life from 13 until about 17 was what most grown men only dream of. Fast forward to now: I’m genuinely attempting to build my life for the future, which includes creating positive habits such as sleeping and waking up early, meditating, working out, journaling and overall anything that will make me a more driven human being.

I’m still drinking, which I’ve tried to stop on multiple occasions without success. But that’s besides the point. My life isn’t necessarily bad, I have a fit body and an attractive face, but my life now simply doesn’t live up to the hype that it used to. I have close to no friends.

I’ve felt like this for a few years now, eventually leading up to severe depression and getting professional help so that I don’t commit suicide. It’s not quite that severe anymore, however I still have a feeling that I can’t shake: Life will never be exciting for me. I hate this. Any advice?

So starting when I was younger, around maybe 6-9 years old (I don't remember exactly when, I repressed it for a while) my brother tried to make me do sexual things with him. He sat me down in my parents bathroom and made me ""kiss like in the movies"" and French kissed me and fondled me. One day he locked me in there, holding me back by my arms, saying he'd give me a shiny Lugia pokemon card(my favorite pokemon) if I sucked on his penis. I didn't know what it meant, but it felt wrong. So I freaked out and started crying and when he realized he couldn't convince me he let me go.

I have no idea if he remembers he did this to me. But its haunted me my whole life, it gave me a really unhealthy mindset about sex at a young age; I was weirdly obsessed with it. I went through therapy due to other mental health reasons and this got addressed and (seemingly) resolved. I found it in myself to forgive him, even though I still feel the trauma from my big brother doing that to me.

Fast forward to now, we're really close friends. His close friend group is now also my close friend group, we have tons of hobbies and interests in common, like video games and movies and nerd stuff. We both still live at home, but I hope to move out at the end of the year. 

He has no job, hasn't had a girlfriend in probably a decade, and never leaves the house unless him and I are going somewhere with our friends or just us. When it's just us, he wants people to see that I'm with him, like he shows me off. 

He has said in the past to his friends that his ideal type of girl is someone exactly like me. I only know he said this because he told me so, out of literally nowhere. When our friends are being gross and making incest jokes bc of how close friends we are, he doesn't defend me or get upset with them like I do. He just happens to be near the bathroom everytime I shower, when the bathroom I use is on a different floor from his bedroom. I've also caught him watching me and staring at me when I'm in my comfy clothes at home, with is usually shorts and a t-shirt. But I've been brushing all this off as me being paranoid for years now.

It's been getting to a point where I feel like he is weirdly attached to me. Before, we were just very close siblings, now he's almost clingy. And it's awful because he's Always. Home. I don't get a break from him unless I'm at work.

Now, the whole reason I'm asking for advice is because about 5 days ago I got home from work and seeing a fwb. This guy I saw is a total shithead and I did not have an orgasm from being with him so late that night I decided to masturbate really quickly to take the edge off. I heard my brother listening to me. I'm very quiet during that kind of thing and my bedroom door was shut. He was not quiet. I've also found out that he's told his twitch chat and some random friends that I'm his girlfriend, not his sister. I am absolutely disgusted and I feel so violated and I feel all the feelings from when I was younger coming back.

I don't want to look at him, be anywhere near him, talk to him, or have anything to do with him. I'm furious and embarrassed. But I also don't want to lose my friendship I've made with his friends, and I'm very upset that I will lose my friendship with my brother, after all this time and all I went through to be close with him.

TL:DR
My older brother tried to sexually assault me as a child. Now, as an adult still living at home with us, he has incestuous thoughts about me and I caught him listening to me in my private time and telling people I'm his girlfriend. I am horrified and I have no idea what to do about any of this.",15May2019,1

149,"Over the past year have designated a journal for the sole purpose of a personal ""dictionary"". I jot down certain words and their definition that I find interesting, want to remember, learn and resort to sometimes while writing. 

I have around one hundred words thus far, but my journal lacks typical structure/categorization that one may expect when compiling random words and their definitions. 

I think words placed alphabetically would only be useful for aesthetic's sake (and potentually OCD individuals) -- referencing back to my journal for a particular definition (idea of) would be of little success if it was alphabetical, unless I knew the first letter of the word that I have in mind at the time. Usually I reference to my journal of words or even an internet search with only an idea of the definition of the word I'm trying to conjure up in mind. 
Plus, I would have to layout a journal alphabetically prior to writing in any words, and then I would probably run out of space for certain letters before others.
Maybe try to categorize words based off of their definitions in a broader sense?

I made the very bad choice of dating my best friend not so long ago. (i’m 14, btw)

So I broke up with him because of that, telling him that I just wanted us to be friends. I told our friend in common about the « real reason », and, unsurprisingly, he told my ex-boyfriend.

160,"Alright. This is a bit of an odd story so bear with me. 

For a little background, I go to a magnet school at the local community college. It’s a pretty exclusive school (you have to apply, have good grades, get interviewed etc. to get in). We have a comparatively low number of students compared to most high schools (only about 230). Just thought I would add this in here so you realize its not the typical high school environment. Anyways, onto.  the story. 

I’ve kinda had a crush on this girl for a while, but I’ve always been too nervous to act on it. My junior prom was a few weeks ago, and neither of us had a date. One of my best friends, his girlfriend, and my crush are all dancing in a circle to a fast song. Everyone seems to be having a good time.

Here’s where things get interesting. A slow song comes on and my friend and his girlfriend pair off and start slow dancing. Here I am staring at the girl of my dreams thinking “Well, what do I do now”. I’ve always been shy, but something pushed me into asking her to dance. She says yeah and we dance. Not like awkward dancing, but hand holding slow dancing. It was awesome. 

Song ends and we head back to the table. My crush isn’t actually there to be at prom, she’s running the snack bar thingy (she’s a sophomore). My friend and I are chatting with some more mutual friends and everything seems to be going great. My friend’s girlfriend heads to the bathroom and my crush follows. Friend’s girlfriend comes back and said my crush was apparently talking about me in the bathroom. I don’t know exactly what was said, but the TL;DR is she thinks I’m cool.

Fast forward a few songs and another slow one comes on. I ask crush to dance in an admittedly cringe way saying “May I have this dance”. It’s fine tho because I’m from the south and a real country bumpkin. Anyway, she smiled and said Sure. We dance again and everything seems right in the world. I twirl her a few times, she seems to be having a good time and all is right in the world. 

The night ends and I get her number. THIS IS WHERE IT SHOULD END. 

The next day I wait a bit and shoot her a text around lunchtime, nothing crazy, I was just like how are you this morning. I’m thinking I like her, she seemed to like me, what could go wrong. 

She never responds. 

Now here we are, two weeks later. Ive caught her staring at me at school, yet still no response. I have no classes with her since I’m a Junior and she’s a sophomore so I only see her at lunch. I’m afraid of approaching her bc I’m shy and she had to have ignored my text for a reason.  Right?

I’m not what most would consider a physically attractive person. I’m pretty tall for my age, but kinda overweight. I like to think I’m pretty funny and smart, but that can get you so far in terms of high school. This girl is, not exaggerating, the prettiest person I’ve ever met. There’s the expression of someone being out of your league, and that’s what’s happening here. In this situation I’m the equivalent of a little league pitcher trying to play in the MLB. 

I’m likely overthinking this, but I really like her and I don’t want to screw this up. She’s gorgeous, we have a lot in common, it seems like the perfect setup. This should be simple, only it’s not.

So here I am pleading Reddit, where do I go from here?",15May2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a non-progressive state and work for a company that is privately owned with about 120 employees. I am around 27 and I worked here for the last 6 years, so it was basically my first job out of college. Last month I sent out a few applications, literally just 5, and I was surprised that I actually just got a job offer from a great company with way more opportunities. My current company pays me around 100k and the new company will as well (keeping this deliberately vague). The new company wants me to start in 3 weeks exactly. My dilemma revolves around some weird details that are making me wonder what I should do about giving my notice to my current employer.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss of many years was fired about a month ago and I had an understanding with him about plans to go on a few big overseas trips with my wife. BUT, I had no PTO/vacation time saved up and he was going to work it so that I could still go on the trips by ""selling the concept to management"" and in the end he was probably going to let me claim some of the trip as ""working from home"" etc as long as I got a few things done. He was very easy to work with. When he got fired my coworkers and I were shocked considering he was in charge of 60 of us out of 120 total employees... I had to explain to my new boss that I had two huge trips already booked and I had no PTO saved for them. She approved both trips, which I understand because she is pretty new and really had no choice since I am a ""star"" employee. So now I've gone on one of the trips and my PTO is at -80 hrs (yes, \*negative\* 80). I also have another trip scheduled for all of next week that will take me to negative \~120. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, out of nowhere, I have this new job offer and I've accepted it. I start in 3 weeks. I'm worried about giving my notice because (1) they might just be overall furious and that isn't fun, (2) I'm sure I won't end up getting paid for my time during next week's trip since it would be weird to grant PTO for an employee who is already negative and ending their employment a week after that trip, (3) I'm worried they will be so mad that they will walk me out of the office right when I give my notice and then I will go 3 whole weeks without pay which would suck. They have walked lots of employees out in the past when those employees gave their two-week notices. Usually they do this when someone quits after like 8 months and we ended up getting nothing out of them other than spending time/money training them.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering what to do... When should I give notice? How much notice should I give? Can they somehow charge me for the negative 80 hours of PTO I already have racked up by maybe not giving me my next paycheck that I've already earned? Is it okay for me to give very short notice on the rationale that they deserve no quarter given that they've walked out people who gave notice in the past (and those people then go without pay for their notice period)?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear about the timeline:

&amp;#x200B;

1. This week -- I'm working

&amp;#x200B;

2. Next week -- international recreational trip that is going to be PTO even though I'm already \*\*-\*\*100 hours of PTO

&amp;#x200B;

3. Week after that -- would be my final week working here as I start at the new company the following monday",15May2019,1

177,"I met my best friend at work, we became really close really quick, spending most of our time together, we then moved in together and I started a new relationship with a man I’ve known since high school.

Since then it was me juggling spending time with my partner and my best friend, often my best friend would become cold, distant and stand offish whenever I was with my boyfriend or he was at the house visiting. 

This led to a lot of arguments and her telling me she feels like she’s “losing me”

Over the past year of us living together she has brought up conversations of us living together in the future and asking me how long I would want to live with her. I told her I don’t know as I cant predict what happens in the future, she would get upset and almost demand me to give her a time frame.

Whenever something has upset her, she treats me as though I am a stranger, often making me question myself. When I ask her if I have done anything wrong, she will immediately act as though and make me feel as though its all in my head until she finally admits she is upset. This gives me a lot of anxiety and often I end up crying because I feel like I am constantly tip toeing around her and watching what I say or do because I’m always upsetting her.. This brings me to why I am questioning if this friendship is toxic.

It’s nearing the end of our lease and after much arguments and her being upset, she told me she was going to take up an offer her mum has given her, her mum was going to buy a unit for her to live in. I was really happy for her and supported her with that decision. My partner and I then discussed our future and decided him and I wanted to live together alone and start our life together. One night my best friend asked me out of no where if my boyfriend and I would live together with her with the unit her mum was buying, I politely declined the offer and stated my boyfriend and I just want to live alone seeing as we are nearing our 30’s and we’re just ready for our own space. My best friend did not take that well and for the next week was very distant and cold and awkward with me. I felt incredibly saddened that my best friend could be acting this way for something I am choosing to do with my life. 

One night she made me dinner and the whole time was saying things like “see you won’t have be around to cook you dinner anymore when we don’t live together” I felt incredibly awkward when she said it and laughed it off and said its fine because I can cook (which I can, I’m quite a good cook) and then the day after while eating the leftovers, she stated “at least you won’t need me cos you’re a good cook” basically mocking me about it. I felt so uncomfortable. 

After a few days, she was acting incredibly off and admitted to me finally that she went into my bedroom and read my diary, that I sometimes rant in about her to get this off my chest.. so she read some things in there that weren’t very nice, things about her being incredibly blunt and rude with me for no reason and how it makes me feel miserable, and how she often uses me as a punching bag when she’s upset with someone else, aka takes it all out on me.

I forgave her for invading my privacy and we seemed to be going on the right track, she seemed to have accepted that we won’t be living together. But now she has been bringing up things like wanting to see me at least once every week and talked about wanting a key to my house (in case of emergencies?) and how would I feel if she just showed up to my house unexpected. I don’t know how to tell her that life gets busy and I probably won’t end up seeing her every week and thats just not realistic with time, work and other priorities. I’m terrified to talk to her about things like this because of the backlash I get of her being rude and blunt with me for days on end making it really awkward and makes my anxiety sky rocket.

She often states her I am “her” person and she’s incredibly attached to me and thats why not living with me is very scary for her. I sometimes feel as though I’m in a relationship with her and seeing my boyfriend on the side, she is incredibly clingy and jealous of almost everything I do. I don’t know if this friendship is something that can be worked on or needs to end.

And yes, I have discussed with her in the past about personal space and she takes it the wrong way. I feel constantly mentally drained and exhausted.

Thantophobia- fear of death

TLDR at bottom
——————————————————————————-

Most of my fear is religion based as I’m terrified of the idea of hell. Endless, inescapable suffering for eternity is a punishment so gruesome it’s unfathomable. I thought I was safe until middle school when I found out I am bisexual. I live in constant fear that once I die I’ll be subjected to torture for something I have no control over. I didn’t choose to be this way and have often considered going to a conversion camp to rid myself of a one way ticket to hell. 

It’s always there. No matter what I do I feel like I’m going to hell. No matter how many commandments I follow, how many people I help, or how hard I pray I’m doomed. I’ve accepted that I’m probably going to hell and I’m just waiting until I die. 

Besides crippling me with feelings of impending doom, this has also impacted my relationship with God. Which only convinces me that I’m going to hell by fueling my doubts about the validity of my religion, which if the church has anything to say about it, is a sin. 

The further I get from God the more sins (drugs &amp; sexual)I commit. It’s not like I’m trying to but I feel pushed away from him. Like the idea of the all loving God I was taught to love is alluring but the repetition of the idea of a vengeful God out to punish sinners in media forces me back. 

Honestly, the whole environmental part of it is simpler. I don’t want to die because it means I’ll go to hell. If human life can no longer be sustained on Earth because of the destruction of the environment then I die. Far sooner than I anticipated (11 years if we don’t get our shit together according to research). 

But I need help as this is impacting my everyday life.I have no motivation for anything anymore and I feel drained of all my passion. My passion was the only thing to keep me going, the only thing that made me feel/ enjoy being alive, without it I feel hollow. Like my only reason to live is cause it’s better than dying. Which is saying something cause I’ve been abused all my life. It makes me wonder what I could’ve done that requires me to suffer in both the living world and afterlife.

What should I do and where should I start?

Things between her and I were rough we would constantly argue and with our already serious mental health issues it quickly became toxic and she would make me feel guilty if I was doing anything else but spending my time with her. 

Eventually I had enough and ended it cutting off all communication with her after breaking up with her. A few months go by and I begin regretting everything and immediately contact her and apologize for the way things ended and left it at that. 

Fast forward to the next day she asks to go out as friends and it was nice but for some reason we were both still very emotional towards one another and we found it hard to be platonic. We had met up once more and went on a walk and we were both talking and reminiscing on good times and one thing led to another  we had the label on it again.  

Now two months later I’m sitting her contemplating everything I love this girl but I feel as if I’m better off on my own especially with dealing with severe mental health issues on both ends.

""I like how killing the dog was the last straw, not the drugs, neglect, etc. 🙄""

The point of my comment was how pathetic it was that Jenelle was finally fired for the murder of the dog, but not for the other awful things she did BEFORE that point. I was not ""minimizing"" the death of the dog, nor defending a murderer, or making excuses for the lunatic who killed an innocent animal.

202,"So there's a bit of backstory here, I'm mostly looking for people who have experience with being in this sort of situation and any recourses they might have to assist me in getting through this sudden fluxation in my confidence. 

First, I'm not a college graduate, or even a student. I attended community college for one semester at best. Though I did well in high school and got accepted into a few colleges (I didn't send out any applications, so that was weird), I had decided early on in my life that unless the world dropped at least a hundred grand unto my lap I wasn't going to waste my time with a degree. If you can't tell, that makes me American. 

The reason this is important is because I am now in a position of moderate power in a health care company. I'm middle management, which I attained with experience and by being really good at my job. My confidence in my skills is usually pretty good. Not that I am arrogant enough to think I'm perfect, I can admit when I'm wrong and that there is also room for growth. I still make stupid mistakes, and I own up to them when they happen. As a leader I believe I should be the one on the bottom of the pyramid, holding everyone else up.

This is stressful philosophy to hold. My teams mistakes become my mistakes, and their success also becomes, in my opinion, our success. Quite often I refuse praise for my work, or avoid conversations involving my achievements with others. This was fine when I was just one of team, even though I was still, back then, a person that others turned to for help and advice. 

Recently, I looked around and I realized that I had trained everyone but four people in the office. I had taught them all, including my manager. It was a startling revelation to have, and I was briefly elated. 

Naturally, that's when the doubts come in. As I said, they've been happening more often. The feeling that I've done everything wrong, that I'm going to be fired because my boss is going to find out that I have no idea what I'm doing. That the only reason why I'm here is because they pitied me, the young woman with no higher education. I know, factually, that none of this is true. 

Recently the sudden influx of doubts happened when I brought attention to our development team a flaw in one of the applications we use for training. Or, what I view as a flaw, because in my opinion it skews the data. The way that I've taught all of my employees to record data isn't supported on the new application. I understand that what they're striving for is consistency. That each employee is taught the same way and do the same things so that the data stays consistent. However, my teams way of doing things has always been more practical. I even received permission from my mentor to bring the concerns forward, because they were the one to approve of our data methods in the first place. However, I did not double check my email with them since it was the end of the work day and I was eager to send out my report and concerns. 

The email I received back isn't very important, but the gist of it is that they brought my own training up as a concern, insinuating that I need to be retaught how to do my job. 

Now, while I'm no stranger to doubts, this one isn't one I can shake, especially after the sudden increase in these feelings of inadequateness. I haven't replied to the email yet, I'm going to bring it up to my mentor tomorrow and see what I can do, but for the last four hours I've been spiraling down a rabbit hole if self doubt, thinking that maybe I should just quit my job and go somewhere else and that any one of the people that I trained could do better than me. Which, it's arrogant of me to assume they can't. 

Regardless, it's never been this bad before, and I'm worried that it's only going to get worse.

I can't think, can barely move, can barely perceive time and how much I'm wasting it. It's causing horrible problems with my friend group because we're all involved in activities that require cooperation and dependability. I can hardly bring myself to care...about the things we need to do, and about them in general, which I know is horrible, and I don't mean to, my friends mean everything to me.

I can't even afford to feed myself good food (I live at home still so it means I'm still eating) It looks like supplementing the nutrients I'm missing would help a lot. Right now I'm looking at Vitamin D tablets as an option.

So has anyone had any experience,  good or bad, with taking Vitamin D relative to their mental health? Are there any other affordable vitamins or supplements or home remedies you've had success with or you think should be avoided?

I am interviewing Thursday for a permanent position at the same institution where I've been an intern for the past year. I currently work as a research engineer, and love it. But as an intern right now my pay could be better, I can only hold the position for 2 years, and there is no opportunity for full time work in my current group. I'm also a little curious to try other kinds of work as I've only ever done research. However, I like my job, and if I wanted to continue that kind of work, it would make the most sense for me to get a PhD. I've even already begun to prepare my applications (this will be the third round of trying to convince myself to apply, but with some time between now and when I finished undergrad I'm much more motivated).

However, I applied to a position in a different group a few months ago. Its been basically radio silence since then, but last week I got a call asking me to come in for an interview. The position is for a test engineer, and would pay nearly double my salary, is full time, and would also fund a master's degree while I work. 

I'm definitely interested in trying a little bit of a different flavor of engineering, but am worried if I take the position and get used to the pay, I won't want to take the cut necessary to return to school for a PhD down the line. This would be kind of barring myself from returning to the world of research. If I won the position, should I take it and push off a PhD, maybe forever, to try something new with more pay, or should I pass and go for the advanced degree to continue in a field I know I enjoy.

I just feel like my grades in high school haven't been too spectacular. I currently have around a 3.3 GPA WEIGHTED! I feel like that's pretty sad. I mean granted, I have only taken 2 ap classes so far, since I'm a softmore, but still. Normally I'm okay in math. And throughout middle school I was a pretty good student. Then I moved across the country abruptly before highschool, and the curriculum and grading system really tripped me up. Going from a top ten state for education, to a 30ish ranked state has been felt. (Even though I went into it with a open mind, and obviously my grades are a reflection of me still.) Now I feel like the quality of my grades have slipped when it really matters. I have grime hopes now. I feel dumb, and subpar.  People have said my grades shouldn't define me, but going to school for the majority of my time and life, it's mostly what I put effort into. Besides my athletics and scouting, (girl scout) I don't really do much else. With that in mind, I feel like they reflect my main achievements at the moment. I feel like a worthless failure, and there's not to much I can do to fix it now. I already screwed up opportunities for myself. I want to try to raise my GPA junior year, but everyone says it is really hard. I want at least a 3.4. Maybe a 3.5. I plan on taking a lot more aps too, so maybe that could positively impact it, considering I will take aps I'm skillful in.

I don't know my point here. I think I just needed to rant. I feel since school is such a big part of a teen's life, how can it not affect my self esteem?",15May2019,1

I have PTSD and anxiety from shit that happened when I was younger and he is just a walking trigger for me. I cant go to their house when he's home.

I (17F) was texted from a close friend (15F) let's call her A. A sends me screenshots of texts between her and our  friend K (17M). 
He had texted her a good bye and things of that nature. I was at work when she sent me the texts, so I didnt see it until about 3hrs later. Convo with her went like this.

Me- "" you need to tell someone"" 
A ""I did""
Me ""Who?""
A ""Another friend (code name D, 18M), and D's parents""
Me ""no, I mean you need to tell someone who can help him.""

K informs us that he wasnt mad and he is glad he was our friend

The reason I am questioning myself is friend D from before said I was over reacting. Basically saying that I did the wrong thing and that people threaten suicide all the time.

So I broke up with my boyfriend 

The first day he saw that I was messaging this guy and flirting with him on social media (we had each other’s passwords) I changed the password but he tried to login. 

The next day he called me begging to meet with him and I did but I just left to go home. He must have called me 200 times. 

The coming week he texted me to the point where I blocked him on social media. He made fake accounts and tried to call me on block. I answered and talked to him on the accounts but I had enough. So I blocked him. 

I told him just give me space. So he did for like a day. During this time I started to sleep with this new guy. But my ex kept bothering me and I told the new guy this. 

2 days later he contacted me again on a messaging app I forgot I had. And he pleaded for me to unblock him and I did unblock him on all social media platforms. To make him stop. 

That night he called me and we have a convo. Same thing again. 

Then 3 days later I am sitting in my car after class and he comes to my passenger window. I unlock the door and move my books from the seat and we talked. I texted him after that it was a nice talk but doesn’t change anything. 

The next day I post a snap of me and my new guy. And my ex asks who that is and I tell him it’s my boyfriend. My ex blocks me everywhere. 

Then a week later he unblocks me and he starts to beg again but I had enough and I texted him “let me rub it in your face...” and told him all about the new guy and how happy we are and how we spend the nights together. He doesn’t reply. 

I saw him walk around my classroom but he has meetings at school. When I left the campus I didn’t see him. 

2 weeks later he replies with the meanest things possible all weekend the apologizes and blocks me.

226,"I recently figured out that both my parents have been emotionally neglectful my entire life and my mom is very erratic flip flopping between wanting to be my best friend and wanting to dictate every aspect of my life and getting angry when I didn't agree and comply. My emotions were never accepted and when I was upset I was either accused of trying to make her feel guilty, told she can't talk to me like this and had to stop crying and/or being upset or be sent away, or confronted with anger and sometimes called names like Victim, B****, or told to stop acting like my manically depressed grandma. If I would try to point out any of my mom's issues she would start saying how she was a horrible mother and would ask me why God would give her me. I struggle with religion because my mom would always blame problems in the family and negative emotions on Satan and would incert religion in things where it had no place. She would always make me to wear more makeup and would hound me about wearing girlier clothes and always wanted me to do something with my hair other than wear it straight. I was always a tomboy and wasn't really into the girlie things. She ended up furious when I told her I was getting a pixie cut. For years I thought something was wrong with me because nothing was ever my mom's fault but always mine according to her. From the earliest time I had personal access to the internet I have been researching psychological conditions to try to fix me and to try and fix my mom and I's relationship. I feel so guilty about being so angry because I don't think she knows that she is hurting me.

I feel extremely broken and don't know how to connect with anyone on an emotional level. It's like I have a psychological block making it impossible for me to attach to someone emotionally. I feel so alone and want to be able to open up but it terrifies me. Every time someone starts getting close in a romantic way I get really bad anxiety and pull away.  I don't know how to break this block... I've tried everything but I'm still not able to build a close relationship with anyone.

227,"I'm looking for some advice on how to deal with having a person in your family who is pressuring you into things without letting you make your own decisions. I'm specifically talking about my grandmother who is very assertive and wants to be involved in my life. 

I'm only 20 years old and I haven't went back to school yet. I plan to start College at some point in the next year and a half but besides working for a little while I haven't done much else. My grandmother has been on my case for the last 8 months on what my plans are for school. She calls me on a weekly basis to get updates even though I don't have any because I'm still in the research stage. A few months ago, after getting asked enough times by her, I gave in and said I applied for a program that I was interested in at the time. I was actually considering applying until I found out more about the school and curriculum. I told her when I applied that I would find out in a month or so if I got in so at this point she expects an update. I've told her a few times over the last month that I would know really soon and at this point I have to give her some kind of answer. I've ignored two of her calls already. 

I've been unemployed since late last year so I'm currently searching for another full-time job. I don't know what to tell her as she is set on me starting school in September and it's looking like I won't be starting until next year.

230,"I’ve been in my current job for about 9 months now doing sales. When I interviewed, I was very open and honest that I intended to move into the marketing department (that’s what I studied) but was willing to do sales to gain some knowledge/experience that could help me understand the market. My boss took me on knowing this and I moved across the country for this position.

I thought I could do this for 2 years before transferring, but I have been having a rough time and really don’t enjoy it. I’m not doing as well as my boss had hoped and I’ve been worried I’d get fired due to low sales. When this role came up in a city I knew I’d be happier in, I was over the moon. This is an internal move, my boss will be notified when I submit an application, so I called him to give him a heads up that I wanted to do this - I don’t know if they’d even invite me to interview due to the qualifications, but I didn’t want to regret not applying knowing the opportunity was there.

My boss is amazing and super supportive (the best boss I could have asked for), but I could hear the disappointment. His advice was that I stay in my current role for another year before I look into the marketing department. He said he would talk to his boss and see what they think about my transfer (not really sure why?).

I was so excited about applying and now I feel like I shouldn’t. I haven’t completed a year in my current job and I feel like I would be wasting everyone’s time leaving now to do something else.

233,"I need some advice with my situation, it's kinda a complicated one, so bare with me. So basically my dad and his girlfriend, whom I'll call my stepmom because she basically is, are having some issues, the major one being that my dad is an alcoholic.  Well my dad is stubborn as fuck and refuses to get any help whatsoever. 

So instead of getting help, he'll stop drinking for a little while, then obviously he goes back to it. My stepmom has been pestering him to get help, but it just makes him verbally aggressive after a while. Well my stepmom has been hinting for a little while that she's planning on leaving him if he doesn't improve, which I honestly don't blame her, and today she flat out told me that she's been pushed to her limit and is looking to leaving unless something changes immediately. Which like I said before, I completely understand her leaving, but now I gotta give you some information about my dad, which is where things get complicated. 

So my dad is unemployed, he used to have is own business for a very long time but had to file for bankruptcy a few years ago. He does some odd jobs here and there, but for the most it wouldn't be enough to cover his bills. So my stepmom pays for most of the bills. We've been trying to get my dad to get a normal job, but he doesn't seem to put any effort into it, and I think he doesn't try because he doesn't like that he wouldn't be in charge anymore.

 So that brings you to my question, how do I prepare my dad for losing someone he loves plus his stuff(because he can't afford the bills) for the second time?  This also affects my brother who lives with him, so how would I also prepare my brother for this as well? I'm not sure if my dad could handle going through this again, especially with his age(55), and that this time he'll more than likely lose his house instead of just his business. I'm not even sure how I'd talk to my dad about this because he'd be pissed that she was talking about what he considers their own personal matters with me. 

TL;DR: My stepmom plans on leaving my unemployed dad, and need advice on how to prepare him for that.",15May2019,1
235,"To summarize, there is this one guy who just so happens to have ALL the same classes as me, and also is in BOTH of the sports I'm in. He's everywhere!

236,"So I'm a 24 year old college graduate. I've been planning on moving out for almost a year now and now that it's time, my mom is PISSED. I'll give you her reasonings why she doesn't want me to move out:

&amp;#x200B;

\-It's stupid to rent. I should instead save up and buy a house.

\-I have a perfectly good home, why would I need to move out?

\-I should only move out when I have a family.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a lot more but from that, I'm sure you can tell what kind of mindset she has. 

So like I said I'm 24, graduated, and have a job that pays more than 5x the rent I'm going to pay. (I'm in New Jersey too so that's rather impressive lol) I had told my mom I was moving out a while now and she's always said I better not. Well this was the month I finally found a place and I'm about to sign the lease soon.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is...is there anything wrong that I'm doing on my part? My mom has always been controlling and the things I found ridiculous, I would just go ahead and go against her wishes. (She would comment on who I should be friends with, what race of girl I should date, and a lot of what I can and can't do...she's also a traditional Asian woman) It's not like I dislike living at home, it's fine but I commuted throughout college and never moved out. I'm in the middle of the best years of my life and I sure as shit don't plan on living with my parents until I have kids.

&amp;#x200B;

One way or another, I knew I was moving out. But my mom has been going nuts, saying don't I ever come back home and if I leave, I'm no longer her son. (She's said these things in the past, usually ended with a week or two of the silent treatment to me. It doesn't really bother me) Regardless, I'm going on with the move but would rather not have her so pointlessly angry, but it's hard to change her mind about stuff.

A little background info: I don’t really go to school often, it’s been like that since grade 7, but back then I had a reason. So normally at that time I’d be out of school once every other week. But for the past couple of years it’s gotten worse. Now I’m missing out full weeks of school all because I can’t seem to get up in the morning or for no reason at all. When my alarms go off I instantly turn them off and sleep in until 3 pm and then when I wake up hate myself for missing another day of school.
This obviously hasn’t gone unnoticed by the people around me. I think my mum is just fed up with me and doesn’t even try to wake me up anymore, my friend always messages me after school getting me in trouble and telling me all the things I missed and my teachers definitely think there’s something wrong with me (one said I chronic fatigue syndrome??? I don’t really think so). 
I don’t know what my problem is, this week I’ve missed out on a fairly big and important test that I’m so mad at myself for missing. I kept telling myself ‘just go tomorrow to finish it off’ but of course I missed school again. I just want to be able to wake up normally in the mornings and go to school...",15May2019,3
238,"I’m gonna get straight to the point here.

I’m 18, I just finished highschool and I’m planning on going to university within the following year. I guess you could say life is going how you should expect it to go but I just don’t feel it. What I mean by this is that I feel a little numb/hopeless towards a lot of things. I’ll just make a list of how I feel in certain circumstances to help with my “case”:

-There are certain days where I feel like I’m gonna breakdown at any moment for no apparent reason
-I’m tired a majority of the time, no matter how well rested I appear
-Although I’ve got a loving family, I just don’t feel as connected as I used to
-I don’t have anymore friends, those relationships faded on their own
-I do however, hang out with my older brother and his friends but as much as they enjoy having me around, I feel alone whenever I’m surrounded by people, no matter how close they are
-As cheesy as this sounds, I feel like I’m an outcast wherever I go


I don’t know what’s wrong with me, if something good happens to me I’ll be in a great mood for like a couple hours then it’s just back to how I originally felt. I take care of myself, I workout a lot since it’s a good way to get out of this mindset, but it doesn’t last me the entire day. 

I don’t want to say that I’m depressed because that is probably not the case and I don’t really like using that term for whatever reason. 

Anyways, I just wanted to get this off my chest and I was hoping you guys could help me out with this. Thanks.

I have tiny anxiety attacks over every decision. Wether it’s what to eat for lunch, what route I should go to get to my next class, what fidget toy should I bring to school. Every single one. And I hate it. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to function like a normal human and that scares me. 

How am I going to pick if I should go to college or not? How am I going to pick which job I want. How am I going to do anything. I spent a good few minute sitting in the lunch line because I couldn’t decide wether to get a ham or blt. How the FUCK am I supposed to choose what I want to peruse in life.

I can usually talk about my mom with what’s wrong but I can’t considering even when I joke about suicide she makes comments about how she should just forcibly hospitalize me. I can’t talk about it with my friends in fear of being that friend who just talks about their problems. 

I also hate my body. Every time I catch a glimpse of myself in a window or mirror I cringe. It’s not just that I’m the wrong gender, I’m also ugly. 

I figured I’d post this on advice or something, see if anyone knew what to do with me, but the more I thought about suicide the more appealing it seemed. It really hurts to write out those words but it’s the truth. 

Nothing seems important, I feel like my friends hate me, I can’t make a single fucking decision, I’m pretty sure I’m super fucking shit looking, I hate myself and how I behave, I hate the lies I’ve built up around that I’m a perfectly sound and okay person. I’m not. 

I have friends who are willing to help but I’ve avoided any of them seeing me breakdown for so long that they just assume I’m the most emotionally sound person there. Just a few days ago I had a full on meltdown panic attack. I was sitting right beside them, hiding my face while I cried my eyes out, and no one even thought anything was up. Idk, it just increased my RSD. I was thinking about how much my friends must’ve hated me to ignore me while I was having a panic attack like that. How much I must leech off them. Of course almost a week later I see that they probably just assumed nothing was wrong, but that was a long week of assuming they hated me. 

Idk, I might sound like another fucking whiny teenager, and I suppose I am, but I just don’t know how to deal. I’m so, so tired of all of this. I’m honestly so done. I don’t know what to do.",15May2019,1
240,"Where do I start? As of now I'm 15 and I'm not sure if everyone's family functions this way or if it's just mine. My mother has gone through a couple of relationships that just didn't work out for her and all of them left her pregnant. The fathers took custody of all her other children. My mother soon gave birth to two more girls and gained custody of them. I was the younger child and I had an older sister. It was my sister, mom, and me for about 5 years until she met her new boyfriend. I was around 4 when I first met my soon to be stepfather. My mother fell head over heels for a man who would soon turn to be someone who wasn't so charming. I distinctly remember we were all eating dinner at the table  when I was 4 and my family all finished before I did. They all stood up and left to their rooms but I remained alone and I wasn't allowed to go to my room until I finished. I was young and afraid of being alone so I did what any child would do, I cried for my mother. Mistake. My moms boyfriend stormed in without saying a word but the look on his face terrified 4 year old me. He lifted me up off the chair by holding my wrists and struck me against the side of my face, his entire hand consuming my small infant face. I don't really remember much after this occurred besides my mother rushing in and trying to calm me down from screaming and sobbing from the stinging and pain I felt. I do remember that my moms boyfriend had left a handprint the size of my entire face on my cheeks. The print had turned red and it even bled but I thought this was okay at the time because it would soon be a common event. I would do something he didn't approve of and soon I would be lifted by my wrists to be hit. Sometimes I would be playing barbies with my older sister and he'd come storming in to pull my ears and my sisters. This would cause immense pain and we'd often try restrain from crying (that would only make him angrier) Skip years ahead and my mother had still remained with this guy. Eventually they married and had a baby together; the birth of my youngest sister. Skip ahead some more years later and I'm now 13 but I'm now realizing that something is very wrong. My bonds with my sisters broke and we drifted even though we lived in the same household. We'd often have no one to talk to. My mother had slowly started to change over the years, she was no longer the loving mother I once knew. She'd often tell me that she was dying or that she would wake up in the middle of the night to someone knocking on her door. No one was knocking on her door. She would tell me the knocking was someone coming for her (she'd say ""they're coming for me, I'm dying."") and this would scare the hell out of me and it would stick with me forever. My stepfather had become distant and would work long shifts just to come home to sleep, my mother would do the same. My siblings and I would usually be watching tv or sleeping. I was diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety around 12 and they put me on antidepressants. There were times I'd see my mother ripping her own her out and screaming that she wanted to die and that god was punishing her for her sins. I saw this so often that It didn't bother me anymore and I just sort of became numb to it. As of now, I do anything in my power to protect my younger sister and I am very protective of her. I'm like this with her because of the way my stepfather behaved and how my mother slowly became insane and my older sister would often fight with me, ending with bruised eyes and blood. I don't know what to do? My mother has developed lumps on her breasts and it breaks my heart to think of the pain she's been through and only to deal with more.

I can't really afford it and 2. my point with dropping out is to start doing something by myself earlier in life, rather than waiting until I'm in my mid 20's and graduate from college.

Also, I don't know how to tell my parents. They're really supportive for the most part, but they can get upset at something like this, and I just don't want that.

So I just don't know what to do. Should I stay and put myself through it? Or should I do something else instead?",15May2019,4
246,"Hello all I am new to Reddit and I stumbled upon this subreddit and realized how helpful people can be here so I made an account and I wanted to share my main issue. I am currently 15 almost 16 and my mother is refusing to vaccinate me, I don't believe in any of this anti-vax bullshit. I have read multiple studies on the benefits of Vaccines and I completely believe and trust the science. I have told my parents multiple times even showing studies that vaccines aren't dangerous at all but they still refuse. My mother who is divorced always tells me that we were born perfect and don't need any junk clogging our bodies. I don't know my father's opinion because I have never met him (my parents divorced when I was around 2 and my mother doesn't let me see him). I am starting to get concerned for my health and have been becoming quite germophobic in fear of the worst. This brings me to my question how could I convince my mother to vaccinate me and how could I become vaccinated if my parents still refuse or is that not possible for legal reasons.",15May2019,42
247,"Please read everything I am about to type so the situation is best understood. I will try not to make this long.



My ex just sent me two emails to two of my different email addresses. I was abused in every way by this woman for nearly 4 years. Near the end of our relationship I started recording her and I think she grew more and more aware I was getting to the point I was becoming more open to the idea of exposing her abuse. One day she and her mom framed me for breaking into our hotel room after taking me off the room and asking the hotel not to give me a key and left me homeless for a night in an unfamiliar and somewhat unsafe town far from friends and family. She went to all her friends and the few friends I had left (she had cut me off from my friends and family, I lost a lot of friends as it was from the loss of contact) and told them I was actually abusing her and doing drugs and I'm randomly gay and all that. She didn't have any evidence while I had recordings and police reports and statements from her own sister and father and whatnot but no one wanted to listen to me. I lost nearly all my friends because of that. She got a restraining order against me that ended a few months ago. I am over $30,000 in debt due to her and her mom using my car on the toll road without my permission or telling me and the toll roads not alerting me until way after the fact and using my name on things like the cox cable bill without telling me and whatnot while we were together. She took full custody of our son even though I had video(s) of her being verbally abusive and physically abusive towards him. My family is very poor while she is very rich and has a lot of friends who were willing to give this ""poor now single mom who went through an abusive relationship"" money and go to court as witnesses to falsify evidence for her because she had no evidence. During the restraining order she did things like posed as someone else online to make me talk to her, called our apartment office trying to get my family kicked out, had my old friends watch my apartment, interrogated the few friends who stayed friends with me to ask about my whereabouts and what I was doing and saying, mailed me blank pieces of paper for some reason, gave me my stuff back which was 80% her trash so she has a lot of my stuff (some of it irreplacable/ family heirlooms), etc.


I am terrified of this woman, she has even attacked me with a knife and put me in a chokehold that hurt my neck very badly among so many other things and now she has emailed me. I want nothing more than it to be recognized that she is the abusive one and get my son away from her until she has gotten the psychiatric help she needs and has recovered. Even though the restraining order against me is over, I do not plan to talk to her and want her out of my life or behind bars or at least getting the correct therapy that she needs. She got a restraining order as she was ""afraid I would come harm or kill her"" or whatever. But she kept doing things like I mentioned above with contacting our apartment or posing as someone online to get me to talk to her that shows she wasn't afraid. I am scared this is a trap and even though I know opening the emails won't alert her I saw them I am still very cautious. Is there anything I can do with the emails? How do I show people who she really is when no one wants to listen or believe in me and help me to stop her from doing something terrible or killing our son?",15May2019,2

I panic and overthink, so I end up doing bad on tests. I just can’t get over this huge panic attack that happens every time I start a test. It’s gotten so bad that I take tests in a special room that’s more casual and relaxed, and it still doesn’t help. 

Because I’ve done bad on so many that I’ve been prepared for, my mind created this barrier where I just believe I will never ace any test ever (because I’ve NEVER done it, I’ve obviously had tests where I’ve gotten one or two things wrong. But never have I been 100% correct, even on small quizzes too. ) 

I’ve been accepted to a competitive legal studies program and god knows the amount of testing I’ll need to do, I really cant (with the price of tuition) afford to be nervous during tests and bombing them all because I’m a tad “anxious” 

My friends think it’s just because I’m unprepared, but honestly I’ve studied for quizzes and tests months in advanced and can recite material inside and out but still. Get. A. 70%. On. The. Test. 

it extends more than just school, I failed my drivers test 3 times (4 by tomorrow, probably) because I just freak out and overthink everything. 

Hell, I can’t even take a buzzfeed quiz without hyperventilating. 

I’ll get these nerves 24 hours in advanced- my first drivers test I stayed up all night because I was too anxious to sleep. I even went for a 3 am jog to tire myself and it didn’t work. 

I’ve tried breathing exercises and they do nothing, I’ve tried calming teas, relaxing baths, stupid meditating apps, music but nothing works. As soon as I pick up that pencil, or start the car I’m nervous.

He took photos/videos of me so im terrified of that every leaking too and ruining my professional career if he ever sees my name in the future..

i am broken again. i became sexually active at a such young age to replace the memories i had as a child. i associated love for a family member with sex. I wanted someone to erase this. i am broken by the choices i made but i was a child who was desperate for someone to fix her.

Unfortunately a couple of weeks before the holiday, my grandad died. We were incredibly close and i was devastated. I knew that if I went on holiday at that time, I would be miserable and couldn’t enjoy myself. It wouldn’t be fair on me or my friend if I was that sad after spending so much money.

I spoke to the holiday company and they agreed to cancel the holiday, and hold my money for some time in order for us to arrange a new date to go. I spoke to my friend about it and she was disappointed but agreed that she understands and that we’d rearrange.

Fast forward 10 months later, I’ve lost the £1,300 forever now, because we passed the maximum amount of time that the company would hold the money for. She kept putting off the rearrangement plans until the last minute and now I lost the money.

She owes me £650, but I’ve said I’ll just be happy with £600. I’ve contacted her a couple of times to ask about it and it’s always the same excuse. “I have no money”. She works a pretty well paying job, lives with her parents and is always posting on social media about getting new tattoos or puppies or going on day trips. So there is some money there.

No one in the house likes him, my mother included, and everyone has suggested kicking him out at one point or another. The thing about kicking him out is that the house we live in belongs to my grandmother  who says that if my mother wants him gone then my mom has to tell him that, which she wont do and she changes the reason why everytime its bought up.

Since his mail is being sent here we cant legally just take him out of the house (or so I've been told, I've suggested just moving all of his things outside and changing the locks multiple times and would have done it myself a long time ago.

My background: i graduated college in 2016 with a business/tech degree. My whole line of thinking in college was to do well so I don’t let down my parents or waste their money and investment in me. I chose my field because I heard it had a good hiring rate. I got a job straight out of college. A very high paying job but I had to move half way across the country for it. I worked there for about 2 years until the company closed the site and laid off most of the people there. I hated this job, it was stressful, lots of work and made my anxiety hard to deal with. 

I moved back home and looked for work for for a whole year. During this time I tried seeing a psychologist but I felt like it didn’t help and was too expensive. I started dating a girl but it was not for romantic reasons. I was just dating her because I wanted an in with the company she worked for.

My job search eventually landed me a custodial job which I don’t hate and is bearable but I make very little and I’m wasting my college education. I like it because it is very light on stress and I work alone at night so I don’t have to deal with anyone.

I have no motivation to search for better work or try to find a relationship/friends. I simply don’t care. I haven’t cared about my life in a long time. My only motivation is not being a burden on my parents and I know they love me. 

Ive had suicidal thoughts and depression the majority of my life. I told myself when I was around 20 that if by 30 things don’t get better I’ll probably just end it. I just turned 29, so I have a year to go.

I played football for my high school the last couple years and loved it. I was a big kid through middle school so my buddy finnaly gave me the kick I needed to hit the gym in grade 10. Given that I'd carried my relatively large frame ( I was probably around 5'10 in grade 10 I'm now 6'2)  I could do heavy weights pretty well. I had taken a weird fall I'm basketball a few years back and destroyed my knee so I hadn't had any real sports to do since. I started deadlifting and doing leg press alot to the point where I made it onto the school record board for deadlifts and was leg pressing 6 times my body weight. Coaches saw this and got me to play and for 2 years football kept me in the best shape id been in in a while and it was great. Come this year I found out that I'd wrecked my knee again and against my doctor's advice I played the last of our season. Now I got the results back (been about 6 months since the actual discovery of the problem) and I can't do anything till I get surgery which means I don't have rugby either. I'm starting to gain back all the weight I lost and its the worst feeling. I'm starting to slip back into a complete lack of motivation and I dont know how to get out of this.  I don't turn 18 till December so I'm taking a year before starting uni and I was so excited before about volunteering places and getting my foot in the door for when I did finish uni. Everything I know from high school is just vanishing. I got out of the shower tonight and just realized I have nothing to work towards, nothing that motivates me. I never got my learner's when I was 14 like any rational person would and when I bombed the test I just kinda left it and haven't tried again since. I work at a sportcheck in the mall and while it pays well and I like my coworkers I get pretty much no hours. I've just got nothing to work towards and the lack of motivation just feels like a hole that keeps getting deeper but I don't know how to get out. 

How do you find motivation and move past the high school phase without just crashing?",15May2019,1
289,"So I (m/20) just got put on academic probation at my school for 3 semesters and am really struggling to do anything productive. I doubt  I have depression but all I've been doing for 2 months is sleeping and watching TV, I have zero dollars to my name and I'm having trouble forcing myself to find a job. At this rate my life will go down hill and I will amount to nothing I need advice to get my life on the right track anything helps",15May2019,1
290,"I'm about to finish what's known as the junior cycle in my school, it's basically a period of three years leading you up to your junior cert. After this I have two more years of school and can either work or go to college.

Where I live I either have to be 16 or have my junior cert done to drop out and in my case my junior cert comes first so I'll have some education.

Now I don't have the greatest homelife and it impacts on my schoolwork, mental health and everything else. My thoughts are to take at least 2 gap years and then return to school when I can as in two years time my friend might move in with me which will split the costs for everything meaning I won't have to work as much. I'll only be getting paid minimum wage if I'm lucky, a hardship I'm willing to take. 

Of course if that doesn't go to plan I have a couple back up plans.

I know work is hard and living alone is hard but it's something I'm willing to do to get away from my family. I simply can't live with them if I'm going to live past the age of 18 without killing myself. It's a proven fact at this point.

Really dunno what to do, I'm very conflicted. Also if your thoughts were for me to just put up with it for two years, I can't and don't really want to. Especially school wise. My leaving cert is a very big thing, if I don't get good grades in this, I won't be able to find a good job or go into further education.",15May2019,3

293,"We live in a nice area in a fairly nice apartments in California. But the only problem is we have an electronic gate that you press a button to get into where you park your cars. That's the only way to get into the garage. So people must be waiting in the bushes next to the gate to get in. That's freaking scary and dangerous. 

In the past 3 weeks my car was broken into. And just now I was gone for one hour and in that time my girlfriends $500 bicycle, that's hidden from street view, and had very thick lock cut was stolen. 

My real estate company that owns the building says they aren't responsible. But now this is beginning to be a safety issue at night. What should we do?

We just called the police to file a report but can they make the company put in cameras or something since it's a safety issue?

294,"   I (16M) recently broke up with my girlfriend of nearly 2 years (17f) after we both had mental health issues and she was using me as a crutch to fix her problems, and I'm not giving her a third chance this time. 

   The only issue is, a friend of mine who she doesn't like because I crushed on let me visit her at her house.

I and said friend fucked day-of-breakup, ex doesn't know and I don't plan on saying anything. I feel guilty for it, but I have had extremely deep-set feelings for this person for months now, and never had the nerve to tell my now ex-girlfriend until about 3 weeks ago. I know I fucked up somewhere down the line, but it's over now and I'm ready to move on to greener pastures, preferably with said female friend that I have been SERIOUSLY crushing hard on for a long time.

295,"**TL;DR: Boyfriend (21) and I  (21) bought concert tickets with left over scholarship money. Parents are ridiculously strict, and because I snuck out last year to see a concert, I don't think they'll approve of me going to this one.** 

&amp;#x200B;

So my boyfriend and I are 21 years old, and I was able to buy concert tickets from my left over scholarship. I'm currently studying abroad and was able to purchase this with the left over money I received. I bought this after all necessary bills were paid off.   


Background: My parents have been very strict with me growing up simply because I just didn't have any leeway. My boyfriend and I got together in high school and have been inseparable for the last seven years, so they were even more strict with me after they found out. I bought tickets to go to a concert with my boyfriend last year too and it was months ahead of time when I told my parents that I was going to the concert with ""friends."" After they found out I would be going with him, they immediately shut it down the day before the concert was supposed to happen. Because I didn't want to waste the tickets, I basically snuck out and we drove all the way there. Understandably, they weren't happy with me, but I still kept in contact with them, updating them on where I'm at and what I'm actually doing. I went home and they were surprisingly...nice? I know they're going to hold this against me whenever I see them.   


I know I fucked up, but I don't think I will ever get ""freedom"" or ""approval"" unless I take action. 

  
I've been trying be honest with my parents these last few years, but all they will ever do is just refusing to not understand that I'm more than capable of taking care of myself and my responsibilities already. I feel like everything I had to do to get where I am (studying abroad, conducting research, getting jobs, moving on campus, etc). was 95% on my own.

I've always wanted and have tried to be open and honest with them about who I am, what I want, or what I'm doing, but they honestly have told me to my face that ""they don't care.""  Of course I appreciate and love my parents for working and  constantly helping me out, I express my appreciation too, but because I'll be living with them for a short time during that summer before college, I won't be able to have that freedom of doing stuff on my own or with other people.   


Now I won't be returning back to my country for another three months, but I just wanted to know what you guys would do in this situation.   


Thanks",15May2019,1
296,"Hoping this is the right sub with all the right info on it.. 

I’ve (30f) been with my husband (30M) for 7 years, 3.5 years married. When I first met my sister in law(26f) she was in a long term relationship with her high school sweetheart. She was nice, was a bridesmaid at our wedding, and it seemed like we had an okay relationship even though we weren’t close.

In January her and her bf broke up after 11 years and she’s suddenly changed. Obviously the whole thing was traumatic for her as she’s never really been “alone” even though the cause of their breakup was ultimately her decision (she cheated on him and got caught, then when he wanted to stay with her she ended up breaking up with him anyway. Now she’s with a new guy.) Ever since this happened she’s been extremely awkward around me. There’s this negative vibe to the point it’s like pulling teeth to have a conversation with her. Family gatherings are painful. She ignores me and is super fake when she does actually respond to something I said. I tried to help her out when she was going through her breakup - tried to give her advice, offered to hang out with her, etc which she pretty much ignored. I know the guy she cheated with and found out that he was harassing her at her work so I told him off. My mother in law thanked me but I never heard anything from her. I don’t know why she suddenly dislikes me or maybe she always did and I’m just noticing now. I dread having to see her and it sucks to feel this way. I tried to talk to my husband about it but he thinks it’s all in my head (maybe it is??)

How do you guys deal with your sister in laws? Of note she’s younger than my husband and I, and she’s the only other sibling. I’m an only child

TLDR: sister in law and I used to have ok relationship, now she makes me feel uncomfortable, ignores me and is super fake ever since she broke up with her long term bf",15May2019,1
297,"So my stepdad has been in my life since I was three. My mom was leaving a gang when she met him on a date. She told him everything that was going down. She told him that she had cancer and that she was cutting ties with a gang. She gave him 10 minutes to leave while she went to the restroom, and an extra five minutes when she ordered her drink. However he stayed. 

I can tell you right now I do not have the best relationship with him. He has been there through thick and thin for my brother and I. I honestly I was really young and stupid growing up. When I was 8 I got diagnosed with severe ADHD. Which makes sense because I couldn't wash dishes or complete any of the tasks, I was given at home. So because he didn't know how to deal with ADHD he would just keep me on lockdown at home and just ground me 24/7.

Because of my mom's cancer she couldnt have kids anymore. But surprise, surprise- 12 years later she had my nine-year-old sister and my five year old sister. After that she almost died giving birth to the last kid. Those kids are my dad's biological kids. And sometimes he says he doesn't treat them differently but I can see it.  They're his kids. His own flesh and blood.  

My step-dad is a respectable man. Except he's the definition of mansplaining. When it comes to me he's very condescending and unfair. He says I'm irresponsible and forgetful in front of the kids. I babysit them when they leave the house. The kids will call him saying I'm being unfair when I ask them to pick up toys off the floor or to come eat lunch. So when he comes home he will yell at me informing me that I am not allowed to tell his kids what to do. So with that I just gave up and let the kids do whatever they want. But when my dad gets home from work he yells at me that the house is an absolute wreck, and that I should have told the kids something. WHAT THE FUCK 

So at 22 I moved out but I've moved out for good two weeks; because I learned that I'm allergic to fleas and cats the hard way,( I never owned a cat) I had to move back in with my folks. And right after that I wrecked my car. But thankfully I managed to get a job in the neighborhood so I take my bike there back and forth. I have two jobs so on this part I think I'm doing good
 
But now that I moved back in I pay rent and every time there's a disagreement he will increase rent by 25$. I used to pay 250 but now I pay 475 and it's increasing. It sucks cuz I will hide out in my room just to get away from him and he will go out of his way and look for me and remind me that I'm a waste of space and that I'm useless. And it's worse if he has a bad day at work he'll take it out on me again. Every inconvenience or anything bad that happens to him at work or if my mom gets mad at him he will take his frustrations out on me. 

 I have literally been saving up money to get a car and leave. But I am at my wits end here. I have $2,000 saved up but not enough to get a car. I am just sick and tired of him of telling me repeatedly that I am useless and a waste of space. It's starting to get to me. Now I completely understand why my brother doesn't visit anymore.  And I don't know how long I can take it anymore. If I wasn't a girl I would pack up my backpack and just hits the streets. 

I'm just really done with everything",15May2019,1
298,"I often find myself trying to make sense of things. Make sense of myself, mostly. I don’t know if anyone else at the age of 27 who has zero clue on what they’re going to do with their life, or their purpose has felt the same way. To be honest, I’ve been struggling to figure that out since I turned 21. I did what most people tell you not to do and that’s not to compare yourself to others journeys because we’re all on our own path… blah blah. As good advice as that is, it’s also easier said than done. We live in a world where people post their accomplishments for the world to see. And even if you didn’t see the struggles that led to that success, it still feels like they figured out something you didn’t. 

People keep telling me that I’m young and I still have time to figure it out and part of me knows that, but there’s another part of me that sees time ticking away, another day coming and going with every sunrise and sunset,  It’s a sucky feeling when you’re not where you want to be, but don’t know where you’re supposed to be.

300,"I recently turned 19 and I feel like I'm doing nothing with my life and don't know where to go or what to do. I just finished my second semester of college and I've lost the point of it all.

I'm already over 5000 dollars in debt because of student loans and my parents want me to continue going to school and go further in debt because ""that's just how it is"". I'm only going because it's what I'm expected to do. Now that I'm on summer break I have time to think about what I want to do and whether I should get a job or not. I feel completely worthless staying at home and doing close to nothing but the thought of getting a job puts a pit in my stomach and I feel like I'll never be up to the tasks that are put in front of me.

I was always behind on my work and had to get constant help because I couldn't keep up. I feel so clumsy and worthless like things that normal people can do I just can't. I ended up quitting my job after working for about 6 months.

301,"  

This is going to be long. I’m sorry. I’ll try to keep it concise. Please don’t flame me. I’m just tired and anxious and I want to do the right thing.

My husband (DH) has cerebral palsy and uses a motorized wheelchair, and sometimes forearm crutches. He speaks clearly and with little difficulty. I was run over by a car when I was a teenager, and I have severe, chronic pain and am considered disabled. I don’t “look disabled.”

Six months into dating DH, we went on a long trip together that required several days of travel in various airports. It is almost comical, how many awful experiences we had involving other human beings, most of whom were trying to “help out” my husband… who didn’t need any help. I’m sure that many of you understand what I mean by this. Examples of this include:

An airport employee refusing to let DH have one of our bags on his lap while I pushed the airport’s provided wheelchair. I couldn’t push both the wheelchair and a dolly, and she refused to help carry or have anyone help carry the extra bag, so I did it while she pushed him (quickly, way ahead of me, without stopping or responding to me). I injured my shoulder so badly that to this day (three years later), I have pain and have to see a physical therapist. I also suffered knee pain that lasted the entire week.

At the security check, the same employee told DH, “You’re lucky she’s with you. There’s no way you could do this otherwise.”

A different employee started pushing his wheelchair while I was unloading our carry-on luggage from the plane, and ignored him when he protested and asked the employee to stop moving him. I exited the plane having no idea where DH was, and had to go find him, bags in tow.

A different employee accused me of taking advantage of a disabled man, and asked to see my ID, and have DH verify that he knew me.

Later, while I waited outside the bathroom for DH, the same employee exclaimed, “He can’t be alone in there!” and burst in, startling DH and causing him to fall.

A man randomly started wheeling DH away, saying that he needed to take DH to a support desk to help “his caretaker” find him. When I interrupted him, he asked me if I was DH’s caretaker, and when I said “No, I’m his girlfriend,” the man also asked to see my ID. When an airline worker noticed the heated discussion, she joined in and also asked to see my ID.

Two people on one of the flights stole DH’s crutches when we weren’t looking and hid them because they didn’t want “those dirty crutches” touching their luggage.

While on our vacation, I had to physically hold back a man who was trying to get DH to stand up without his crutches.

A stranger came up to me and told me I was cruel because my purse was on my husband’s lap while I pushed him in a wheelchair.

*All of this happened in the span of seven days.* On the trip home, I cried from sheer frustration and anger. I felt so helpless that I started therapy to help me deal with the feelings from what happened. We haven’t traveled since. My husband is used to this kind of treatment because he has experienced it since he was a child. He’s just resigned to it. No one can tell that I’m disabled, so people don’t treat me differently. It wasn’t just this one isolated place or event, either. We often (five or six times in the past year) have Uber drivers try to *pick up my husband and put him into the car*. A security guard recently told my husband that he was a “smart little buddy” because he *was walking with his crutches.*

We’re planning another trip soon, and I told him that things need to be different this time. If we encounter people like we did then, we need a way to deal with it. I thought about handing out pre-printed cards that say something along the lines of, “We appreciate your concern, but DH is a fully grown and very capable man. In general, unless a stranger is obviously distressed, confused, in jeopardy, or asking for assistance, please assume that they are able to take care of themselves.” My husband thinks that this is too confrontational, and that nothing we say will be able to a) end the unpleasant interactions, or b) change strangers’ minds or behaviors.

Honestly, I think he’s right. Some tiny part of me is happy that most of these interactions we’ve had stem from people being concerned and trying to do the right thing. But it’s ridiculous, overwhelming, and incredibly stressful. How can I handle this? I don’t think I can make it not happen, but how can I make it stop once it does? If any of you guys on here are dealing with this, can you please tell me how you do it?",15May2019,19
302,"I finally made an Instagram a couple days ago and noticed this girl I know showed up in my suggested follows as I have her phone number. However, I've only met her three times in person, once when she cold introduced herself to me at a career fair and asked if I was interested in working at the company she works at, once for an informational interview kind of thing, and once for potentially buying something from the company she works for. It definitely felt like the conversation flowed well all three times and we spent quite a bit of the time talking about our personal lives, but I get that it was only three times and mostly for professional reasons, as she was at work all three times. All our texts so far are regarding professional stuff, i.e. the job when I was looking for one, buying something from the company, etc. over the last month or so, but I'm quite sure we're texting using her personal number as it's connected to her personal Instagram. I just wanted to get some advice if simply following her on Instagram would be seen as creepy or too much or what. If it helps, we are the same age (23).

It was incredibly awkward because we had mutual friends, so she would stare me down when I bumped into her. I'm not entirely sure what happened, but I have a nagging feeling some of my friends told her friend that I either said or did something to her. To be honest, they were pretty shitty friends and often made things up about me because they thought I was weird. 

Should I try to reach out to her and apologize, or should I just let it be? It seems like if people don't like you, it might be better off to just leave them alone.

307,"  So one of my teachers included me in a group of girls for a project. They didn't really want me there as I have a reputation of sleeping in class (I am very sick mentally and my medication makes it worse) but I always 100% complete my work if it's a group project as I don't want anyone to lose marks because of me.
  This one girl (let's call her X) tell me that they want to check my earlier work and my marksheet from the last term if I were to work with them (I think its important to mention that none of them had done better than me either so we had pretty similar grades). I told X that I need a day to complete my paper and I would give it to her by the morning. She agreed and I got to work. I first checked out some reports written by my classmates from their school blogs (her and I had a very similar subject) and then went on the Internet to do some research. I completed my paper and the format was similar to X's report as that was most common format. I sat for hours and did my research on the Web and wrote my letter. At this point, none of us were taught how to cite our sources so noone from class had done it. 
  I send the report to her the next day and she goes ""Are you okay? How dare you copy my paper and send it to me?"" I was a lil bit confused and she went ""I have been so nice to you and you do this? I know you go to therapy and all but I still was good to you than others"" (by good to me, she meant she smiled at me maybe once when noone was looking and then went on ignoring me even when the other kids were rude to me). Then she complained to the plagiarism committee and asked me to own it and apologise. At this point I was crying as I had no idea what I had done.

To add some context to the birthday thing - for the passed two years we've been together I've planned him awesome bday parties doing things he absolutely loves with friends and family he loves as well. But I planned my own birthday... and it was embarrassing because everyone knew I planned it myself. My boyfriend just showed up for dinner, I even paid for his dinner. Leading up to my bday he kept whining telling me he didn't know what to buy me? All the time. I never brought it up, ever, but he somehow always found a way to bring up how he didn't know what to buy. I told him what I liked and 2 days before my bday proceeded to buy me lotion and a charm for my charm bracelet, which was awesome except for the fact that I had to tell him to buy it and the fact that he just handed it to me 2 days before my bday, unwrapped. He doesn't have a license, I drive him everywhere, we live in his parents house because he hardly works and it makes living on our own harder he's sweet when he wants to be but we fight a lot. When he's mad he gets mad about everything around him and will start yelling at me too. I have to constantly tell him to relax, to stop swearing at people, to stop trying to fight people. It's always his way or no way. I feel like his mom a lot, having to guide him through simple things in life. I'm a little tired of it. But I love him. Like really love him. It's just hard.

So far my considerations are contacting a few of his employers by sending an anonymous letter detailing the wrongs he has committed and why continuing to provide a platform to this individual is enabling a predator and that he is currently being pursued by legal action.

314,"So I either made a big mistake, or made the best decision of my life

&amp;#x200B;

I made the decision to stop talking to my friend (H) completely.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll share a bit about H before I go on, since these details may be important.

&amp;#x200B;

H and I have been friends about about 5 years now. We have great fun together, and rarely argue. Any major disagreement we have is forgotten the next day. H and I work together in a restaurant. We're both 18 and not in school. We spend our days either at work or playing games all day together among other things. This has been the last year or two of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

So today my friend, H, got upset (I annoyed them) and left my Discord server. H has done this many times so I'm used to it, but today, it felt a little different. I started reflecting and thought about what I wanted to be, a game developer. I had talked to H about it and H had expressed interest in joining me, but when we started learning, H got frustrated and quit as soon as one thing went wrong. I inevitably joined H to play some games since I felt the need to be with my friend. This was about 2 weeks ago, and since then I haven't made much progress at all on my game development skills. I feel H is a distraction, so I told H exactly what I was thinking, left the Discord (passed on ownership to his roommate) and now I'm relatively alone with no idea where to start. I haven't blocked H or any of my/his friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to quit gaming for the most part (will realistically play casually for an hour or so a week) so I can focus on what I want to do with my future, so everything has pretty much started over for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure where to start or if I should go back. I feel pretty good about this decision but I'm worried things won't work out. Was this the right decision? What do I do from here?",15May2019,1

I didn't mention it but then I saw a lot of red cuts on their wrist underneath the sleeve.  Ig it could be cat scratches but I know what I saw and I very much doubt it, I've had stuff myself happen in the past and I guess I can just tell by now.

I'm not judging this person for it, and I don't want to be intrusive but I also want to make sure they're okay cause right now idk if something's going on and people know or if their other friends are clueless.

I'm not planning on talking to them, because it's none of my business and that might be awkward for them. However if it's serious, is it a good idea t just ignore it?

I often find myself trying to make sense of things. Make sense of myself, mostly. I don’t know if anyone else at the age of 27 who has zero clue on what they’re going to do with their life, or their purpose has felt the same way. To be honest, I’ve been struggling to figure that out since I turned 21. I did what most people tell you not to do and that’s not to compare yourself to others journeys because we’re all on our own path… blah blah. As good advice as that is, it’s also easier said than done. We live in a world where people post their accomplishments for the world to see. And even if you didn’t see the struggles that led to that success, it still feels like they figured out something you didn’t. 




People keep telling me that I’m young and I still have time to figure it out and part of me knows that, but there’s another part of me that sees time ticking away, another day coming and going with every sunrise and sunset,  It’s a sucky feeling when you’re not where you want to be, but don’t know where you’re supposed to be.

324,"Hello all, first, little bit of context :  


I have a family of 4 children, i'm the youngest one (23) and my parents have been married for around 40 years now.  
It's been already few years since my Mom was complaining about my dad or about the house they live in, she wanted some changes since long.  


So it all started when my Mom wanted to sleep with an other man, she told my father about this, and they agreed she could do anything with anyone, as long as she stayed here to take care of the family (ofc not a single child knew this). It was 15 years ago.  


2 years ago, my mum started to get close to my father's cousin, he was helping her a lot with many problems and we (all the family) will never thanks him enough for the help he brought. She was often taking some holidays at his house and they were often calling each other. To my great astonishment, I was the only one realizing she was way too close to him, and I got the confirmation when I saw a picture of him naked on my mum's phone. Didn't say anything, she did a bad marriage and want to be happy again, as long as she's happy, I am aswell. So I kept that as a secret, not a big deal for me.  


1 year ago, she met her highschool love whom she lost contact after school ended. Let's call him Simon. They started to get close aswell, but as friends only, nothing weird here. I don't really thought Simon and my mother could have an affair untill he invited her for 2 weeks in Indonesia, just the two of them, without Simon's wife knowing it. That was 1 month ago.  


Yesterday, she asked me to come at her office so we could have a talk. She told me everything, how the relation between my parents was horrible, how she couldn't handle to get back in her house, how she was totally in love with Simon etc...  
She told me she wanted to get divorced, and start a relation with Simon. I already thought about that, and Simon is a nice guy, with money, he'll take care of my mum and I know it, so it's not a big deal for me. As I already said, it will make my mother happier, so i'll be aswell.  


My father still has no idea all this is happening, and we are very scared of his reaction. He's someone pretty hot-blooded and stubborn.  
He often told me, when he gets old and start losing his mind, he'll shoot himself clean in the shower (wich scare me pretty much actually). I'm scared this divorce can bring him to do that. That's why I concluded an agreement with my mother, she could do everything she wants, as long as she doesn't break any family relation, and take care of my father (finding him an appartment, giving him some money, still invinting him to party etc...). I don't have any problem with the fact they get divorced, I just want my parents to be both happy, so I try to find the best solution for that.  


Here comes my question : How can my mother do, to get divorced with my father, and stay in good terms ? How to announce it ? (Considering they didn't have sex since year 2000, and I hope, my father already know this relation is bad.)  


  
PS : 

My father has a lot of fault, but he never hitted or insulted my mother. He's just stubborn and lazy.

He doesn't remember feeling that much better whilst he was on the medication the first time but remembers having more energy. He works hard and is all functioning in every other way so I didn't have a clue he was feeling like this

However now he's said it some things do make sense, I've realised that his stand-off nature was probably due to that and the fact he can sleep for 10 hours and still feel tired.

He had me under the impression it was a sleep issue so I assumed once he sorted that everything would be brilliant and he would have more energy to be loving.

330,"TLDR @ the bottom 

Disclaimer: English is not my first language, I'm very sorry for any mistakes.

Okay so two years ago my parents split up and my mother moved out. With me.

My father has a history of ""untreatable"" (his words) depression (I don't even know if he actually has a diagnosis but I think he does) and alcoholism. Several years ago an accident (while he was drunk) left him heavily injured and unable to keep up work but he doesn't get pain meds bc the doctors can't locate the issues.

On the other hand he never really made an effort to search out therapy or different doctors or anything like that. He just sits around, takes on work when the dole runs out and then gets back into the sitting around.

Last summer my sister who stayed with him when me and my mother moved out also moved in with us bc she couldn't handle it anymore with him (she's also in therapy for depression now).

So that far about the sad, old man. The splitting with my mother left him quite devastating since the both of them seemed to be the only ones who didn't see it coming.

They barely speak anymore. Neither do he and my sister bc she really suffered from her alone time with him.

So now I'm more or less the only one who really visits him or talks to him and even I do that very rarely. He doesn't live far away or something he just is not nice. And with not nice I mean straight up racist, always critizing me for my hair, my clothes and my plans for tattoos etc.

I know how all that sounds but I can't just let him alone although I normally don't even feel slight remorse.

Getting together with him is just uncomfortable for me but it kinda feels like my duty and I don't wanna leave him alone completely.

Or something. Idk. Help pls.

My mom is fine she is nice and all, but she only sticks up to my stepdad doesnt matter what he says. The real problem is my stepdad.

When my stepdad gets mad at me he would shout at me for at least 1-3 hours without exaggerating. He would compare me to my friends and sometimes threaten me eg. I will hit you if you dont do this, or I will cancel something you are looking forward to.
He would take away my phone (which is understandable because I am on it quite a lot) and read the texts I wrote with my friends and go through all apps. If he finds a text that i wrote with my friends where i swore in he would shout at me for hours.
He would always bring stuff up about my real dad knowing it would hurt me and my mom still sides with him.
He would mock me if I said something or sometimes push me a little just to trigger or annoy me. He would also get mad at me for locking my bathroom door when I'm in it.
Anytime when I would cry because he is shouting at me (i am really sensitive to people shouting) he would moco me and tell me I am just doing it for attention.
He doesnt mind doing these things in public too.

Another being that my partner isn't crazy about them. He doesn't ""dislike"" them but he likes to get rough inbetween the sheets. Anyone who has them done knows they can get uncomfortable/painful in certain situations. 

Anyways!! Going to cut to the chase.
I love my dirty little secret but when I do decide to take them out I fear scarring. I've had them in for almost 4 years now. After the initial healing process (not that they are ever really healed) the right nipple is the only one that gives me problems sometimes. It gets irritated, I take extra care in the shower for a few days, and then it's fine again. I know everyone has their own experience with having their's done but they have been super easy piercings!

The advice I was wanting is from experienced men and woman on how their's healed. The process they went through. Maybe if anyone has every attempted breastfeeding with piercings. I feel like that's an accident waiting to happen but I may be wrong. 

I asked the piercer when I first got them done about my concerns with breastfeeding. He was an acquaintance because my sister worked at the shop.

Long story short is I need cash for a down payment so I asked my parents for a loan of 10k (full intent of paying them back). My money is in the equity of my house and in retirement funds. My mother goes nuts! Belittling me as to why I want to move, ignore the neighbors and eventually says ""your sister has never asked us for a dime."" Neither have I, mind you. Truth be told, they paid for the finishing of my basement but I didn't ask for that and they did it for my kids - and I was grateful for that gift. But, to have her say that to me made me feel like a loser, degraded and down right hurtful. 
She has a drug and alcohol problem (which she'll (and my father for the most part) will deny but it's very apparent. I'm my opinion, she is a terrible human being, mean and an awful mother, but she is my mother so what do I do?  She tried texting me after our conversation to say sorry but it is not enough. I also refused to borrow their money now and will come up with it on my own. 
I have also changed my eating habits and lost 52 lbs. Previous to this she would tell my kids to 'tell daddy he's fat.' Now I overheard her tell my father last week that I ""look horrible."" 

I think I look great and furthermore, feel great.",15May2019,5
352,"If anybody could... please help

My story;

My life was pretty shit, I was born in The Netherlands my family was pretty shit.
I remember that when I was around 6 years old life went to shit for me. 
My home situation at that time was this;
Mother: always drunk and abusing me.
Dad: always in the kitchen and smoking.
Brother: was gone, somewhere in a sort of jail thing.
Sister: always sick and behind the pc.

So family was of no help and with all the problems my parents caused I was trying to be a translator for my parents to explain everything from the money problems to food *sighs* etc.

Anyway, at the same time I didn’t want to be at home, so I went outside to search for friends as a 6 year old. I found some 16 year old guys, and at the beginning it was alright, but after a few weeks I found out who they really were, they were such a wannabe gang, and well.. they also made me do shit, they made me steal, drink, smoke weed and cigarettes, there were fights now and then and well that went on for a few years, so yeah as a child I was more worried about surviving then actually being a child.
And this went on for a few years until I went to the police when I was around 10 years old.
So then I tried to go to back to school and see if I could get my life together, a few months later the government decided it would be best for me to go into foster care. I moved from house to house and from school to school. So I always got depressed and never left my room only when I needed to like for school, just so that they thought everything was alright (part of my defense system I created when I was a kid).
Fast forward a bit, I turned 18 years old, I went back to my parents house (dropping out of school) depressed as shit, I started to smoke and drink daily just so I could push away those self hating thoughts.. 
I am 21 years old, the self hatred and stuff is better now but I have absolutely no idea how to move on or what to do.. 
I am still a child not knowing what to do scared and alone I don’t have any friends or whatever..
Somebody please help me...",15May2019,2
353,"Me and my two closest friends are all survivors of abuse at the hands of a parent (and in my case my grandmother as well). It's a hard topic, but it's comforting that we've had similar experiences. My friends don't like talking about it much and theirs happened years ago, but I'm still going through it (all hs students). I talk about my experiences and they don't really push me to talk about it, but venting helps and they understand. My grandmother lives with us, so I've never been allowed to have friends over (not that I'd want people over in that environment). One friend understands that, while the other was constantly asking to meet my grandmother. They've never met her, but talked about it for years. I've explained that I don't want them to, and that my house is a uncomfortable, hostile place. They say they don't care, but *I* do. That's what should matter. They also want to meet my dad even more, even though I've suffered at his hand. My friend also tells me to get over it, ""I did it so you can"". They don't see why it's a problem.

354,"Bit of background. I like to watch porn on reddit. There’s some good shit on this site and some very specific NSFW subs. Admittedly, some of the subs I like are pretty weird— r/feet, r/Pee, r/freeuse... 

Well for the past couple months my girlfriend has been giving me shit (almost daily) for jerking off to girls that aren’t her. She’s been saying my type is fat white girls with no ass and that’s the type of girl I like to jerk off to (she’s black so she says this makes her very mad and that she should break up with me for it and that she doesn’t know why she has already). And admittedly I did kind of lie to her about it, and say that I usually jerk off to her nudes, which isn’t true. But in my defense she has asked me several times throughout the relationship to not compliment other girls because it makes her sad, and she’s made it clear that me being attracted to any other girl will result in a fight.

So for the longest time, I was wracking my brain trying to figure out how she knows I’m jerking off to porn. Whenever I asked she would always just say she can’t tell me because it makes her suicidal to talk about it... well I’ve come to find out that it’s probably because it’s a bit obsessive. I checked my login history on my account and 9 of the 11 logins in the past week were from a phone with Sprint. The other 2 were with Verizon. I use Sprint, she uses Verizon. I realized that a couple months ago I told her my password to my Snapchat (but she pretended to cover her ears and not listen) and this is the password I use for everything. Well I guess she was listening after all, and she used this password to login to my reddit so she can see whenever I’m jerking off. She pretty much logs in once a day; sometimes she’ll skip a day, but sometimes she’ll log in 3 times within a 24 hour span.

Well I really don’t know what to do. When I saw this my heart dropped to my stomach. I feel invaded upon and exposed. I jerk off to some weird stuff. I have untraditional tastes. And my girlfriend has been monitoring this daily for the last couple months.

Our one year is coming up next week. She’s apparently going to get me a massive present that’s going to “creep me out” because of how expensive it is, and apparently she had to take out a loan to buy it.

Should I break up with her now? Should I talk to her about this? Should I wait until the one year as a way to get my money back for the things I bought her for our one year? Because I’m suspecting it may be a car, in which case I’m willing to be slightly unethical and wait a week just to dump her. I need a car",15May2019,2

I know he doesn’t like me back but I cannot help it but fall for him every single time although I tell myself everyday that i’m done with him and I don’t want anything to do with him because he can be so careless and insensitive sometimes.
I really hate the fact that I can’t have him. He is INCREDIBLY charming it makes me so furious. He makes me feel all types of emotions all at one, I fking hate him and love him at the same time. he probably sees me as his little sister, I am 21 btw. 
Going to work has not been the same anymore. Whenever he is around it makes me upset that i am right here in front of him yet I can’t seem to get any attention from him. I CARE ABOUT HIM SO MUCH. I do lots of things for him without him even knowing. I organized his desk once when he was away because I heard him complain about how messy his office is.

362,"Hi all, I own an older iPad mini (not sure of generation but it’s roughly 5 years old) 

Recently I had it turned off and in a drawer for about six months and when I tried to turn it back on, it said it has been disabled for over 40 million minutes! Obviously this wasn’t a human error, as not only was it turned off and in a drawer, but theres no way to get it to that point as it would have just locked after so many attempts.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this or is it a lost cause? The nearest Apple store is several hours away and even then, as it doesn’t get a tonne of use I can’t justify the cost of repair/replacement.

364,"So idk how long this is gonna be or anything but I appreciate anyone willing to read. A few hours ago I blocked my best friend of 6 years. Over two months ago I was talking to her on the phone when my neighbor started knocking on my gate to tell me something. I told her to hold on a second while I went and talked to him for no more than 5 mins. I heard her on the phone saying “are you still talking to him?” and I said yeah I’ll be right there and then she hung up. I haven’t heard from her since. (keep in mind we would text almost all day everyday before this and hang out irl all the time) A short backstory is I have a complicated relationship with my neighbor and she doesn’t like him, which is understandable. But I also don’t like guys she has involved herself with and I don’t take it out on her. I try my hardest to give her advice and be there for her when she’s having trouble with her boyfriends and I expected the same back. A while ago I set aside everything and messaged her pretty much a whole essay to explain myself a bit and apologized to her if I made her feel any type of way and told her my feelings for him were complicated and I’m working it out. I really tried. And she ignored it. I just know in my soul she’s trying to play games with me, and I’m tired of it. She is giving me the silent treatment over something so small and pointless. What’s really hurting me is I had texted her a while after saying that I was in a really tough place and needed someone to talk to, and she just ignored it. She has done so much worse to me than this and I have forgiven her and have been there for her constantly. I’m just so done with these mind games and “teaching people lessons”.

Even when they're not venting about personal problems, their tone still makes you feel slightly unpleasant. I'm sure this is unconscious. I could ask to tone down the venting but the way they speak is ingrained.  


I'm desperate to maintain the positive atmosphere we have going on. Some people like this person, others don't. If I kick this person out, the atmosphere will change for those who liked them. If I do nothing or only ask to tone down the venting a bit, the atmosphere will change for those who dislike them.  


I really don't know what to do. A server similar to mine dealt with this in a way I deemed nice enough, but even that changed the atmosphere for the worse.   
The only idea I could think of so far, was creating a certain channel solely dedicated to venting. I could disallow anything remotely negative in all other channels and put a maximum on how often you're allowed to use the new channel. However, creating a space for this content only puts a magnifying glass on it. But without a space for it, I can't disallow the negativity in the other channels - I still want other members to be able to ask for support every now and then.

373,"Hey guys, will keep it brief for you. I’m really into this girl at the moment, let’s call her H. 

So we hang out in the same friendship group, go out a lot together and flirt quite a bit. I started to wonder if I actually liked her in *that* way, and I definitely fell over heels for her. However, there’s a catch.

Next week, she’s going to America for 3 months. She’s basically going to be like one of the leaders of Girl Scout type thing, and I’m happy for her, considering it’s going to be an amazing experience and it’ll look good on her CV.

So from knowledge I’ve learned from her close friend, she’s actually said that she wants to be with me, but she’s too busy thinking about all of the stuff to do with America to get involved in a relationship right before she goes. Which I totally understand. 

The problem, is that 3 months is a long time, what if she comes back one of us has moved on but the other hasn’t? What if I spend the summer waiting and then she gets back and that spark is gone. I’m not asking her to get with me and be in a fully committed relationship before she leaves, but to at least give me some sort of confirmation? 

We’ve got 3 nights out before she leaves. I intend to talk to her about it at some point, but what do I say? I don’t wanna cause her any distress by mentioning this before she goes, but if we feel the same way about each other, surely it’s worth talking about *at least*.

I like drinking, my whole family does, and working doesn’t exactly remove me from alcohol, I drink pretty much every day either having a beer after work or wine with a book or film. Generally my relationship with alcohol doesn’t feel at all like I’m addicted, but then again I think I’d be pretty uncomfortable if someone told me I’m absolutely not allowed to drink for the next few days (unless it was for a good reason of course.)

I met my best friend in college 2 years ago, she was the complete opposite to me in every way but we clicked. She was in an abusive relationship at the time and i spent everyday with her convincing her to end it. It ended up with her trapped in another state and me having to call the police and get her back home. Since then we rarely go more than a few days without seeing each other, we’ve grown to be sisters. Last night was her 21st birthday, we had been planning for weeks. I would pick her up at 8:30 after work and we would go bar hopping around my house and she would crash there. I get to her house to find a car full of dudes waiting to pick her up and take her to a bar 30 mins away from my house. We got into a fight because she thought i shouldnt be upset that she now expected me to drive 20 mins home and pick up our friends waiting then drive 30 mins back to that bar when the bars we planned on going to would surely be closed before we got back to my town. I left and she called me apologizing and asked me to come get her from the bar to continue our night. I wasnt about to let changed plans ruin her birthday or my night so i went. She was with a lot of her old friends who ive heard countless stories about them fucking her over or hurting her. She wouldnt leave. I wouldnt leave her there because i didnt trust her to get home safe with any of them. I sat in my car waiting for almost 2 hours before i left. I’m really blindsided by this honestly. Id never imagine she’d choose to spend her birthday with those people or that she couldnt even have the decency to ditch me outright and save my gas. I didnt get home till 1am after working 9am-8:30pm. I didnt get a single drink, and i cried myself to sleep while she posted 50+ snapchats of her and her friends. I dont know what to do at this point, is it wrong to want to end the friendship over one fight?

387,"So.. i'm 13. And my mom has barely made me do any school over the last 1 or 2 years (maybe 3 years, not sure.) (i'm homeschooled. And i don't know how to do it myself either. i have to be 100% sure i'm doing what i'm ment to be doing or i just won't do it at all.) I don't even remember what grade i'm in i haven't done it in so long. But i'm asking this here because: i don't know if i can get a job in the future if i don't have an education? Should i just keep not doing any school and hope my mom helps me with it at some point?(which i doubt she will anytime soon)  Or should i try and get her to let me go to a public school?

389,"My ex (first love)  is the perfect guy. Noble, good heart good son good boyfriend good brother and friend, Good Samaritan , good looking, good student. He has always been and he will always be. Everything I wanted in someone.  We went thru so much shit together. We were together when we were 12/13-15/16 years old I didn’t realize what I had until we broke up. It’s been 6 years and still can’t get over him, I’m still thinking one day he will be back, the fact that we kept talking all this 6 years even tho he’s in a committed relationship and probably marrying eventually didn’t help at all, he just fed a fantasy because he felt sorry for me. He is not interested  in me romantically at all. He told me the last time we talked that he felt since the beggining that I wasn’t his other half, that most of our relationship was an act because he didn’t want to hurt me. That he felt sorry for me and he didn’t want to hurt me anymore, he wanted to leave me but he couldn’t without hurting me. So when I left him he felt sad for the good times but happy that he finally got rid of me, he didn’t want me close at all. He kept talking to me over the years to try to compensate all the wrong he did to me. He was an imbecile and he knows it and it makes him feel terrible every time he remembers me. he knows what it caused in me. He’s head over heels in love with his gf and he’s actually afraid that she’s gonna do to him the same he did to me. “Fake it”.  I forgave everything because we were kids. He set a really high bar that nobody could ever reach. My actual boyfriend is almost there( with who I got because I thought I was over my first) who’s is a very nice guy, his heart is so big, there's no mean bone in his body, he's a good son, not as thoughtful and more cold, he's love language is definitely not like mine but I have learned to read it and accept it. He's a good brother a good student, idk about Samaritan, he doesn't really care for people. Extremely good looking. Amazing boyfriend. He’s not perfect, there’s stuff I wish he did different. But even like that I have a thing for him. Like the adult love thing where you accept them even with all imperfections. I guess the idea that it didn't work out with my ex because we were young, I feel like now it could. If he gave me the chance. But if he did I don't think I would be able to leave my boyfriend. He's amazing with all and his imperfections. And I really want to be with him. He will never be my ex but i choose him.I know he's the right for me.  It got bad when I realize my actual SO wasn’t playing with me and was actually getting serious. I told my self it was not normal to keep checking up on my ex and thinking about what he thought of me. And that is a trigger that has ruined everything. Now I see him everywhere, people look like him, colors, scents. Even my SO reminds me of him (thing that never cross my mind for more than a year ) If the case is that I still love my first. How do I stop? How do I get over him? So I can be with my actual SO? I really don't want to leave my SO.

P.S. if you gonna tell me this isn’t fair for my SO and that I should leave him... my SO knows about ALL this about my feelings and everything and he believes I can overcome this. He’s 100% amazing and supportive.  He’s there for me, he listens. He understands. Talk about an amazing person. Who loves and doesn’t expect anything back. I cant leave him, there’s no another one like him in this world. I wanna be 100% his and I know I can. Pretty sure if I break up with him I’m gonna 100% regret it and won’t forget him never just like my first. I don’t want to make the same mistake twice. I know this can be fix not matter how hard. I’m gonna fight for a life with him.",15May2019,1

396,"Hello,

So, I put in my two weeks notice via e-mail on Saturday after one of my shifts and management has not acknowledged it. My formal resignation letter was attached.

I know notice should typically be given in person. However, I work two shifts a week and hardly ever see my manager. It is nearly impossible for me to do this. Note, I also had to put my two weeks in when I did because my Summer Semester for school is starting in about two weeks, and school responsibilities are one of the main reasons why I am leaving my job.

The e-mail was sent with High Importance to two members of management. I know for sure both of them check their e-mail regularly. Yet no response still. As I’ve said, I hardly ever see my manager. I am unsure what to do in this situation.

I’m debating on forwarding the e-mail I sent to my HR rep. I could text my manager, but I really don’t want to bother her more than I already have. 

I’m going nuts because what if my manager really hasn’t acknowledged it and then says that my end date has to be later? I cannot work past the date I already gave notice of as my last day. 

I realize notice should be given in person, but I’ve only worked at this place for about 6 months. They’ve never shown they’ve really valued me as an employee so I’m not really inclined to go the extra mile in terms of this kind of stuff. Plus it’s 2019 everything is done by e-mail these days. I don’t see why this should be any different. 

Note, I do work tomorrow. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",15May2019,1

I go to work early and stay late everyday, and I'm only getting some support. It's essentially so fucking busy to the point where if I stay home today, tomorrow will be impossible.

407,"Sorry for the long post

So my relationship with my family is complicated, my mother was depressed and very rarely got out of bed or made me go to school and my father had left years ago and was doing well for himself with a new girlfriend and a cosy house and was even trying for a child. Then my mum up and decided, when I was about 12, that I was going to live with him and dropped me off with my things and that was that.

So back to the modern day, I'm currently in college doing a course that I'm not too bothered about as I'm basically finished (did the last paper exam yesterday and only have 2 more small assignments to do left) with it and doing something else next year.

I like to think of myself as your average 18 year old, I'm on social media for a large part of the day, have a small friend group who I hang out with once a week, have a job at a pub, messy room all that kinda stuff. 

My family now has a 3 year old little sister who has not really impacted me too much directly but who has been a issue between me and my family, this is because I'm not an overall big fan of children, so I often end up trying to avoid her and keep talking with her to a minimum.

This all recently came to a head in an argument my father got into with me when I told them I wanted to get a vesectomy as I don't think I could raise a child after seeing what it was like first hand or let a child impact me as much as I have impacted my father. He told me that it wasn't normal for my age to be thinking that, he then made the assumption that it was because I don't like my little sister (I don't not like her, I'm just not going to coddle her or play her games)

He then proceeded to bring up my ""shitty attitude"" and how I don't seem like I care about anything, don't enjoy anything, not interested in being part of the family and bad hygiene (I only take showers when I need to because I always get a sigh from him when I ask and I just feel like a pain).

He then said how hell make a plea that I'm not right in the mind and will ""get every right taken off me"" (side note: step mum works in a mental hospital) and how he'll kick me out of the house.

Where should I go from here? If my parents don't want me there enough to kick me out then is our relationship salvageable? Should I start making plans to move out with what little money I have?

409,"I am a game designer, right now working as a game tester. I recently got a job offer for a position of game designer and the pay is about 50% more than what I am earning right now. Before I became a tester I tried for a while to be hired as a designer, but most of the studios around the place where I live are studios that make mobile games that try to cannibalize the customer. I hate mobile games, I hate what they did to a medium I respect as art. And I just couldn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasted a year pursing and achieving nothing. I wasted another year working as a game tester for the very kind of games I hate(still there). I tried to rely on my programmer friends to try and get some work done on my own game, unfortunately they have their lives and I cannot compel anyone to work for me that too for free. So that got nowhere and I wasted further more time.

Now, finally for the past two months, I am getting my work done. I get a lot of free time at my job, I learned some rudimentary programming and basically got a bunch of design related stuff done for my game. Currently on my way to make the first prototype of my game. Now out of nowhere I get an offer, should I pursue? I do not want to. But logic dictates I should pursue something I am sure of, rather than something volatile with a large margin of failure. I do not know if after I make the prototype I'll find a publisher for my game. Whether anyone in my country would be willing to invest in something that makes less profit while requiring a larger investment than a mobile game. And what would I do if I am rejected? Would I be stuck here forever? I am 25, I occasionally still have to borrow money from my parents to make ends meet.

I have the skills to make a game that can cannibalize, this past year I had access to most of the design docs for the money making cannibalizing mobile game I am testing, further polishing my insight. I don't want to, but the 'if' I don't succeed is scaring me..

I always apologize, and text him first, and why does it even matter, if you care about someone then show it. Like i don't understand because he tells me that he loves me or at least used to, but then ignores me and act like he doesn't care about me. Maybe i'm overreacting.. but i just don't want to force someone to show that they care about me. Or force someone to talk to me. I'm currently in school and it's awkward whenever he passes me, it's like weird eye contact but no eye contact at the same time.. I hope that makes sense. Am i overthinking this? should i just talk to him? see the thing is i dont wanna come off as annoying, and i dont want the cold shoulder to be given. He normally always comes up to me, so when he doesn't anymore it gives me the impression that he doesn't want to talk to me, so i just give him some space. Like this is so immature, if he doesn't want to be around me or talk to me at least tell me, don't have me wondering what i did like a fool.. Every time that i try to confront him it just doesn't get any where so i've given up in a sense.

When we texted yesterday this is how the dialogue went 

Me: how are you?

Him: amazing

me: wow that's fantastic, i'm gonna go

him: wait why, oh my bad how are you?

416,"I recently moved back from university to come back to the hometown that has nothing left for me but my family. All my friends have left so I'm very alone with no one to hang out with and I've been working overtime shifts at a shitty warehouse so far this summer to make money for school. I've been very depressed and in addition, in a long distance relationship. 

My partner works for the government parks and her boss was able to give me a job offer to live in staff housing and work there for two months with the high possibility of being re-hired each year for each summer of University. This is excellent as I initially planned next summer to stay in the city and work but instead can get free staff housing and not move back home; so I get to save on rent and save time applying to summer jobs during school. The only downside is that the warehouse pays $18/hr while the government job pays $14/hr. My parents expect me to cover my tuition costs (Approximately $7000) and I am able to cover it as according to my budget calculation I'll be making around the high $8000's including tax deductions and excluding overtime and already have some funds set aside to cover the majority of my groceries for two months ($400). To make things better, my partner will be working in a different department meaning that at the end of our workdays we can be together, and my long-term independence and the fact I'm away from my disliked hometown will really help my mental health. 

The counter-argument from my parents is simply me being mentally weak because I'm reliant on her, me not liking the outdoors, expense for groceries and leaving a job midway through the summer as I'd be quitting the warehouse after two months. To be honest with you I'd rather be outside than have my eyes hurt from the sunlight after being trapped in a warehouse for 9 hours a day with people double my age and alter personalities of myself. Going through with this job will make my two months even worse as my parents will be upset and be angry at me for a whole two months living in a hostile and tense environment. I'm very scared but I really feel I need to make a break for my independence. I even had to ask my parents for my social insurance number because they keep it in a safe place cause they don't trust me. I really feel this is an excellent opportunity in the long-term and that if I am brave enough I can secure my independence for the rest of my undergrad.

422,"I live with two friends (all female household), both I've known for 10 years and we get along great.   The friend with the boyfriend in question just moved in last August -- since then things have been ok but in the past three months her boyfriend has basically moved in.  He will be at the house ""waiting"" for her but his ""waiting"" is HOURS before she gets off work.  He showers at the house, sleeps at the house, and hides in her room and watched tv all day, at the house.  We have both told her it is not ok, nor appropriate that he is here without her.   Nothing against him, but we want and deserve our alone time. (for gods sake I just want to go to the bathroom for once without putting on pants.). She has aknowledged the problem but it still is consistent.   For example this morning, she is at work until 1:00 and he is now waiting at the house house for groceries to arrive in between 10-12. So he will be at the house literally all day.  My other roommate works from home so she has is at her wits end as well.  

The advice I'm seeking is: when should we start asking for him to pay for power, water, and maybe internet?  Is it reasonable for him to be at the house every minute is girlfriend is and then some? How would you go about this? 

Happy to answer clarifying questions.  Just lookin for help!  Thank you in advance.",15May2019,1
423,I just started a job at a big home improvement store in a small city as a cashier in the garden Center. It has been pretty slow and I work 9 hour days so it can get pretty boring as sometimes it’s long periods of time between customers and I don’t really have any other tasks to do other than sweeping up every now and then. It’s a nice and non stressful job which I like but I wish I had more to do cause I’m super bored all the time. Would it be bad to maybe use a bluetooth headphone in one ear and listen to music while working? I feel like it’s a bad idea and would feel kind of guilty about it even though you’re technically allowed to have your phone on you. They haven’t told me if I’m allowed to read or anything like that which I assume is a no. Any advice is appreciated,15May2019,1
424,"Okay I don’t know if this is the right place to post this I don’t even really know why I’m posting this but I needed to say it to someone or something.   

So basically ever since I was really young I’ve always been getting with older guys like men in their 20s. I’ve been with a man in his 20s since I was 16. That’s fine we’re happy and coming up to our 3 year anniversary.  

But I can’t stop fantasizing about older men. I see one man almost every day and he’s definitely about 35 and I can’t stop thinking about fucking him. I get off to the thought of older men on me. 

I don’t know if it’s just a fetish and I need to tell my other half so he can role play with me or if it’s daddy issues.   

My biological father physically abused me and my mother and went to jail when I was really tiny and I barely remember him. Then my mom remarried and that man would beat me when my mom wasn’t home and then he was shot and killed when I was 10.

I decided to do a strict crash diet before I go visit my boyfriend (Friday). Unfortunately it has made me feel really terrible. Not only do I feel extreme hunger (expected) I feel so sleepy and I have had terrible acid reflux (haven’t had that in years).

I want to work back to normal food (I’ve only done this for a few days) but I feel like I’m going to vomit anytime I get near food. Any advice on how to work food back in?

427,"I recently got a text from a friend in which I’ve been told that someone’s been spreading horrible things about me. 

I’ve always hated gossip. I can never sit knowing that someone out there is speaking ill and essentially cursing me, so when I got this text my heart sank to the bottom of my chest.

I asked said friend who happened to say this, but he basically told me that he had no idea who it came from, but he heard it from HIS friend, so he refers me to said friend.

I speak to his friend, ask him who it is and he replies with “He’s apparently one of your close friends.” At this point, my head is fucking spinning. I have many close friends, and I wouldn’t dare suspect them of having said such things.

Eventually, I get them to elaborate and he tells me that they’re in my small discord group.

Before I go on, I have a small discord group for gaming - R6:Siege, LoL, Warframe, Apex Legends. Squad, Escape from Tarkov and etc. it’s a group of 5 people (me included) these include

-Names changed for personal reasons, they’re random names-

Person 1 (Jake) is my closest friend. I’ve known this guy since about 5 years ago and I can’t imagine him saying things like these.  Person 2 (Gabe) is an eccentric fellow I met in class, we’re close and have bonded over countless problems and issues, he even calls me a brother from another mother. Person 3 (Ace) is a friend I made at my school over gaming, he’s really cool, introduced me to PC gaming and essentially got me hooked to what I am now. Person 4 (Daryl) is a rather narcissistic guy. He often insults Gabe and the rest of us, but he’s nice in general. He’s full of himself and I’ve gotten into fights with him because he constantly bullies Gabe. Despite all this, we’re close, he’s got my back and I’ve got his.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who did it. I have my bets, I have my assumptions, but I can’t just act on those can I? 

What do I do reddit? 

TLDR: Found out someone in my 5-man discord friend group has been saying bad things about me behind my back, don’t know what to do.",15May2019,1
428,"Hey guys.

Its been like that virtually my entire life - my eyebrows are structured in a way that gives me a REALLY bad case of RAF (Resting A$$hole Face). It really hurts my first impression on people and even one time a guy straight up asked me ""dude what did I do?"" After we crossed each other a couple where I did nothing but glimpse at him. Meeting a girl and talking to her is a lot harder for me because when me and someone first cross looks I look like I really want to beat them up (according to my friends and family at least) and I need to go to online dating where the first thing people see is a pic of me where i can slightly raise my eyebrows and look a lot more pleasant, but let's face it, online dating sucks (I get plenty of matches the issue lies within the very concept). People tell me ""just smile!"" But come on - nobody walks around smiling constantly (unless you want to look super creepy). I'm seriously thinking of going through some sort of cosmeting procedure to alter my look because I have a feeling that it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy where I become an a$$hole because I look and sometimes treated as such.

437,"I (21) first met her (20, we’ll call her Steph) last year at work. Our relationship since 2 weeks ago only consisted of flirting and basically spending all day at work with one another. But rarely making plans outside of work where it was just us. Like going to the movies. I have a girlfriend, and she has a boyfriend. 

Recently we had a night out and we became very close. We had a few shots, nothing to make us drunk, however it was enough to make her tipsy and me buzzed. We began flirting with each other like never before, touching, holding, laying on each other, holding hands. Basically if I was single there would have been nothing in the way of us hooking up. (She’s always saying there’s something wrong between her and her bf so I assume she’s ready to end it, haven’t asked her though) 

On the drive home we were in the back and our two friends were in the front. She kicked off things off by grabbing my hand and things escalated from there. Next thing I know she’s laying on me, we’re holding hands, I have a hand over her waist and we’re laughing, flirting. I see my house coming up not really sure if I wanted to get off or stay in the car longer. A part of me wanted to get off so I can go to sleep and pretend it never happened. And a part of me didn’t want it to end because I knew what was coming next if we would have stayed with each other longer. 

Time passed, and we’ve realized how similar and alike we actually are. We’ve gotten very close, telling each other everything. We’ve been seeing each other late at night, lying to our SO’s about where we’re at. Talking in our cars and driving around for hours and never running out of things to say. Honestly this is the shit you see in a movie, but I shouldn’t be in this position with her. 

I love my gf, we don’t argue, I love her family, we’re always ourselves, and I do see my self marrying her. 
But I feel like shit because I can also see a future with Steph. I don’t think I would have tried anything if I was drunk, but that doesn’t mean I would have turned her down if she did. 

Am I a bad person? I’m very good at controlling myself, especially while drunk. But I feel like all of that goes out of the window when I’m with her. Should I just stop talking to Steph (which might be hard since we work with each other) and hope the feelings go away?",15May2019,1
438,"I \[17, F\] have never wanted of having tons of friends to talk to and meet up with every single afternoon. What I do want is to have one or a few real close friends that I feel like I can be myself around, that I know will be there for me and that I can trust to 100%. The, very few, friends I have had before have either been toxic or they have lied to me several times and pushed me away.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a dream once before that I had real friends. I didn't feel too good and all they really did was greet me, as in them walking up to me and not the other way around, asking if I was okay and giving me a hug (as in a sincere way). The feeling was so unfamiliar yet so amazing. I remember that I cried when I woke up, wishing I had that.

&amp;#x200B;

I know all this might sound a bit silly and all but it's just me being honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any place to meet knew people and trying to make new friends at school is really hard too. 

People give of the feeling as they don't really want me there. When I come to school to meet my classmates in the morning most of them ignore me even though I say ""hi"" to them. Several times they've just left me behind, even though they knew to 100% that I were there and that they could've waited for me. It's also very clear that they much rather choose someone else over me. Their faces literally light up when they see someone else other than me. If I ask them a question they give me short, half-hearted answers while they give my other classmates a whole speech. 

Once, when being with a group of girls, one of them said to ""make the ring we were standing in bigger so that everyone could fit"". Well, everyone fit....except for me...of course. And that's not the only time I couldn't fit.

I even overheard my *roommate,* at a school trip, having a conversation, just 3 weeks in with my new class, talking about how she didn't like me, and let me tell you, that school trip went from great to living hell. I did not want to say there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would never do anything like this to any of my classmates. I always try to be great friend and make everyone feel like they are accepted and sometimes I wonder if I should just stop and give up. It's been a year now and idk if I'll get anywhere with my kindness and constant trying of becoming friends with my classmates. Am I doing something wrong? Am I not cool enough? Am I boring?... I don't know and sometimes I just wish someone could tell me the truth and say:

""Hey you are really boring and annoying. Just leaves us alone, we don't want you here.""

Just something so that I know what it is with me that makes people not want me there.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, I'm not gonna drag every single person there is. There are times where someone have said something to me and made me feel like I actually exist and that I'm a part of the group . And Let's just say those days are the best ones.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what I'm asking for.

Within the past year my sister has been talking about marrying him. I’m wondering if it would be weird to ask if he wants to propose at my wedding reception? My fiancé and I don’t like a lot of attention, and we are only having a reception so that our families will feel like a part of our big day (we are having a very small ceremony). I love the idea of doing a bouquet toss, but instead of tossing to the group of girls, I would hand it off to her, and he could propose right then. I don’t want to insert myself into their engagement. But I want my sister to be happy, and I would be a little relieved if some of the pressure was taken off me on my wedding day. I think it would also be a great story. My sister is also much more outgoing and has no problem with receiving attention. So what do you think, should I ask him if he’s thinking about proposing?

444,"Slightly misleading title. I'm a generally happy guy. I am 30, happily married, have a great job, great family, amazing puppies (they make everything better)... But I often get very overwhelmed. My job is demanding and I'm still a part time student. When i get overwhelmed I typically shut down and quit at things or admit defeat. I also have issues with being tired. I am very active in my job and personal life, but as soon as I sit down my eyes want to shut. I have trouble getting up in the morning and I want to nap every day after work. I suppose you call this ""being an adult.""
However, this is where it gets interesting. I had an injury about a decade back that caused me to need painkillers. I never got addicted to them and rarely ever took them in the last decade. There was the occasional bad day that i would need one but I always tried to avoid it. I had one of those bad days recently and took half of a painkiller (Vicodin). That day I wasn't tired at work, I was able to get a ton of work done, etc. It was like someone flipped a switch in me. Even though it helped, I continued to avoid them. To this day I've never taken them on back to back days. I'm not even sure I've had two days during one week where I've taken them. But on those days when I do take them, I'm so much more productive and awake. So how do I get that without prescription painkillers?",15May2019,2
446,"I have been living with my roommate for about 3 years now. Everything has always been good with us except for the random argument every once in a while (we are also good friends and of course disagreements happen, so it’s no big deal). 

Over that time we’ve both have had some partners come and go. He’s been with his current partner for 2 years now and she moved in about a year go. I’ve been with mine for 8 months. 

When they started seeing each other she lived in another city for school (her family leaves here though) and when she was in town she would stay at our place. This included summer break where she basically lived here full time and was home even when we weren’t. At that time we had another roommate and he wanted the GF to start paying rent and utilities. It turned into a big argument which ended with him moving out and friendships being ruined. I supported my roommate and his GF and said I didn’t think the GF should pay but maybe she could contribute with helping with the chores around the house. Roommate agreed and thought that was fair, his GF begrudgingly agreed and kind of contributed. The roommate would do her chores because she generally would complain about it. 

Flash forward a year...

Roommate and GF have officially been living together for a year now and the rent is split evenly between the 3 of us. For the most part everything is fine and we all get along. I’ve been seeing someone for 8 months now and things are quite serious but, we are not at the point where we fully want to move in together. Everyone gets along quite well and we spend a good amount of time together except for roommate’s GF who is just constantly unhappy. 

I should also point out that we live in separate parts of the house (I’m upstairs and they are downstairs) so, we literally aren’t bumping into each other or having to fight for space. 

My GF spends a lot of time at the house. She spends most nights here and generally comes over once I’m done work. She’s never here when I’m not and she goes home in the morning to get ready for work i.e. eat, take a shower, make coffee. So, she’s not consuming any of our food or taking showers here or using any of our stuff. 

Just recently, my roommate approached me and awkwardly asked for my GF to start contributing financially to the house. I asked him if there was a problem with my GF and where this was coming from. He told me that his GF didn’t like that she spends the night so much and that it’s not fair. When I brought up that this was similar to what happened a year ago with him and his GF, he only responded by saying it was different because his GF went to school in another city (but, she still had her house with her family here). I don’t think that makes a difference personally since she still had a home in town where she could stay. 

Him and I agreed that just the two of us would go for coffee this week and sort it out. 

How is the best way to be reasonable with him about this without moving out or having my GF not stay here or having it turn into an argument. Yes, I know that staying at her place is an option but, we’ve both agreed that it’s inconvenient since she lives on the outskirts of the city.",15May2019,2
447,"Hey all,

I'm 18 and moving out by August, to an entirely new country, in fact. I've been working my ass off for about 5 months earlier this year and made more than enough money for about 3-4 months abroad without a job.

I really liked my previous workplace but I signed a short term contract, knowing I couldn't stay there for much longer anyway because of my plan. Ever since I left that place in February I haven't really been up to anything. I've earned a few pennies doing some graphic design, but that's hardly an income at all.

Bottom line, I'm still somewhat emotionally attached to my previous workplace, and I'm afraid I won't be fortunate enough to feel the same about a new place. Not to mention that the fact I've got enough money for my near future plans makes me picky. Very picky.   
I feel like I'm wasting precious time and money but I'm simply mentally unable to step up and start contacting employers (even though I'm even familiar of a place that's currently hiring nearby).

Apparently she got the worst news yet and I know she doesn't have too many other friends to talk about this with or to hear her out aside from me.

I'm graduating college this fall with a bachelors of arts in art and I feel completely unprepared and overwhelmed with the world I'm about to enter. I've learned absolutely nothing practical from my degree. I only know how to paint pretty pictures and the very basic of skills in Adobe Illustrator, but nothing more. I feel like I've wasted my four years in college and come out in the same position I went into college, completely directionless and unequipped for the workforce. 

On top of all of this stress, my mental health has quickly been deteriorating. I've been suffering from Major Depression for the past four years and it hasn't been getting better. I've been on antidepressants (specifically Lexapro) for the past 2 years and it's only left me feeling emotionless, numb, dissociated from my life, and even more overwhelmed. I hate being completely unable to feel anything. As someone who largely relied upon her own feelings for every decision being made, I feel completely at a stand still because I don't feel anything at all anymore. 

My family is making all of this even more difficult. There isn't a day that goes by that they aren't asking about my job search, or saying that ""I need to get a job"", and are constantly making their opinions and their thoughts known to me. Their constant ""are you doing this? have you done this? you know you need to do this. why aren't you doing this? etc. etc. etc."" only leaves me even more overwhelmed and stressed out. I feel like so many people are asking and expecting so much out of me when I know I don't have the mental capacity right now to do what they expect of me. 

I feel so directionless, emotionally numb and distant from my own life and completely unable to be an active participant of it because of how I feel. I feel so extremely passively suicidal because I can't feel anything anymore and I feel like a complete shell of my former self who was so driven and sure of what she expected/wanted out of life. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Sometimes, I honestly think about just moving somewhere else, taking a low-minimum wage job and just sorting life out and being away from my family. I feel so incredibly claustrophobic around them, even though I know they mean well, but I've never felt like I could be my own person living here with their constant high expectations of me.

He broke up with his fiancé (while she was pregnant with their 2nd child) and moved in with Becky.

452,"Last year, my disabled parents sold their house and were temporarily homeless. This was in part due to their bad money management, and in part bad time management. They were given extra time by the buyer to find a new house and move. They squandered the time they had to find a new home in their budget. I worked my rear off trying to help pack their entire house in two weeks. I spent more time at their home than mine.

My husband and I decided to help them, so we took our 11 year old son and moved over 50 miles so that we could live with them, making the household income high enough to be approved by the HOA in the community we chose together. My parents are disabled, and over the years my father became emotionally abusive toward my mother. We knew he had some issues, so we set up ground rules things that would not happen around my son. Yet I didn't know how bad it had gotten until we moved in together. The passive aggressive storming around, yelling at my son any time he made noise (they got angry when he laughed too loud, or if he got excited playing games, he's a child!), as well as making my husband and I feel we could not leave our room without being glared at, snapped at, or scolded. Any time my son was in the living room, they would glare and go back into their bedroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in January, we moved out. There was a lot of screaming, yelling, drama, and over the 6 months we lived there, guns were involved several times. My husband called the police twice, and I had to take my father's unlocked and loaded weapon away from him. For the safety of our son we left. It was a very painful split. The three of us here have all suffered severe depression and anxiety from the time we spent living with my parents.

I explained to my mother that there was no way I would move back in with them. I was hurt by their actions, and felt taken advantage of. They expected me to be a live in caregiver, work a part time job, and be a full time mom who kept my son completely quiet and out of the way.

My mother responded by waiting a few weeks, than coming to my home so I could give her a haircut, and telling me that my son and I were welcome to come back and move in. She had a job interview for a full time position, and wanted to know if she would have a reason to work that much. She wanted my son and I to move back in with her, and she wanted an answer within the next few weeks. She made no mention of my husband moving in, just said that he hadn't helped with the situation when we all lived together.

I responded with anger. I sent her an email explaining that I was not going to divorce my husband because she is lonely. She chose the abusive relationship, and then dared to ask me to put my son back in that situation. After several days of back and forth emails calling each other out, and her insulting my husband repeatedly, I have cut communication and haven't spoken to her since. I have spoken to other family members, and tried to rebuild the support I need to keep myself together.

I miss her. I love my mother and I wish things had turned out differently, but they didn't and I have to keep moving forward. For a long time we've been very good friends. I haven't stopped my son from emailing or calling her, it isn't right that his relationship with his grandmother should fail because she and I are arguing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I married a damn good man though - I have full faith in him, in our relationship, and he has never treated me the way my father treats my mother. I married the best person I know. I won't throw that away because of my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to say to her at this point. How do I let her back into my life without destroying myself? We all make our own choices, should I choose to try and repair the relationship or just admit that her choices have led her down a path I can't follow?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have no idea if we are still on the paperwork for the HOA. I don't know if my parents have a high enough income by now, and I worry that if I call the office and check, and we haven't been taken off the paperwork than my parents will be evicted. I don't know if I could live with myself if I was the reason my disabled parents lost their home, yet I am extremely concerned that my husbands credit could fall if they stop paying the bills. I really have no idea what to do.

(Just made this account, partly to lurk - partly to post this. I've tried asking supposed advice columnists, but all I got back was, 'Thanks but we've decided not to answer this question!' and the friends that I have spoken to don't seem to understand.)",15May2019,5

463,"Hi Reddit, (M24) 

I’m on the train to work this morning after staying the night at a friends place. She generously asked me to come over and stayed up with me after a huge fight I had with my boyfriend (M26)

I still don’t know exactly what happened between us but I’ll try to explain as best I can. I came over around 7pm as I usually do on a Tuesday because we always spend Tuesdays and Saturdays together. I was super excited to see him all day as we recently had a great weekend together. I was also excited to talk to him because my sister had told me a couple hours before that she is 6 weeks pregnant. 

I texted him earlier in the day saying I was excited to see him. He didn’t respond to it because he’s a teacher and is super busy at work. 

Finally I get to his house, and I’m grab him and kiss him. I lifted him up and gave him more kisses and hugged him tightly. I was trying to talk to him and tell him about my day and about the news and he was on his phone. He said “hold on, I’m doing something important” after-which he seemed to be fussing with the fitness app for his new Apple Watch. 

I could see that he wasn’t in the best mood. In fact, both of our moods couldn’t have been anymore polarized. He came home to his apartment being a mess, he didn’t have time to clean it the night before because he got home late and that always sets him off. He’s a very clean person, and gets upset when his space is a mess. 

He asked me to get his laundry with him and move the fridge so that he could clean behind it and he got more upset about a reoccurring odor in his kitchen. Some granola spilled on the floor and I helped him clean it, all while still wanting to talk to him. He was antsy, and stressed and to be honest I figured “he’s having a tough day I should sit on the couch and do my own thing while he cools down” 

But then he took the rugs outside to beat the dust out of them, cleaned the sink in the bathroom and did the dishes. While I understood that he has too do these things, the vibe of the night was making me feel uncomfortable. It was getting harder to talk because I felt like he wasn’t really hearing me anyway.

He stopped for a bit to join me on the couch and I asked him if he’s okay. And he sorta said yeah but also shrugged it off. He complained a bit about coming home late and such and 2 hours he spends commuting to work robs him of his time. 

I told him that my sister is pregnant, and that I was really excited for her. And that I have to see her soon. He smiled and talked with me about it. I can’t fully remember but I’m sure he kissed me on the cheek. 

He asked me what do I want for dinner. Which I always respond with “I’m not sure, you tell me” because he cooks, it’s his place and his groceries so I’ll have whatever he makes. I suggested this dish we were supposed to have over the weekend but didn’t get to. It was already prepared and he answered kind of sharply with “I’m not cooking that”. He said he didn’t want to cook for the two of us. Though he said “I’m
not saying I wouldn’t cook for us both, I just don’t want to” immediately after. I felt weird about that, it started to seem like he didn’t want me there.

I figured I could just order off seamless for myself and let him cook for himself.

After this, he went back to running up and down the house cleaning and complaining. 

I stayed on the computer and he said “I don’t like that you’re not keeping me company” in a softer tone. I said “well babe, I would like to but you seem like you’re not in a talking mood” 

So I stopped what I was doing and followed him into the kitchen. I talked about my stupid boss and tried to be funny about it and he responded well to it, but after that, our conversations started to feel more and more forced. 

In one moment I held his hand to stop him for a sec and said “baby, sit with me” and be sharply said  “I don’t want to sit, I want to clean my place because it makes me antsy, I want to shave my face and shower, and then go to bed. I’m not in a cuddly mood right now and I’m sorry”.

The night got worse after this. He folded laundry while I sat behind him on my computer. Too uncomfortable to talk. And he kept trying to come up with things to talk about and at this point I started feeling upset.  So I wasn’t really talkative as I had been.

Then he snapped and said “well I tried to be engaging too” 

And then he walked out of the room. 

I scrolled through my phone texting my friend that this is happening and that I don’t know what to do. And he began to tell me that he needs me to talk to him and accompany him while he cleans and he won’t hold it against me if I can’t give him that at the moment. But then he paused and said “I will hold it against you if you are going to be on you phone” 

And I heard him, but I did a double take and looked up and said “wait what?” He got pissed and said I’m not listening to him. I tried to repeat what he just said and it came out wrong and he got more upset. 

I apologized for that. As I can understand that it can be rude. 

Then we sat awkwardly across each other and talked and he said “I would like for you to offer to cook sometimes”

And I was like “what? Where is this coming from?” 
I said I’d be open to that but I’m terrible at cooking and it will take me twice as long. He said the dish I suggested was already prepared so I could have done it. He said he washes dishes 80% of the time but yet acknowledged that I offer to do it. 

I started getting angry at this point. But also confused about why this is even happening. I told him if he didn’t want me to come over then he should have just told me. I’d rather have gone home. 

He said “I didn’t know I would feel this way. I saw my messy apartment and it triggered me” 

And I said I have my own needs and although I had no expectations for the night, the last thing I wanted was for me to try and have a conversation with you while you’re attention is divided as you scrub the toilet. 

I had nothing more to say in the moment so he asked if it’s cool if he can shave, shower, and clean the stove. 

And I said “go”

Then he came back, said he won’t eat tonight and he’s going to bed. I sat across from him in bed and said ...

“I’m really hungry and I need to take care of myself so I’m going to order food” (I would have stayed in the living room that night. 

“Going forward I need you, even if I’m on my way and it will be inconvenient, to tell me if you don’t want me over. It’s understandable that you get upset about your apartment but if you feel like it going to make for a bad night then just tell me”

“I can accept that you want me to offer to cook and I’m open to that but I feel like given the context and how tonight went, it felt out of place. It really should have been brought to me when things are more calm”

“I need you to be more responsive with your texts, because you didn’t even acknowledge the ones I sent you and quite honestly it feels like you weren’t even excited to see me at all” 

He got mad about the texts, said he didn’t even look at his phone. Didn’t even see them. He said all he did was use the music app and didn’t have his messages open. 

He texted me at the gym, during his work out and said he’d be going home in 20 min. 

Personally I feel as though he was making up excuses. He didn’t even text me in the morning. I had to. 

He got so mad, that he said

“I don’t want you to stay. I want you to go home and I want to go to bed. I don’t want you to order food and so you can either leave my bedroom or leave my apartment”.

And I tried to talk to him and he completely shut down so I left. 


Part of me wants to fix this.. the other part is so angry and feels disrespected and so I don’t feel as though this is going to work out.  I held it together the whole time and then broke down as soon as I got to my friends house. 

I will not reach out to him. I don’t even know if I want to talk to him right now.  I deserve better than how he treated me last night. 

I don’t know reddit what should I do? What do you all think?

464,"I am a Belgian neuroscience student, nearing the end of my studies, and soon I will be doing a research internship. These internships range from very theoretical to more applied.

\- *Subject*: applied, which might open doors to new interests

**Option B**

People will only ever speak to me when they need something, and ignore me when I need something. Over the last two years, I decided to try and be more social and enjoy my life, but I find it difficult.

However, once it shifts, I hear nothing from them. As of December 2018, I have had no messages on my phone and I have received no FB messages. I was hacked on FB so had to do a new account and after friend requesting all my friends again, I have been ignored and some people blanked it.

* Person A: (Had a major crisis)
* Me: Popped up and helped them as best as I could, listened to them at all times and helped

471,"I’ve been with my loving girlfriend for 5 years. We don’t have sex very often, she’s a bit inexperienced and is okay with going long stretches without sex, I’m okay with that completely. 

I stupidly had an affair with a woman at work a few months ago. She isn’t quite my type but she’s manipulative when it comes to wanting sex, more specifically wanting me to finish inside her (no protection, but she’s taking the pill).  

As you can see where this is going, it happened. She’s pregnant. We only had sex maybe about a dozen times in the three months or so we were having sex and I felt so guilty the whole time that towards the end I told her I didn’t want to have sex with her anymore since I couldn’t stand the guilt when I came home to my girlfriend. That’s when she told me that she was pregnant. 

She claims she hasn’t had sex with anyone else and that it had to be mine. I saw her take two pregnancy tests and they were positive. She’s happy that’s she’s pregnant which leads me to believe she wanted me to get her pregnant by purposefully forgetting to take pills, otherwise, why be on the pill in the first place?

Long story short, I live with my girlfriend, I’m going to have to tell her that I had an affair, that the woman is pregnant, and I’m completely fucked. 

I don’t want to get to know and live with this woman. 
I don’t want to be a deadbeat and have this kid grow up not knowing his father.

472,"I tried posting this on r/crushes but no one ever responded, so I decided to post it here: 

So I’m an 18 year old guy who’s a senior in high school, about to graduate. I’m a big theater guy, and currently rehearsing for a musical (opening night this Thursday!!!) and I’m surprisingly finding myself crushing hard on this sophomore girl who’s in the cast. I’m confused because I’m not the type to crush on a specific person, let alone a sophomore girl.  I’m a pretty shy guy in real life, but I like how in acting I can become someone else who’s not shy. However, I think one of the reasons I’m crushing is because, this girl is showing interest in me. I’m wondering if she just wants to be with an older guy and she’s like 15-16 (not sure, whatever age of a typical sophomore). She frequently breaks the touch barrier, said she knows that I lift weights without me ever mentioning (compliment I guess), lowkey flirts with me etc. Sometimes I don’t know what to think because this doesn’t happen to me much, but I’ve recently lost 30 lbs of fat so i guess that makes me a little better looking. But she has a naturally flirty personality I guess. She’s said things like asking me if I think she’s hot, or if i thought she had big tits, etc. I’m thinking it’s all maybe because a lot of the guys in our cast aren’t straight so maybe she can tell that I am or something. But all in all, i can’t believe that I’m crushing on some sophomore girl when I’m basically a grown man at this point. What steps should I take, if any? I’m graduating in a month.

The area was kind of remote too, so we were only allowed in the playground area, where they could see us. I went up to one of the kindergarten nurses and asked her if I could take care of presumably the youngest Child that with us and she happily agreed, since he was a bit annoying and cried a lot. I picked him up and we snuck out of the playground, into the wooded area. It was not far away from where all the others have been but they could not see or hear us. There, I placed him on the ground and walked away from him, hiding and listened to him cry. I remember feeling true happiness and excitement while I was causing him to cry and scream. I say that because I had a similar feeling when I got my first gf or graduated, but way more intense and better in a way. I peeked out of my hiding spot a few times to see the relief in his eyes that he was not alone just before hiding and making him cry again. This went on for a few minutes before i took him back to the others and since he was crying before as well, no one took notice.

480,"To begin with. I'm not too sure if this is the right place to post this.
For background, I'm a (female) student at the ONLY highschool in my town (the ages of students here are from 11-12 to around 16-17) and most of our teachers are 25+. Now I HATE my gym classes because my Gym teacher  (GT) is... strange. 

He often makes perverted comments towards the female (and male) students and treats them like trash, whereas the male students are basically treated like ROYALTY.

Examples of his comments towards the students are:
1) We were doing high jump one day, and my two friends  (both male) were doing really good at it. But he kept making weird comments about their butts. And it wasn't like:
""Oh, try stick your hips up so you don't hit the line."" 
It was more along the lines of ""Your butts are big."" That's it.

2) When checking attendance GT often checks if the females are wearing gym kit (a top, and anything that wasn't normal trousers, pants or jeans. Shorts or leggings only) and he wasn't too sure about this one girl was wearing proper kit for her lower half or not. (If the boys aren't wearing kit or don't have the proper shoes, he'll leave them alone but if the GIRLS don't seem to be wearing kit he'll harrass them and give them shit about it.)
   So he asks her to stand up and give a twirl, but whilst going to stand up she accidently spread her legs and his exact words were ""mhm. Even better."" 
    (As a side note. On that day I didn't have kit - I was ill and had thrown up that morning but came to school regardless. When I told him this he rolled his eyes and basically yelled at me.)

3) TODAY, we were playing frisbee outside because it was pretty warm outside and he divided the class into two teams.
    Boys (8) vs. Girls. (11) and I offered to join the boys team to make it 9 against 10 and he SCREAMED at me about how it was boys vs girls and it was staying that way. 
    Quick note: The girls in my gym class do nothing and he knows it.
    At one point in the game, I had gone to get water  (I had brought a bottle) and sit in the shade for a moment to regain my composure. (Again. I'm unfit.) And he yelled at me to get back to the game despite the fact he was letting two boys (one wasn't playing to begin with, and the other was just sitting t h e r e) rest.

4) I have a friend (F) and she's in my gym class. She's of a rounder build  (like me) but is overall very pretty and rather kind hearted. When we were changing she was letting me vent: (I'll be Me, she'll be F,)
Me: ""Like, GT is so annoying! Did you see the way he was treating the girls!?""
F: ""Yeah. It was pretty annoying.""
Me: ""You know he was saying weird comments about the girls and some of the guys?""
F: ""Really...?""
Me: ""Yeah!"" I begin to explain a bunch of weird comments that he was making  (1, 2)
F: ""That... makes sense. He once just went up to me and started saying stuff about my hips and thighs.""

I LOST it at that moment, I had finished getting changed and went to go get my lunch. I had decided to go and report him after the day to my pastrel teacher  (PT.) I had told my friend C about this (he was one of the guys in reason 1 and is also my best friend.)

After my first class after lunch I met up with C and a few more of our friends and we had began to make our way to the classes. (I'll be Me, C will be C and another friend will be Z.)
Z, to me: ""You mentioned wanting to report GT to the guidance (PT) what's that about...?""
I told her the reasons. 
Z: ""When are you reporting him?""
Me: ""After school.""
C: ""Why not now? I'll come with you.""

C is a really kind boy, he's seen as being strange but he always means well. Z is a bit of a drama queen, but as I usually say ""She's a queen I stan.""

So C and I made our way to the office where out Pastrel Teachers (aka the Guidance) normally are and we spoke to our PT who is really understanding and the only female Pastrel Teacher. As we explained our reasons for him making him uncomfortable, one of the male teachers  (also a gym teacher) tried to defend the comment about the butts. I shut him up instantly and PT took us somewhere more quiet so C and I could talk to her without being interrupted. 

PT promised us that we would remain anonymous as she got the HIGHER UPS (Senior Management and Vice Principal) and told them what we had said before taking the next course of action and talking to him. 

But then I began to worry about the teacher that tried to interrupt. He's really buddy-buddy with GT and might tell him who reported him to PT.

Did I do the right thing here?? If GT finds out it was me what should I do??? I need advice here.

(SIDE NOTE: I had also mentioned a rumor that he had looked into the girls changing room as well as the fact that he is extremely harsh to girls when sick or on their time of the month. If they complain about cramps he makes them run at least a lap and gives them a referral, but it the GUYS hurt their hand or finger minorly they get to sit out.)",15May2019,2
481,"TL;DR at the bottom  
\-

So, I have been with him for about 6 months, we met on a dating app and we put off meeting each other for the first month that we were talking. He was okay with this and very understanding and accommodating. At the time (and still - getting to my goal soon), I was just starting a weight loss journey (I've lost 40 lbs all together - 10 more to go), and really wanted to be my best self for when we finally got to see each other. I also wanted to take the time to get to know him, because I didn't want to jump into being physical right away. We took a month to get to know each other, and around christmas, we met in person for the first time.

\-

Where the problems start is that in the first few weeks of talking to each other, he expressed that he'd like if I wouldn't talk to other guys. I expressed that I'd prefer if he didn't talk to other girls.. that it would probably be a bit hurtful (since he requested it of me first). I would have been okay with both of us talking to and dating others, because I didn't want to push him into anything, even though I really liked him. But since we'd both agreed to really only talk to each other seriously, I thought that this is what he wanted. However, his words and actions didn't quite line up.. (I should also mention that around the first time we met, he divulged that he'd never been in a very long relationship and that he once broke up with a girl because she had a bit of upper lip hair \[he called it a mustache\] - this was cause for a bit of anxiety on my end because I feel as if I have flaws that are MUCH worse)

\-

Every now and then I would go back on the dating app to look at our conversations (I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic) and I would see that he was active on the app. The app is one that only shows that the other person is active when they're actively going through matches/likes. I was pretty devastated but I never said anything, because I didn't want to freak him out or push him away. But I was hurt - the fact that he was active probably meant he was actively talking to other girls. And I considered it as breaking the promise we'd made to each other. Around the same time, a friend of mine also told me that she saw he was active on another dating app/site. It was okcupid (little green dot when active). An app that I didn't use. So I was crushed yet again.

\-

I made the decision to stop going on the app to look at his profile. Because each time I did it just broke my heart a little bit more. I began to slowly distance myself (though he probably didn't notice) and I let him approach me for dates. That being said, we were basically seeing each other once a week, and the time that we did spend together was really nice. He was always very respectful and gentlemanly. He always paid for our dates (even when I would offer to pay - he wouldn't allow me to) and even expressed that he would like to take me shopping for new clothing (my clothing was getting too big and baggy for me at this point) I learned later on that he had kept the movie ticket from our first real date, and put it inside the homemade Valentine card I had made for him. So he obviously felt sentimental towards me.

\-

After the first time we were intimate I felt I had to bring it up. I expressed myself calmly with him over a phone call one night. I told him that now that we were intimate, I would prefer that we would be exclusively intimate with each other. He said that he wanted the same and we were on the same page. I thought this was good, and that he would finally be ready to delete his accounts on the dating apps. Although, I didn't bring it up to him. I wanted to let him decide for himself.

\-

A month or two passed and he was still active on the apps. He didn't say this to me, and I am sure he was under the impression that I had no idea, so I finally decided to bring it up. I called him on the phone and very calmly asked him to be honest with me about everything, he told me he had been. I told him that I knew that wasn't quite the case because I knew he was active on the dating apps. He immediately became a bit defensive, and said that he wasn't. That he only opened the emails he received from them. I told him that I wanted to give him the opportunity to be honest with me, and tell me what he wants. I told him that if he was looking to see other girls, that it was okay but that if that were the case then I would probably want to see other guys. He said that wasn't the case. In the end he couldn't give me a totally straight answer as to why he was still active on the apps. I let the issue go, I didn't want to push him or make him feel as if I was asking for too much.

\-

Still, it was pretty much constantly on my mind. We would spend a night together, a night that I thought was great and fun... and then he would be back on the app as soon as he got home or the morning after. A few weeks later I couldn't take it anymore.. I felt really disrespected and confused. If he seemed to enjoy the time we were spending together, telling me that I was his ""ideal"", that I was exactly what he wanted in a girl ""sweet, kind, good morals"" (all his words), and that he always wanted me in his life... then why was he seemingly still advertising his singleness online? Why was he seemingly actively looking for other girls.. it didn't make sense to me. It hurt and confused me.

\-

I tried to confront him and set my boundaries, while remaining calm and understanding. I tried not to accuse, or demand.. I told him that I was thinking that it would be a good idea for us to both delete our dating accounts if we were serious about each other. I told him I was serious about my exclusivity with him and didn't see a point in keeping my accounts open, and I preferred that if we were going to be exclusive that it would be beneficial to instead of focusing on what else is out there - focus on having fun with each other and spending time together. He expressed to me that the last few weeks had become dramatic and serious and he didn't like that. He didn't like talking about deep serious topics and preferred keeping things lighter. He said that he would delete his accounts if it would make me want to stop talking about the issue. I wanted to be fun for him, I was resenting the fact that I felt as if the sense of uncertainty in what we had was what was keeping me from enjoying myself and having fun. I compared the way I was feeling to how I typically interacted with friends and I didn't like it. He didn't really give me the chance to be silly, I felt, because the time we had to spend together was so scheduled and planned. It felt like planned fun.

\-

So, he told me he deleted his accounts. I felt guilty. I didn't want to force him into doing anything he didn't want to do. I saw the times when I confronted him as giving him an opportunity to come out and tell me what he wanted. If I had confronted him and he said ""I don't think that's something I'm ready for right now, but maybe in the future"" I would have known what to do. I would have drawn back, I wouldn't have invested as much, I would have probably started looking elsewhere as well - or at least kept my accounts inactive but in existence. I hated that every cordial conversation I tried to have made me feel as if I was being too dramatic. I didn't want him to do whatever for my sake, I wanted him to tell me where we stood. And I expressed this to him. I felt that I was communicating my wants/needs but he was not communicating with me at all. I had no idea what he wanted or where we stood.

\-

I should add that during this time his father had been diagnosed with cancer. He's very close with his father and confided in me quite a lot about it. I gave him all the support I could, I offered to do anything that he needed. He had told me he was never a cryer, that he only remembers about 5 times in the past 10 years he had cried and... he cried in front of me. I held him in my arms and he cried. This alone made me feel so much closer to him. He had been a bit closed off from me from the start and I felt he was letting me in slowly by doing this. I loved letting him feel as if he could confide his pain in me, I wanted to help him through everything if I could. This is probably when I realized that I loved him.. in some sort of way at least. And I was comfortable saying that I loved him.

\-

However, I recently discovered that I had gallstones. I had been getting sick on and off for a while after I ate. And the most recent attack took me to the hospital. I had jaundice and I was in pretty bad shape. I needed to have two surgeries in two days (I'd never had surgery before and I was afraid and nervous) He was nice through all of it. He sent me texts asking how I was doing but.. it didn't feel like what I probably needed. He didn't come to the hospital, he didn't visit me after I got out of the hospital, I guess I didn't feel like he supported me the same way that I did him. While there, I called him on the phone and it took a lot to express to him that I felt lonely... I started crying, a little bit, for the first time in front of him... I realized that the fact that I felt as if I couldn't freely express myself with someone who I had been with for half a year was probably a red flag.

\-

The week after I got out of the hospital.. I had a lot of time to think, a lot of time to overthink, and a lot of time to ruminate and worry. I think I was probably unhappy and felt unsupported. Whatever we had after 6 months didn't feel like a relationship to me. I had told him I loved him, he'd never said it to me.. and I didn't expect him to or want him to feel as if he had to - but I guess I was wondering when it would happen and if it would happen and starting to doubt that it would. He had only ever told me that I was his ideal, that he loved having me in his life, and he didn't want to lose me. I guess I was beginning to resent him... I felt like a placeholder. Like entertainment for the time being. I felt insecure in my position in his life.. I had no idea how he really felt about me. Because he was reluctant to express anything.

\-

So, in probably my worst moment.. I decided to do something. I needed to know where I stood. I needed to know if I was wasting my time on somebody who didn't really care about me all that much. I needed to know, so I did something I normally would never think of doing. I made a fake number with google voice with an area code in the town he lives in, and texted him on Friday evening. I just said ""Heyy"", he texted back almost immediately (normally he texts me back hours later). The conversation continued, he wasn't sure who this girl was, so I made up a name. And he took the bait. He apparently had talked to a girl with the name I chose. He asked for pictures, and when I called him on the phone to tell him how I'd been feeling (it was just a few days after my surgery) and ask him how he was, and how his father was doing.. he was simultaneously talking to this fake girl. Apologizing to her, and telling her that the serious conversation that he and I were having was ""multitasking"". Like I was a chore to be taken care of, an annoyance. At this point my heart was pounding.

\-

After a while, he stopped replying to the texts while we started to have a deep conversation. I told him all that had been bothering me. Not knowing where we stand, feeling as if he doesn't really want to be around me. I finally got him to admit that even after he'd asked me not to talk to other guys - he was talking to other girls. I asked him why, and he didn't even have a reason. I was so hurt. I told him that if he'd just been honest with me from the beginning that things would have been different. I would have understood, and acted accordingly. But he was dishonest. I told him I didn't know what to believe anymore, because I'd been lied to from the beginning. We talked for hours, and fell asleep on the phone together. The next morning he texted me telling me that he'd been crying all morning, that he realized he wasn't giving me what I deserved in a relationship, and that he never wanted to be a cause of stress or hurt for me.. that he wanted to be able to take all of that away. He said that he understood if I wanted to break up with him, because he just wanted me to be happy no matter what.

\-

We talked on the phone again, and he broke down in tears. Over everything. His father, our situation, and feeling as if he was being pulled in two directions. I told him, quite firmly, that I never would expect him to choose between me and his father.. that his father was more important, and that I want to support him in any way I can. He cried and told me how kind I was... I just wanted to be there with him, holding him and comforting him. Hearing him cry broke my heart. We agreed to meet the next day.

\-

When he picked me up, he said his piece. He said that for most of his life he kept his work, home, and romantic lives separate. And that ideally, if he was ever with somebody, he would want what we had at that time. He felt comfortable only seeing each other about once a week for a few hours. He started to choke up and said ""I don't want to lose you"". But he understood if I would leave because I wasn't getting what I deserved. Basically, it felt as if he was saying ""this is the way I like things, and I'm not willing to compromise but I want you in my life anyway"". We talked some more, and I asked him why he'd been lying to me. The best answer I got was that he was worried that I would be a catfish (in the first month) or that things wouldn't work out. Our conversation was enlightening, and I did feel as if we got somewhere with it. When I expressed to him that I didn't know what we had, he was very surprised. He said that he just assumed we were already in a relationship, while I thought that we weren't.. because it was never expressly said. He said that he considered me his girlfriend, and I was shocked... I had spent so long not wanting to push myself onto him, and not wanting to make him feel forced into a relationship, always worrying where I stood.. and then he just says it like it was common knowledge. I suppose he figured that it wasn't the kind of thing that needed to be said.

\-

I'm not sure what to do. Part of me wants to put this behind us, and put my trust back in him. I feel like our conversations this past weekend really got us somewhere, and helped us reach a better understanding of the others wants and needs, and where we fit in each others lives. However, there is a part of me that feels incredibly guilty and ridiculous for doing what I did. I feel as if it has the potential to ruin our relationship if I tell him, but I want to be honest, and there is also a part of me that wants to confront him about the fact that he was lying to me as he was doing what he was lying to me about. There is also a part of me that knows that I will NEVER know what he's doing at all times, not that I want to... but I suppose I have a hard time putting my trust into someone knowing that at any moment I can be burned. Should I confront him? Should I put it behind us and move forward (because I feel we've made a lot of progress)? Should I admit what I did? I do love him a lot, and I feel I would be going against my own morals by not being honest with him.

\----

TL;DR Met my boyfriend on a dating app, after becoming exclusive he still hadn't deactivated his dating app accounts and was actively using them. I confronted him about it and he said he was just ""checking emails"", I said that I would delete my accounts and would appreciate if he would too. He told me he did, but he didn't. He said he removed the apps from his phone, but he only removed one. Then, after a heart to heart he admitted that he was talking to other girls when we first started talking (even though he asked me not to talk to other guys). I asked him why, and he didn't have a reason. Now, I made a fake number to see if he would ""take the bait"" so to speak, and he did. One night, on the phone he was texting the fake girl at the same time as speaking to me and when I asked if he was talking to any other girls at the moment he said ""No"". He lied, effectively, to my face. We had a long dialogue over the course of three days this weekend and worked some things out, but it's still at the back of my mind that he so easily talked to some random girl. I'm wondering if I should confront him about it or let it go. I'm also wondering if I should admit what I did.",15May2019,1

485,"Hi, I am new to this subreddit. I have also checked personalfinance subreddit, but I felt the advice I need is more personal than money/budget wise, so I thought I'd post here for some help. Please tell me if it's still better to post over there instead &gt;&lt; 

**Brief background:** Currently both my parents haven't been working in the past few years due to severe health issues, and I am still in full time college (graduating in 2-3+ years), so I can only work 1-2 days casual minimum wage jobs on Sat &amp; Sun. So the only proper money we are getting is government support, which is below the poverty minimum in our country (we get roughly 28k in USD a year in support). 

The problem is we have a lot of mortgage, credit card bills, health insurance and loans to pay, so we are not left with much money afterwards. Currently we borrow 2k USD from some relatives every year to manage, but I don't think they are capable of giving us it in the future. 

However, I did some brief calculations, and if my family pretty much live on 1.5 meals a day, minimum internet and phone usage (so we can switch to cheaper plans), and absolutely buy NOTHING such as new clothes unless EVERYTHING else is unwearable, nice fruits, glasses when their broken glasses still sort of work, etc. then maybe we are capable of managing without borrowing money from relatives.

**This is the problem:** Despite our financial situation, my parents *want* (and they are very stubborn. Like nothing I do can stop them. Nothing unless I get a knife and threaten them or something lol) to go out regularly shopping - to buy fruits, food, clothes or other things like a $40 USD home phone since our old one is 12 years old and glitchy. Nothing they buy currently is extremely expensive but they all add up.

Currently we still eat 3 meals a day, even eat out (cheap food though) sometimes, so I presented my plan to my mother - to not go out anymore (to do anything, except shopping for things we HAVE to have once a week) to save money. But she was very stubborn and give me her opinion on our lifestyle: since my dad was very sick and cannot work anymore, over the years he's become increasingly depressed and perhaps even a little suicidal. He frequently complains to us life isn't worth living because he's sick for the rest of his life (and that he wants to die), and such. He's very mentally unhealthy and unstable. 

My mum encourages us to go out shopping &amp; spend money every week because shopping (money) is the only thing keeping my dad happy. Like, it gives him hope to live because at least next week he can go shopping and buy the food he's always wanted to eat - that kind of thing. Shopping also keeps my dad healthy, because otherwise he doesn't leave the house to exercise at all and just sits in front of his laptop all day long. I'm honestly afraid that if one day our family is so poor we actually have to live like what I just listed (1.5 meals a day, etc.) my dad might actually go crazy because for him, there's no point of life. We live in a culture where money is extremely important - your worth in life is defined by your money, so without money it's like your entire life is ruined beyond help. If my dad doesn't live like how we are currently living I think he would rather die since that means life is completely worthless and there's no point of it. He also doesn't listen to ANYTHING I say... he has a bad memory too so he will forgot it anyway even if he does listen to my advice to stay positive.

They also buy me a lot of expensive (not that expensive... but 'expensive' considering our situation) food to eat, and sometimes nice clothes. I tell them I don't want it, but my dad says if I don't eat good food I will extremely unhealthy, that I need to eat well so I can study well at college, and nice clothes will help me make an impression when I go to study at college or when hanging out with friends or when doing job interviews so I don't look too shabby. 

I can understand their reasoning but I am aware we cannot afford to keep living like this. When I tell my mum she says we will naturally come up with a plan or stuff like that (I mean, I guess we can potentially borrow off richer relatives until I graduate) but I hate living like this - living on borrowed money. But my parents are too stubborn to change. Like, 2 days ago we were looking at sweaters in a shop because my current one is really old. But it's not unwearable yet. I told my mum we didn't need to buy a new one (it was 15 USD) but she physically wouldn't leave the store until we bought it because she says I need good clothes to make a better impression, because she loves me, that kind of thing. I currently still keep the receipt and I'm thinking of returning it but I know she will yell at me and secretly buy it again for me if she finds out. I also suffer from depression and anxiety I'm always very lifeless... I can't work as if I'm working at gunpoint to improve my current situation, if that makes sense.

I was wondering how to approach my parents regarding our current  situation to save more money? Like, not the saving money part (I know we need to budget), but the part to pretty much *convince* them we got to start living even more poor to save money. Without my parents objecting like they do right now. Nothing psychologist related please because my parents *hate* that kind of stuff and don't really believe in mental health (I've tried so many times).

489,"It's starting to agitate me now because we've known eachother since kindergarten and that's the only thing that's keeping the ""friendship"" alive for me at this point.

We're in our 20s now. The problem I have is that he's consistently flaked on plans for a year and a half despite always talking how we should spend our time going to parties and meeting new friends. I've been doing exactly that ever since we graduated and spent all last summer inviting him to all sorts of social gatherings but he flaked almost every single time. The only time he actually hangs out with me if it's just us and we end our hangouts by sitting in my house all day watching TV, which is something we've been doing since middle school and now is something I can do on my own. Or something I rather do on my own I should say considering I balance school and work full time while he's basically goes go work and is done with the day after 3 o'clock. One time he straight up declined to go to one of the parties he said we should always go to because he was hanging out with another friend, then immediately called me some odd hours later after those plans fell through to see if I was home. I rightfully kept the convo brief and he kept texting me all throughout the night about what I had on my Snapchat trying to make small talk. After he randomly flaked over the summer last year we just seemed to agree mutually that we should make new friends. After this conversation he proceeded to text me every 30 minutes after I stopped responding. This went on for 2 weeks. There's no way for me to even feel bad about it anymore either. He says he ""doesn't know how"" to make friends but our neighborhood is small so all of our old classmates are literally right there for him. They're all the people we happened to be closest to in grade school too! Now summer is starting again and we're going through the same old shit as last year. 

He's been talking about watching t.v. all day and I kindly explained to him yesterday that I want to spend my now limited adult free time doing something fun since I'm also taking summer courses now.

490,"Hi I'm 15 m and to be honest I don't know if I have ADHD .I mean i hope its just some stupid phase or that I'm just lazy but it doesn't seem like i can focus on my school work or making friends.

Every time I try to focus on studying or doing a projects I can't I have to listen to music or act like idiot and run around my house. 

I don't have a barrier when speaking to people. I mean I really do care what people think of me but without thinking I would just blur out something offensive or insensitive.It is quite frustrating.

Sometimes I just zone out like I'm there and I can hear what people are saying but I just don't react. I just sit there like an idiot.

So I decided to take an online adhd test and it says I'm positive but I doubt that I mean it is a free adhd test on the internet.

I just hope this is some stupid phase or something with puberty and that this isn't permanent.

Please answer my question. Thank you.",15May2019,1
491,"Hi everyone, I'm a 16 year old guy. I was looking for a job for a while and eventually got offered a job at McDonald's. I really did not want to take it but someone told me I should take whatever job comes first and I took it. Now I'm looking for something more my pace. I'm a very anxious person so I want something a lot calmer, food service is way too fast pace for me. I realize that sounds stupid but I'm in the blessed position of not needing a job rather I want one. So I've applied at Barnes and Noble (dream job) and other retail stores since it's a little less fast pace. Also, some of my co-workers are pretty toxic.

492,"Alright so. I’m new here. This is my first post. Now sure how this works but figured I could get some advice and some input on the matter. Well, back story (it’s important to know). My mom’s had a couple of boyfriends. She cheated on my dad (my dad was abusing her mentally, verbally, emotionally, prior physically up until she cheated on him) and had a baby with someone else 4 years ago. She was with my baby sister’s dad up until 7 to 8 months ago, and her current boyfriend she’s been with for over a year (yes, she cheated on her precious boyfriend with her current one). He had invited all of us (my 3 siblings, myself and my mom) previously to go watch a movie about a week ago and I wasn’t able to go (I didn’t have anyone to take care of my son) but my two other siblings went ahead and tagged along with my mom and him. My siblings mentioned to me that that there was a new Godzilla movie coming out, so I came up with the idea that we should go watch Godzilla on opening night. My brother had told my mom what I had said and she was okay with taking us, but she also mentioned that her boyfriend would be going with us too. I mentioned the idea with my boyfriend and he was all for it and said he could take care of our son so I could go, but then I said that my mom’s boyfriend would be going too and he was completely against me going after that. He told me it was fine if I go, but he wouldn’t be happy with me going and he prefer if I decided to say no I’m not going anymore. His reasons? Because the guy is my mom’s boyfriend, basically saying that my mom’s judgment shouldn’t be trusted and she gets with whoever she wants, she’s unfaithful and that he doesn’t believe that my brother (who’s bigger than my boyfriend) either would be able to defend me. He also told me that he’s “pretty sure” he would harm me (sexually). I had a huge problem with it because my siblings are going to be there and I believed it was okay. Now, we don’t know her boyfriend very well, in fact, my mom hid the fact that she was with him up until about 2 weeks ago, but my siblings and I had known the whole time that they’ve been together, she didn’t know that we knew. Don’t get me wrong, I understand when I’ve gotta be cautious and be aware and to protect myself the best way that I can (plus, my brother is a big dude and he could very easily defend me if I can’t do it myself and he gladly would), but I just think it’s unfair and wrong of my boyfriend to assume and go off the top of his head and using phrases like “I’m pretty sure” to justify what he thinks about the situation and assume a completely stranger who he hasn’t even met will harm me in any way. Again, I know when I need to be aware and look for the red flags and I realize he’s trying to look out for me , but we really have no idea the way this guy is, which I realize could go a couple of different ways. Again, he’s going off the top of his head, making his own assumptions, using phrases like “ I’m pretty sure .. “ and going off of his own judgment about things he’s not even 100% sure. I need some advice. Am I wrong for still wanting to go knowing the things my boyfriend is assuming, or should I listen to him and not go? I’m not going alone with my mom’s boyfriend, my mom is going to be there, so are my siblings. Should I restrict myself from trying to make some good memories with my family? We’re also in a really hard situation and we could really use the distraction. I’m 17, 5’0 and weigh 100lbs incase anyone wants to know another reason why he’s being cautious. I’m fairly small so it’s easy to believe that I can’t fend for myself, but again it’s not just me and my brother is a big dude who could have my back in an instant and he would. How should I go about this? Advice? Insights? Could use it all.",15May2019,1
493,"I received this message this morning: Mr. My last name my name is Frank McCullough. I am a retired criminal investigator out of Winston-Salem, North Carolina and I have been knowing Miss Mary Lineberry since the 1970s.
   Now I am aware that you may not be familiar with Miss Mary Lineberry, however I do believe that you are somewhat acquainted with her 16-year-old granddaughter Kaitlyn Blank, who you recently met online on a dating application.
   Unfortunately for you, on Friday May 10, 2019 at approximately 10:20pm the young girl was caught in the act of making a pornographic video to send to you over the telephone. Miss Mary thought that she heard her granddaughter crying, but when she went into the girl's bedroom she found her completely naked and... Well, let us just say that she was doing something that she should not have been doing and we will leave it at that.
   Anyhow, the girl was caught by surprise and, when Miss Mary tried to take the laptop, a struggle ensued and the laptop was broken - a nineteen-hundred-some-odd-dollar MacBook Pro which was purchased from Best Buy back in December of last year.
   That laptop actually belongs to the girl's mother's employer - and that person is threatening to terminate Miss Janey Lineberry's employment should the broken laptop not be replaced.
   Thus the reason why I am contacting you, and why the police are not.
   Now Miss Janey does acknowledge that her daughter is just as responsible for what happened as you are. Because the girl earns between $80.00 and $100.00 per week, she is being made to pay for half of the laptop's cost - or, more specifically, $974.00. Should you agree to do the same, and carry out your part of this Agreement Offer in a timely fashion, then Miss Janey will agree that this issue has been fully resolved and no further litigation will be pursued.
   Of course, this Offer IS predicated upon the stipulation that you are never to contact, nor try to contact Kaitlyn ever again.
   Now you do have the right to reject this Offer, however should you choose to do so you should be aware that, instead of resolving this issue in a civil manner, the girl's telephone and the broken laptop shall be taken to the sheriff's office and this will become a criminal matter.
   The choice is yours. Should I not hear from you soon, Mr. My last name, then there will be no need for you to contact me at all, as this matter will no longer be in my hands.
   Thank you for your time and God bless.",15May2019,1
494,"Hey guys, first post ever on Reddit. 

I need some advice, and I'm hoping I'm in the right place for it. 

My workplace is becoming toxic, and I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to do going forward. I know there's the standard steps, like talking to your supervisor, following the chain of command, etc... 


**The Situation**

I work in a small office, outside, with three other guys. Over the course of the year and a half I've been with this company, things have progressively become more toxic. 

• I'm constantly blamed for things I'm not doing
• Things that do go wrong are constantly blamed on me, regardless of whether or not I'm at fault

I've brought this to my supervisors attention before, which resulted in nothing but being berated by both my supervisor and my coworkers. 

It's getting to the point where my coworkers are becoming agressive towards me. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do, so if there's some kind of advice? Please let me know.",15May2019,1

But now I feel bad that I shouldn’t have bought it because when looking for other underwear she said she really liked that one (the one that didn’t have in her size) I don’t know if I’m weird and shouldn’t worry or I’m just a complete train wreck but...I love my mom so much and I feel so guilty buying them I don’t know why.

497,"I'm a male in his 30s. I've been addicted to cocaine for about 3-4 years, using it about 3-4 times a week. Stayed clean for a few months then got back. 

I see myself dying of some heart desease before 60 (maybe before 50?).

Life is absolutely boring. Between things that are mildely entertaining or uninteresting, I'm barely motivated to live without cocaine. 

I've tried a lot of different stuff, nothing does it for me. Learning an instrument, reading, writting, stock market, competitive and casual gaming, YouTube channel, several kinds of sports/exercising (including different martial arts), smoking marijuana...

Even relashionships and sex are just not the same anymore. 

I've attended several different therapists. It's always something between a therapist that barely says anything and someone who says common sense shit or straightfoward bullshit, like some sort of post-modern relativistic shit (""that's your truth, but what about someone else's truth"").

If you wanna entertain yourself giving advice, I'm all ears. But please, no religious or getting married/raising a family stuff. I'd rather die of heart desease before 50. Or 40, 30, whatever.

498,"Ok so, there is an internal position in the company I work at. It is a senior role. My current boss is in the equivalent of this role. I’ve been doing my job for 5 years, and I noticed that on the company board an internal vacancy came up for the next step up for me. 

Once I saw the vacancy I went to seek advice from my boss. I was unhesitatingly shut down and advised against it.

I’ll give some context, I personally think I’m really good at my job in comparison to my colleagues. My boss always sings my praises so I was surprised by his response. I’m really unsure why he responded this way other than the fact he either doesn’t want to be considered the same level as me (he is way more experienced I admit) or he doesn’t want to lose me working under him, because I do a lot of his leg work day to day, and he knows I do it competently. 

I’m not too sure really what the criteria is in the sense of how many years experience to be considered, however I did ask him how old he was and he said when he was made up, surprisingly, it’s the age I am now. 

So, do I go for the application without him knowing? Or go for it and tell him I am anyway, maybe putting tension on our work relationship. Or just take his advice and wait until he thinks I’m ready?

Bare in mind, if I apply he has the ability to advise my directors against it considering he’s been my direct boss for years.

For further info, I do think that Id be at the bottom end of the experience level, but I am competent and what I do, I love a challenge and I want to progress. 

Would love your advice!",15May2019,1

502,"I am currently in highschool, and still have a few years to go, I'm not even close to being popular and have such a terrible sense of humour that my attempts at jokes only make a few of my close friends laugh, I am definitely a geek, love videogames used to play Magic: The Gathering and am just really tall and skinny, 3 things that make me ""the weird kid"". As is to be expected a group of people decided I'd be a really easy target to bully, and I was. I was scrawny generally unlikeable was and still am incredibly ugly and most of all, didn't have the self esteem to stand up for myself, so through about a period of 3 years a group of 5 guys would constantly harass me, push me around, and found every possible opportunity to ruin my life. The only person who ever tried to defend me was a good friend of mine, but he's terrible at confrontations so he tried to get me to stand up for myself and really tried to convince me I shouldn't just let people use me as a punching bag. Through about a period of 3 years the bullying continued and there was nothing I ever did to try to stop it. But then one day I was leaving a library wich is on tge second floor when 3 of these bullys try to push me down the stairs. That was the one time I truly felt threatened, so as I think most people would, I snapped, I did something really pathetic, I took a cup of Joghurt and squirted it on the nearest guys face and chest. I felt like a hero after doing that, it was the first time I had ever stood up to these guys and I felt like I was unbeatable. Very same day, I had to deliver something to the secretary and as my friends had to do so aswell the teachrr excused us and we went to deliver whatever documents we had to. I was putting the documents through a sort of mail-box and the moment I turned around, the two biggest guys in the bully group we're standing right there. First thing the dude right behind me was did (lets call him Miguel) was drop the file he coincidentally also had to deliver and started strangling me and punching me (Miguel was the guy I had sprayed with Joghurt earlier) all the while my friends were panicking and since none of them knew what to do thet just stood there telling the guy to stop, this was where i realized i needed to defend myself so I just started kneeing Miguel in the balls while trying to punch him in the nose. Eventually a third member of the bully group comes around and tells him to stop because he does'nt want them to get in trouble. So Miguel throws me on the ground and runs away as fast as possible. I didn't know what to do in this situation, so i immediately called my mom who was the only person y felt capable of solving the situation so my mom told me to go to ""Convivencia"" (I dont think theres a direct translation to english but it's basically an office where you bring disciplinary issues) and so I went and told them what had happened and they told me they would review the security camera footage and theyd call me to the office the next morning. When i had exited ""Convivencia"" and was running back to the classroom, the worst of the Bullies (the leader basically, who wasn't present during the incident)
approacged me together with Miguel and the other two guys and tells me Miguel was sorry, I would've accepted the apology but this leader guy would'nt stop laughing and making jokes about how pathetic I was with the tears still on my face from the shock of the incident earlier. And when I tried to shake his hand as a sort of gesture of good-will he just slapped it out of the way, looked disgusted and wiped it on his pants. The morning thereafter, I found out why I will never be able to be happy at my school ever again, this group of bullies were the jocks, the popular kids, they were the only good music band at school and everyone loved them. So as I exit the disciplinary office after them telling me they've reviewed the camera footage and are going to take disciplinary action. 
I am suddendly infront of about 50 people all saying I should killl myself and that I am a snitch, and so far theyve managed to remind me almost every day how little im worth and how disgusting I am to them. Luckily for me my school offers an exchange programm, where you leave for anotger country for 6 months, right now im in the middle of my exchange, wich is the only positive school experience ive had since primary school and its really changed me, I really had a ""glow up"" I grew from 5'11 to 6'3 (naturally not all during the exchange but still grew quite a bit) found a group of people who believed in me and turned me into the best possible version of myself I could they convinced me to work out with them, join lots of clubs and just generally make me more outgoing and by now I've even managed to have my dream of being funny come true. But now going back home is getting closer and closer and I want to be able to show people who I am without immediately being excluded for being the snitch i was. So all the advice I want really is how to make up for the 8 lost years of social life and being a snitch.",15May2019,3

Among that, he has been dealing with an aggressive rash. He has small dark spots all over his feet, and they think it's a problem with his liver, but they're not sure.

If you didn't think he was enough of a petri dish already, he was recently diagnosed with Pneumonia. He almost died of it when he was a kid. I literally at one point thought I was going to lose my brother to Penumonia years ago. And here it is again, so you can understand my concern. 

He has insurance, under the same insurer as me, actually. So I'm familiar with their healthcare plans. He insists it's too expensive, but going and getting a medical bill is miles better than dying. I've even offered to help him pay bills as I'm in a significantly better place financially. He refuses, of course. 

He used to work 50-60 hours at a hospital and survived on adderall for years. It killed his health. But he had a fiance and a kid to support and that's the only way he could provide. He works at a rehab center now and has much better hours, but the damage has been done. I've just kind of been watching his health slowly deteriorate.

Any advice on how to convince him to go to the ER?",15May2019,1

526,"This got really long so I'm slapping a TL;DR for those who don't care about my specifics:

When it comes to learning, is it much like creative expression, in that we have finite amount to spend in a day without wearing down our mental health; and if so is there a recommended amount of studying to be had in a day?

I would like to point out I googled this first but all I could find was how many hours people reccommend you study per week relative to college credit hours.

I'm wanting to pick up a new skill, and I want get good at as quickly as I can (preferably in the next two years) Which means trying to study a good amount everyday (on top of working). But I also don't want to burn myself out.

I hear some people say they study twelve hours a day and that just doesn't seem healthy.

My thoughts were that (for intensive, focused studying) somewhere around 4 hours. Although I am basing that mostly on the knowledge that most creative's only work on the intensive side of their craft for about 2-4 hours a day, and the rest of their day comprising of more minor activities. For example a writer might spend 3 hours banging out the next chapter, but after that they would be creatively tapped, and spend the rest of the work day, doing the ""busy work"" rewrites, detailing, emails, etc.

And my assumption is that the learning brain functions much in the same way, it has finite capacity to absorb information, and anything past that is at best unproductive, at worst damaging to the mental health.

Am I entirely of base, or does anyone know what the reccommned guidelines are?",15May2019,1
527,"My (19) girlfriend told me she was going to commit suicide. At first I thought she would maybe drop the subject at the end of the day, but she insisted that she was going to and kept telling me over text. Being that I’ve never been put in such a serious situation before, I immediately began to try and find any possible solutions to the problem that would involve her not taking her own life. 
I reached out to my best friend and from there I decided to call the hotline. At first I insisted for my girlfriend to call the hotline but she wouldn’t listen. She wouldn’t let me see her either. The operator on the hotline was very sympathetic and, in short, said if the situation seemed like she was 100% on taking her life than to call in a welfare check. 
I was pretty convinced she was absolutely positive with her decision and I called in the check, because I wasn’t able to see her and she wouldn’t allow me to. When the dispatch unit was in route she texted me and told me that she wasn’t going to commit suicide. After receiving that text I told her that I called in a welfare check because I was, and still am, worried about her and didn’t want her to take her own life, placing that guilt on everyone else’s shoulders. She completely freaked out, screamed at me, cursed me out, called off the relationship, demanded to see me at once and than had a complete mental breakdown. 

It’s been 2 weeks post incident and our relationship is at a stand still. The situation keeps getting brought back up because she doesn’t trust me. I feel like my reaction to her telling me about the suicide was favoring her life over our relationship, and to me that was more important. But I really don’t want to be at a standstill, nor do I want her to not be able to trust me. 

What can I do from here? I feel like I’m not really getting anywhere",15May2019,1
528,"Ok this is going to probably be a long story. Also forgive my grammar mistakes as i did not major in English lol.

I am from a very broken family. My parents split up practically the moment i came out of the womb so i have always just lived with grandparents and aunts and uncles. i was raised by my dads parents for about 11 years where i was raised by their daughter and a foster child who is a distant Aunt. Both of them were younger than me and were raised by my grandparents from birth like me. When i was 11 i had to move in with my moms family because of a terrible nasty custody battle. It was horrible over there. I was raised around kind, passionate, loving people and placed in a home where there was constant mental abuse as well as constant physical abuse between my new parental figures. Long story short when i turned 18 i ran away and went back to my dads parents as it was always a safe haven. I have been living with them for three years and now my foster sister (who everybody loves and adores) has taken a hard right turn towards failure. She is constantly yelling and back talking my grandmother as well as cussing out teachers on a a daily basis. We have just fund out that she is going to have to retake all of her sophomore classes because she failed. Every single class. Currently i am living with my fiance. Things have gotten so bad between her and my grandmother that we have had to move her in with us temporarily. I don't know what there is left that i can do to try and change her to be more respectful. Not just to my grandmother but everyone. I have tried everything and just want to see her do better and be better. Can anyone give me any advice on what to do?",15May2019,1

533,"Hello, 
First I'd like to apologise for my bad English. 

There is this girl (36, f and I  am 27, m) we became friends during my time in my last job. She also happened to live not that far away from me so we became some kind of close friends and she started to talk to me and open up about the problems she has been dealing with for a while now.
Basically she suffers from depression/anxiety, fear of commitment and also being abandoned, she is ashamed of her body (she used to have a sharp body and now is overweight) . She believes that her boyfriend (she's been with him for 4 years now) doesn't understand her, since both of them have big cultural/social differences. She basically doesn't do anything other than drinking from the time she goes back home from work till she falls asleep. 
She avoids public places and procrasitanes a lot.
I am afraid things can go worse now because I am quitting my job and therefore won't be there for her as often as I was when we were together at the office.

I really don't know what to do to help her since she refuses to go out, and prefers spending her whole weekend in bed binge watching friends for the 1000th time.

Thank you in advance.",15May2019,2
534,"32M, USA, living with both parents and older brother, working part time ($300/mo), savings 9k, no car


Over the past year several major household problems have arisen and my family is ignoring these issues and/or addressing them so slowly that it's unbearable for me. 


These issues include: scabies (has spread to entire family, parents in denial), mold/contaminates in hvac system resulting in constant breathing issues/coughing/phlegm (brother agrees there is a problem, parents in denial, may have inspector in a few months or longer after things are tidier around here), new bamboo flooring has toxic levels of VoCs (was intended to go into my room, I tried it out several times but it gave me tremendous breathing problems which my parents do not believe, my parents put it in their room and now the entire house reeks whenever they leave their door open causing sore throat and breathing problems for me and my brother, parents cough/sneeze slowly onsetting since installing wood), potential mold in my bedroom (good luck getting my parents to hear me out here), been sleeping in garage/outside/tent to avoid breathing problems for over 6 months, several household projects to be completed (2 bedrooms to be carpeted, kitchen cabinets to be put in, 3rd bathroom to be redone, etc).


What's strange to me is that my parents are unwilling to work with me and just deny that these problems exist even though I can see them also being affected by it but they're insensitive to the slow onset symptoms (cough, sneeze, itch). I've been bringing up these problems to them almost daily for almost a year and now they think my brother and I are hypochondriacs.


Because of the scabies I must quarantine myself from other people (friends, doctors, employers) so getting a job is next to impossible until I treat it (entire household must be treated to prevent reinfection) and this seems to be the last thing on my parents list of treating if they ever get around to it. I'm lucky to still have my part-time job, if my co-workers found out I had scabies they would not be happy.


Soo... after much frustration thinking I could fix this situation I think my best bet may be moving out and starting fresh although I don't really have a career planned and not much work experience for my age (4 years blind manufacturing, 1 year part time blind installing, 1.5 years fast food). Due to having scabies I think I may have to get an apartment before a job because it will take at least a week to kill the scabies off completely. And I'm also considering moving to a more rural area (not a big fan of suburbs), perhaps out of state. I've never lived on my own before but the thought of it sounds empowering and serene.


I'm thinking my safest bet is to room with a friend although I'd rather leave the suburbs and would prefer to live alone. I know it may be difficult but I'm an extreme minimalist.


One hypothetical scenario (I'm not sure how realistic this is) is to move to the most beautiful (heavily wooded imo) yet affordable area within a few states of here ($400-600/mo apartment) and then find a job there, perhaps a job that interests me like farming, maybe get a roommate/SO to help with bills later.

Another scenario is to find a temporary 1-2 month apartment nearby for approximately $700/mo and use that time to get clean of scabies and find a decent/interesting job somewhere.


Also considering purchasing a vehicle for 2-3k, although I'd like to try to live without one.


What do ya'll advise in this most insane of circumstances? (I don't think therapy is an option) 

Do you think I should move out? If so, how should I go about it?",15May2019,1
535," 

My dad and I were having a discussion about Boxing. I heard somewhere that most boxers are on performance enhancing drugs sometimes

but I had no proof for this but based on what I read on the internet I said to my Dad I had reason to believe that a lot

of boxers may be on performance enhancing drugs, however I said I was no expert on this (my Dad's stance was that there

are not on drugs). I said I don't agree with my Dad's stance based on some of the things on the internet, but I said the if I had

the time to research more about it I could either verify his stance better or my stance better. My Dad has this thing where

if I'm conversating with him, and I'm agreeing with him it's fine and then he just talks at me. But if I show a hint of disagreement

with him, he basically gets really upset and takes it personally and makes it as if im trying to 'get a rise out of him' - why he

does this I do not know.

Long story short, he would say his stance, I would disagree, then he would basically repeat his stance again and personally attack me.

For example, he would say that I'm just jealous of the Boxers skill or their physique or something (which is obviously not true). I'm not a boxer,

I am a student. I would basically reply back but it would be us going back and fourth like this constantly. I had time so I thought I'd play his game

and 'entertain' him for a bit. He then goes on to say his stance, and then before I could say my opinion on what was said he would walk out of the room and pretend

he has 'won' the argument (him winning the debate/discussion is him not allowing me to say my opinion/peace) rather than agreeing to disagree.

I said to him ""have you gone to applaud yourself out there"" (out there refers to he went into another room). He heard that and got angry,

and said that the debate is finished now and that everything he says is fact. Which would have been fine if he did not want to discuss anymore, but he would

say the argument is finished and then still continue talking about his opinion, and if I interjected he would say ""no the arguments finished now, leave me alone"" and then

would still continue talking. I just thought the behaviour was a bit odd.

Because we were talking about performance enhancing drugs, mainly steriods, which by knowledge allows boxers/fighters to train/fight harder for longer or just to basically

'enhance' their performance, I made a joke that maybe he should take drugs like the boxers in order to continue the debate/discussion as if to say he's lost his stamina. He said, ""what, take drugs to be like you?""

And I said ""wait are you talking about antidepressants"", and at first he tried to deny it and then full on said that he meant it. For context, I've taken antidepressants in the past and have gone through therapy

to help with my depression and am doing a lot better now. I wasn't offended by what was said, but I didn't like how he had to bring up antidepressants, but he said it's fine because ""we were talking about drugs"". I was

joking about performance enhancing drugs, because those were the drugs that we were talking about for the past 1 hour and a half,but he was saying that it's okay to joke/poke fun at/mention my antidepressants in that

way and that I'm being immature for joking about the performance enhancing drugs thing to him, as he said I was trying to attack his 'mentality' and imply that he was 'crazy and insane'. Am I being gaslighted here?

I talked to my mother about it and she said my Dad was justified and that I should apologise, so I apologised to my dad, expecting him to apologise about the antidepressant remarks, but he said he didn't have to apologise

because he was justified. Is this a double standard or am I in the wrong here?

Since I secured a year long internship, my Dad then went on to imply that I was trying to play the 'big man' and be the 'man of the house'. This again wasn't true and caught me off guard, so I started dancing around and doing the

michael jackson crotch touch 'he-he' thing to show that I wasn't trying to be a 'big man' and wasn't trying to 'undermine his masculinity'. But then he said but doing this I was being immature, and in hindseight I feel like

the dancing thing was so I aplogised for that too. When I tried to explain why I did the dancing thing to my mum and dad, they again said I was being immature, and then this time implied that I was trying to 'play the victim' because

I brought up the fact that bringing anti depressants into a debate about performance enhancing drugs in boxing was wrong.

I'm not sure if I'm being gaslighted here or anything. Am I in the wrong here? I aplogised for what I did, but it seems as if my parents never apologise for anything, and just name call me constantly ""immature"" ""trying to be the big man""

""playing the victim"". My Dad is the same dad that would say getting professional help in the form of medication means you are weak, and I should ONLY EVER be depressed if someone in my life dies, no exceptions.

I remember in the past I exclaimed that I was worried that my little brother would grow up depressed, but because I've been through depression and I'm better again, at least I can advice him as to what I did to get better.

My dad just replied ""what so he can go on drugs like you?"" in a kind of condescending tone. Is he justified in saying this? My take on it was that I wouldn't 'force' my brother to take anything, just that I would advice him as to what I did

but whatever he chooses to do to help his depression would be his choice. I just felt like my dad was being rude saying this, as if going on medication to get better is a bad thing.

My sister caught wind of what happened and eventually moved out, I have moved out also. I still maintain the position that they crossed the line, but I'm guessing my sister things they havent after having further talks

with my parents and I'm guessing she feels that their behaviour (what I've outlined in this post) is acceptable.

Am I in the wrong here? It just feels like they are saying that everything is me being immature, but they are blameless and feel not need to apologise. They then said, even after apolosing, that I have no manners and that I am immature.

I did some research, and it seems like some form of naricistic personality disorder. However I am not doctor and can't diagnose anyone.

All this drama over a discussion about boxing and I just feel I can't live there anymore.

My mother then went on to say that if I wish to live in her house that I have manners (which translate to you must agree with me all the time or I will threaten to kick you out). It just seems like a lowkey threat to me idk.

Like maybe in the heat of the moment my dad replied to my joke about drugs and brought up my antidepressants, and if he said that I would have been probably fine with it. But instead he was saying that he was 'righteous' in bringing up my antidepressants, even though the argument had nothing to do with antidepressants, at all. It just seems like he was just using ad hominen attacks throughout the argument? Or am I overthinking it here.

He then went on to say that I was depressed because of my attitude in life; (Because I don't believe in christianity and the idea of life after death and wrestled with existential thought for a while, - however through therapy and self-help I was able to overcome those thoughts). It just seems like he was using black and white thinking. He would then go on to call me a mommys boy for some reason (even though my mum was the person who was disagreeing with my point of view). It was really wierd.

I later reconnected with my parents to try and have an adult conversation about it and my concerns (as I admitted the dancing thing was immature and apolgoised for that). And when I tried to conversate with my parents, again came the name calling etc, and the random laughing at me when I was trying to get a point across. They said that I was immature in the past and deserved more lick (hitting with a slipper) and more discipline. I asked them to explain what else about me was immature in the past, and they said that it was 'self explanatory' and they shouldn't have to explain it to me? They then said I was spoiled in the past, even though I moved out to gain some more independence (which they disagreed with the fact that I should move out for uni/college and I should stay home with them so they can cook and clean for me - and apparently that is why I'm depressed because I moved out (just seems like a half-truth here)). Before leaving, I asked them if how I conducted myself during the duration of the conversation if it was mature of me or not, and for the first time they argreed I was being mature. Then a week later, my sister told me that my parents said I was again being immature and 'acting out of character' in the family talk. So it went from me trying to explain myself in the family talk, to them basically name calling me again and bring up the past and they thought they I was offended/triggered or something. It just seemed like a bunch of ad homiuems to avoid discussing what went on, and they would always try to interject me. Also, when they asked me a question, I said I needed 2 minutes to think about the answer (As truthly I didn't want them to twist the answer or misconstrew it in anyway), but they said I needed time to think about it as I was 'plannig to lie to them and avoid asking the question directly"". Wtf?

tl;dr: Am I being immature and unreasonable here? Do I lack basic manners based on the fact that in an argument/discussion I feel they should not resort to bringing up my anti depressants? This isn't the first time they have done this (in a discussion with my dad pertaining to my little brother). Am I in the wrong here?",15May2019,6
536,"So my friend is a psychiatrist, she works with troubled teens. She was working with younger kids before but she recently got a new job. And at her new job there's a teen who's taken a huge interest in her. She wasn't even done with her training and he has already sexually assaulted her(grabbing her breast and rubbed his dick on her). This was during the day. Her shift after training is supposed to be at night for 12 hours. At night there'd only be two workers and the 8 teens who live there. This wouldn't be a huge issue, but there's no security at this facility. 
So there's no one there to help if anything happens. 

She's been through this before, she's been raped. She's filed a report about him harassing her, but not of the assault. I've told her that she needs to say something to someone. Being a prior victim it's hard for to talk about it and she just wants to forget anything happened. This was last week. Today he grabbed her by the hair and threatened to rape her. I've been trying to get through to her and convince her to speak up to someone at work who can help her so she doesn't have to work with this awful person. I told her she still has power in this situation to stop anything from happening. 
By A.) Reporting it to her boss who whoever is in charge of getting reports to change her work schedule or change the facility she works at
B.) Leaving that job if they don't take serious measures to help

I have really, really horrible spring allergies. Having recently moved states for college, they’re worse this year than they’ve ever been. I’ve tried three different antihistamines, as well as Flonase, but my runny/stuffy nose just won’t go away. 
It’s bad enough having a waterfall out of my nose and not being able to breathe, but now my roommates are getting all pissy about it. Normally, they’re awesome, two of my best friends actually, but now it’s pretty awful. 
Last night, my roommate got up in the middle of the night and moved to the couch, slamming the door behind her to make it clear that it was my fault. And today, both of them are completely ignoring me. They won’t even look me in the eye. 
I’m already miserable because of my allergies, and I really don’t need them acting this way towards be because of it. There’s literally nothing I can do about this, I’ve tried everything and nothing has worked. I don’t know what more they want me to do. They’re punishing me for something that I have no control over.

Look, I get it. I own a dog. I love her very much. Buuuut this is a whole new level. He has a shrine for her. He has her as his wallpaper on his phone, debit card, and computer. 

He said he wanted to go to a restaurant named after her so we could celebrate her in “honor” and even spoke with the waitress about how he had no idea she was sick and how she was “pooping and eating” just fine. I could tell the waitress was very uncomfortable. 

Last part, he wants to go to a grieving class for her. Keep in mind that this isn’t for animals. No no no.. it’s for people. In my opinion, I see that as offensive.. 

So my question is..

Should I tell him that he needs to get therapy for it? I just think it’s overboard.. I don’t want to be insensitive. I really want to help him as much as I can.",15May2019,0
548,"I got pulled over in Nicholasville Ky for expired tags. I looked for my insurance card and the cop said keep looking i'll be back. When he got back I showed it to him and he said I took to long to find it and presented me with a ticket for no reg no insurance. 

Oddly enough I noticed my insurance was due to expire the next day on the photocopy I had. Turns out the insurance lapsed unbeknownst to me a couple of months earlier. I must have not gotten the mail or it was sent to wrong address.

The very next day I got my registration and new insurance. I called the county clerk and they said If I showed them proof of insurance at time of ticket the charges would be dismissed.

I have the proof of insurance photocopy. It says it expires 1 day after the traffic ticket. That's not true I found out it lapsed. Still my card says my insurance was valid.

If I present this photocopy to the clerk and they don't verify it or call the insurance. I just saved myself $750-1000 in penalties and court costs.

If I present it and they make attempts to verify with the insurance company and found out it expired. I could play dumb but if they don't buy it. I then could face a felony and jail time including perjury.

I have no idea if nicholasville clerk verifies this. For all I know they could take the paper, file it, and dismiss the charges.

I am poor but a nice attorney said he would take my case for $100. 

Would you hire the attorney and show up in court showing you purchased insurance the day after and show contrition.

Or

Would you show the clerk your invalid insurance card photocopy hoping she doesn't make verification attempts?",15May2019,1
549,"Hey y’all!

I had a baby last July and we moved back in with my parents in hopes to buy a house (I also had PPD which brought us back as well). We quickly realized that we weren’t in love with the area (previously CO but moved back to WA). My family lives here and it’s okay but the rain and fast growth of the region along with the price of real estate make it someplace where we can’t see ourselves long term. 
I also don’t have help. My mom vowed to take care of baby while I worked (hairstylist) but things amped up in her career so my husband is our only source of income. Daycare is pretty pricey (been quoted $1100-1700/month), so I’d essentially be working to pay for that.

We are planning on building a sizable - close to 700sqft  - “tiny home” (something we’ve been planning for the better half of a year) . Our plan was to move it back to Colorado to be close to my sister and law and their new baby. We’d buy a parcel of land and eventually build a home.

This brings me to a final option. Buying land in GA and relocating there. Husband is originally from there and I lived there for a few years as a teen. My in laws are there and would love nothing more than to care for the baby while I work (their words). 
I could grow my career and be a dual-income family. 

My only hesitation is that I’m scared I’ll always be missing Colorado. It’s where I met my husband, had our baby, etc. 
We were avid skiers and hikers and loved being outdoors and in the sunshine. 
My in-laws have also pushed that we relocate back there (so both their kids and grandkids can be in the same state) and have even talked about relocating there but most likely won’t due to the snow, cold, and high elevation.
Husband can transfer there through work easily and we can buy parcel of land.

GA sounds so appealing because it’s inexpensive and we’ll have free (reliable and safe) childcare. I can begin to work again. The only downfall is my in-laws can be a little overbearing, but aren’t they all? ;-)

However, I'm starting to think that deciding to help my friend out and teach these classes was not the greatest choice. The trainings even before camp that start this month are 2 to 3 hours long and some are 3 times a week. I am already a certified music teacher in my state, and I still have to do other clearances, certification and background checks. The Y I will be teaching at is close to 25 miles away. They won't accept any of my previous clearances through my district, and are making me repeat various other ones. I have to do all of the trainings even though I will be teaching students in a music room one day a week, so it seems silly that I have to do water training, etc. 

Lastly, I'll only be making 11.50 an hour. I know that seems like a lot for some people, but I'll be driving 23 miles one way, and for trainings, sometimes 3 times a week.

559,"So it's not technically MY grandma, it's my husbands.  His grandmother had to move in with us a few years ago because she lost her own home because she couldn't pay the mortgage...things have been building up for a few years now &amp; i don't have anyone to openly express my frustration to so i guess this is the right place. 

His grandmother has some expectations about how ""a house should look"" ... If i don't clean the house in the morning before she wakes up (I'm talking sweeping, mopping, dishes, cleaning the bathroom, etc all before 9am!) As soon she wakes up she starts to huff &amp; puff &amp; say things like ""are you on strike?"" In a sarcastic tone &amp; she expects me to make her coffee every morning as well.. And lord help me if i don't. 


When she wakes up she expects me to sit at the kitchen table with her A L L D A Y. Im literally talking from 9am to 4pm &amp; sometimes even after that.. Until she's ready to go in her room to watch her shows. 

I like to leave in the mornings to get my errands done &amp; usually its 1 day a week that i go do shit early.. Like before she wakes up at 9am.  I always have the house clean before she wakes up &amp; her coffee made just so i don't get yelled at when i get home... Well if she wakes up &amp; I'm still gone she will call me &amp; yell &amp; ask where i went &amp; that shes mad because i didn't tell her i was leaving. She will also call all of my husband's family &amp; tell them i just leave her here all day to fend for herself &amp; that I'm being sneaky by leaving ""all the time"" 


She will tell me I'm not allowed to go places without her, that i need to sit my ass at home &amp; worry about my house &amp; family instead of ""running around town""  &amp; has taken away my car keys&amp; hid them. She doesn't admit to this but i always find the keys in her room when she decides she wants to go somewhere she will help me look &amp; they are always in her pocession or in her room. (Essentially grounding me from the car even tho its mine) 


I have a son who is almost 9 &amp; she constantly is telling him the opposite of what i tell him to do.. This goes from eating all the way to picking out school clothes.  So my child is always confused on what to do or who to listen to. 

She gets disability &amp; something like a widows support? (Roughly 1400 a month USD) she pays no bills here (we don't ask her) 


She has dementia &amp; COPD &amp; a few other health issues so it's not best that she lives alone but no other family member will step up &amp; invite her in. (Not even her daughter or sisters)  because of how she is towards people.  &amp; she 100% does not want to live in an assisted living facility &amp; we don't have any power or right ""to put her in one"" 


I've become so used to doing things this way that I'm not sure where to even begin to fix things... Me &amp; husband have talked to her about working on these things and she just gets defensive &amp; starts screaming and crying that we don't want her here &amp; say that she's a burden that noone wants &amp; when we assure her that she's welcomed here we just have to find a better way to do things she starts picking on us.. Calling us heavy &amp; telling me ""no wonder your mother didn't want your ass because of that attitude"" and the list goes on &amp; on. 

Part of me wants to believe she acts this way from her dementia but the other part thinks shes just a mean old lady. 




Any advice is welcome but please don't say to kick her out.  That's not an option because of the reasons I've stated above &amp; we're not ones to ""throw out"" family members. 


BTW we're both 27 &amp; shes 71. My husband has a really good job &amp; he's able to support us without asking her fot a dime.",15May2019,1

561,"Hi, hope everyone's having a great day! I recently ended my engagement to the love of my life (or so I thought) and moved back to America after 5 years in Germany. I've been staying with my mom on Long Island for the past couple of weeks, but I'm too old to stay at home and am ready to start a new life somewhere on my own. I've always wanted to live somewhere warm, so I've been considering Asheville, Charleston, Florida, Texas, or Arizona. Of course, my family wants me to stay near them in New York, but I just don't see value in the high rent and taxes. I pay self-employment taxes, so New York is one of the worst options for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for hobbies, I'm into some ""artsy"" stuff like playing the violin, going to open mike once in a while, writing poetry, etc. but I'm most certainly not a hipster. I enjoy warm weather so that I can run, bike, and hike in the fresh air. I'm also really into Pilates, yoga, and kickboxing. My friends tell me that I should live somewhere where I know people, since I have my Blah moments I suppose, yet most of my friends are in Boston or New York. I'm not really sure what to do or where to live. An option is living 1-2 months in different cities and then choosing....

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions? I'm just in this weird transitional phase that I hadn't really expected at 30. A part of me wants to do something wild like go teach in Japan or Dubai; however, a bigger part of me wants to live somewhere where I could actually meet my future husband and start a family. Any advice would be much appreciated. I'm very disappointed in the whole situation that I find myself in. Oftentimes I see it as a blessing--I have so many options now, so many choices since nothing is tying me down to one place (e.g. job, significant other). However, most of the time I see the situation as a burden. I know I will be able to start a new life, but the thought of getting to know someone again and moving my life across the Atlantic exhausts me....Anyway, thanks in advance!

I’m a 19 year old girl, I’m currently attending college but only have gone through some preliminary courses.
The required maths and English’s and whatnot. 

My original dream was a art teacher, because I love art, but that job is a rarity to find, some schools don’t even have art classes any longer. 

I have been debating about what I’d like to persue as a career and I really like the idea of teaching. I was hesitant before because I didn’t like the idea of teaching young elementary children, which I thought was required. But now I’m not sure.

565,"I recently moved back from university to come back to the hometown that has nothing left for me but my family. All my friends have left so I'm very alone with no one to hang out with and I've been working overtime shifts at a shitty warehouse so far this summer to make money for school. I've been very depressed and in addition, in a long distance relationship.

My partner works for the government parks and her boss was able to give me a job offer to live in staff housing and work there for two months with the high possibility of being re-hired each year for each summer of University. This is excellent as I initially planned next summer to stay in the city and work but instead can get free staff housing and not move back home; so I get to save on rent and save time applying to summer jobs during school. The only downside is that the warehouse pays $18/hr while the government job pays $14/hr. My parents expect me to cover my tuition costs (Approximately $7000) and I am able to cover it as according to my budget calculation I'll be making around the high $8000's including tax deductions and excluding overtime and already have some funds set aside to cover the majority of my groceries for two months ($400). To make things better, my partner will be working in a different department meaning that at the end of our workdays we can be together, and my long-term independence and the fact I'm away from my disliked hometown will really help my mental health.

The counter-argument from my parents is simply me being mentally weak because I'm reliant on her, me not liking the outdoors, expense for groceries and leaving a job midway through the summer as I'd be quitting the warehouse after two months. To be honest with you I'd rather be outside than have my eyes hurt from the sunlight after being trapped in a warehouse for 9 hours a day with people double my age and alter personalities of myself. Going through with this job will make my two months even worse as my parents will be upset and be angry at me for a whole two months living in a hostile and tense environment. I'm very scared but I really feel I need to make a break for my independence. I even had to ask my parents for my social insurance number because they keep it in a safe place cause they don't trust me. I really feel this is an excellent opportunity in the long-term and that if I am brave enough I can secure my independence for the rest of my undergrad. However, I'm very horrified as I never do anything my parents disagree with and the backlash I am going to receive.

What should I do?",15May2019,1
566,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year now, so we decided it was about time that our parents met. There is, however, a reason we postponed it for this long.

My dad.

My father isn't a horrible man. He can be a bad man, but not horrible. He sucks at parenting, has hit me twice in my 21 years on this planet, and can be a massive prick, but he is not all bad.

My parents have been divorced for little over a year now, but I feel it is somewhat unfair to let my mum meet my gfs parents and not my dad. All things aside, I still consider him my father and I still care for him.

My dad considers himself extremely intelligent, and my gf's parents are simple people. He will acknowledge this immediately and attempt to intimidate them with his theories and ideologies. At least, that is what I'm afraid of. My dad is not one to let things slide and he certainly isn't afraid of speaking his mind. If he disagrees with something, he will say it, no matter how inappropriate it may sound. What's worse, if an argument may get too heated, he will not hold back and may very well insult them.

It's hard to describe, but I fear that my dad will just bash at these people who he will undoubtedly view as 'commonfolk'. He did the same to a niece of mine years ago, and she has refused to contact our side of the family ever since. My father has the power to intimidate, humiliate and overall make people feel very, very uncomfortable. 

In short, I fear that my dad is simply like a ticking time bomb. And I do not know how to approach this. If I don't talk to him about it, I fear he will not be considerate and behave like a 'normal' man. But if I do talk to him about it, I'm afraid that he will prepare for the situation and bash them on purpose. 

My father is the kind of man who will simply tell them ""my son told you that I should behave normally around you people, so I'll try my best"". And that is enough to set one awkward as fuck mood.",15May2019,1
568,"Hey there.  I've been doing therapy and psychiatry for a while.  I've made significant progress.  I'm in a healthy relationship with a guy that loves me.  

Through therapy we have dug up some core issues causing problematic behavior today.  They all are sort of linked together.  

I think my current brain wiring stems from having dealth with social rejection for most of my life.  I was abused as a kid, and I never got into any in groups because of my distinct personality and intellect.  This mostly continued into college (I tried some orgs here and there, nothing special.)  

I've had attachment issues and separation anxiety for years.  I've been abandoned and backstabbed by friends and lovers.  I always want to have someone around me to do things for and get support from.  

So currently I'm dealing with ostracization from a subculture that shall not be named.  I can be very blunt and honest, and what appears to have happened is that I've called several people out for inappropriate behavior or not performing their roles as chat moderators.  A lot of people are holding unjustified grudges.  

My boyfriend has told me that I have an unhealthy obsession with this subculture group in my city.  I think my therapist agrees.  I'm struggling to get over it.  My thinking is that if I'm going to be ""kicked out,"" I'm going to do it on my terms and get what I want.  

I've then began performing retaliations against said group (ban-evading, countering there spread of lies with crafted misinformation, crashing events, etc. ...) despite the fact that I don't even want to expend the energy on these cultists that are below me.

569,"So, I'm a 27 year old female, and live at home with my mom right now due to a slight financial crisis last year. I'm currently in school for medical coding and billing and work a full time medical billing job. Your standard 9-5 deal. My coding program is through the local community college, but I want to actually be in class more. Online classes are cool, but I did biology as a night class last semester and did much better than with my online classes. My job now has no flexibility. 

I have an interview on Friday for a job as a secretary at a hospital in the ER. It's an overnight job with 12 hour shifts and there's a pay cut. I would get to have some weekdays off again, and well, I would be able to take classes during the day. I don't think I can find a flexible medical billing job. And I need to keep a full time job schedule. I want to try and stay within the medical field at least.

Speaking of class, I know the medical coding exam is hard, a lot of coworkers I have now, have tried, and I was looking in the medical field to have something to fall back on, for whether I need to taking the coding class again, or just need something different, and I want to do EMT. My community college offers it, the program is 2 semesters and I would finish it before the coding if I do it at the same time. I'm just not sure if I should add it on to my schedule or wait until I finish or what?

I'm just not sure if leaving my job is good, and adding on more schoolwork is okay being that I need to work full time. I just don't know if I'm doing anything right anymore.

I have tried every avenue that I can think of, drawing on half-remembered talks and fragments of chat logs to uncover clues about where to make inquiries.  My attempts thus far have been as unobtrusive as possible, asking certain business owners to forward my details if they know of whom I seek, but time and again I run into people who wish to ""read between the lines"" and try to stonewall me.

I've considered hiring a private investigator to deliver my details without letting me know where she is, but their prices are steep and I've seen little to indicate that so-called professionals would have success beyond what I, a layman, have already been able to glean from various free Internet search tools.

There are myriad details to go on: the first name she insisted was pronounced just-so, the school she once attended, her job across the street from a particular landmark, her encounters with celebrities, the landscape surrounding her apartment, her musical tastes and the upcoming concert she's likely got tickets for, etc.  However, I am hesitant to post her details publicly, as some of the profile images she used are part of an adult collection, and might cause embarrassment if connected to her identity.

Perhaps someone here can examine, privately, the information I have, then help me sort out what's useful?

578,"Right so this is really long. 

I have had this teacher for about 5 years now. He has been very nice to me for the first 3/4 years.

For the first 3/4 years, he was really kind. He has been quite inappropriate though, some very unprofessional things he has told me in his time at school which did mess with my brain a lot. 

He has once told me that I have lovely hair, that I am his favourite pupil and compared me to his wife, and told me he thinks I’m a nice girl and likes me as an individual. I also once was walking around with charcoal on my face (because of art), and he proceeded to refer to me as ‘my little chimney sweep’; and also got me a CARD for my birthday with a chimney sweep on the front of it. Very very wierd things. He was called up on it by a pupil of how wierd he is with me and he’s stopped now, which is a bit of a relief.

This year, I have had a hard year. He helped me a lot with my depression and I would speak to him when I’m sad etc. There’s no doubt about it that he helped me which was nice. But then this happened.

For some reason, he started being really horrible to me. I don’t know why, and I’m absolutely tired of it. He told me to ‘internalise my negativity’ in front of the whole class; knowing full well my mental state which was extremely personal and uncalled for on his behalf. I reported him for that, he gave me a half hearted apology, and proceeded to try to twist it and make it my fault. 

Now, every single lesson he has a go at me. He shouted at me for shutting a door, clicking my pen, some other stupid things. He also decided to have a go at me, because at the end of a lesson he told me that he marked my essay and then walked out. The next lesson I asked to go through it with him and he started shouting at me saying ‘you walked out the lesson when I told you that I wanted to go through it with you’ which was so unnecessary because he didn’t say a thing to me about me waiting back and going over the essay with him. 

He has also been marking all my essays so harshly. I normally get A*s in this subject, all I’m getting are Cs and Ds from him, which I don’t mind, but I need constructive feedback. My exams are coming up and he’s giving me awful feedback, merely just saying my essays are unclear; and when I ask him how do I change it, he doesn’t tell me any of the sort other than the fact that I  ‘need to change it’. 

I also told him that I am just really struggling with this side of the subject, and I am doing fine in the others, and it’s really concerning me. His reply was that he heard from another teacher that teaches me that one of my last essays ‘weren’t very good’, when in reality that ‘not so good’ essay marked my the other teacher (not him) was an A*. And if he was referring to my other essays that were marked Lower from other teachers, the lowest I got from them have been an A.

I also handed one of my C grade essays to an examiner, and he gave me a high A*. My exams are coming up and I don’t want to keep handing in essays with no relevant feedback, and just feel degraded and so negative about it. I need to have constructive criticism; I’m not saying all my essays are perfect, but there’s one thing getting Cs and Ds when in reality when marked by an examiner they are far from that. I also can’t be always paying for an essay to be marked every time, my parents already pay enough for my school and I just don’t see the point in that. 

I want to report him, because I am sick and tired of him degrading me. But I know if I do so I might get him getting angry at me and gossiping about me and I don’t want to. I just want him to realise that he can’t always have a go at me and make me feel so negative and unmotivated. It’s making me lose the will to live. And no I can’t ask another teacher to mark essays on his side, because it will get back to him, and they also do not want to be a part of the wrath of him. 

Anyone got any advice? I’m kind of desperate at this point on what to do.",15May2019,1

I made a few pictures of my work to track the process then left my phone on the table and went to another room to talk to my teacher. When I get back in the previous room after 10 min I walk in on my neighbour holding my phone and hes saying he tried to call me (wtf, you're holding my phone though lol) and then he proceeds to take a picture of me, I'm kind of confused i thought it was his phone then i realise its mine hes holding. I don't think much of it and  don't say anything. Then he leaves it on the table and returns to his work. I quickly pack my things because I have a babysitting that night so I tell him he can use my table now I am leaving anyway. He asks me if I will babysit a man his age, I'm confused and I say no, it's a child. Then he says 'you can come and babysit me tomorrow evening, we can have dinner together too' I don't say anything again but this is weird. He quickly  excuses  himself saying he's talking nonsense today because he just came back from visiting a friend in the hospital who's dying of cancer and it's messing up his mind. I leave and take the bus down the street. When I go through my phone I see that indeed he took a picture of me. So I know he had access to my pictures..my phone was indeed unlocked. In my pictures I have screenshots of porn and now I'm super embarrassed thinking he has seen these, maybe this is why our conversation was weird no? What should I do? Should I call him out on it or not? I'm embarrassed and also pissed he went through my phone like this. 

Tldr; i think my art neighbor saw explicit pictures of porn  on my phone, now I'm embarrassed and don't know if I should talk to him about it or just let it go.",15May2019,3
581,"Hi! Posting this on behalf of my boyfriend. I am 19 and my boyfriend is 18, and he is graduating in a few weeks. His parents scheduled their two-week family vacation during the time my family will be going on vacation. 

A little backstory: 
•His grandfather passed away a few weeks ago and his funeral is this weekend. My boyfriend's senior class trip is the day before, so he is having to miss that to go to the funeral. 
•Most of his friends are going on trips together after graduation to celebrate. His family vacation is scheduled during this time, so he won't be able to go. 

My boyfriend is basically upset that he is having to miss a lot of memorable last moments with friends and classmates to go on his family vacation. His parents (mainly his mom) said that the vacation was his graduation present/trip, but he did not have any say on when or where the trip was going to take place. He also doesn't think it's for him because it's his parents favorite vacation spot and he is bored and tired of going there every year. 

This is where it gets a little complicated: I was going to go on their trip with them for the first week (his parents invited me and welcomed me to come), and then fly to the beach with my boyfriend to be with my family for our vacation. My mom has messaged his mom multiple times the past few months asking if it was okay if he could go with us. We even moved our vacation back a week so he could be there with his older brother at the same time. 

My mom texted her again a few days ago asking once again if he could go. She responded back asking where we were going and when (even though both my mom and my boyfriend have told her multiple times about it). When my mom told her, she said no, that it had been a stressful time in the family and they wanted a family vacation. Now I am unable to go with them because I am afraid of traveling by myself and would have many layovers. 

This is upsetting and confusing to my boyfriend because 
1) I was going to go with them, and his older brother and sister were welcome and planning on bringing friends. 
2) His brother (2 years older) and sister (5 years older) are not required to stay the entire trip and are told to ""come and leave when they want to"". 
3) His brother was allowed to go on a senior trip with friends after graduation. 

Basically, he is just upset and doesn't know how to convince or talk to his parents about the situation or try to get them to see his point of view. I thought this would be the best place to go to try to find him some answers.",15May2019,3
582,"I am a rather socially awkward guy, and I tend not to have friends outside of my friend group. A while ago I managed to befriend a young woman (We will call Cass) and e became close. About a month ago I introduced her to some of my friends, and her and one ( we will call adam) of them really hit it off. Now they both have feelings for each other, and I was really uncomfortable with it, despite telling Adam that I was okay with it. After struggling with these feelings for a little while I realized that I have feelings for Cass. I don't have feelings for people often.

Out of college I pursed a career that I thought I would love. I ended up putting in long hours, added a lot of stress to my life, and got very little back.

\- I had my car stolen (out of a nice neighborhood)

\- I found out my other grandma was diagnosed with schizophrenia

\- My research project has been a flop due to a bad advisor (which the university wont allow me to change)

\- My great grandma has become very sick

588,"Summary at bottom

Well, this is gonna be tough.... my littler brother was adopted. He is 15 and I am currently 18. Our mother is 65 and quadriplegic. My father is 70 and obese. So it’s hard for them to parent in general. My brother has developmental issues, he struggles academically across the board because of these issues. As he is becoming a teenager, we are noticing social and behavioral issues. He assimilates to whoever he is with, and he tends to be with bad kids. Druggies and gang members. He has gotten arrested multiple times and suspended multiple times. He does not listen to my parents whether they lay down the law or not. (My mom took his phone, he took hers until he got it back. I view this as him taking advantage of my mother’s disabilities.) I have gotten into verbal and physical altercations with him. He seems to show no compassion or empathy towards us. He puts his “friends” first. However I believe he get manipulated by his friends to do stuff. He does not help around the house at all, doesn’t clean his own dishes or anything. He also steals from us. He has stolen money from all of us in the family. It’s disgusting and hurtful that my little brother acts this way. I thought I was a good role model. But now we are out of options, we have tried everything. He is also failing high school because he “is bored by the material” but he could “get better grades if he tried”. Those are direct quotes from him. He doesn’t do his homework either.  We have gotten help from multiple professionals assigned by the school district but they do nothing. We don’t care if he hates, we just care he does something with his life. I couldn’t live with myself knowing we didn’t try everything. We do you think we should do?

Sum it up: Brother is failing high school and throwing his life away regardless of help, he is disobedient, violent, emotional, without compassion, and cannot comprehend what it means to be a proper member in society.",15May2019,2

591,"Okay so let me lay it down. 

Im 19M.    

About two and a half months ago, i was jobless. My last job (land surveyor)  fired me because they were bringing in a more experienced land surveyor that had a degree in the field, which i didnt. After that i basically took a break. The first week after being fired I still would occasionally look for jobs but not as hard as i would the following weeks. I applied for at least 60+ places, and got one interview. After the interview i knew i wouldn’t be pursuing that job further, and dropped it. 

One night my girlfriend and i were over at a mutual friends house, hanging out, doing things that 18 year olds do. Anyways, the mutual friends dad comes out and ask if I’m looking for work, i told him i was and he said he would be in contact with his boss about getting me into a spot at his job, but he wasn’t sure about the details. Eventually, after about 2 weeks, i get into the place for an interview. Its a body auto body shop. The GM told me that he wasnt going to make me a lube tech, because it would setme up for failure. He said he would call me if he had any job openings, but none were available at the time, but he still had me send him my license and information and etc. 

Now after about 3 weeks go by hearing nothing, GM text me saying “everything checked out” and to stop in to see him that day. So i went into see him, and he tells me he can hire me to be a Car Detailer. I agree, and he has me start working RIGHT AFTER THE CONVERSATION. It turns out the detailer before me quit, and went to his old job. 

Fast forward to the present.

Im tired of working here. They rushed my training and put it into 2 days instead of the normal 2 weeks. I feel like im the scapegoat, and that everyone looks at me like im a kid. Im being told to constantly preform better even tho im visibly busting my ass off,  but the other detailer is left alone to do his business. I sense a lot of favoritism, and i really truly feel like this isn’t a fit for me. I dont want to work here and try and make it into a career, which is what i think some people think i am planning.

I have an interview for this Saturday for another job opportunity, and am going to check that out, to see if it sounds like a better fit. 

The advice i need, is if i get hired for this job, and i accept the job, what do i tell my current job and the person who hooked me up with it? I dont want to piss them off, but i dont know how long i can stay at this job.

When I was 17 (2010) I overstayed my visa in Canada in order to stay with my aunt and help her with some family issues and health problems. 

Fast forward 2019, the situation progressively escalated. My aunt doesn't work and due to my situation it's not easy for me to work. Because we stay 24/7 with each other, our relationship has deteriorated. I do not want to get into the details because I do not want her bad treatments towards me to be the focus of my questions. 

Basically, my living situation has become unbearable. She has become what people would say abusive. She bases her behavior upon the fact that I don't have the right to stay in the country anyway so she treats me very badly.

I am seriously considering moving out. Is it wise to find a job in my situation, putting myself at high risk with landlords, with hiding when having a job, etc?

As abusive as my living situations is, can I trust the ""jungle"" out there? My aunt still is my family. Should I ""trade"" her with the stranger outside?

I wanna start out by saying I’m 26 so the problems I’m about to discuss are gonna sound incredibly childish in context. I’m getting married, I work over full time as a social worker, I have a crazy full life...so I don’t know why this stuff still bothers me. 

Friendships have always been a source of trouble for me. It’s not that I don’t have friends, I always have, but I get very invested in them and the people I gravitate towards (the people that gravitate towards me?) were never the healthiest of people. Maybe none of us is. 

I have a few friends I’ve had since freshman year of college that just constantly cause me stress. Things like hating my now fiancé when I initially met him, not supporting the relationship when they were single, to the point where I felt I had to hide and lie about it (which obviously is on me, I shouldn’t have). They’ve done super crazy things, none of which is the point of this post so I won’t dwell but I’ve been told time and again that any sane person would have left the friendships a long time ago. 

And yet they’re my bridesmaids! They no longer openly dislike my fiancé, one in particularly (who kind of abused him the most) is pretty good friends with him. But I can’t stop being mad about stuff they’ve done, not only in the relationship but beyond, things they’ve said about me or how they make me feel, etc. 

Now that we’re adults I get like hella anxiety any time I have plans with them which I do pretty regularly even though we live at closest 40 minutes a way and it requires driving to a major city and all that entails. And despite being anxious about it, I make these plans and follow through without fail! I still get mad about all that they’ve done and said and I go out of my way to accommodate them, while super anxious about it all. 

Why do I do this? How can I stop? Therapy isn’t an option unfortunately due to shitty health insurance and crippling student loan debt. I see so many things that are like let go of things that no longer serve you and I don’t know why that’s such an abstract thought to me, it feels impossible.

608," So I just received the email from my school telling me I have been dismissed from the university. To be honest, I kind of saw it coming but at the same time it is a total surprise. Let me start by giving you a background of my academics at the university. I just completed my fourth semester and ever since semester 1 it has been a downhill slope. First semester I had a GPA of 2.9, not the worst, but definitely not good in my parents eyes. The following semester I had to withdraw from a class and I got a D. The next semester I failed my first class and also got a D. This past semester, I failed 3 classes, got a D and the university has dismissed me. After my 3rd semester my parents basically told me that I had to get all As or they would pull me out of school (haha now they dont have to fml). I told them I would do this, but clearly I convinced myself that I could when I did not. My parents believe that I am fully capable of getting at least a 3.5 GPA every semester, and I somewhat agree with them. My biggest issue is that I do not put time into my school work. I would show up to some of my classes, and barely do homework or turn in all the assignments, and when I did turn them in it was rarely on time. Instead of putting time into school, I was always smoking weed and getting drunk with my friends. I know this is the main reason for my lack of success. I have no idea what to tell my parents though. I can credit all my lack of success to my poor attitude towards school and lack of motivation to do anything. This also brings me to the thought that I may be depressed, and that this could have played a role in me not putting time into my academics. What do I tell my parents? I know I have to come clean and tell them that I failed out of school, but how? I am in a desperate situation and really dug myself into the biggest hole of my life. I also cannot even think about the future. I cannot live with my family, I love them but I just can't live with them any longer.

612,"  

Yeah, I get that I sound like an addict  asking questions to somehow game the system in some circuitous scheme. Frankly, I cannot stop nor blame anyone from being cynical of my claim, and in a way I invite you to do so, but I would like anyone who reads this to look at the details below before making your final judgment.

1. I started going to a new doctor and after explaining my patient history, I was asked from the get-go to provide a urine sample that I initially thought was for blood sugar levels, sodium, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. The test was in fact for a “presumptive drug screening”, as it was labeled in the bill I got later. The staff accidentally attached the results of the screening to my file, which checked for standard illicit substances, and that led me to find out I had tested positive for “opiates”. I do not have a criminal record nor have I been compelled legally by anyone to perform a mandatory test for drugs. But things get dicey from here on.

&amp;#x200B;

3. I have been legally prescribed Seroquel over the years at its lowest dose possible. Asides that and caffeine pills, I do not take anything else. I am also aware this medication has been known to yield false positives for opioids, which implies a more specific test would have to be done in order to determine the specific substance in my bloodstream. This was confirmed when I spoke with my pharmacist, who told me that a  gas chromatography test could be done to determine that I was in fact taking Seroquel and not something else.

&amp;#x200B;

4. I initially dismissed that first test as some weird fluke, but I was asked to do another “presumptive drug screening” six months later. The results were not made available and I asked the staff via email as why this test was being done. Their emailed response said all patients sign a documents allowing for a random drug test in controlled substances  (more on that later). They also mentioned they perform the test to check for cross-interactions with other drugs and all this stuff is standard protocol. I did not fully understand the logic behind that because a drug test only screens for a general class of drugs, false positives do occur, and a follow-up for a more specific drug test was never done. The issue of cross-interaction also appears moot because  my file only reflects that I only take Seroquel and caffeine. What other cross-interaction do would they expect unless they suspected something else?

&amp;#x200B;

5. I started getting suspicious because I had never been to doctor who would just ask for a routine drug test without telling the patient nor explaining the specific circumstances that led to this decision in person.

&amp;#x200B;

6. I had some questions regarding the wording around controlled substances because I did a quick check online with the  DEA drug schedule and my state’s list of controlled substances.  Seroquel (aka Quetiapine, Temprolide) is nowhere in the list. I called 3 different pharmacies, asked to speak with the pharmacists themselves, and all of them told me that Seroquel is not considered a controlled substance. The third pharmacist probably made more convincing argument for the doctor’s office when she indicated that technically all medication given by a pharmacy is considered a controlled substance, but Seroquel is a schedule V drug that is not actively regulated (V the lowest rating; schedule I-IV are considered controlled substances under regulation). So, if Seroquel is not considered a controlled substance, wouldn’t that make a violation of the doctor’s office protocol?

&amp;#x200B;

7. All these events brought memories from the visits in which the drugs tests were done. The PA and the doctor asked me to lift my sleeves and take off my shoes, which now make me think they were looking for possible injection sites. 

&amp;#x200B;

8. I cannot blame a medical professional for doing their job if they suspect drug-seeking behavior, but if that was case, how come they never followed through with additional tests to confirm? If the suspected abuse of medication, why was I not confronted by the doctor after the second drug test, how come a note was not made in my files (I have copies of all my visits), how come referrals for treatment were never made? Why would they keep prescribing refills for Seroquel? I have been attending this facility for nearly a year this upcoming month, and I am upset at the lack of clarity on behalf of my medical professional to tackle this problem. What can I do to resolve this issue as diplomatically as possible?",15May2019,1

Two nights ago was the same situation. This guy was worse and I don’t know how to take jokes like that (aspergers). I didn’t know how else to tell him to back down. I don’t know what I said exactly but it was something like,

619,"On the one hand, I have a job that I love in a field that I also love, but that has pretty low stability. As in it’s not uncommon for massive layoffs to happen and it can be difficult to find work for a while after.

On the other hand I have been given an opportunity to go back to school and get my masters degree in a really solid field, completely taken care of as long as I maintain a good GPA, and a guaranteed two years of service at a high tech government position, that I may or may not enjoy, but will almost certainly be rock solid employment.

The short term risk is that I don’t really enjoy the Masters program, do poorly, and get saddled with the tuition debt, and give up my current good, but unstable job. That’s a worst case scenario

The middle ground is I finish the Masters program, do my years of service, and try to get back into my current field four years down the line. Those four years that could have been me getting experience in the field that currently I am super interested in.

The long term risk is that I don’t take the “sensible” option that guarantees stable employment that I might not enjoy, and instead stay with my kind of dream job, and end up unemployed with now way fewer options.

I realize it’s rich, being so caught up in two seemingly really beneficial options, but choosing one kind of means throwing away an opportunity, and I have a hard time throwing away old notes.

620,"     I started college kind of late in the game at 26. When I began I had a very particular goal which was graduate from a Nurse Practitioner program and live comfortably for the rest of my life. The first year I was so focused and so ready for college and I did well maintaining a 4.0 gpa and loved everything I was learning in my bio classes. That steam lasted around 3 semesters and then I started floundering. There was some stuff going on with my family and honestly I just lost motivation. I didn't quit school but I was not taking the full 12 hr course load anymore and now 3 yrs from when I began I am only JUST finishing my AS but the thing is I have absolutely no motivation to apply for BSN programs and I can't even imagine even getting to a grad program. It's not that I don't think I would like nursing, I worked as a CNA and scribe for a bit and watched their work. It's still really appealing I just do not think I could finish another two years of school when it took me 3 just to cover my basics and then another 2 for a master's. I keep hearing  that NP's will have to finish a doctorate to work now so maybe even more than 2 yrs. 
      I need some advice on where to go from here. What can I even do with an AS? Will I have to keep going and apply to nursing programs and at least try for my BSN? I dunno I guess I'm asking if it's going to be worth it to push through and finish or if there are shorter programs maybe not nursing that I can apply to with an AS?

He’ll rub against your legs then flop over and bite the shit out of your ankle. If you have to reach past him for anything, your hand will be a clawed, bloody mess. Basically when I see him I wait for him to go away before doing anything. It’s like a wild animal. I’ve always spoken softly and been nice to him and had a laser or something for him to play with. My bf says he’s been like that since he came home as a kitten, but at least when he was smaller it was cute when he tried to kill someone with his tiny claws. This cat lives indoors, has plenty of space and good food, and only deals with a dog as competition. He won’t allow another cat in the house and hisses when even the dog gets too close. 

Is there any way to tame this beast, or is he just a permanent asshole? The funniest shit is when my boyfriend’s mom wanted him to leave the room, she full body pounced on him and hissed back while plopping him outside, and he didn’t even attempt to claw her.

628,"I recently dropped out of university during my second year as the experience I had at the Uni was terrible.

The location was horrible and the tutors / lecturers never got in touch with me.

Ive since applied to universities outside of London as I really feel like I needed a change, and actually make some friends at a new Uni.

However due to my first year not being great, as my mental state hasn’t been the best for the last two years, and not being able to get hold of a proper reference due to the tutors being incapable of replying to my emails, i’ve lost all confidence about being able to get in to any Unis. 

I applied for second year entry at all 5 Universities, as finance only covered 4 years total. And one of the lower ones have replied saying they can only offer first year entry, which just isn’t possible for me. On top of that they are asking for a reference from my Uni, which again is impossible to get.

The fact that one of the lower ones said no to my second year enquiry has made me really unconfident about the other choices letting me in, especially since they will probably ask for a reference too.

This thought has been nagging at me for over a month now and I have had countless sleepless nights because of it.

I can’t speak to my parents about it in detail because I know i’d break down in tears at how disappointed they’d be at me if all 5 reject me.

I feel like theres this cloud above by head and a burden on my shoulders I just can’t shake off no matter how hard i try. It’s really annoying and even though i can get rid of the thought temporarily by going to my part time job or playing video games or talking to my mates, as soon as i’m alone again the thought comes back, biting at my brain like a parasite.

I know i’m not a stupid person academically, I did great in high school and ok at A level, and i really don’t want to waste any potential I might have by not getting a degree. Or are degrees over rated ? 

I’m seriously stuck on what to do, and honestly don’t expect anyone to read all of what I said, as im sure it’s a very common and boring situation, but getting it off my chest is a small relief.

I know this is stupid but inside my head I keep having dark thoughts about what I might do if none of this works out, if I can’t get a place anywhere, if I can’t sort my life out in the next few months. I really hate thinking about things like this and honestly i’m sick of it.

630,"Hey so I've had multiple different sexual partners who've all loved the blowjobs I give. I like to think I'm very good at them, I've gotten lots of compliments and praise.

However, with my current boyfriend, he doesn't seem to enjoy them as much as anyone else has. I've asked numerous times for critiques and feedback and he has nothing to offer. He always takes a very long time to finish when I go down on him and usually tries to coax me into having sex, as if he doesn't even want the blowjob. But he inisists that he does enjoy them and there's nothing I can do to improve them.

Honestly Reddit my pride is hurt here and I feel like I'm losing out on something I really enjoy doing. My past partners loved receiving random blowjobs until completion and never complained about me not wanting to have sex on my period because I love doing oral. They also never took very long to finish. With my current boyfriend, if I don't also use my hand during it takes a minimum of 20 minutes.

I'm the only woman who's ever gone down on him until completion so he doesn't really have any comparison as to how long it usually takes him during a blowjob. I just feel like 20/30 minutes is a long time. It makes me feel like I'm bad at it and he won't offer any feedback so I can never improve. I miss having a partner that would ask for oral. I feel like I'm missing out on something I used to enjoy.

So I guess my questions for you are, is 20/30 minutes actually a long time? Do you think maybe he's not enjoying them but just doesn't want to hurt my feelings? Are there people out there who simply don't like oral?

I want to feel like my talents are appreciated and wanted and needed again... What should I do?",15May2019,0

639,"Hey Everyone,

Using a throwaway because my brother lurks on reddit from time to time.

Like the title says, my family and I are at our wits end trying to figure what to do with my brother (25M). He seems to be going nowhere in life, spending money like it grows on trees, is generally lazy and not hardworking, grossly unhealthy physically, has no drive or ambition, lies constantly, and is overall abusive. 

Essentially, my parents coddled him at a very young age because he was born with a heart valve defect of some kind (not a doctor). Because of this, they often times refused to be strict or punish him in anyway. All his life he has been extremely temperamental and emotional often screaming at everyone in sight as soon as things don’t go his way. It’s not that he gives people time to explain or anything, at the first sign of opposition, he lashes out until no one can stand to be around him.

To give some background examples of what he does or why he believes his actions are okay:

When we he was graduating high school (a small private school), his grades were miserable. The administration told our parents that he would not be allowed to graduate, but after my parents talked to them, they decided instead to let him do so.

He went to a community college, where he signed up for classes, but never went choosing instead to hangout with his friends on campus playing cards and doing other generic slacker stuff. Then, he dropped out of that.

He once wanted to pursue his culinary dreams, went to orientation at a culinary school and dropped out after the first hour.

Anytime my mom asks him a question, his immediate response is to scream at her until she cries and leaves.

When my dad asks him to do something, he screams and comes up with a thousand excuses until he gives up.

I can go on and on with examples, but the pattern seems clear.


Recently, he’s even begun hanging out with gangbangers and thinking he has now become one of them. To elaborate, he doesn’t want to harm people or steal, but every conversation you have with him ends up leading towards how he believes he is a gangbanger and gangs are actually a lot of good. I don’t particularly like the idea of him associating with them because of the bad habits and mentality they can pass on, however, those people are still harder working than my brother is. 

I’m looking for advice from people who have similar experiences with a sibling/child or professionals who recommend a plan of action.

He's told me he plans to move as far away from his parents as he can for university, which completely basically fucks me too, because I'm staying fairly near to where I am now, so I'm scared about what's gonna happen with us, because he's honestly my only real good friend, and I desperately don't want to lose him.

I managed to land a wonderful girlfriend early this year and we are both super into each other, and it's been a truly fantastic time. We even went to a party together recently, a rare occasion for me, and we both had a great time but it's now been three days since she's spoken to me and I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I'm right to be worried about what that means but I'm at a complete loss on this one.

I'm also right in the middle of maybe my most severe depressive episode to date right now, I lack motivation for the most basic of tasks. I can't bring myself to sit and seriously revise for my exams, which start on Monday btw, I haven't left the house in a week, and idk I'm just struggling man.

On top of that I've realised that I really fucking hate the subject that I've chosen to do at uni and that I really never wanted to go in the first place but I've been pushed into it by school and my parents. But on the other hand, if I didn't end up going, I'd be really embarrassed because all of my family think I'm really smart and they're constantly going on about how because I'm the first one in the family to be 'academic' I have to go to uni and get a good job in the city and make money to pay for all the shit they can't afford

I realise now that I don't even know what I'm asking for advice on anymore, and I'm more just venting/complaining but if anyone has anything to say at all I'll be glad to hear it. And if you have any questions I'll be more than happy to answer them, probably. Please tell me if this belongs in a different sub, I'll move it faster than you can say wait that belongs in a different sub",15May2019,1

646,"I left a dress with the tailor, asking to have the elastic taken out from the waist and then to have the waist taken in. She did that, but she also removed a lot of the fabric around the hips, which I never asked for. Now the dress makes me look lumpy, and she didn’t leave enough fabric to let out the hips to the necessary extent. It technically fits, but it looks bad. 

Is taking in the waist something where the hip adjustment should have been expected? I don’t know if it’s justified to refuse to pay or ask for a free fix, maybe if they can sew a panel into the skirt of the dress to let it back out. 

I don’t want to pay so much for a dress I now hate. :/",15May2019,1
647,"My wife and I have been fighting a lot recently. I work in sales for a large cell phone company and make 40 to 50 thousand annually. My wife makes about 12 thousand a year but wants to quit and be a stay at home mom. I have an associates degree and some college. She wants me to make more 100k or more a year and keeps fighting with me about going to trade school. I went to school to be a teacher but put that on hold when we meet seven years ago. I am a introvert and don't really like doing sales and I hate the idea of working with my hands for a living. I told her I would get serious about my writing and try to self publish through amazon or something to supplement our current income but she wants me to make 100k within the next few years.

648,"Im going to keep this as short as possible. Basically, i used to have at least 5 really close friends, and then i was friends with their friends and so on.

They are 2 grades below me in school wise, so I graduated last year, and they are both juniors in high school. All 3 of us were doing our own thing for awhile, but my other 2 friends recently rekindled and now hang out pretty frequently. Im usually busy with work or something so i cant blame them. But i feel like i have no friends. I have an amazing girlfriend and her female friend, but i really miss my guy time, ya know? 

I just need advice on what i should do, and how i should go about doing it.

I was trying to soak everything up in, all while mirroring their body language and trying to adjust to the situation given I am usually a rather more introverted individual.

652,"I used to work for a famous company a few years back and whenever the name of it gets mentioned or I tell people I used to work for them I get overwhelmed with feelings of depression. I would sometimes go on Social Media and see updates of the place or former colleagues who would post work related stuff and it would just make me feel extremely uncomfortable either through embarrassed or just sadness that I wasted so many years working there. My memories of that place are 95% negative and so being reminded of the place feels a bit like a ptsd kind of thing of which I would like to get rid of especially since it is a valuable experience to have on my cv and to use in general.

We both had girlfriends and talk about girls and do normal guy shit. we also talk about sex and masturbation from time to time which isn't anything awkward cos were super close. So for some reason I have this feeling I have a crush on him, because he looks amazing in beanies and snapbacks, and also when he sags his pants. I don't know if thats a crush or I just love him as a best friend and just admire how good looking he is. I mean obv I dont wanna go out with him but he just looks so good in a beanie I always think about him in it. I also have a picture of him wearing a beanie and have masturbtated to it because I was really horny. but I know I'm not gay but im thinking I just admire his looks and personality rather than being gay and wanting to go out with him, dont want none of that sexual thing eww. thanks",15May2019,1
654," 

My BF and I are together for 3 years. We are both each others first sexual partner (And only.. i hope?) My boyfriend had a medical condition on his penis before we had an relationship and he got surgery during the early days of our relationship - he basically could not have sex until the surgery was completed. (Severe phimosis). This happened around 3 years ago.

Anyway couple of days ago we had sex and he came very fast within 10 seconds. This is something that never happens, he usually lasts long so I sorta joked about it.

Yesterday we were grocery shopping and he said something in lines of I am the 10 second hero. And I said 10 second hero? Then he said; that was with you, that I came so fast.

""That was with you"" this bothers me big time.

If he didnt have other girls of course this was with me? Why would he mention it? 

When I asked him about it he reacted grumpy and said it didnt mean anything and I shouldn't wine about it.

Am I overthinking or?? If it was a joke why couldn't he explain what he meant?",15May2019,1
655,"I’m trying to figure out what career I want. TLDR @ bottom.

I need to get a financially secure job. But my passion is what I’m good at, and that’s art.

Not to say I’m not smart, I’m actually thinking about going to get my degree in advertising, but I’m not sure if that’s a career that is 100% my fit. Either that or a communications/digital media/graphic design degree, whichever is most practical.

I want to care for my mother, she worked hard to get in this country, but I fear if I follow art I won’t be able to provide for her in the future.

I am already accepted to a few colleges. I realize all the RISDs and SAIC and all those out of state expensive colleges aren’t happening for me. I’m choosing to stay instate, in Texas. 

Instate, I have to choose between University of Houston, University of St. Thomas, and University of Texas at Dallas. I had so many health issues that I missed the deadline for University of Texas at Austin, which I would’ve preferred. 

TLDR: Which school is best? University of Houston, which is mostly commuter so I miss out on the college experience, University ofSt Thomas where my mother is happy but I’m forced through religious classes, or the university of Texas at Dallas where I feel it’s too nerdy for me and not enough nightlife. I could also do community college one year then hope I can transfer, although I don’t really want to go through the transfer process.

660,"I have an internship lined up that I'm starting the second week of June. I decided to rejoin the landscaping company I worked with 2 summers ago for the few weeks I will be home in between school and my internship. At this company, i used to do more physical labor, outside work, but for these three weeks, I'll be working inside doing more stocking and inventory type jobs. I don't know anyone in this new department, don't feel comfortable in my responsibilities, and fear that I am missing quality time with my family by spending ~40 hours a week at this job. I started up 2 days ago, but am considering working until the end of the week (when the new schedule is made), and telling my boss thank you for the opportunity, but this position isn't exactly what I wanted. 

Truthfully, I think I made a mistake even accepting this position because I now realize I enjoyed running errands, doing casual yard work, and cooking and cleaning for my family these few weeks before I started my internship. I fear that the bridge may be burned with this company (although I don't intend to work there in the future). Further, I worry that I'll instill a poor mentality in myself of quitting if I don't like what I'm doing (I've never done this before, but I don't know how it may affect me in future jobs).

For activities and societies, should I just include my honors societies? Or intern work I did through the school too? My intern work could be mentioned somewhere else instead, though, I suppose.


Should I include an electronic version of my diploma in the part where I can add documents for schooling?

662,"First of all, apologies for strong language but I've been frustrated about this for quite some time.

My biological dad passed away in 2015 from cancer, because isn't it always cancer. My mom went through the usual grieving process, as did I, but it seemed like she was eager to find someone to rebound on. She started dating a guy she'd been friends with for a long time, who I'd never really known of outside of her occasionally mentioning e-mailing him. Fast-forward through a lot of getting used to the guy and whatnot and I'm in a weird situation. We'll call the boyfriend Boyf.

For a little bit of context, I admit I'm already not fond of the guy. His relationship with my mom is rocky at times, and she confides a lot of it in me because she doesn't have many friends her age. When they were first dating, Boyf was going through a divorce with his ex, so he was reluctant to commit to a full-on relationship with my mom. Understandable at first, but there have been at least two times during this process where he either implied or straight up told my mom he was considering taking his ex-wife back. And when you have to sit up with your crying mother because some random geriatric nimrod is playing around with her feelings, you tend to be predisposed to not liking the guy.

But that doesn't really directly have to do with the problem at hand, I'm just explaining why I might be a little harder on Boyf than otherwise. Anyway, ever since I met the guy, it's been apparent he's very...outwardly affectionate. He would tickle me and lightly smack my head and a variety of other things. Nothing malicious or creepy, but it bothered me because, like I said, I was already not liking the dude. But I also hate being touched without permission by people I'm not close with in general. And I HATE being tickled, even by people I do know.

At some point I eventually told Boyf how much the tickling annoyed me and made me uncomfortable, and asked him to stop. He kind of grumbled about it a little but conceeded. And I thought, problem solved right?

Oh, so wrong. Now, any time he does literally anything else that annoys me (kicking my butt as I walk past him, popping up behind the couch and scaring me, whatever), if I express my annoyance he mockingly replies, ""At least I'm not tickling you!""

I've told my mom how much this pisses me off and she insists he's just playing and I'm being too hard on him. And on top of all of that, here's the kicker: the dude's kind of loaded and has frequently paid for things for me. He bought me my current car, for god's sake (not brand new and not expensive, but still kind of a big deal). So on top of everything, any time I express any kind of annoyance toward him, my mom tells me I should just ignore it because he's done so much for me and for her and blah blah blah. Pardon me, but I don't think I should be made to feel like I have to endure anything this dude does just because he CHOSE to buy things for me. I never asked for any of this.

Not to mention, I feel like all this is kind of inappropriate to begin with. Maybe if he had gotten into a relationship with a woman with a young child, it would be more appropriate to tickle and play with them this way. But I'm 24 goddamn years old. I'm an adult. And I don't appreciate being manhandled by someone who is still essentially a stranger to me.

The job, outside of needing one for obvious reasons, is to pay for my schooling through undergrad and I just can’t seem to grasp onto how to get one, honestly I’ve applied to nearly a hundred and gotten zilch.

So the most recent thing that brought these feelings up is that she, the day before departure, cancelled my planned visit to her house, citing mental health problems as the reason. Normally, this would be fine, disappointing but reasonable. But the difference is, she’s done this so many times before, cancelling or postponing plans at the last minute, and it’s always disappointing for me since it’s the only social interaction I have anymore. 

Also, I logged onto Facebook today and saw a load of photos taken in France with another friend of hers. I had not been invited on this trip, nor even informed of it. She mentioned once she was going to France *alone* at some point, and I think she said that because she knows I’d be upset if she went with someone else. 

She and I have often talked about sharing a room together for university, but then she goes and shares a room with this other friend, and doesn’t even tell me until she’s moved in and it comes up in passing. 

I could go on, but I think you get the picture. Is this the behaviour of a self-declared “best friend”? Am I overreacting, or do I deserve someone better? Should I talk to her about it? I’d honestly hate to lose her, but maybe it’s better than subjecting myself to this shit long-term.",15May2019,1

While growing up, the stories she told me made him seem like the boogeyman. She told me when I was young, that if I ever saw him, run away and call the police. 

That’s what I grew up with. Just stories of him. Until about two months ago. He messaged me on Facebook. 

He told me that he was sorry for never being in my life. He told me they got divorced because my grandparents threatened to cut my mom out of their will if they stayed together. He told me that the few times he tried to get in contact with me while I was young, he was met with police force. He said he doesn’t hate my mom for keeping me away, only wishes she didn’t.

So, where do I start. I have received admittance to several prestigious medical schools after my senior year at the undergrad level at a prestigious school in the Northeast. It feels like I'm set for life, but my heart is more interested in MMA. I have a BJJ black belt, winning first in multiple regional tournaments, second degree black belt in Goyo Ryu Karate, winning state championships multiple times throughout my teens (never was able to be able to go to nationals due to schooling), and have an undefeated amateur kickboxing record. Fighting is my passion, has been since I started karate at five years old, but the pay is horrendous, unless I get to large organizations and become dominant there, such as the UFC or Bellator (probably not gonna happen), it's a very unstable profession, and it's at the most a 25 year career, while including brain damage. 

I'm not uninterested in medicine, but I know my true passion is fighting, and I'm at the point where I can't half-ass both. 

If it helps, my goal is to become an anesthesiologist if I do enter medical school. I know you guys can't really make this decision for me, but any words of advice could help me come to one. Thank y'all so much.

Well now things have changed and there is the possibility of him being sent somewhere that is not the current state we are in.

The only issue is that it is just upsetting to know that this is going to happen. I am currently finishing college and my education is important, he emphasized to me that I need to finish college for my sake (I also think so as well). I will end up moving to wherever he is staying once I am done school, so the end result is really not bad at all.Marriage is not an option right now because we have been together 6 months, even though we have both established we want to get there someday.I would not necessarily be against it, but we are trying to be smart about it.

684,"Hello anyone reading this,

First I like to say thank you so much for spending your precious time with someone like me. It means a lot. But on to what's been bothering me.

For some background information as a intro, I'm currently 18 and going to be 19 this year at September living with my parents and older siblings in East London.

I just wanted to see if I can find people out there who can help me in anyway. By the many posts, I guess I'm not the only one huh? I'm currently facing a few issues on what I'm suppose to feel in a sense and don't know how to approach things since I never ever been in these types of situations.

Like many people, I have some anger issues. Mainly being frustrated in things which lead to my blood boiling but it's mainly directed at myself as a person or just people I slowly grew to not like in whether as a person or what they did that I did not like. I never knew who to talk or trust and right now I just want answers in things.

Are these feelings I have justified? Probably not if I'm questioning it but I don't know how to feel or if emotions like this is natural? I try to surpress it but it almost always burst out in the wrong situation.

I feel like my opinion in things don't matter in conversation or to change something as if I never talked at all. It's almost like I never mattered to begin with, I was never good at talking seriously. And not having a chance to express myself as a person. I just want people to listen. Mainly family related reasons.

What I'm most concerned about is what to trust. There's this Network Marketing company that many people don't really heard about called ACN. My older brother (31) who bare in mind still lives with us (we both sleep in the room in separate beds) and provided one reason that he pays the Internet for Virgin Media (eventhough my older sister who is 25 says Sky is cheaper and back then  helped pay for it instead).

Anyways, he joined in 4 years ago and I just want a clear definitive answer on this. Is ACN truly a scam that my older brother that looks like he's in the awkward phrase of puberty with poor growth of facial hair it's almost dying weeds in the back garden?

This company has been slowly changing him to someone I personally I'm starting to not like character wise. One of his philosophy is ""I only listen to people who have what I want"" meaning people who are already success. He will never listen to anyone else and while we had a petty argument late midnight (sort of my fault for shouting in frustration because he wasn't aware of something and made a rude remark like a rebellious teen would say because he's not aware how cringy he can be which caused me to get a bit mad) he just told me to shut up and go to my room which I didn't of course since.

1. I wanted him to listen and he's covering his eyes with one hand on a phone playing a inspirational video saying ""I'm not listening"" pushing me away slightly as I try to stop him from acting childish.

2. Mainly confused on how someone would just say that at that age. 

3. Tried to intimidate me by saying in way that he will hurt me if I don't stay quiet using violence. He didn't but the chances are there that it might happen. So much for the man in the argument. Pretty confusion what the guy was doing. 

Cut connections with many friends and doesn't like to look at the past and wants to move on no matter what. Has a bit of a hostility with my older sister (who I respect and love very much like mum and dad since she's honestly a good person that has me and my mum's anger). She's worried he doesn't listen to him and worried that he'll rather go to a event of the company than her future wedding in 2 years time. And always ask me to talk to him about her issues since shes knows I have any possible chance to talk to him. (I'm slowly losing that ability to get him to listen to) 

Is pretty loud and noisy. Talks to himself a few times but mainly in the shower which he takes too long in. God he wears boxers and ask me if they look like pants since he sometimes just walks around in them with a shirt on and when I said no they're not, he just wears it still believing their pants. 

Terrible in washing dishes as I'm the only one capable of doing a good job since my mum needs a break and my older sister knows I'm good at it. And is messy with his side of the room. I had to clean our rooms. 

Massive BTS fan nearly on the edge of being a Koreanboo always playing their songs loudly and singing them (terrible singing). 

Really sorry about that tangent. Just wanted to get this off my chest for a while. All I just want is the legitimacy in ACN because my dumbass of a big brother is probably never moving out is praising of telling people about it.

685," Had to use the great local police Keep The Peace escort to facilitate the retrieval of my personal belongings from my GF's house.

After they left we spoke over her locked front gate - after I had left my ""I love you but must walk away"" letter on her bed.

She had 3 blackout drunk/memory loss episodes in one week and actually drove home from her dive bar drunk not even remembering how she got into her car, getting into the house and to bed.

To every specific example I recited her response was ""I'm not an alcoholic"".

I had to end the dialogue with ""I hope you get arrested for DUI before you hurt yourself or others in a bad car crash"".

She's also a deliberate enabler - lets her daughter smoke cannabis all night long.

I have no skills to deal effectively with such deep denial.

She has an older brother she respects deeply.

686,"Throwaway, on mobile, not exactly sure how to word but will try my best.

So backstory: I (18) was driving my friend's car with him sitting in the passenger seat in the GTA of Ontario, Canada. I was trying to change lanes from the left to the middle and I went through all checks to make sure it was safe to merge (mirror, side mirror and blind) and it was clear. As I was merging there happened to be a car in the lane and I ended up colliding with them. It was a minor accident and everyone was ok albeit minor damages on both cars. (Driver's side on their car, passenger side on my friend's car)

I'm not under any car insurance but my friend is and he's the primary driver. He needs to have a clean insurance record because of future prospects. I don't want his record to be tarnished but at the same time it is also safer to go through insurance to fix the damage and prevent scamming. I've already offered my friend to pay for damages for both cars out of pocket. There was no police report.

My question is how would this affect him and his insurance if he decides to go through it, and will it also take a toll on me when I do sign up for insurance. And what can I do to mend this situation.",15May2019,1

Throwaway because please holy toads I don't need my Mo family breathing down my neck. I'm not getting any answers from self-help books and I'm too ashamed to share this with anyone I know. 

I'm a 30 year old female. I have a bachelors degree in the plant science field and after I graduated I went into the field immediately. I married about 3 months into that and pretty quickly stopped working to be a house wife, basically. I just went along with what I thought I was supposed to do, and what he asked was that I stay home. (I'm past that point in my life and trying to undo what my naivete let me do to my life.)

By the end of my 6 year marriage I had no job, job experience, or life experience. When I got over the horror of my failed marriage I got my EMT certification and then worked as a dispatcher for a year, until I got sick. I am about to start chemo now, I tried other things to keep myself able to work, medications, diet changes, no luck. 

Daughter and I are both on medicaid. I want to turn in an application for disability, I've got it filled out, but I've heard the only way to get actual assistance is to have a lawyer. The pro-bono lawyers I called never returned my calls, I gave up. I'm scared and ashamed to go, if they chase me out I will be crushed. I guess I really need to grow some balls at this point. 

I've got a car payment that's way too high (260$ every month) on a car left from my marriage (total of 10,000 left). I don't know how to sell this car safely (not get murdered on craigslist or scammed). I don't know how to buy a car that I can afford (not get ripped off and buy a lemon). 

I've got credit card debt under 6,000 spread across 3 cards. Right after my birth, I started working an office job I found on craigslist. I fucked up and got scammed out of 5000 dollars, so that's where that debt came from. Yeah, fuck me, I know.

I pay for my sons food, clothing, toys. I pay for the electricity here, my cell phone, and a few other small bills. I'd like to start him in daycare but can't afford it. This state has daycare assistance but once again I can't get in touch with these fucking people. 

I was living on savings for the last two years, that well is dry. My Mom is now starting to contribute the majority, she owns the home she and I live in so at least there's no rent. 

My sons dad contributes a couple hundred each month (I don't want to take him in for custody/support because things are civil and I don't know what to ask for.) I know I'm a shit person for taking money from my old retired mother. What the hell do I do to fix this? I should be taking care of my Mom, not the other way around.

I know there are people who would give or loan me money but I don't want to go down that road. I'd like to fix this myself. Where do I even start? I don't know the first step to take, but please, I am willing to take it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was very good people enjoyed it and it soon started to grow. The biggest page had 700 followers. We made a group chat and sent memes to each other. (Usually taking the piss out of bad teachers) and one of them got questioned by the police and had to shut down for a while and all the other ones went dark and disappeared for a while. I was  the only original one left with one other account who was inactive. (Many of the younger years started to make some) and when I returned in march. I had upped the quality and started to make video edits and such. And now the police is trying to track down who ownes them all. The other guy posted that he had to delete his shit because the police were hunting down the meme account owners. And i deleted everything and made the account private.

697,"Hi all!  


I'm trying to decide if I should leave my current job and move in with my best friend who will be starting Grad School in the fall. Let me run down the details:

I graduated from Undergrad in May of 2018 and have been living and working in Chicago for the past 9 or so months. I started with a marketing internship that I hated but managed to get a pretty well paying job doing ""content marketing"" (basically writing) with a cool team at a good company with benefits and a decent culture. While I like the people I work with and some of the work I'm doing, I can't STAND working in an office environment, and hate the actual marketing aspect of my job. It also doesn't matter much to me personally as I fully intend to pursue a Ph.D. in Sociology in the Fall of 2020.

I am not a Chicago native and have had a terrible time here socially. I live alone, and have one friend from my undergrad who's not too far away from me that I see regularly. Unfortunately, they are an unrelentingly negative person who I'm finding harder and harder to be around. The only other person I see in the city with much regularity is another acquaintance from undergrad with whom I've become somewhat closer friends with, but they live fairly far away from me and are somewhat older and better established with their own group of friends. I didn't make any lasting friends at my last job and have been struggling to make connections at my new one (mostly due to an office culture that is almost entirely centered around Slack, which I hate). 

Furthermore, my family life has been a bit of a dumpster fire as well. I lost a close family member to gun violence in October and now another has cancer. It's not directly relevant, but it's certainly been affecting me.

The loneliness and depression I've been experiencing the last few months has been exhausting. The only times I really get to go see people is when I go play Magic the Gathering at my local game store twice a week. I've tried a few things to put myself out there (improv classes, pickup sports) but those have sort of fizzled out and didn't really lead anywhere, 

Now, it turns out my best friend is looking to move into an apartment in Charlottesville the same month my lease here in Chicago is up. I'm seriously debating just up and moving in with her and finding a service job (bookstore/coffee shop/restaurant) until I start my own grad program. She and I are extremely close, and would have another mutual friend in the area. I also don't have to worry too much about the financial aspect of things (which is not many people's position) due to some money I inherited from my grandparents and a lack of student loans to worry about. 

What do you all think? Should I stick it out and try and make Chicago work? Is it stupid to make myself miserable for any longer than I need to and should I up and move in with my friend? I'd love to get your opinions!

698,"Disclaimer: I originally posted this in r/college and am posting here as well even though it is not entirely fitting, but I'm trying to gain as many opinions as I can.  Sorry if this thread is inappropriate here.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting this off, I'm in computer science major, as an international undergraduate student (yes here for 4 years) at National Taiwan University (NTU). The major is indeed, extremely hard, as our major's ranked globally top 40 (though I think it's been fluctuating to top 70's due to some political problems) for computer science majors of all the world's universities. I'm not trying to brag or anything, but this is one of the points that would contribute to my struggling thoughts.

Right now this is my 2nd semester here as an 18 year old in Taiwan, the place where my immigrant parents grew up but had me born and raised in Silicon Valley, California. Over the course of these 2 semesters, it has been multiple times that I have considered alternatives of changing majors, going back to the US, starting a side-hobby that may help, etc. Many reasons have led me to stagger and think much more than twice and I will list them, so please bare with me.

1. I was not entirely sure about my major choosing it during the college application process starting the summer going into senior year but because it seemed kind of interesting and lucrative for choosing computer science for the future, I settled with it. I have gotten A's in the few computer science classes I took in high school as well.
2. Growing up, my parents have always viewed me as smart (I know, I sound really full of myself listing these reasons and I apologize), due to my performance in schools with the levels of class that I was able to excel and skip and the programs such as GATE, for the gifted that I got accepted into. This led them to pave a road that would secure a future on a path for making good money with a solid job, rather than a subjective job that could result in unfortunate scenarios. Unfortunately, I guess I have inherited the science/math side from my dad as he's an electrical engineer which made those subjects easier for me, but also inherited my mom's talent for drawing and design. I have always loved to draw and create 3D objects of my imaginations or some sort of creative object I saw in comics or on the TV. But my mom knows how hard her path was to become a successful graphic designer with pretty insane salary during her years working, and didn't want me to go through the years of struggles and uncertainty like how she did. This leads back to my the reason why my parents had me focus on academics in school instead.
3. Because I focused on academics, I took a lot of AP (advanced placement) and honors courses (probably around 13 AP exams were taken) over my high school career. While it was gruesome, sleeping barely 3-4 hours a day while participating in varsity sports and clubs, I managed a 4.3 GPA which I still am upset at how my slight mistakes of B+'s dragging it down from a potentially higher GPA. I advanced in classes still like how I did growing up and was able to take many classes 2-4 years ahead of people, and even took community college courses over the summer since those level of academics were not offered in high school. It would be quite a shame to put all those hard work to waste
4. Starting from this point, I will start to get into more personal/family situations. One of the most influential reasons of finally deciding to come to Taiwan for this university was the networking and level of education I would receive after I graduate. My school has close connections with even the famous US schools like MIT and Harvard since they excel in similar majors like my school, so they like having people from our school attend their's for exchange or graduate school. The classmates I would meet here are some of the smartest people in Asia and for sure are not associated with anything out of the ordinary that makes them sketchy. Also, improving my Mandarin Chinese would definitely benefit me in the future market since Asia is becoming much more essential in the role of supply and demand with the Western world.
5. While I do admit I grew up in a slightly above middle class child, since you had to be about that level to thrive well in Silicon Valley, where people see it as the famous place of technology. My dad got laid off when I was 12 and we have been only gaining income from rentals, stocks, and other activities on the side. Since I was born in the year of Dragon, at least with the statistics and the articles that were published for my year of college admissions, my year, 2018 was probably one of, if not, the worst year of admission rates. The percentages dropped as expected with the growing population, but for 2018, it dropped at a much larger scale; some completely blew away our minds. One of the popular theories of rejection from the typically seen as sketchy business from college admissions, is that they almost disregard your application and reject you if you have low incomes and have applied for FAFSA or other financial aids. It's a similar problem that people persist, like how affirmative action is currently and other policital problems. I personally believe this theory might have affected me a lot since according to my application, some of my friends I knew I had similar, or 100% better application than them but were rejected from the same college for the same major while they were accepted. On an even more ridiculous aspect, my friends who were a year older got into most of the schools that we got rejected with very similar or even worse applications. Most of us got rejected by California universities, especially the UC's, but a lot were accepted by out of state or international universities, furthermore supporting the low income theory. I got accepted into computer science for schools like UW or Purdue, that were all ranked much higher than the other UC schools that people often viewed to be ""easier"" to get in. This of course narrowed down my options which at the moment, going to National Taiwan University seemed like it outweighed the potentials of going to community college or going to universities I did not want to go.
6. Due to my low income starting middle school and busy schedules leading into high school, I have not visited Taiwan for 11 years until I came here for college last year. Many family problems have occurred along with my relatives getting old, which I have been absent the entire time. As an Asian descent, I happen to be the only boy on my dad's side to continue the last name. This is just something I keep in mind and respect because I know how much my relatives love me despite growing up on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. I wanted to also visit my relatives more and do not want to only come back to Taiwan to visit their funerals, as even some I have missed the past years.

The reasons listed here are mainly the reasons that have led me to eventually decide to commit to going to an entirely different country on a drastically culturally different continent. Below I will list my current reasons on why I want to possibly change majors or go on a different path.

1. I believe I am not completely enjoying my major, or even any, at all. But I know that does not necessarily mean I should give up immediately as many others are in the same boat as I am. Perhaps I am just taking more General Education courses since I'm a freshmen or I am still trying to adapt to this culture, or the other usual reasons people have. It might take a little more time until that spark flashes and my brain clicks which results in more interest. Sometimes I might feel that motivation to work hard but I noticed that even if I finally solve an insanely hard programming task, I almost never, and have not for the past few months, that satisfaction of succeeding of overcoming a challenge like how I always did when I finished a creative project growing up.
2. Going back to the US, transitioning back to my roots will have cost expenses and if I regret my decision ironically, it could have pretty nasty drawbacks on giving up such a valuable opportunity I have at hand currently studying here.
3. Similar to what I mentioned before, I enjoy art and design related projects like drawing, building 3D objects, Photoshopping, video editting, etc. Unfortunately, like how my mom believes, it truly is subjective. From her experience, my dad really did have an easier life that in total earned more money than here and landed a life in Silicon Valley, despite neither of them being able to attend college due to the unorganized political state Taiwan was in when Jiangkai-Shek ruled Taiwan after losing to Maozedong.
4. The cultural adaptation is not the usual troubles of not being used to some habits or traditions of the people in the foreign country, but for me, it is within the academics. Many of the teachings, besides half of the time it is in Chinese that makes it difficult for me to understand (most are in English because computer science relies on its roots in English), subjects like math are taught quite advanced as the stereotypes hold for Asia. While I did notice that the topics covered are essentially identical to the Western counterpart, the numbers given are extremely hard to solve and we are taught more strategies to deal with them. The most troubling part is often during lectures, the professor may seem to skip a step for me, but to my Taiwanese friends it is not skipping because it is assumed that they have always learned and knew those methods. Obviously I never knew those growing up in the US since they were never taught. This problem occurs in quite a lot of classes for me.
5. If you truly have read up to this point, I thank you. But you may have noticed that I am quite a bit on the stereotypical-""Asian-American-with-immigrant-parents""-decision-making kind of person. Unfortunately it is kind of true which leads me putting this reason last. Growing up, especially when I got into high school, me just like a lot of other people, especially with the ""stereotypical"" Asians, we took the hard classes to boost our GPA. But we all knew in our hearts many of the subjects, even without their weighted counterparts, were little to nothing on being useful to our life. Coming to Taiwan and talking about this similar topic with my Taiwanese friends, they came to ask me that technically I am taking that learning about useless information in those irrelevant classes to another level as Asia always teaches the harder path. This 5th point is kind of opinionated and probably does not matter as much perhaps to some readers but I thought I'd just include it because taking dis-interesting classes often led me to become stressed and overclocked with boredom throughout high school.

In my current situation for this 2nd semester that has about a month left, I'm just planning on soldiering my way through to the end first and try revisiting my interests during the summer. I feel that I would be more passionate with a major that is related to art &amp; design like graphic designing, fashion design, animation or maybe even architecture (a bit of a stretch for the last one). But as I have mentioned multiple times, it is a really subjective major; in our harsh reality, many people in subjective fields often are either barely surviving or just extraordinarily successful. For all I know I might be interested in eventually becoming an entrepreneur or a YouTuber (just really wild/naive thoughts that may be possible, who knows).  I probably missed some points and would edit my post later, even though it's already long enough, but thank you for reading and please give me opinions on this. I have talked with my parents on my potential decisions on a few occasions now and we are still not sure about this commitment.

P.S. I do not really use Reddit all that much so excuse any hiccups I might have in amateur mistakes in this thread. Also I probably would post this in another subforum that's appropriate so I might have some accordingly edits or replies with additional knowledge from other information gained from other areas.",15May2019,1

700,"Sorry if this is long. I'll try to condense as best I can. Also, I'm on mobile, so sorry about formatting. I have had chronic migraines since I was 8 years old. Before starting medication, I would have upwards of 12 migraine days a month. I also get some ridiculous symptoms along with them. Impaired vision, impaired hearing, confusion, fatigue, nausea (even vomiting), and dizziness. I've had my job for about 3 and a half years and I really like it. Any time I'm asked to learn something new, I jump at the opportunity. I've even asked some coworkers in other positions to teach me what their doing, just to learn something new. I KNOW I'm a good worker. I mentioned my migraines when I was interviewed for this job and I was told that it wouldn't be a problem to work with me. It's also been discussed periodically throughout my time with the company. Granted, the managers who interviewed me and who I usually spoke to, no longer work in my location. One of my previous managers even tried to help me get FMLA, but I was told I don't qualify because I don't have enough hours. I'm part time, and I'm also going to school. Now the manager that we have left (who I have talked to about this before) pulled me into his office the other day for an attendance review, which is standard. He asked me about my steady absences. I told him it's due to my migraines. When I have them I can't drive to get there, let alone function enough to do the job. I also reminded him that we had talked about this before. He said he ""thinks"" he remembers me mentioning it. He then told me that he's choosing to put me on corrective action for my absences, because he doesn't believe a verbal warning will fix it. He explicitly told me he does not have to do this, that this is his choice. I don't understand if he thinks this will cure me somehow? I understand that because I don't have FMLA, I'm not really entitled to these absences, but I'm not sure what to do here. At this point, I'm guessing I just go to work with all of my symptoms and just be a liability? But I have to drive 40 min each way with impaired vision and hearing to get there. Should I just start looking for another job that may be more willing to work with me? Or is at least closer to home? I just don't want to leave. I really love this job.",15May2019,1

710,"Hi everyone,

I’m not the normal type to air my family drama but I need to do it somewhere because I’m literally boxed In to my situation.

I am in a happy, long term loving marriage with ‘G’. Now ‘G’ did something stupid (non-violent internet based crime and no scamming people either) and he’s doing a short spell in prison. He was sentenced last September and has been in since. 

The family drama started the day after he got sentenced.

Now, we lived with his parents who are, ‘I’ (82) and ‘D’ (86). We were their carers and help them with everything from the minute they wake up until they go to bed. My husband ‘G’ would also care for me as I have Relapsing and Remittent Multiple Sclerosis. But since he went to prison all 3 of us have been looking after each other with the help of one of their daughters and my sister in law ‘M’.

On the Saturday Morning, the day after his sentence, you can imagine I was an emotional wreck. I didn’t want to see or speak to anyone. But at about 11am there was a knock on the door. It was the police, they had come to check I was ok and give me an update on a Rape and Domestic abuse case that has been going through the police and court system for 6 years. Not the greatest time for that update but none the less there they were. 

I was sat on the sofa talking to the Detective Constable and there is a knock at the door. It is my husbands eldest sister ‘Do’, and two of his nieces ‘L’ and ‘K’. 

My mother in law went to answer the door while I carried on talking to the Police and we could hear raised voices. So one of the officers went out to see what was going on. It was when he opened the door to the front room that the 3 of them pushed past my mother in law, straight into the living room screaming at me to get my stuff packed and get the F**k out of the house. My MIL was screaming and crying at them that I wasn’t going anywhere and to leave us alone. That is when one of them hit me where it hurts, ‘K’ made a comment about my husband and said I was causing trouble online. Now I was out cold from the moment we arrived back to the house from court till the minute the police arrived. I had not been online at all. 

They had taken comments I had made about MY family, who I have a terrible relationship with on account of my dad being a pedophile. They had been attending my doctors, solicitor and friends addresses in an attempt to find my address. They took these comments as being about them. Now if any of these family members ‘Do’, ‘L’ or ‘K’ ever took 2 seconds to ever get to know me or even have a conversation with me then they would know the comment wasn’t about them. 

‘K’ in front of the police officers got into my face screaming at me saying I was bad mouthing her family. I screamed at her it was about MY family and she screamed saying it’s my family blah blah blah. She made another comment about my husband and threatened to punch me in front of the officers. I flew at her and I literally got tackled to the sofa by the male police officer while the female one took the others outside with my MIL and told them that if they came back and caused any trouble they would get arrested. They came back in, finished their conversation with me and left. At that point I shut down all social media and went offline completely. 

We carried on together me, ‘I’, ‘D’ and ‘M’. Looking after each other. Supporting and counselling each other through our upset and grief. We had a good routine going and we got back into daily life about 3 months later. 

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK @ 11pm

I went to the door where there were two officers in full uniform asking for me. I said yes I am ‘B’. They proceeded to request to come into the home as they needed to check on the welfare of ‘I’ and ‘D’ as they had a report I was holding them against their will, I was spending their money and they weren’t allowed to socialise with family. In a state of complete shock at what I had just been accused of I said here I’ll stand at the door you go in and find them yourself. They walked in to find ‘D’ sat in the front room with ‘I’, their granddaughter ‘J’, son ‘Ia’ and Daughter in law ‘S’. They spoke to them and said we had a call from ‘K’ who is worried about your wellbeing etc etc. They told the police where to go, ‘I’ phoned ‘K’ and told her to stop playing stupid games and sending police to the door. 

January 8th comes around. At this point I had found out I was expecting in April 2019 and over the moon. ‘I’ and ‘D’ went with their daughter ‘M’ and her husband to Blackpool for a week. They do it every year and I have the house to myself for a week. It was the first time I had been alone since ‘G’ went to prison and expecting our first child, which was a miracle as I have fertility problems, that week was very emotional for me. 

January 10th @ 4pm. I can hear sirens coming down the road, I live in a bad area so it isn’t uncommon. But seconds later I heard what sounded like someone trying to take the door in. I jump up and run to open the door not knowing what was going on and there was 5 police officers with ‘The Big Red Key’ and an ambulance. They asked me my name and I told them and they bundled me inside. Terrified at what was happening. This was the basics of the conversation.

At 9am someone called them saying they were me and that I was going to kill myself. That sent out police looking in local woods. At 10pm someone rang and said I had taken a load of pills and I wanted to die and take my baby with me. That triggered a helicopter search. 12pm fake me called back and said that the tablets hadn’t worked I was going to drown myself in The sewerage drains. That led the police to the woodlands out the back of my house. No one called back after that but the police were on an all out search, 30 officers searching the woods. Then one officer said, has anyone checked her home yet. Oh wait no we haven’t, so they came bounding around the corner, didn’t need to knock because they were pretty certain I had killed myself. So they started to beat down the door, so when I opened the door and confirmed who I was they told me I had some explaining to do. Now I was as confused as shit. I had no idea anything like this had been happening. I had been sat in my recliner watching bargain hunt. They got the officer to ring the number that the calls had come from and a male answered the phone. It turned out to be the husband of ‘K’ who was training to be a police officer himself. The police asked for his address and they went around. ‘K’ explained that she was concerned for my wellbeing at being in the home alone and she knows I have mental problems (EUPD, Depression, Anxiety and (C)PTSD secondary to an abusive childhood) and that she thought that I would kill myself. Well ok then ‘K’, that doesn’t explain you making the police do a man hunt. She got told off and told that if she does anything like it again she will get in trouble. 


April 19th 2019, my beautiful daughter was born sleeping. I was patiently waiting for a transfer to a different hospital due to my disabilities. Contractions 10 minutes apart. ‘I’ and ‘M’ were on their way to get some last bit and meeting me at the other hospital. Then the worst thing happened. I was sleeping and woke up feeling like someone had stabbed it. It was my first thought, I thought some maniac had broken into the transfer lounge and stabbed me. I looked down and I was gushing blood. I was the furthest point away from the maternity suite waiting to the ambulance transfer so it took about 11 minutes to get me up to the maternity wing, another 7 minutes to get me into the theatre, 3 minutes to knock me out and a further 4 minutes to get my daughter out. She was gone, the umbilical cord ruptured and she suffocated. And I went through it alone. The hospital was ringing and ringing and ringing my emergency contact that on my maternity notes was ‘M’ and couldn’t get an answer, 3 hours later ‘M’ and ‘I’ turned up not knowing what had happened they were just told to head back to where I was before. Turned out they were ringing my husband. Well they won’t get an answer from his mobile will they.... 
As I was laid there in shock, empty, broken. My husband didn’t even know, I saw a message pop up on ‘I’ phone. “Well that’s convenient was she even pregnant!” I just ignored it as I had more pressing things. The next two weeks were a blur but that message always sat in my head and I didn’t know who sent it, I didn’t catch the name. 

Things settled and then yesterday well yesterday a sh*t show happened. 

‘K’ rang ‘I’ and said nana I’ll pop around later for a cuppa. All was well, I stay in my room when she visits. ‘I’ and ‘D’ go into town with ‘M’ to put money in the bank for gas and electric bill. I’m elbows deep in a mega clean of my room. Clear room, clear mind an all that jazz. 

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

Oh for fuck sake.

I open the door, 2 police officers. Hi, we are looking for ‘I’ and ‘D’ are they here. I tell them they are up town and could I help. They asked if they could come in and check if they were in the house. I said of course and they looked in every room. I say I’ll call them and get them back, they are only a few minutes away. So they wait. While we wait I said look if this is something that is going to upset them I need to know as they struggle with depression. And they said oh don’t worry no one is in trouble but we’ve had a call we need to have a chat with them about. They arrived back and they asked ‘M’ who she was by saying are you her friend. She said yeah but I’m their daughter what’s going on. And they asked us to stay out of the way so they could have a chat. 

5 minutes pass... 

The police leave and ‘I’ and ‘D’ are sitting there stunned. ‘K’ had rang and told the police that I was PHYSICALLY holding them against their will. They have zero mental capacity and I take advantage of that. They don’t want me to be here and I won’t leave. I bring trouble and drugs to the house. They don’t know what is good for them and I’m a crazy person because I have a personality disorder and she was scared for their safety. They told the police it was ridiculous they wanted me here and we all help each other. Police apologised to them and explained they had to check. 

Well, I have never heard ‘I’ as irate as he was when she picked up the phone to ‘K’ and told her to leave us alone etc etc. I get told to ignore it and not let it bother me. 

Well this is where I need advice. I don’t have a great relationship with my family. I have no experience to know how I should handle this situation. 

Here are the current options I can think of but I’m willing to have suggestions. 

1: Ignore it and move on.
2: Go to a solicitor and get an injunction to stop ‘K’ from contacting me. 
3: Contact the police and report harassment. She is causing so much upset and distress in this home.

The problem I have is I am not happy with option 1. ‘I’ and ‘D’ aren’t happy with option 2 or 3 because they just don’t want any more stress. 
But what if this isn’t the end. At what point do I say enough is enough? ‘L’ who came to the house the morning after court will stand outside her house, not doing or saying anything just watching me the whole time I’m out walking to the shops. It’s intimidating and I’m not a fighter, I’m a drop my shopping and run type of girl. Unless someone says something about my husband I won’t get aggressive. So i don’t know what to do and I’m seriously depressed, Low, lonely, afraid. What do I do! Please please help.

713,"Im 21 and my bf is 8 months younger. We basically fell in love at first sight when we first met. He got together in summer but due to many issues, I broke up with him in late november and got together on new years.
He fixed some issues a bit, when we first hung out as friends before getting together and after we had goteen together he never offered to pay for my coffee drink or anything. I wondered if he liked me because every guy who had ever liked me would offer to pay. The biggest issue was when he invited me to a concert but didn't buy the ticket. I felt like crap that he treated me that way because it wasn't a concert who was of an artist I would really care to even see. He's changed but is still very immature.
I understand he doesn't know what he wants to do in life but he doesn't really take initiative to do anything except work at his restaurant job that doesn't even pay much (about $10), he isn't going to school not even a trade school or work at a job or company that he can move up in to make a potential career. I know me and him are still young but I can't help but worry about a future with him. I went to school, have a 3.8 gpa, don't get any financial aid and its 5k a semester so saving money while paying my car off and not taking out student loans isn't easy. 
Here's some irresponsible ideas or things he done
- he doesn't save his money and spends it on a lot of unimportant things
-told me he didn't buy my concert ticket because he was trying to pay off his credit card balance (why even invite me to a concert then?)
-he had spent a lot of money on yezzy shoes, supreme and I don't think has done that since this 2nd time in our relationship but it seems immature if hes still living with his mom and buying supreme 🙄
-we live in TX where the summers are in the 100°s usually, his car's ac is starting not to really work and it broke down like twice. He was considering holding off on getting a car that works because he wanted to take the little money he has been saving to go see a museum in amsterdam?! When it broke down the mechanic even said several months back that his car was going to last a couple of months before it's completely unusable

He is just very unrealistic and irresponsible. I even talk to him about these things and usually it goes out the other ear. He is considering to get another car and not do a amsterdam vacation because it's getting very hot now and he finally had some common sense to realize it's quite unbearable to not have any ac in his car and it could potentially break down for good soon.
The weirder things is the things he had done in the past, people at our work assumed he was gay because he can play around or make sexual jokes with his gay best friend and my sister and brother in law and other coworkers thought he was gay or bisexual. He is definitely not gay but just very wild. He like vaginal-penis sex but had a phase where he had kissed some of his guy friends back in high school just to get free mcdonalds?! Hes done various weird things in his past like moon his friends, go streaking, and he has a youtube channel so today he was filming and took his sister's clothes. He sent me a pic of him in I guess an old should top or dress (only showed the top). I just wonder how I should even feel seeing my boyfriend dressed in girl clothes. Like I get he's just being crazy like usual, thinks its funny but I am very different and more mature. We are basically like day and night. 
He have some common interest like visiting new coffee shops, going new places like cities (obviously can't travel to another country because he don't make much money) but he is a genuinely nice person who is there for me. I just go through times where he over does his actions and I am not sure how to feel. I just want to know what other people think of this. I have talked to various friends who know him and see if I'm not just overthinking and they agree he is out of line. I want to be in our relationship but how should I handle it? I don't know how.",15May2019,1
714,"I feel trapped and idk what to do. I’ve been living home for 8 months after dropping out of college. I moved home because I was dead broke so my plan was to get a job. After four months, I still hadn’t gotten one (I’m naturally lazy and slightly depressed aka lacking motivation). 

Finally, I got productive and got an interview. I psyched myself out and skipped the interview. I set up another interview. Psyched myself out and skipped it. at this point, I’m afraid my parents are horribly disappointed in me, so for some reason I tell the lie that I got the job.

And now, for 3 months, I’ve been leaving the house 3-4 days a week and “going to my job”. I don’t have a car so I just wander around my suburban town for 8 hours, and then come home and pretend I was working. 

Like I said, I feel trapped and idk what to do. I anticipate a lot of you will comment to just tell the truth, but I think that would just hurt everyone involved. This is such a big, long standing lie that my family might not trust me for years afterwords. Maybe I’m just a bad person, but if there’s a way out of this that doesn’t involve telling the truth, I think that would be better for everyone involved. Is there any realistic way for me to “get fired”? I feel like quitting wouldn’t make sense because I need the money. I feel like my best bet is to get another job, but that could take weeks.

715,"I am 17 years old and I'll have my first sex. The thing is, my parents don't know about this (and for obvious reasons, we don't intend to tell it to them). We planned almost everything, how she'll come to my house secretly, how I'll buy condoms from a place that my parents don't visit, where I'll hide these condoms etc. 

She is a virgin and her hymen will probably break, meaning that there will be blood. Even though she didn't tell me, she said that she'll handle it and that we won't have any problem about blood. However, we guess that there will be sexual fluids coming out, it might not be a problem for me since I will be wearing a condom but we don't know what to do about her sexual fluids. We can't just do it on my bed and then change the sheets, because my mum organises how frequent sheets change, and she herself puts them into the washing machine. I first came up with the idea of using a rubbish bag as a surface on the bed but we figured it would be way too noisy and uncomfortable. I, then, thought using t-shirts as a surface and then throwing them to the washing machine, as if they were a part of my usual dirty laundry. But, we don't know whether the sexual fluids that will come out can be washed easily, if they leave a stain, then we're basically busted.

So my questions are these: 

\-Do sexual fluids (every fluid that comes out during sex) get washed easily from clothes and not leave stains?

\-Do you have any idea on what else we can do about the matter?",15May2019,0

When I got out of HS in 2013, I was sure that I wanted to be a teacher. I ended up doing an internship and absolutely hating it. Then my dad said what is something you're interested in when you were a child, and I told him fossils, rocks, earth. Anything related to that. BOOM! I found out that my uncle was a Geologist, how fucking cool. I took every geology class in community college and fell in love. Now im stuck, right? No money, no financial aid. My community college had a shorter and cheaper program for teaching. I thought maybe because I was so young then I just didnt like it. So i decided to give it another chance with another internship for teaching. Still fucking hate it.

I got a job at a pizza place because that was my first job when I turned 16, I quit today because I feel so degraded.

My husband is a chef, and loves what he does. He has no college experience, nothing. He's happy where he is. I feel like I am just falling behind. 

I cannot figure out what I want to do.

I want to work from home because this is my safe place and I feel comfortable. Every time I look for ""at-home jobs"" its practically impossible. I'm trying. I'm failing. I'm falling, I don't know if i can get up at this point.

I have another meeting tomorrow with my nursing school director and campus president. I am terrified I am going to be kicked out. They know about the ectopic and miscarriage. How do I explain this to them? My grades are excellent...it’s just the attendance they have an issue with. I didn’t miss anything for a few weeks until Tuesday when I physically could not get out of my bed.",15May2019,1

720,"So I recently started therapy but I don’t really like my therapist. My mom sits in one the sessions despite me being 18. We’ve only had a few sessions, for the first one she (the therapist) said it was different from normal sessions and was just to set up some goals so I figured maybe she’d ask I wanted her there the next time but she never did. I forgot to ask the last few appointments but I plan to ask at my next one. I know I might be over dramatic but I don’t like that she never once asked if I was comfortable having her there, my mom says “maybe she just assumed” but I also feel like a therapist should never make assumptions like that, especially with a new client. She’s not a family therapist as far as I know and I don’t think it’s appropriate for others to be in an individuals, especially an adults, therapy session. She also seems disbelieving when I bring up worries about issues I may have. For example, when i brought of the possibility of me having PTSD she seemed to kind of not believe me (I was later diagnosed with it and given meds for it by someone else). She also doesn’t seem to understand what I mean most of the time. I’ll repeat something in different ways trying to explain what I mean but she can’t seem to understand.

So I'm getting straight to the point here. I am a 21 year old woman and lately I have been struggling with my femininity (I don't even know if that's a word, English isn't my native tongue). I do want to be feminine, but every time I dress up nice and do my hair and nails it just feels like I'm a dude trying to be feminine. It just feels really uncomfortable for me to wear feminine clothes. 

I think it also doesn't really help that all my friends are dudes and that they see me as one of the ""bro's"". I've ways been a bit of a tomboy. I'm scared that my lack of feminine vibes might jeopardize my dating life.

TL;DR at bottom

I’ve been working at a retail place for a few years now and we just had a new guy start a few weeks ago. Right from the day the dude came in for the interview I wasn’t a fan. So far my opinion has not changed and I wanted to know if I’m just being over critical.  He’s a total brown-noser and has severe FOMO. Leave the guy alone for 5 minutes and he’s looking for someone to stand with or talk to. He gives random compliments to the supervisor, but no one else. Already taking breaks throughout the day while the rest of us work. At the interview he made it seem like he knew all about retail and sales but that is not how he acts now. 
I know most of us are nervous and act weird when starting a new job so I’m trying to not be too hard on the guy but he’s making it difficult. Am I being overly critical?

736,"So my parents and I are going to be moving to a different state, across the country. The plan was originally for us to move in the summer right after I graduate high school (I graduate in 2020, so next school year), but a few things are changing for us and I’m kind of starting to like the idea of leaving this summer. My parents said they want to do what’s best for me, and if I’d rather stay then they’d agree to it. They like to have my input in a lot of big decisions they make, which I appreciate a lot, but at the same time it does stress me out a little. I know they want to move as soon as they can, so that’s definitely a big consideration. 

So the biggest change in my life right now is that my 20 year old sister just died in a car accident a week and a half ago. It’s been rough for us, as you can imagine. My sister was the only one in the family who wanted to stay in the state we live in now. My parents and I don’t like it here, we don’t have very fond memories of this place, and this happening has especially made us want to leave to get a fresh start in a new place. 

Secondly, we’re already in the process of listing our house for sale. The original plan was to sell this house and rent an apartment in my town so I can finish high school at my current school, but that would change if we moved. 

Like I said, I’m starting to like the idea of moving this summer, but there’s a couple things holding me back from saying yes for sure. First of all, and most importantly for me, I’d be moving to a new school in a state thousands of miles from where I am now. I’m not very good at making friends, but I think part of that is because I’ve lived in my current town since fifth grade, and a lot of people from school have seen me during some of my most embarrassing phases (middle school lmao). I’m definitely a lot better at socializing with complete strangers who’ve never known me than acquaintances at school. I’m a lot more confident in myself (and less weird) than I was before, so I think I have a better shot at making friends. Not to mention, I live in a state known for having some of the most rude people, and the stereotypes are true, sadly. I have a small group of friends here, but I’m not very emotionally attached to them, and I’m starting to think they’re getting sick of me. 

My second big reason for not wanting to move is because I feel like moving senior year wouldn’t be the “new start” I’m looking for. I know it sounds corny and kind of stupid, but I’ve never liked school and I’m not sure how much I’ll enjoy it in a new state. What if I completely hate the last year of school? I’m probably not moving to a new state again, at least not for a while, so I feel like I’d be going right back to how I feel here now: lost, trapped, hating this place. I think I might be making this part a bigger deal than what it is, but I don’t know for sure. 

My third and final reason for wanting to stay isn’t as big to me as the other two, but it’s a reason nonetheless. I still have more I want to see in this region of the country. The place I’ll be moving to is totally different from where I am now. The biggest thing is probably the ocean. I love the beach and the ocean, and where I’m moving is a completely landlocked state. And plus everything just has a different feeling to it, I don’t know. Like I said though, this isn’t really a huge reason, I mainly see it as a pro if we stay. 

With all that being said, what should I do? I’d like to hear other opinions, because I’m completely on the fence about this. I’m not very emotionally attached to my current area, but I feel like it might do us some good if we stay. Sorry for the long post, I appreciate everyone who read the whole thing though! Thanks.",15May2019,1
737,"So I’m worried about my friend but I don’t know how to approach the situation 

So here’s what happened: 

So today at school she was rather quiet and didn’t talk to us at all, she was busy doing something on her phone, we tried talking to her to start up a conversation but she ignored us except for like 2 times, my friend even remarked that she probably developed a skill of being unable to know we were right there due to how she failed to acknowledge anything we said 

Out of curiosity, I try to take a peek at what she is doing on her phone (not really the best thing for me to do, but I’ll explain later) but don’t see much except for the fact that she’s on Snapchat

Now side note as to why I was incredibly curious, so she doesn’t like telling us much about herself other than the very basics, she doesn’t really like it when we ask her some stuff, and the times when she does tell us something, it’s usually rather interesting or just rather wild, and it makes you get curious because how did somebody who was pretty much a loner and doesn’t talk to anybody (before she started hanging out with us) turn out to be somebody who does crazy shit and has friends, now I know it sounds rather rude to be surprised she had friends prior to meeting us but it’s due to the fact that she doesn’t talk to anybody in her classes, she doesn’t try that much to make friends, and used to sit alone in an obscure area of the school 

Back to the story, so I see sort of like those pop up things for Snapchat on the app, so I assume she’s probably saving or deleting messages, so I ask what she’s doing, she doesn’t respond and I quickly go “nevermind, you don’t have to answer” as I didn’t want her to think I was trying to invade her privacy, ask more about her, or something along those lines 

I lose interest in talking to anybody so I start using my phone (and yes, it was Reddit I was browsing), suddenly I get the “(insert her name here) is typing...” and I get intrigued as we never message each other when within speaking distance unless it’s something we don’t want others to overhear, so I open up Snapchat and see she isn’t typing, I find it odd and stay on to see if she will say anything, nope

I exit out of Snapchat but then remembered how she was probably deleting messages so I decide to open up Snapchat again and yep, sure enough she was deleting her messages, now this is rather odd as she never deletes messages unless she regrets them, which was once, and she was deleting messages she saved in our chat, she deleted everything since today up until our first convo which was 1-2 months ago

Out of concern, I ask her if there’s anything wrong, she shakes her head to say no, which also makes me thing something isn’t as she would talk when answering stuff and the times when she didn’t verbally answer, she was looking at you, she didn’t even look up or anything, I ask her if it’s that I’m bothering her and that if she wants I can just leave her alone 

Small side note: reason I asked if it’s cuz I’m bothering her is because I have a tendency of being considered incredibly annoying and it’s probably the only thing I can ask her as to why she wasn’t happy without stepping into the “trying to know her outside of school life” territory 

I leave and once school ends, I’m checking the group chat to see if she also deleted all of her messages from there as the group chat contains a metric fuck load of messages dating back as February of this year, and yep she deleted all of her messages from there as well 

Small side notes: 

- I’ve been talking with my best friend about this and he’s also weirded out by this as it’s out of my friend”: behavior 

- She has depression and anxiety supposedly, again she doesn’t really like to elaborate on this stuff so I can’t say for sure if she’s on anything to help her with it or what 

- She apparently attempted suicide before, again she didn’t want to elaborate on it so all I have to work on was that she tried before 

I sent a message to her saying that if she needs somebody to talk to that she can talk to my best friend and I and asked her not to do anything stupid she might regret, she hasn’t opened my message and appears to be inactive, I’m just hoping nothing has happened",15May2019,1
738,"     I’ve been dealing with this person for quite some time now and I’d like just to have him stop. This person is in a discord server for a game, he has no roles like moderator but he is unavoidable if you want to chat with other people as he is always on the server. I’d personally classify him as being needy for attention and that he seeks validation from other people.

    This person is always blunt and rude, he does not care if he makes you upset, he verbally communicates to you that he does not care whatsoever about what you think and that he will give his opinion even when it’s asked for that he doesn’t.
    He doesn’t cuss when describing something but he knows that what he’s saying isn’t kind

    Whenever he is accused of something, like if he’s been saying something rude and the other person doesn’t like it and gets after him, he’ll victimize himself and make it so that the other person did something wrong. If the other person did do something wrong in the past he’ll bring that up and compare it to his situation saying stuff along the lines of the other person not being good and has done a lot of bad things in the past, not talking about whatever he’s done.
     He knows debate tactics as he’s talked about specific debate tactics before.
If I do something wrong that he *could* find the slightest bit offensive (even though the same action is done by others) he’ll go off on me and act rude, essentially over-reacting.

    He’s verbally communicated across that he does not like me even though he acts like he’s never said anything of the sort and that I’m the one trying to start something with him.
He demands respect but will not return it back. Like I said, when I ask for respect he will directly deny it. It’s like a big frustrating loop and I’m absolutely sick of it.

    When I asked to talk directly to him to have a respectful conversation with him to resolve our problems, he denies my request and says I’m not worth his time to talk, making up excuses like he is busy when there is clear indications that he is not busy and is just making up excuses to avoid me. 
    This instance I got fed up him with because he blew my request off as he’s been this constant nuisance, I asked him “are you that incapable of having a civilized discussion with somebody.”
    His response was:

insulting me because i don't want to vc with you?
(3 clap emojis)
civilized discussion amirite
later dude

(And then later he came back and said this):

oh, one last thing. 
you can't debate without almost immediately resorting to insults, and you have the *audacity* to tell me i'm incapable of civilized discussion. what a joke lmao
and if you're like this in text, i sure as hell don't want to now what you're like in voice.

739,"I moved a lot when I was a kid. My parents currently live in a small town in the Midwest. I never really had many friends growing up and it felt hard to break into these cliques that were formed long before I came in. I barely hung out with the same handful of people in high school (I think I hung out maybe once every six weeks?) and I was certainly never invited to any parties.

Fast forward to college. I leave the place entirely and go to college on the East Coast. I suddenly meet a lot of new people and make a lot of new friends because everyone is kinda lost and meeting new people. I become a lot more social, overcome my social anxiety, and discover that I'm actually an extrovert. I love talking to new people and meeting new people.

The last two summers, I had concrete summer plans and didn't stay in town all that long. This summer, it looks like my internship plans will probably fall through. I'm currently ""home"" right now and I have no idea what to do socially. I'm working on projects of mine that are important and will propel me in my career, but I have basically no social life. When I did stay in town before, it was extremely hard to connect with people and most people moved on with their lives.

Over the course of the year, M showed me that not only was she a much worse person than I thought she was, but she also had been talking shit about me to our other roommates. Important to note here that she had been talking shit to me about said roommates our whole junior year (they lived together then, I replaced their fourth the second year). I was a dumbass who thought M just didn’t like them and didn’t realize she was just that type of person. The whole of senior year was basically M bullying me by trying to control me, constantly correcting me, treating me like I was stupid, and randomly accusing me of things like lying and talking behind her back (probably due to her own guilty conscience). 

Here’s my issue. M knows A LOT about me, including the fact that I am bisexual and not out to my family. M also lives in my very small home county, and is well liked because she’s great at putting up a front with acquaintances. I’m afraid that if she’s feeling petty and vindictive enough, she’ll lash out at me in some way. I’ve seen her do it before, create awful situations in which she is the victim. 

If I were to block M online and cut her off completely, I would be getting peace of mind as well as a little vindication. If I don’t, she’ll constantly contact me and try to talk to me like we’re friends, which is shitty because every time she’s around I can feel myself get extremely anxious, mad, and feel like I can’t tell M no or be upset with her without being punished in some way.

Hi all,

A few years back I started posting naked pictures of my junk and face online. I am a male by the way. I was not getting the attention I wanted from women sexually, and I had been curious about guys (I identify as straight, with curious tendencies) and decided to start posting nude selfies and sexual things online. I deleted them after a bit but a few got on to other site. I have been able to  delete most of the pictures of myself and hope to get the rest deleted ASAP, since I have found a few more. But when I search my old usernames other pictures show up. Now my full name is not attached to any of these, but someone posted my first name on some pictures back in the day so I know no one can search for my pics by   
 full name, but I hate myself for what I did and worry every day they could ruin my career. They are hard to find unless you know the usernames I posted under and I am going to try and get them removed from as many of the sites as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I worry that these could end me? I can’t get over this stupid, stupid decision I’ve made in the past. I get that we all make mistakes, but I can’t forgive or forget this one of mine since others have reposted these images(mostly on random sites that no one probably goes on, but still). 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently had someone I used to talk (2 years ago...) to on an app find an old texting app username of mine that I never gave out and I am worried about what he may do. He just messaged me saying hey but I didnt open it. It can sort of give away my full name though, and I feel like he may know me personally. I wanted to delete the account but that may give it away...

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry for the wall of text but I need help here on what to do. I am going to reach out to google to help me make the pics harder to find(they remove them from their search engine, but any other advice will help too.

When I get home from work I try and motivate myself to do more chores around the house, but I end up succumbing to laziness and doing barely anything at all. Laundry for example just piles higher and higher and I resort to washing just what I need for the week or the next day. 
Friends message me to hang out but I often create excuses to not do anything but lay in bed and binge YouTube. Weekends are the worst because I mostly stay in bed and feel sorry for myself.

753,"I quit a call center that I enjoyed but the workflow was becoming crazy to a point where after two years I just decided to leave and afterwards experienced trying to save someone with CPR from a suicide they attempted and succeeded in. He was my mothers fiancee and was in a bad place and I've had a hard time adjusting. I don't have health insurance and regret leaving the old job cause I could use it now more than ever. I decided to go back into working in a kitchen with a knee injury and it's now been a month and can't seem to stand it, something I used to love is now too physically demanding and with my mental health I just don't even care for most of it.

754,"So a co worker recently would ask to use my phone to call his girlfriend or Mom, how ever it turns out he would look through my personal photos/ videos. Most recently it came to my knowledge that he would actually find videos of me and my boyfriend (intimate adult videos) and would send them to his own number... he would then delete the texts and I guess he assumed I would not find out, and I never would have if it wasn’t for the Apple Watch keeping all history. I had noticed that my videos were being sent to an unknown number and I decided to reverse search the number and his girlfriend matched as a possible match. I immediately messaged her asking if it was her number and she replied with “no it’s my boyfriends” I then told her what was happening and that he had done this multiple times within the last few months. She confronted him and he immediately admitted to everything. I had to make a case at work yesterday and describe everything that happened. Today I went into work and I noticed that people were removing things from his desk and the surrounding area I was informed that my place of employment has “taken care of it on their end” however I’m not sure what that means. I truly hope he was fired, I feel so strange knowing that someone did that. 

I have multiple questions... 
Do you think he was fired?

Last week she texted me asking if we could talk. We aired out all the problems we had with each other and how it was.lack of communication that ended our friendship. Then we met up and talked and it was like old times. Just catching up. She asked if we could be friends again and I said yes. 

The last couple years I went through a transformation and I am in a good place whereas before I was angry all the time. The thing is I don't know her well enough to see of she has too.  I am scared that if I let her on my life it will cause me stress and heartache. 
I haven't had much friends the past two years and I think a part of me wants to reconnect because of the fun times but also because I am a bit lonely. 

How do I keep her at arms length without seeming like I am blowing her off, until I can trust her again? But at the same time I don't know how to not keep my hopes up. How do I make it clear that I want to take our friendship slowly?",15May2019,1

761,"My sister found out this morning that her ex husband shot himself and is struggling with how she should approach telling their daughter. 

A little background info: My sister got pregnant with my niece about 10 years ago while she was a senior in high school. Her and the dad (Ill call him Jay) got married shortly after. It was a good beginning, they moved in with my mom and I for a few years, so Jay can go to college and start a career to provide for the family. It was good in the beginning for a couple of years but turned sour quick. I could tell that they definitely got married for the wrong reasons and it wasnt working out. They finally got divorced when my niece was about 5-6 years old. Jay made it an ugly and hurtful process for both my sister and niece. My sister got custody of my niece but with Jay having visitation rights to see her. 

At first he was never physically hurtful towards my niece, but slowly became more and more emotionally abusive over the years. At times my niece would tell us that she would get in trouble for doing something wrong while over at Jays house and then would get told that she is a screw up and doesnt deserve to be loved and no one is going to love someone like her. Mind you, she is only about 7-9 years old at this time. 

This type of stuff had a profound effect on my niece. You could tell she was becoming more and more quiet, reserved, and not quite herself. My sister got child services and the court involved and tried to tell them about the emotional abuse that was happening when my niece would go over to Jays house every week. Nothing came of it as it turned into a ""he said she said"" type deal. 

My niece was started seeing a counselor during this time as she was having a hard time with her dad (Jay), school, and not having any friends. Sh. Also was diagnosed with alopecia during this ordeal, being around 7-8 years old at the time. (She has beautiful long blonde hair.) It took a huge toll on her as her hair started falling out due to the alopecia. Only slightly at first, definitely manageable, but got started getting worse and worse. It ended up with her having a pretty significant large bald spot on the top of her head. We tried doing different hair styles, using bandanas to cover it for school, but she said all the kids still made fun of her.. She told us she didnt have any friends at school and didnt like it there. It broke my heart. :(

During this time my sister met a new guy (no kids), they dated for a while and they eventually got married last summer. He has provided a good stable environment for my sister and niece. I am thankful for him. 

Jay also got remarried to a woman who had young kids from another marriage. 

My sister, her new husband, and my niece decided that it would be best to have a fresh new start by moving out of state. My sisters new husband got a great job and they thought it would be a great new life start for my niece. 
They've only been there for a short time (a few months maybe) so my niece is still trying to adjust. 

A week or so ago my sister received some dark news about Jay. Jays wife found out that he had molested her daughter and did some pretty awful things with her (even while my niece was there too). She contacted the police and child services and went from there. I dont know all the details right but it sounded like he was going to be going to jail. I dont know why he wasnt arrested yet, but thats not what i want this to be focused on, at all!

My sister got a call this morning from Jay's wife and she told her that he shot and killed himself..

My heart is broken for my niece. Her birthday is tomorrow and she has to find out her Dad is dead. All while struggling with a new home, trying to find new friends, and her alopecia.

My sister doesnt know how to approach telling her. She has been trying to reach out to find counselors to help, but can't put it off forever. With my niece only being 9 years old, what would be an appropriate way to tell her? I want my sister to just say that he passed away. I feel like she is too young to find out he committed suicide, shot himself and took his own life. 

I feel like there absolutely be a time in a few years that she should know more.. But as of right now I think she should just be told that he passed away.

I am sorry for the long novel, but I appreciate any advise or feedback that anyone has. 

Also, I'm not sure if this is against the rules or not, but even if a few people have any time to write my niece a birthday card for her tomorrow. I know it would mean the world to her to know she has friends that care for her as she doesnt have a lot of friends right now. DM me and If you can.",15May2019,123

The options I have are:  

1) Double with an attached bathroom- the main issue with these are that they’re the smallest rooms on campus- they were built in the 1950s to be singles and now have two beds shoved in together 

2) Double with a community bathroom- I’m not a fan of the thought of a community bathroom, but the room itself is bigger than the double with a single bathroom. 

3) Single with a community bathroom- I wouldn’t have to rush into finding a roommate and I could live by myself as I wanted to before, but it’s $400 more a semester than the other two, which might not be worth the money.

768,"Sorry for the long post i'm sleep deprived and an emotional mess at the moment! Baisically i want advice on whether I'm expecting too much from my husband or whether should I be ending our marriage? 

My husband and myself have been together for eight years got married last year and have a five month old baby girl. When I got pregnant he wasn't particularly enthusiastic but never outright said he didn't want the baby, we'd discussed kids many times in the past and he's always said he wanted them. 

He's quite immature and selfish which I don't think he'd disagree with. He works hard, spends his free time playing the playstation and doing sport, all the housework and cooking has always been left to me. 

Since having our baby I'm feeling really overwhelmed, I thought he'd step up and help around the house and with the baby, obviously not as much as me as I'm on maternity leave but at least a little so I can have a couple of hours a week to catch up on sleep and shower etc. This hasn't happened, he doesn't change nappies, he rarely plays with her, he never puts her to bed or helps in any other way with her. Of I ask him to look after her whilst I cook he will play the PlayStation with her on her mat and if she gets upset I will usually have to come and get her and hold her whilst cooking. He has outright said he doesn't want her on several occassions and resents her being born.

He also hasn't helped anymore with the house. I spend all my time looking after the baby(who doesn't nap in the day for more than 20 mins and wakes every couple of hours at night) when she does sit quietly for a few minutes I'm tearing around the house trying to tidy/clean etc. I still cook all the meals even though I rarely have time to properly eat them. He still has almost all of his free time including training one full evening, an hour a night to go running and all day on a sunday to pkay his sport but continues to complain about the impact of her on his life. 

I love my husband and I imagined we'd spend our lives together but it's so draining doing everything in raising our beautiful daughter and maintaining the house whilst the only help he gives is financial. I feel so sorry for my little girl that he doesn't love her as much as she deserves because she is honestly the most gorgeous little thing, she's always smiling and even though she takes up a lot of time she clearly loves us both. 

I've tried to discuss this with him several times and it always ends up with arguing he is incapable of putting himself in others shoes and just says well you wanted to keep her and suggests I ask my grandparents or mum to look after her so I can get stuff done. 

I don't know whether the best thing to do would to call an end to our marriage and raise my baby girl alone or try and keep going hoping that as she gets older he'll take more of an interest and help me out a bit. I'm at breaking point and I just don't know what to do, all options seem to be bad for me.",15May2019,1

no relevant experience, haven't work a job since i quit my retail job a year ago. Still live with parents.

Aside from this one classmate who I bonded with this semester, people I can call ""friends"" is non-existent.

only bright thing going for me is a small business side hobby I run that is sustaining me ( mainly food I buy outside on occasion). I also use the school gym to do weight training as far as exercise goes.

So, since there are so few of us guys here I immediately befriended this dude and we became quite close friends. We watch anime together and a bunch of shows too like GoT. We were pretty close until one of my girl friends came out as bi. I was actually quite happy cause she's really cool and I love treating her like a ""bro"" and setting her up with other girls, but once, during a truth or dare segment, my friend basically found out that she's bi and he immediately started acting disgusted. For reference's sake he's Moldavian and she's Romanian. 

Ever since that happened another guy from our class came out as gay and my Moldavian friend has mentioned multiple times that he wants to beat him up for being that way. Not only that, but he talks trash about the girl too who I would consider to be one of my closest friends too and I honestly don't know how to process this info anymore.

791,"I'm graduating from college this month and I'm worried about what will happen if I can't find a job. I've applied to at least 120 jobs online in the past month and a half. I was rejected by about a third of them, 3 of them seemed like scams so I didn't go forward with the interviews and I didn't hear back from the rest of them. I'm not sure what I should do going forward. Competition for jobs in my city (NYC) is fierce so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm a business major with no work experience besides a couple of months working retail. What type of job positions should I be applying for. The HR field seems appealing to me but I've been applying to nothing but HR roles so far and I haven't gotten anywhere. Are there some entry level positions that would be easier for me to land? How did you land your first job out of school?",15May2019,2
792,"using a throwaway and english isn’t my first language so sorry for any spelling mistake.  

I (22M) am a student. 2 years ago i started feeling extremely unwell whenever there wasn’t a direct access to a bathroom. I believe it’s called a panic attack: i can’t think and keep repeating « i don’t feel well » in my head, while it is happening I just want to kill myself to make it stop. But as soon as i have access to one I immediately calm down.  

I don’t know why it happens but i have since developped a phobia for it.  I never feel safe leaving my home (I live alone) and i feel forced to go to the bathroom each time before leaving.  

I end up spending a lot of time on the toilet most days. When i am not at home i constantly feel like i have to go to the bathroom. If it’s to urinate then it’s quick, but whenever i have to defecate i stay 30m to several hours in the bathroom. On my worst day i can go to the bathroom 3-4 time a day and spend 7+ hours there  in total in one day.  

I am also constantly anxious and I think i may be depressive.  

I currently have class to attend but I miss a lot of them. I feel guilty whenever i miss one. I wish i could just go to class normally.  

Currently i spend all of my time alone in my apartment. I keep ordering food and rarely go to supermarket although it’s less than 2 minute away by foot.  

I stopped talking to my friend, i don’t really know why. I was never someone who went to a lot of party, but i used to spend a lot of time on discord or steam, now i don’t open them anymore and i avoid them.  

I also feel like my mood is constantly changing. Sometimes i get motivated and i am able to go out easier or get work done, sometimes i get extremely lazy and can’t get anything done or leave.  

I have also noticed that 1-2 day after going out, i usually get diarrhea which is maybe cause by the stress? I feel like my stomach is « bleeding inside » and feel unwell all day.  

I have already seen a psychiatrist about these problem and he gave me some exercise to reduce stress and some medication. At the beginning they helped a little but not anymore.  
Also i am usually bad at explaining and keep forgetting to say important things to him each session.  

I don’t feel like this problem will ever go away. I want to stop caring about anything and just stay at home. But if i can get through the last few weeks of school without repeating the year i will only have a year left to get my degree which would be nice( although i have no idea how i will be able to do a 6 month internship abroad). I also don’t want to disappoint my parent which are paying for my tuition.  


Sorry if all of this is confusing, i don’t really understand all my problem myself...  

If you have any similar experience or even just advice on how i can handle, fix or reduce the impact of these problem on my life please help me.",15May2019,10

794,"no matter the decision. it could be as trivial as “do you want vanilla or chocolate?” or something totally simple. i can’t pick. i always need someone to pick for me. from large scale things to even the smallest tiny decisions, i can’t make them when others are around. when i’m alone, it’s not really an issue. but when others are around, i always need them to pick for me because i’m scared i’ll pick the wrong one. i don’t know what to do or how to stop it but i just wish i could make a simple decision around my friends. how do i make this better",15May2019,2
795,So I’m in high school but there is this girl I like. I know if i ask her out she’d say yes because I know she likes me too... but the thing is. I have and I am struggling with depression and honestly I’m trying my hardest to cut out all the negative people in my life. I really like her but she’s always down on herself and if we start dating I want to make sure I’m okay too because that’s what I didn’t do in my last relationship. Any Advice?,15May2019,2
796,"Hi all, I'm 32 and it's just dawned on me tonight after another fall (I've slipped and hurt my butt and hips a few times in the past) that I haven't been for any in-depth medical checkups before, just a routine appointment about mental health etc, and I heard that a shock to the body has a risk of starting a cancer growth.

So basically just to put my mind at rest instead of worrying for eternity, can anyone recommend a thought process or series of steps I should take?

Thanks in advance",15May2019,3
797,"So my girlfriend works as an after-school program coordinator for kids in elementary and middle school. Well today, she got an email from the principal of her school that she needed some gift cards ASAP. She then proceeded to text my girlfriend and ask her to buy 3 $100 Google Play gift cards. She promised that she would reimburse my girlfriend $300 plus another $50 for her troubles. We're finally realizing that somebody had probably hacked her principal's email and had her do this. This all happened in the last two hours. What should she do?",15May2019,2
