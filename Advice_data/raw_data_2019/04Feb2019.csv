0,I am in my penultimate year of my undergraduate degree in a very intense stem field at a top university in my country and am on track to get a good job in finance after I graduate and have so far never had any problems with my grades and have always performed well academically.  The problem is I am bored and under-stimulated but have a really insane workload and no longer have any drive to do any of it. I have reached a point where I am really miserable and cannot face being here any longer. It is impossible to take any time out for longer than a year and I really don't want to do that as I started university 2 years late as it is. I am really feeling like I want to drop out but I am worried I am throwing away a bright future although I do trust that I would land on my feet even if I didn't have a degree. ,04Feb2019,1
1,"I went to a family reunion and got to talking about the minimum wage with a few of older guys and was explaining what I believe/ listening to their stories/ arguing my case. All of the sudden this one quiet guy comes over and pushes my chair over and gets on top of me like he is gonna punch me. Im on my back and I didnt want to make this guy to punch me so Im just kinda telling him to chill. Anyways he tells me to shut up and walks off and I didnt see him again. So my question is: what would have been the right thing to do? I really wanted to punch him but i would have ended the conversation and i learned a lot after this incident. Also i dont want the reputation as a guy who throws the first punch. We were being really civil until he walked up. I feel slightly immasculated for being put on my back and not really doing anything about it besides yelling at him when i got up. I feel like i lost some respect from my family elders by not doing more. We were all pretty drunk btw. Or did i do the right thing?

Tl:dr how should i diffuse a potentally violent situation without losing respect?",04Feb2019,1
2,"So, first off I just wanted to say that english isn't my first language so please bear with me...

I'm 15 and I started highschool in september 2018. In my country highschool matters a lot since the very first year if you wanna get into college and I feel like I'm not ready to face this reality. There's 2 main things that have concerned me a lot lately. 

1 - My diet. My weight has fluctuated a lot during my teenagehood. I've gone from binging to eating 400 calories a day to eating normal again and for the last few months i've binged almost every day. I do that bevause i'm stressed out about school. It's like my way of coping i guess. The thing is sometimes, if i have a good day, i'll also end up binging for no reason. I've been gaining weight and i just can't motivate myself enough to diet.

2 - School and my future. This problem is the worst one of the two. I used to be an excellent student, i think. I studied a lot everyday and I also attended music classes and played the piano. I always tried my best, it wasn't hard because it was a routine and i was used to it. That was in 5th and 6th grade. Now i'm in 10th grade (the first year of highschool in my country) and I barely study for tests, half ass homework, stay up until 4 am procrastinating and I don't even attend music or piano classes anymore. I just dont have motivation to do anything. I feel so inferior compared to my classmates who have better grades than me, more hobbies than me, are more attractive than me and also have a better social life. 

I don't know how to get my life together. It sometimes gets so stressful that I cry. Sometimes I wake up before going to school and just want to cry and go back to sleep. I really want to get into college and fullfill my dreams but lack the motivation and drive to do so. Also, I know I don't have depression because I know the symptoms and I've been around people who actually have it. So I would appreciate your advice. If any of you has personal stories of something similar happening to you and how you overcame that phase, I would also love to read those.",04Feb2019,1
3,"My friend recently lost the ability to smoke marijuana, which led him to find another vice. We are both fans of certain surface level anime, but recently he has been subject to a phenomenon I now know is very common in Japanese animation culture. He is beginning to like the animated breasts.

We used to shutter and cringe at the idea of those who were perverse enough to indulge but now he is very depressed and turning. He is not showing up to school, his personality is changing quite drastically as he is seemingly becoming more hysterical. 

Now he constantly consumes media related to these anime girls and it has become a large part of his identity. I’m even getting hints that he’s starting to like the little girls or “lolis”.

If this keeps up, he’s going to become more antisocial and it’s creating a rift in our similarities and connection. I keep warning him but he tells me it’s quite normal. Is it time for me to break away or am I overreacting?",04Feb2019,1
4,"So to point out, I have average thick hands and I realize that my girlfriend has thin long fingers and hands. I don't really have any picture for evidence and this might sound like a dumb question but I just gotta get it off my chest to be honest.

5,So ever since my brother got into high school I’ve just been finding out bad things about the him once I found out he brought a dab pen to the house and told my mom so he won’t fall into the wrong track alongside all his friends today I found him trying to scam someone for $50 he was gonna give them a broken iPhone for $50 my mom found out about that too herself because he kept his account on her phone and later today I caught him stealing candy from a store what should I do about this because if my dad finds out he can possibly have a stroke because of health issues and he would take us all back to the country my parents came from and my life would be ruined I want to find a way me and my mom could make him stop this also he would never agree to stay home all day,04Feb2019,1
6,"At my school, there’s a girl known for playing with the feelings of pretty much every guy. She did it to another friend and he was left pretty distraught and sad. Recently, she’s been ‘targeting’ my guy best friend. It’s gotten pretty excessive and they’re talking and are together quite a bit. I’ve tried telling my concerns to some other friends but they don’t agree with me. They’ve said that I’m just overreacting and I shouldn’t jump to conclusions. But the thing is, she’s played with guys so many other times, so isn’t it reasonable to think she’s going to do it to him? Please tell me your thoughts, thank you.",04Feb2019,1
7,"I'm supposed to have received $100k as inheritance from my deceased grandfather once I turned 21. Despite having turned 21 several months ago my father has refused to hand the money over to me. Currently he has about 95% of that money invested in the stock market from an account that I have no access to but is under my name. My father has shown me the account and proved that it is being invested. To add some context to my father's position, my older siblings all blew their inheritance money except for one which has been very successful. I appreciate my father making more money for me and I understand his concerns but he would always remind me that, “you're not your siblings” when I would compare myself to them and I have been very successful in the company I've worked with for 3 years. Despite this success I'm still working paycheck to paycheck and on top of that I have about $4k in credit card debt which I have calculated I can pay off in a year and a half. I currently live with my girlfriend and we plan on moving out of state in a year which is a very difficult goal to reach with my debt. I don't even want all of the money, despite knowing that it belongs to me, but I do want at least enough to pay off my debt and start saving more money every paycheck. I have asked him to give me enough just to pay off my debt but his response is always, “It's good to have some debt”. I really don't know what to do because my father and I have gotten a lot closer over the past few years but it doesn't make sense to me why he wouldn't give me even 4% of the money to pay off my debts. What do?

8,"I’m 20 M. Just moved into my second house with my best friend (renting) Our last flat was always so messy and we never kept on top of cleaning purely because it was always so messy it seemed like such a task.

9,"Before I start; This is not about making friends. One is almost too much for me. I have 1 close friend and i'm perfectly satisfied with it. He doesn't go to my school. I also have enough acquaintances at school, I meet them on weekends sometimes.

So i'm a pretty social-phobic guy. It's not that i'm choosing to be closed off and mute, it's just that I can't speak when i'm around people because I can't social that well. Anyone who has a friend knows that people mingle well with people who are similar to them. Have you seen many druggies hang out with football players at school? nope but do you see girly girls hanging out with other girlie girls? yes. They take all these selfies and what not. That's a mutual interest. Selfie taking.

Anyways so now you get why I don't have a lot of friends at my school. Also to add, it's an all boy school and sadly for me, it's been said that my school year has the highest % of rough football players in years and I just happen to be in that year. So not a lot of selection for me.

What I need to do is: be able to social with these guys and talk to them. What I mean by that is, if i'm put into a project group with them, I need to be able to SPEAK to them. 

Why? Social people tend to remember things faster. I've had times that i've been super social. Maybe 2-3 times a year. And when It does happen, Boy do I remember shit easily. I'm less tensed and retain info faster.

Any advice? I can't find anything in common with the commoner at my school. They seem to be normies who like football and girls (which isn't a bad thing at all) where as i'm into boys, music, martial arts and dance.",04Feb2019,1

11," I have been extremely overwhelmed with everything in my life lately. I am a student in an accelerated degree program and I often have 5-6 assignments due every week. I also work part time in a job in my field that I need to keep. It seems like every week there are a bunch of other little things that add to my stress and I feel like I am at my breaking point. Sometimes when the little things happen, I snap and get extremely angry at myself or I will cry for hours. Some days I wake up and just feel numb. I wonder what the point of anything is and I find it really hard to concentrate in class. I feel like I am withdrawing from everyone and no longer participate in any social activities. My family offers little support because they don't believe in mental health issues. Does anyone have an advice as to how to survive the semester? I do also keep a very detailed schedule and manage my time pretty well so that's not the issue. Thanks for reading. ",04Feb2019,1
12,"Please guys, Ive never done this before, I am at my lowest and need support.. please be kind.. I need help.

3 years ago a family friend confided in me about his feelings towards me and wished to pursue me outside of our friendship.. he is 9 years my senior which is a first for me. He is 42 yrs old. This man has lived a solo lifestyle his whole life. Never had a relationship and seemily never pursued anybody else. Our friendship was great, never any sexual advances or innuendos. So when he came out with his feelings I thought ( and maybe I was wrong to ) that this could make for a great relationship as I have struggled in the past with partners betrayals and ex GFS hanging around ECT..and the fact he respects me enough to keep it so friendly was very appealing to me.

So our relationship advanced, eventually my 4 year old son at the time and I moved in to his house. He is an alcoholic admitably and a marijuana smoker occasionally... So addiction has been in his life for a long time. He did tell me very early on that he watched porn majority of his life but since being with me he has cut down significantly and quote 'barely' watches it anymore . Okay cool, I believed that. In the past, he has a friend out of state that would send him filthy short vids of girls masturbating themselves or clips of pornos that were sometimes ment to be 'funny"". This was a daily occurrence, sometimes 3 a day and middle of the night so upon waking up it was the first thought in my head so I'd start the day bitter and resentful. Many fights occured because of this . He pretty much said, deal with it I am a bloke and they're funny to me . I shut up as best I could about it , although I felt like my heart broke everytime I'd hear his phone go Bing. This extended into 3 or 4 other friends sending him content like this... He thought it was harmless fun. Nothing was done about it but it has seemed to eased up quite a bit... Not sure what's happened as he refused to tell them to stop . 

and Here comes the major hurt.. ..

I discovered his porn usage never really stopped or got cut back... He was just more discreet with when and where he did it. His whole life it was the first thing he did in the morning in bed. As an alcoholic, he could never really be intimate with me before bedtime as he was too drunk. So I had to change my preference to morning ( which Ive had to get used to )  He works mon to Friday, he is too tired to even look at me in the morning and if we do get intimate it's eyes closed he doesn't move and I do it all anyway . It's quite unfulfilling for me , the alarm going off evey 5 mins in the background helps a lot too.....
 He has told me he NEEDS to ejaculate every day, so I discovered that the days he wasnt interested in me , he would look at porn. Which made me feel like I had to make him ejaculate each morning so he wouldn't watch it . Turns out, that didn't matter, he watched it anyway and even got mad at me for wanting to be intimate every day. I am not a prude, I wouldn't mind so much If it was an occasional thing, it's not. It is almost every single day.. and here is why it hurts so much...he will only search up teenage/young girls pleasuring themselves to the camera, or up close vaginas being played with. He completely cuts out the male and the sex action it is purely about the female. Which makes me feel betrayed and sick inside. He watches it in the toilet, while my son and I are walking around the house , he watches it when I go to work at night and he is looking after my son, he watches it when he sends me out the house to the shops. He watches it in bed while I'm making him a damn coffee . Since I have brought it up a few times when I just can't hold it in anymore and pretend it doesn't bother me ..he has started to delete his internet history, lie to my face when I ask him and know he has done it , his work involves doing call outs to customers sometimes in rich areas and sends his best mate pics of the 'hot' clients to get his friends approval saying such things like 'just serviced this client ' with pic of her to get a dirty response which he will get because his bestie is a complete pig to women and when he comes over ( very often) I either have to leave or listen to the filth he 'jokes""about women and sex and hugely influences my partner to talk the same way. They both know I can hear. Everything is funny to them and I'm constantly being told to 'harden up'. I feel so disrespected. My partner seems to have stopped any sexual efforts towards me. He sits on his phone which he has a major addiction to as well and sometimes won't speak to me and tells me to leave him alone. He takes his phone everywhere with him, and panicks if he can't find it. He goes to 'the toilet' at least twice each morning sometimes 3 or 4 with his phone... 20 mins at a time.
This is where he does it most, feeling safer In there I guess. But I fucking know what's going On 

I can't cope with the emotional betrayal I feel. I am full of silent rage as when I try to express this he is quick to shut me down and get defensive and mad. I have never asked him to completely stop, but he knows how much it hurts me , I thought he would try himself for that reason.. but he just waits for a week or so after it's been brought up and then goes for it again.

I cannot continue like this, to me ...and I hate that I think this but in my mind he is a dirty old man perve...he looks at girls in the street and then looks at me and smiles as if to say ' yeah I looked I'm allowed' he makes sexual jokes about young girls, and has told me he has been looking at boobs and vaginas since a kid and will most likely never stop 

I do everything In my power to please this man, and to be honest, he has let himself go where I don't think most girls would find him attractive anyway and i don't think I'm anything special myself but I am always being told I'm beautiful and pursed by men who I immediately shut down because I love this man so much.... My partner turns it around on me and accuses me of keeping things from HIM! I am so upset, I am so loyal to him in every way U can imagine...

I can't accept both the content he watches and the severity of it. Everyday??? and young girls playing with themselves...
and then there is me..always available and eager but he chooses that instead. It is so damaging that I am thinking that's what he is invisioning while we are intimate. Eyes always closed. I feel like he is so addicted now that he does infact NEED it to get excited and it is always girls masturbating... Young girls... Videos of up girls skirts.. basically anything with a close up vagina. Is he always imagining him doing that to the girl?? It hurts so much. 

I feel he will never change, and this porn addiction has turned him into a dirty perverted monster...and he has pushed me away with all his justification and deciept.
He is not the person who I thought he was in the beginning, he had so much respect. Now I can't look at him.. and it is killing my desire for him. It is all I THINk about now...  


How do I end things while extremely hurt and angry without hurting his integrity... Afterall I love him still...

But my mental health has to come first.

I see no other way around it, he is completely stubborn and will not change his behaviour.
It will kill me but I can't live this hell anymore.

16,"Okay so me and my closest friend had a pretty bad fight a week ago, and now I decided to text her because I didn't feel closure at all. We both have our major issues, but she has worse issues. I finally told her how she hurt me, and she was so distraught. She said that she doesn't deserve to be in my life, that she ""must punish"" herself. I'm just so confused I was so worry she'd cut even more, or kill herself. Thankfully she didn't.(Hopefully she didn't cut herself that'd destroy me)

  


I didn't tell her straight up how she hurt me and how I felt. It was all on me until I let it slip that she hurt me, which I didn't want to do because I was so worried about saying that. I was ready to take the blame, I just wanted to know why she said what she did the day of our fight.

  


After a bit of saying how much I loved her and cared about her. I think we calmed down a bit, but she said that she still needed time because she is not well and that her only goal was to make others happy. And she failed that. She has 2 therapists and a doctor. I hope she's fine.

  


I don't know how much time I should give her. I want to respect her wishes. This girl means a lot to me, and I don't know if she believes me when I say that. But she does. What should I do? How much time should I give her?",04Feb2019,1
17,"I’m going to try and be as clear as I can because people tell me or do things which I’m already doing.  We met in school and she just stuffed her number into my hand.  This isn’t exactly how I exchange numberS with friends, and since knowing her, I have asked her about it and she just giggled at me.  Never gives me a straight answer.

But since we’ve been friends we’ve gotten closer, and she’s said she wants to spend more time with me.  So much so that we’ve planned two trips together.  We have one coming up in a month’s time and we have to commit to certain reservations and I asked her if she’s sure she still wants to go. The reason I asked is because she had originally asked me out of the blue, and seemed really nervous when she did.  I didn’t want her to go through with something she didn’t want to, because this trip is sorta expensive, and very romantic in nature.  She just hugged me, gave me a kiss and said of course I want to go with you.

Did I offend her by asking her if she was sure?

We’ve always been friendly, but she’s been doing weird things like in the middle of a conversation took out her phone to show me a picture of herself in footsie pajamas and lingerie.  Now, she’s soo fucking cute and sexy I almost couldn’t help myself...but didn’t do anything.  I know it’s stupid, but I don’t know how to say “I like you and would be interested in more, and it seems like you’ve been sending signals that you might too?”

I know we’ve known each other a while, but anything about feelings will be hard to keep “light” I don’t want to emotionally dump on her, but everytime she does any sort of cutesy, sexy, flirty bullshit, I just want to pick her up and kiss her.  I just want to pick her up all the time and squeeze her, especially when she giggles (I’ve told her I love her laugh, that’s not something I would usually tell a platonic friend).  


TL;DR: I’ve been spending more and more time with my female friend.  She really seems to want more.  I don’t know how to tell her that I’m definitely open to more with her and am attracted to her without making it a slight felling dump.  Don’t say ask her out.  I just asked her out and if you say, “ask her out”, then you didn’t read the post.

NOPE. Not happening. Even though they've tried recently.

The problem is that I can't file a restraining order on them or get the law involved as they never abused me physically, but:

We have almost all of our classes together at uni since we're in the same program. I make a huge effort to sit farthest away from them possible with my new friends.

A few days ago before one of our classes started and I was waiting alone, they approached me and said they wanted to talk after class. 

I was livid, but I agreed and used it as an opportunity to tell them to stay away from me, twice, and in the most icy and angry/violent tone. 

I'm pretty sure I scared them because their eyes went really wide (they probably thought I was going to smile and eat up their manipulative apology but nope) and almost made them cry after. 

But now that I think of it, they're probably really salty now, have a good reason to have beef with me and might start planning passive aggressive revenge against me. 

What should I do if they try to get back at me by talking behind my back with our classmates spreading gossip/secrets or trying to talk to my friends? How can I stop them if it happens?

I'm thinking if they try to approach my friends and I again, I'll say aloud, ""When I told you to stay away, it means you can't be within 5 feet of circle radius of me, regardless of who I'm with.

22,"Only my 2nd post, so a little nervous posting something so personal but here we go. 

I’m not sure if I’m being victimised by my family or if I’m being too touchy. 

I don’t know when to draw the line between a bit of banter and something worse... because I’m definitely aware that I have a very good, very privileged life and that some people have to go through such horrible things... but I’ve come away from a family meal tonight full of such frustration and nervous energy I can’t sleep. A little previous history to myself; I have self injured in the past. This pent up anger that I feel now is what I’ve felt in the past, when I’ve hurt myself to relieve the pressure. This really concerns me because I believe I’ve done very well to move on from this method of self medication in the past few years. 

Anyway, all night my brother (m30) has been relentlessly teasing me. I’m sure this sounds familiar to all younger siblings. Sitting next to him at the family gathering (minding my own business, or joining in the general conversation) , he’s been pinching me, slapping my phone away from my hands - he unlaced my shoes at one point - taking my food etc. All pretty childish stuff which I found funny for the first 30mins but after four hours of it constantly it was wearing thin. I always feel so powerless around him - he’s 6”2 muscly and I’m 5”4 on a good day. It feels like nothing I do - verbal or physical-  can make him stop or deter him. This is an enormous source of frustration for me. 

Meanwhile my dad had been slowly getting drunk. As I stood up to say goodbye, I wrapped my scarf around my neck. 

Dad approached me and grabbed either end of the scarf and pulled, so the scarf tightened around my neck. He did this with sufficient force to make me yelp - there’s also some deep down primal fear that came along with this, being surprised with material clamped around your neck when you’re not expecting it isn’t great. 

Now, I know that he meant this in a playful way. But I believe in his drunkenness he pulled a little too hard. He let go as soon as I yelped. I looked at him as I loosened it off and said in a high pitched, shocked way, “why did you do that? It hurt”. Especially after my brother hurting me all evening I just wasn’t prepared for this from my Dad. 

He said “oh, it was just so tempting” and reached for my scarf again. And in a deeper, calm voice (that I have no idea where it came from) I told him not to do it again. Think of that scary calm voice you might hear from a pissed off teacher. 

The whole room stopped and looked at me, I was mortified that I had just had to tell my dad off.  I caught my uncle making a “awwkkwaaarrrdd” face at my brother. But it was just so unbelievably unpleasant a sensation I couldn’t have him do it again. And bear in mind that I respect my Dad so much, I would never normally tell him what to do.

Everyone was then on eggshells around me as I said really awkward goodbyes. 

As I drove off dad tried to pull the old “oh no you’ve run over my foot” gag. I believe this was an attempt to lighten the mood, but I wasn’t in the mood to play along so I just waited for him to back off and drove away. Meanwhile my bf is sitting silently in the passenger seat. 

And now I’m in bed, thinking this over and over. I just feel like when I left they’d have been saying how touchy I was tonight, or I was in a mood (I was generally taking everything on the chin until the scarf) . And I’m hating myself for making things awkward and being a drama queen, I should have just laughed it off or played along to keep everyone happy. 

Im also lamenting how much of a bitch I must have looked when I drove away - and I feel guilt for not taking Dad’s olive branch of a joke as I left. 

But then I also do wonder what they must think of me to constantly do this sort of thing when I visit. Just little things all the damned time. They must think of me as a rag doll, or think that I have no feelings to be constantly pestered like this. 

Anyway I guess I’m just wondering - am I overreacting to normal sibling/family banter: should I grow a tougher skin? 

TL;DR - wondering what a normal level of family banter is, and wondering if I am upset because I’m overreacting. ",04Feb2019,1

24,"When it comes to people and friendships, I'm quick to jump in and make friends. But, for the long term I'm not always the best for maintaining a friendship.

 For example,  I'll make a friend, exchange numbers; we will chat for a bit then taper off.  Things like life and such that normally happens. Then weeks later, or sometimes months later I'll find time to send a message asking how they are and what they are doing. I'll apologize for the long gap, we chat for a bit, but just as fast the conversation ends. 

Often, I feel this is kind of crappy of me as I've not kept consistent contact. That this, coming out of nowhere and picking up a conversation out of the blue, is selfish. This leads me to drift away, as I don't want to impose.

This has been me and every friendship. I want to change this, be a better friend, and have stronger friendships.",04Feb2019,1
25,"Like the title says, I'm looking for advice for moving apartments. I currently live in a 3rd floor apartment, and I'm moving into a three floor townhome at the end of this week. There will be a couple days of overlap between my current lease ending and my new one starting, so I don't have to do everything all in one day.

I've moved a few times, but it's always been extremely chaotic so I'm hoping to get some tips on minimizing the messiness that I'm sure comes with all types of moves. 

I'm not hiring movers, and since it's in the same complex, the current plan is to pack all of the small stuff in boxes and move in one day using my boyfriend and my cars, and then rent a UHaul truck for the larger furniture.

27,So I’m a very shy &amp; quiet person but with people I’m comfortable with I talk a massive amount. When it comes to girls I find really attractive I don’t know what to say or approach them. Once I tried pushing myself for once but I was shaking like a leaf. I got her number but had no idea how to keep a conversation going.

28,"I (F17) have a manager who has to be in his late 30s to early 40s, I’m not sure if his age, but some of the things he’s been telling me kind of bother me. I reached up to grab something and he told me my boob was in the way, which wasn’t that bad, it was just a weird joke.

But then we closed one night and I had to show him something from my car. We were alone at night in an empty parking lot. I was showing him my art work cause I was talking to him about it before, and he looked up at me and for no reason said “I bet you get all the boys, huh?” And I get that adults normally say that stuff, but it made me feel weird.

Welp, tonight at work my female manager had made some joke about liking guys butts, and I’m Asexual, so I was like “Haha, eww” and she was like teasing me for being squeamish about the joke, it was all good, then the guy manager said “well, OP, you make dirty jokes why are you so freaked out?” Which is true, I like a good dirty joke even if sex disgusts me, but then he said “a dirty mind is good to have. It’ll help you with some self adventure.” 

If you didn’t catch that, a 40 year old man talked about me, a 17 year old girl, masturbating in a conversation that wasn’t even about sex in the first place. It made me feel so disgusting, like I needed to go home and take a shower.

I don’t feel like it would bother me as much, but his brother goes to school with me and I heard through the grapevine that he had taken nudes of a teen girl from his younger brother’s phone.

I don’t really know what to do about this situation, I’m not trying to say I’m some sort of victim or something, I just don’t want this to continue. I don’t really know what to do, cause I like my job, and I don’t want this to be some huge thing, I just want this to stop.",04Feb2019,1
29,"So there is this guy in my life let’s call him Chris who has become my best friend in college. We are always hanging out and he got me more involved in the gay community. I met Chris through my boyfriend who we will call Jo. They were friends and we would all hang out together but when Jo went and studied abroad Chris and I got really close.

Here are the events between us:

We hung out often and would get drunk and play video games. I met a lot of his friends who I know see all the time. It was nice to have a gay friend who I could relate to. When he would sleep over we would rarely share a bed. He would sleep on the couch. While Jo was gone I got a suspicion that he was cheating on me. Chris would tell me that I was overreacting and give him a chance.

Well, Jo came back and ended up cheating on me with ten different guys (yeah I know that's a lot). The first person I told was Chris. I called him crying. He was super supportive. He wanted me to leave Jo but told me it was my choice. I ended up staying with Jo because I was still in love with him.

Chris hated Jo so much. They never interacted again. Chris and I went to a friends birthday party and when we were outside on the balcony he told me that we should leave our boyfriends and fuck shit up and love our best life. I considered it but nothing happened.

Jo and I had been having a lot of arguments. Jo even noticed that I have been hanging out with Chris a lot and asked me if I ever thought about fucking him. I said no. That was a lie.

One day Chris and I got super drunk and shared my bed. We got super close and I could feel the tension. I could tell we almost did something. He told me we aren’t in control. I almost kissed him but I rolled away.

Chris tells me he has been thinking about leaving his boyfriend a lot. I tell him I feel the same way. We talk about leaving our boyfriends often. He tells me he doesn't love his boyfriend and about two weeks ago he got drunk and gave a guy a handjob. 

Chris and I went to a gay club and had a lot of fun. We on each other I could feel his dick on my leg. I liked it a lot. This happened a week ago and really fucked me because I can't stop thinking about it. 

We shared a bed with a friend. When she fell asleep he asked me if I wanted to be cuddled. I said yes.

Chris texts me “I love you like a brother.” In a very long text message when I told him I was feeling sad. 

Chris has been giving me a lot more hugs and does nice things like touch my leg and give me a back massage.

Jo and I have been fighting a lot and we are going to graduate in less than six months. He’s the first guy I have ever been with. I love him but our love is fading. I feel like if Chris really does like me it and may help me let go of Jo. I don’t want to get into another relationship right away. It would just be validating to know another guy can like me and maybe fall in love with me. It would be nice to just have some fun with Chris before we leave. We promised to make a bucket list and finish it before our time is up. I just need some opinions on Chris. I already know how fucked my relationship is with Jo. ",04Feb2019,1
30,"I love my wife and daughter, but I’m starting to question if I can survive staying with my wife. She’s going through a tough time deciding what she wants to do out of college and I fear the stress has turned her to drinking, nearly daily.

 It all started around Christmas. A few days in a row she got very drunk and that resulted in her berating me, at one point hitting and biting me, and throwing things, breaking a few appliances. More than once she has said she will get better, and in a way she has. She hasn’t drank to that point since, but I’m scarred from it. She drinks until she’s goofy and acting funny but it causes my anxiety to go haywire. I’ll start acting distant and irritated with her and when she notices she knows why I’m acting like that. She denies her drinking problem, but it’s gotten to the point that she hides her alcohol throughout the house, denies drinking when I can clearly smell it on her, and has been running errands after drinking. 

I’m worried about my wife, but mostly I’m worried about my daughter. My wife stays home with her 5 days out of the week and I’m afraid of what might happen if she drinks too much around her. I also don’t want my daughter to grow up thinking that this is her mom. 

Last of all, I love my wife and want to help her all I can, but I’m hurting. I find myself thinking about leaving and sharing custody of our daughter but then I go back to worrying about what might happen if I’m not there. I’ve discussed it with her but she just says “I know I’m getting better it’s not a problem” or “I think you’re just projecting your insecurities (I’ve dealt with alcoholism before) on me.” If I stay what can I do? How do I survive this?",04Feb2019,1

32,"My friend is a big sports better and I've been helping him compile stats and put together his own formulas in spreadsheets(google sheets) for analyzing the lines available to him and amounts to bet that keep him safe from going broke entirely.

I love it. Making the spreadsheet work and scraping websites for data and comparing the statistics to previous games. 

Here's the catch though. I'm not college educated, but understand numbers and formulas well enough to figure things out on my own. Is there a career I can make out of this? And how would I get my foot in the door without a degree?",04Feb2019,1
33,"I am always trying to be an emotional person but no one will stay with me long enough for me to make any progress so how do I get people to understand that it is a process for me learn how to feel emotions and stay around long enough that them leaving me isn't going to make me loose all the progress made?

Context: A couple years ago I realized a big part of me being unhappy is that I can't make good connections with people. Whether it be friends, family, or a s/o I can't get close to people in a way that will fulfill my needs and most of my friendships end within a couple months. I always try my best to feel enough emotion to make people not be afraid of getting close to me but in the end it always ends up with me being too emotionless to keep them around. After waiting for a while I will try to apologize but every one just ends up pulling even further away afterwards or don't even allow me to apologize at all. 

tl;dr I am an emotionless asshole but I don't want to be and no one will stay with me long enough to not be",04Feb2019,1
34,"Long story short, a lot of people had complained that this co worker doesn't clean her work area (apparel associate) and walks around doing diddly squat for hours. She also goes outside to smoke, THEN clocks out for lunch, then clocks back in, and spends 15 minutes sitting on her phone. She also takes 30 minute breaks instead of 15. Many associates record this.

Well, today, she literally got on her phone and WAS YELLING to this person. I was trying to tell my other co worker something important and she was beside me, YELLING over the phone. I typically go to my support manager for this stuff. I recorded my workspace table (that she was doing this at, and she has no right to be invading my area as it's not her area), and recorded her voice yelling on the phone for ten minutes. I was thinking of giving it to my SM.

35,"My husband and I have been together for 8 years (married 5). He is doing his last year in a PhD program and has a really great future: a top 10 university hospital just offered him a two-year postdoctoral fellowship with a decent salary ($50k). It's a big deal and he's stoked. And I'm stoked for him. We'll get to move to a new state and meet new people. Overall, it sounds good. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working two jobs for the past 5 years to help us make enough money. Sometimes I resented having to do this but overall it wasn't a big deal. However, the jobs I have had are just that: jobs, not careers. I am an administrative assistant at a non-profit and also teach part-time at a local community college. Now that his school is winding up, I've been thinking about starting my own career. I'm 32, have a BA in history (which has been pretty useless lol), and I'm relatively intelligent and upbeat. I have no student debt but I do have chronic depression (on medication). I guess a guy really can have it all ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I feel like there are so many paths to choose from. I enjoy a lot of things. I love teaching, so I've considered doing a masters degree in that. I also really like helping others so I have considered going into social work or even nursing. I'm pretty creative so I have thought about studying something niche, like landscape architecture or furniture making. My major issue is that I can't decide. Do I play it safe and go into something I know (teaching, social work), which I know I enjoy, or jump into something totally new and potentially not liking it (i.e. making a costly mistake)?

&amp;#x200B;

39,"I just turned 23 and I hate myself for never accomplishing anything towards my life goals. I’m almost certain that I have learning disabilities because I can’t sit still and study for long periods since my brain is so wired for action. I have a natural talent for building and creating which I haven’t really used much. My teachers over the years have debated with me in class and we’re shocked at what I knew on my own. Many told me I was really intelligent yet my grades have always been terrible. In middle school I was a discipline case because I was angry  due to a pretty difficult childhood. I had to think for myself . Now That I’ve turned 23 I have only completed some school at my local community college. I teach myself so much better and the pace/ style of learning used in school completely misses me. I am wired to master things. I learn a topics of interest by seriously delving into it sometimes for years until I have a complete understanding of it. In school, I feel overwhelmed by so much information that I never really get to mull over. My brain needs to deep dive and spend long amounts of time fitting everything into my worldview or else I feel like I’m wasting my time with trivial knowledge. What do I do with myself? I’m so afraid because I know I’m probably not a college person and I’m already getting older.

I’m incredibly curious and I need stimulation to feel happy yet somehow I don’t feel that mental challenge at school. I get overwhelmed by all the data and info coming at me. I don’t want to be a failure. Modern corporations really want to focus on what degree you have and even my family is telling me to just pick a trade because I’ll never finish school. It hurts to be discounted like that since I know a degree is what they want for me but it’s probably true. My dad was in all Gates classes when he was young because he has an extremely high IQ. He also failed out of college when he tried to go back yet he is one of the best in his field and a recipient of trophies. I wish I could follow in his footsteps but you would need a degree to even start a few positions below where he did. I hate being looked down on by people for not being a graduate. I hate feeling like I’m gonna be nothing when I have skills to offer. I desperately want to be a productive member of society and yet the well worn paths to success that everyone else is taking just haven’t worked for me. Please help me. I’m not above working hard. I’ve done construction and I’ve worked in the restaurant service industry for 7 years doing physical labor since I could legally work.

40,"Hi everyone

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, I was blackmailed on a streaming site - someone got screenshots of porn on my screen and before I realised it was on screen, they had sent me messages saying I needed to ""pay $$$"" or they would post the screens online. The porn was fairly standard, nothing ""weird"", but they wanted to blackmail me out of embarrassment/humiliation. I didn't reply to the person, I just closed everything down, hoping it would all just go away.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, it was a really dumb mistake that I made, and I regret it terribly (I wasn't aware I was streaming at the time, but whatever, what's done is done, it happened). 

&amp;#x200B;

In the months since it happened, I've been checking websites relentlessly, and I have only found the screenshots posted in a single discord, nowhere else (hopefully it stays that way!). The thing is, the images themselves are just screens of me looking at thumbnails, so again, they aren't as bad as it could have been, but I still live in fear of someone I know seeing the images, so really, I want the images deleted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to contact discord over it, but they don't seem to be interested in deleting the images, so I took matters into my own hands. I signed up for a premium search engine, and I've gotten hold of the person's name, email address, phone number, and province where they live. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked up what the laws are for blackmail in their country, and their country in particular seems to be cracking down on things like blackmail, sextortion, etc, and I see jail terms of around 2 years come up for this sort of thing. As far as I'm concerned; they threatened to post the images if I didn't pay money, I then of course did not pay them money, and they then posted the images without my consent. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, instead of me going to law enforcement over this, I really want to reach out to the guy and just ask him to delete the images because I honestly don't want to go to such drastic measures and potentially ruin his life. I am, however, worried that this will stir his interest in the blackmail scenario again, which could potentially lead to him posting the images on other sites. In the event that he does threaten something like that, I'm thinking I'll threaten him with legal action, and provide him with the details I have on him, and then threaten to contact his local law enforcement. Is this a viable approach?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I attempt to make peace with this guy and ask him to remove the images, or should I just move on and let sleeping dogs lie? Has anyone got any experience of trying to resolve less desirable scenarios like this? Did they try the peaceful approach? Did it work?

&amp;#x200B;

45,"Sorry this is really long. I'm not super expecting anybody to read it or answer I just wanted to get it off my chest and if anything comes of it then what's the harm. 

I just turned 24 two days ago.
My life has been pretty much in the shitter since I was born. Physical, emotional, verbal, psychological abuse from family causing severe depression/anxiety that lead to morbid obesity. I started self harming at 15, had a psychotic break at 17 and had to spend a year in the hospital (don't remember any of it thankfully). 
My social anxiety eventually morphed into full blown agoraphobia and I didn't leave my house from about 16-21. I've never learned how to drive, never dated, didn't even get my first job until a year and a half ago. In fact I've never done any type of living at all.
After I finally got the courage to come out as trans (another reason I'd been so f'd up my whole life) to my parents they kicked me out of the only home I'd ever lived in. So I packed my bags and left September of 2017.

Cut to today. I'm 150lbs lighter (still about 20lbs overweight) I live on the other side of the country on my own, I've been on T for almost 2 years and love the changes it's brought physically and emotionally (I can look at and actually enjoy seeing my own reflection finally), I have a full time job and I've made friends who I actually hang out with in the outside world lol.

But now I feel stalled. I like my job and I really like the people I work with (most of them anyway lol) but this isn't the career I want. It's more of a step in the right direction but one that feels like it's dragging on forever. 
I have no insurance (thanks to my dead beat dad) and I'm about 30-35,000$ in debt from failed school attempts, hospital bills, credit cards, etc. Don't qualify for medicaid either 👍 

I can't afford any surgeries I want, trans or weight related. I still don't know how to drive so I have to bus everywhere. This wouldn't really be a problem except that where I live is an almost 2 hour bus ride (which also makes getting a second job impossible) to and from work (~40 min drive) and moving is just not feasible. I'd look for a job in my town but all of the jobs are in the town where my job is now. And moving back into that town would be crazy expensive. Plus I like where I live, I have a nice roommate with sweet dogs and things are good there.

My credit is garbage, I don't make enough to actually save anything on top of all these bills I haven't even begun to touch. I have no help from anyone as far as finances go so I'm pretty screwed in that department. I don't have money for driving lessons, or a car to learn on. 

So I guess I just don't know what to do. I'm completely stuck. I need money in order to do anything and I can't put money away to save my life. Part of me wants to pick up and move somewhere, another state, another country, just somewhere where I can actually make money and not work myself to death. I work in restaurants so I know I could go anywhere and find a job but like I said restaurants just aren't the goal and it takes its toll on me if I'm being honest. 

It just feels like getting my freedom and happiness in one area means I have to sacrifice it in another. It's been a year and a half since I was forced to leave home and I just can't shake this feeling that I'm not doing anything. It feels like all my time is being wasted and there's nothing I can do. I can't get rid of this nagging in the back of my head telling me to pick everything up and move on but it's just not possible. 

How do I get a job I want when everything is too far away and I can't drive or learn how to drive? How do I save money when my paycheck is already spent before I even get it? How am I supposed to pay for any surgeries when I don't even know when I'm eating next? I'm sick of being in this body. I hate all this saggy skin and girl parts and I'm stuck with them for the foreseeable future. 

I'm just so stuck. I feel like I'm falling into quicksand. The more I struggle to get out of this the quicker I sink. I know I'm only 24 and I have the rest of my life yada yada but you gotta understand. 22 years of never having lived a single day. Years without friends, without goals, without hope. It's like I got a taste of it and it all just fizzled away. 

Somebody please tell me what to do. I can't keep going like this. I have no family, my friends help me with emotional support the best they can but they're my age so it's not like they're older and wiser.

I know a big part of the answer is money but I just have no way to get it. At this rate it'll take years before I can start actually living and Im just not willing to wait that long. I've waited long enough. I just want to start my life already. ",04Feb2019,1

I'm orbiting Jupiter at this point, and this is where the encounter happens. My friend, who's also my-*a few buildings over-*neighbor, tells me that she's excited to go to this wedding but she had no one to take care of her dog. Seeing where this is going, I quickly try sidestep the whole thing by suggesting she contract someone. She responds by bringing up some financial woes, effectively dispelling any possibility of hiring someone. *Shit. She can't hire someone. Does she have any friends that could take care of her dog? Fuck. I'm her friend. Here it comes.* It came. She asked me. Due to the spur-of-the-moment-timing, along with by stupor, I couldn't think of a good excuse. I had to capitulate, I accepted my fate. *Oh well, it's only for the night*. It wasn't.

Our family dog is over 17 years old and he's had a great life, but he is now blind and mostly deaf. He is incontinent and spends most of his time inside the kitchen and back room (both of which are very open and give him plenty of space) to avoid him ruining the carpets.
He goes on very few walks and can't go very far, his backside is very thin and he limps a lot. While he does seem happy when someone pets him, he also seems very confused.

49,"Me and my boyfriend have been together over two years. We live together. He plays an important part in my daughter’s life. In fact, he’s great with her. He’s a hard worker. Very much into his art, painting and woodworking, to the point he’s quite manic. But with those wonderful traits - passion, perseverance, responsibility - also comes the not-so wonderful traits - unempathetic, judgmental, and just plain mean.

My mental health has taken such a deep dive to the point where I’m on a consistent regimen of psychiatric medications. I just recently (as in the last week) had to add a new medication to the mix because I truly feel like I’m going crazy. 

He’s always so cold to me. About stupid things. For instance, he tells me he wants to go to a super bowl party with his friends and wanted me to come with me.

He knows I’m overworked between raising my daughter and my case management job. I spend so much time and emotional and mental energy on everyone else, I never have any for myself. So I thought he understood.


Anyways, I tell him this morning that I’ll have my daughter tonight unexpectedly so I won’t be able to go to the party (which would end around midnight) but i wouldn’t mind dropping him off. He said he didn’t want to go anyways and wanted to watch it at our home. A few hours goes by and he starts acting cold. Which he does almost every day after a certain time (around the time he starts drinking). I ask him why and he said he’s mad that I never want to do anything and we have nothing in common. Neither one of those things are true, and he knows that but refuses to believe it and almost has me convinced it may be true. 


He goes onto say I told him I didn’t want to go out tonight and I never want to do anything. He said I got upset when he brought it up earlier and called him a “crazy fucker”. I never said that! I started crying after he said we have nothing in common and I need to grow the fuck up (even though, regardless of my mental instability at times, I take care of my responsibilities very well). And when I started crying, he called ME fucking crazy for crying. I feel fucking crazy. 

He is constantly wearing me down, time and time again. Snide comments all the time, every day. All I do is give and give and feel like I get little emotional honesty or response in return. It’s gotten to the point where I’m constantly questioning everything about myself. Am I the kind of person he says I am? Careless and lazy and ignoring of all my responsibilities? I’m forgetful at times (like opening the window shades in the morning to let the plants get sunlight) and he tells me it’s because I don’t care about plants and having a well-decorated home even though our home is beautiful. I’ve also told him I’m CONSTANTLY thinking of my responsibilities to the point where my anxiety causes me to forget things. Mental health is a joke to him, and he believes people who are anxious or depressed should just “deal with it”. It’s insulting so I don’t even bring it up anymore in fear of sounding weak. 

He makes me feel like I’m not good enough. He constantly assassinates my character and then tells me I “pity” myself too much when I get hurt by his comments and insults. I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to fix our relationship but I don’t even know what to say to him. I’m honestly feeling so helpless and like I’m going insane. It’s to the point where I wish I had the guts to hurt myself for relief, although I never would. What do I do? What can I say? Sorry this was so long and likely incoherent.

56,"First of all greetings and sorry in advance for any mistakes as English is not my first language.

Since a very young age I've had problems with addictive behavior which has given me both problems and perks. 

The first obsession I remember were books, at around age 11. A couple of year forward videogames were my one and only passion. 

At age 16 I dropped school, and soon I had my first experience with drugs and got hooked on (thankfully) ""non addictive"" substances. 17 I started highschool again, but shortly after I joined the chess club I could'nt focus on anything but chess. The only reason I kept going to school was to play, get tournament discounts and transportation.

Eventually I dropped out of school again. I felt worthless, like an impostor, I  could'nt get out of my home, room or sometimes even my bed. Some time passed and I started playing League of Legends for 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours a day. 

Every rank up and every tournament match point felt so good , like a discharge of pure liquid joy floating on my brain.  Of course the higher I ranked the harder it was for me to feel that pleasure. I peaked after a year playing and then everything crumbled when my team could'nt qualify to the national league.

 I played more, for longer periods of time but my performance was only getting worse. I went from talking and being matched with pros from my region to getting kicked from my team and avoided due to my toxic behaviour. I had suicidal thoughts everyday. 

My coach and other players told me to seek for help as I was sick. I cut laces with them and nearly everyone I knew, but one day I said to myself ""Ok, lets go see a therapist and if that doesn't work I'll finish it all"". It was right after my third session that I had the biggest urge to kill myself, if it wasn't for how crowded it was it might've happened. 

However, that weekend I went on a camping trip with some friends and out of nowhere someone I had not seen in a long time showed up and went with us. That night I braved up to her knowing that that was probably the last change I would had. We talked about our problems and the day right after we departed in different ways suddenly I felt a lot stronger knowing that someone was facing almost the same issues as me.

It's been 8 months since then and for every day that passes I feel stronger and more capable. I'm starting college soon, I have a half-time job, I go to the gym and I'm working on a project for gender equality and democracy. Althought I've had highs and lows, I would describe my general mindset as balanced, almost stoic,like I have control  of my urgencies, emotions and reactions.

However,recently I noticed that I have a crush on someone. At first I thought I just liked her the same way I like other people who are similiar to me. But then I noticed that for the past week I've been moving deadlines on my projects, I can't focus on study, I've been late to meetings just to be with her and today I had that sensation of pure joy on my brain as strong as I can recall feeling naturally and it put me in such a  dopey state I could'nt do anything. 

I'm so afraid of losing control. I don't want to be as obsessed as I've been on the past. One part of me wants to be with her while the other  is literally trying so hard to get me as far away from her as I can and keep focusing on my personal improvement.",04Feb2019,1
57,"While I would not call myself homosexual (and this is not up for debate) more than 95% of people I find attractive are also of my sex and it is almost impossible for me to feel any kind of emotional connection towards people of the other sex even if I happen to find them attractive. 

With today's technology (Tinder, etc) one might assume that it would be easy for a person with mainly homosexual desires to find partners for dates or similar things. Weirdly I can go for hours on Tinder without actually finding someone attractive. This also applies when walking through the city. I almost never see a person who is attractive to me. The same goes for porn websites. I have almost given up on those. 

As the title implies this situation is different when considering people that I know personally or have seen over an extended amount of time, sometimes even without interacting. In this case the chance of finding someone attractive is magnitudes higher. There is no emotional closeness involved. Some of those people are still effectively strangers that I have not spoken to/interacted with for more than a minute.

The other night me and my bf got high, and he had a bad reaction. He got paranoid and felt like he was dying. He then ran out to my car and almost drove away. I was pissed. It took a lot for me to get him back in the house.

I come home and vent to her about it, screaming that I'm done with him. I didnt know at the time that he had a bad reaction, I just thought he was ditching me and trying to drive off in my car.

She gets so upset that I'm in a ""toxic relationship"" that it ""started affecting her physical, mental, and spiritual health"" and she felt ""unsafe physically and mentally"" so she calls her bf at 1 am and makes him drive 4 hours to come stay with us. 

Shes been crying for the past 24 hours because I didnt break up with him. Shes gone through multiple boxes and such. She also got drunk and started screaming at both him and me.

Fast forward half a year later. Family member wants new items. Stuff I don't even make. Told them I don't do it / know how to make those items. This resulted in blow back and insisting I do research to see if I could do it. 

I've told them I won't be making these products multiple times now. That I don't want to carry these products and therefore do not want to sign a new contract. I have even found a competitor (local) that will do this and I'm still getting push-back.

I've had three calls tonight alone. One from said family member, which I ignored. The other two were from OTHER family members, asking why I was causing drama? I'm like: What?

Apparently this family member is calling OTHER people to CALL ME. Working them up and making it into a huge deal. I'm being asked to deal with it because it's annoying them too and how I need to cooperate so that the rest of the family doesn't need to get involved.

Said family member has an anxiety condition, so the rest of the family tends to cater to any tantrums.

I have said no, over and over. Now the rest of the family is getting harassed and I'm being blamed for 'starting it'.

66,"My girlfriend is early on in transition and it’s not quite obvious image wise yet. They are still very secretive about it and I would never tell someone about it without their permission first until they are comfortable talking about it publicly.

About a month ago my girlfriend gave me permission to tell my mother. Everything went perfectly and she was very supportive. I made her promise me that she would not tell my father or my brother until my girlfriend and I were ready to talk about it.

Yesterday morning after I came to visit my parents house, my mother told me nonchalantly that she told my father. This sparked a panic as we were not ready to tell my father and I had not yet set boundaries with my dad about who he’s allowed to tell yet.

Of course I got very upset and told my mother that she had breached a line of trust with not only my girlfriend, but me. She retaliated saying I’m being manipulative by trying to control who she talks to about certain things. She insists I’m overreacting and need to understand that we are a family and there are no secrets in family. 

I feel like I can no longer trust her with secrets. Especially because she revealed something so big. I tried explaining to her that this was not hers to tell and that she has taken the voice away from my girlfriend. She says we need to relax since my father reacted positively.

70,"Not sure if this goes in r/legal advice, since I don't know if I'm taking legal action. 

For simplicity, we'll refer to her as Emma, and her dad as John. 

In May of 2018, Emma and John got into verbal fights, but nothing serious. As the year went on, Emma's life hit a couple of roadblocks and she became severely suicidal. 

In November, she opened up to her parents about it, which was a mistake. John told her things like ""Is my love not enough for you?"" that she was attention-seeking, and other unsavory things I can't even remember. 

More and more fights happened, and he started taking to backing her into corners, flicking her forehead, and shoving her. Every time she threw her arm up sideways to block something she was afraid was coming, he would yell at her for trying to hit him.

It kept escalating as John threatened to send her to a mental hospital as Emma continued to beg for therapy or some kind of empathy or support. But nothing happened until December. 

They got into a fight about her being suicidal again, and it got to the point where John, a 6' 1'' man, stared stomping 4'' 10'  Emma's bare foot until it bruised very badly and she could hardly walk on it. She then baited him into calling the cops so she could be taken to a mental hospital, as she told me later, ""just to get away from him."" 

The cops came, and immidiately John started playing the victim card, saying how his 16 year old daughter is so hungry for attention and terrorizes the family while he works so hard to support them ie. Playing Fortnite at 3 in the morning while Emma cleans the kitchen. The cops ended up siding with John, and ended up even threatening to taze Emma. They ended up leaving with nothing being done, since her father was able to interrupt her before she could say anything about him physically abusing her. 

Fast foward to 2019.

Yesterday came along, and Emma pierced her nose. She came home, John yelled at her, kept making punching motions toward her but stopped *just* before he hit her face, until she said ""Hit me, I dare you."" 

He then started punching her lower back to the point where she was crying out in pain and tried to run out of the house, and he just dragged her back in and took her phone away. I literally cannot contact her at the moment. 

I'm 15 years old myself, and she lives several states away. She doesn't want to do anything in fear her father will play the victim card and it will escalate even more. She doesn't want to get put in the foster care system, and I don't think she'll be able to get through it until she's 18. Neither does she. She's either going to kill herself, or her dad is going to kill her.

What do I do?

73,"I already posted this in r/offmychest but I wasn't getting any responses and I wanted to try again at another subreddit and this one seemed appropriate. Heads up, this is going to a long post.

About eight years ago, when I got out of high school, I had big plans for the future. I was gonna have a successful career as an independent cartoonist (with my own cartoon series and everything), I was gonna have my own happy family, and I was gonna be a happy, successful adult. However, between then and now, things have changed: people have changed, moral values have changed, opinions have changed, and the world became more confusing. And here I am at 26 years old, still going to college, still in sync with my childhood upbringing (while everyone else I know seems to have completely broken away from their childhood roots), and worried about what people think of me, and as a result, not having many friends, having no dating experience, still working minimum-wage jobs, still having a long way to go to be successful.

I am currently in the second semester of my first year at a university (I previously attended a community college for six years) and I'm currently undeclared. I applied for the animation program (my university is one of the rare schools in the US that teaches 2D animation and cartooning) but I didn't get accepted. But even before that happened, I had been having doubts about whether or not I even want to do cartooning anymore. Mostly because I don't know if most people will like my cartoon (which I have been working on since 2014).

For those who are curious about the plot of my cartoon, it's a children's series about a middle-school-aged girl named Mira (short for Mirabelle), who comes from a family of people who have supernatural powers and attends a school where most of the student body is also supernaturally gifted, but she herself (at least in the beginning of the series) is a mortal and is trying to find her place in this paranormal world. She is also rather introverted and doesn't have a big circle of friends, usually hanging around with her best friend Stephanie and her older brother Mateo. The show is loosely based on my high school years.

What I wanted to do with my show was have it explore a variety of different situations (that also keep in touch with the show's central theme), kind of like what most shows from before 2013 did. But most shows today seem to be adamant about having an involved overarching storyline that you have to watch every episode in the season to follow. And a lot of people on the internet today say that's what they prefer, even proudly saying that they would much rather watch these shows of today (like Gravity Falls or Steven Universe) than episodic shows from the 90s/early 2000s (like Rugrats, Pepper Ann or Recess).

A lot of shows today also place a lot of importance on romance and shipping, which is something I was always against doing in my show, since I feel that people who don't have much experience with the opposite sex or just aren't interested in dating don't get much recognition in entertainment, especially today. I want my show to be more family-themed. But a lot of people seem to think shows more focused on family and friends are boring. Plus, the most well-liked shows on television (not just from today) involve romance or romantic hints in one way or another, which makes me more worried about whether people would enjoy my show. At this point, if anyone commented on this saying they would enjoy my cartoon (and not just saying so to make me feel good), I would be (pleasantly) surprised.

That's why I'm thinking about giving up my dream to become a cartoonist, but if I do that, what do I have to fall back on? Do I go back to reviewing television shows on the internet? Everyone ***HATES*** my opinions. Whenever I'm on the internet and I voice my honest criticisms/concerns about shows like iCarly or That '70s Show, I get nothing but a plethora of people telling me I'm ***wrong*** or that my perspective is ""off"" or I have no sense of humor or I'm being hateful. Some people would even ridicule me, harass me with sarcastic comments, call me names, and talk to me like I'm dumb. And it doesn't help that a lot of my opinions aren't exactly ""popular."" Not only regarding things I don't like, but when I state that I like something that most people don't, I would get ridiculed or even berated for it.

Honestly, I'm jealous of people on the internet who are able to express their honest opinions, no matter how unpopular/controversial they are, without getting completely murdered for it. A lot of cartoon/television reviewers on YouTube have made videos where they pretty much took the words right out of my mouth when discussing their feelings about stuff and the feedback they got on their reviews/critiques was much more positive than what I usually get when I get my opinions out there. Most of the time, these people get commenters who either agree or respectfully disagree with them. Obviously, not every comment they get is positive, but *most* of the feedback they get is constructive and nice. So they're obviously doing something right that I'm not. Maybe I'm just not as persuasive as they are. Still, if I had to fall back on reviewing shows, I'd love to learn to be persuasive, because I want people to hear me out. I want to be able to get my point of view out in the open instead keeping it bottled up, and I want people to at least try to think about my perspective on things and make me feel appreciated for my input. But I guess that's only a fantasy for me.

I'm also having doubts about my desire to become a parent. I mean, I am 26 years old and have never been in a relationship, so I probably won't become a parent any time soon, but over the years, my desire to have my own family has been gradually decreasing, mostly thanks to social media and the changing times. I'll try to explain my reasons for these doubts as briefly as I can since this post is already long enough as it is: 1. A lot of people nowadays tend to generalize kids based on things like their gender and seem to have moral values that conflict with what I was taught as a kid, so I'm confused about how I'm supposed to raise my kids, and 2. Pretty much everything that made my childhood what it was is gone (or at least on the verge of being gone) in favor of the internet and other modern ""conveniences"", so I'm worried that I might not be able to bond well with my kids. I promise I'll elaborate on my anxiety about these doubts in a reply if anyone asks me to, but again, this post is already pretty long and there are other things in this post that I really need advice on, so I wanted to keep this as short as possible here.

So that's pretty much my life story right now. I know I probably seem like kind of a dork, ranting about my life to strangers on Reddit, but when almost none of your friends in real life or on social media are into much of the same stuff that you're into or have much of the same problems you have, and so they likely wouldn't have much useful advice to offer and you need *some* place to spill your feelings, you'd understand the need to get it out somewhere that anyone can see it. If anyone here does have genuine advice to offer about any of the anxieties I talked about, I'd really appreciate it because they're really getting in the way of my self-confidence and academic success.

I would have put the moves on right when I saw her, but the problem is that the pastor was talking and she was in the direct middle of a row of seats. Can't exactly push thru 10 people sit down and be like ""hey my name's u/mynamesnotpat"" while a pastor is giving his sermon.

My plan is this...I chill in the church sanctuary before services and wait for her to show up. If so, I just so happen to see her and be like ""oh hey I remember you from last week! you got the nicest smile by the way. I'm u/mynamesnotpat what's your name etc etc etc etc"" strike up a conversation and get her number.

Good plan? Do I adjust? Or did I lose my chance?

78,"I am currently attending a boxing gym because I’m not satisfied with how I’ve let myself go since I started college. I don’t feel attractive enough to date and I’m getting less and less comfortable with the idea of being alone forever. The gym is $125/mo but so worth it to me, not only because I expect to see results but because I’m actually motivated to go for once, and the workouts are the best I’ve ever done.

Yesterday I toured a music studio for the first time and made the first step in recording my debut album. I’ve been writing for 10 years and I can say with confidence that this is my biggest dream I’ve ever had, and it actually seems doable because this studio has subscription-based studio time, $149/mo for unlimited time with an engineer and producer. Really everything I’ve been needing. The engineer and producer have extra fees attached but it seems doable still.

The man at the studio flat out told me to trade my gym for the studio time, but I’m so torn. I really can’t afford both right now, and I’m starting to doubt myself in terms of getting my vision across to the team there. I don’t even know if I have it in me, my music is so vulnerable and I’m a shy person. It terrifies me so I think I should do it, but at the same time I’ve been at this gym for a month now and don’t want to quit and lose all my progress. It is the perfect time to quit, however, because yesterday was my last paid day for last month. So I’m at a crossroads 

What’s the smartest thing to do? Do you think the studio man is right? I know that as I get older it’ll be harder to lose the weight, and he said the whole process of getting my first song done will take months...

Any help is appreciated. I should also add that I actually have ANOTHER gym membership that’s much cheaper but I have zero motivation to go, because I’m not good at deciding what workouts to do on my own and I feel uncomfortable around the other guys there who are trying to get swole. I mention this because I do have a backup gym but I’m not even going to it currently because I kind of hate it, and I’m locked into a 2 year contract :(",04Feb2019,1

preface: i have this friend group and we are all in theater, we are in highschool and we hangout pretty much every day. 


i originally joined theater last year for a guy because i thought he was cute, we’ll call him Train (m17). when i joined, i had big expectations about eventually hooking up with Train and falling in love and getting married etc. i joined because i was going through a rough patch in my life and needed to try something new for a change. i learned the ropes and actually really started to enjoy rehearsing and performing. a couple weeks fly by and the show we were doing comes to a close. at this point i’ve forgotten about Train almost entirely and made a solid group of friends in the department. it’s at this time i’m asked if i wanted to stage manage the next show, and since i had so much fun, i said yes. 

the next show is i became really good friends with, for the sake of anonymity, we will call them Neck and Rex. Neck and Rex good friends with Train, so when i would hangout with Neck (m17) and Rex, Train would be there. We hung out almost every day over the summer and we had fun smoking and drinking and just being teenagers. The show we were doing eventually ended so now i had all summer to hang out with my new friends.

In July, I (m15) ended up hooking up with Rex (m18), and it made things weird with the group. He treated me bad after so we kind of kicked Rex out of the friend group. It was now me, Neck, and Train. Now that it was just us, my feelings for Train hit me like well, a train, and i quickly started swooning over him again. 

August comes around and auditions come up pretty quick. I convince my other friends, Ferret (f15) and Earth(f15), to audition with me. We all got into all three shows along with Neck and Train. Rex has gone to college.

The first show ends with little drama. My crush for Train is at an all time high. We hangout pretty much every weekend and get drunk and/or high. Life is pretty good.

The group quickly reforms into me, Train, Neck, Ferret, Earth, and a new person, Tea (f 16). Neck and Ferret start dating each other and i get jealous with a capital J. Neck tells me that he hooked up with Rex before i even did it, and we bonded over that.

ok so fast forward to now:

Train has a girlfriend and Earth has a boyfriend. Ferret and Neck are still together. we all hangout so much that i’ve grown an enormous crush on all of them (i’m bi). what do i do? i’m not about to tell any of them because they would kick me out of the group. i’m the only person without a SO and it’s almost embarrassing.

The person who I considered ""the one"" left me without much warning &amp; it messed me up real bad. Round the same time I turned 22 and graduated. Also landed my first desk job right out of college. 

Anyway, big transitonal period happens and I'm suddenly trying to cope with living alone again. I dont hate it, and I'd say I've done pretty okay- but I have this terrible feeling that I'm a nobody going nowhere despite notable success in my passions. 

I have this weird sensation that if I'm not doing something interesting or making something I'm wasting my time. I literally can not sit still. I feel like I live in a state of a lacadasical panic attack to where I'm always bored to tear. I plan on moving soon, but I dont know where.

90,"I feel so utterly hopless. I am a 16 year old female in my junior year of highschool. I know, most people are just going to call me dramatic. Thats fine. Say what you will. For those of you that care... can you help me? 
Honestly, my mental state is a wreck. I have pretty bad social anxiety, like to the point where just going into a store alone will literally make me start shaking. I am medicated but it doesn't do much, anyway thats not the point. The point is I just realized how incredibly alone I am. I have no friends. None. I had friends at one point but they all seemed to find someone better or just moved on after I switched to home schooling... I don't want to be alone. I haven't hung out with a friend for over 2 years. Not to mention I have an overprotective mother, so if someone does offer to take me out somewhere or ya know just offers to hang out she says that she'll speak to her husband about it. Eventually the day that I'm supposed to hang out with the person comes and I'll have to dip because she never gives me an answer. I also need time to myself sometimes so if there is a lull in conversation (I only text people because phone calls fuck with me so much,) I leave them on read. Its not that I don't try. When my mother does allow me to hang out with someone they'll either blatantly tell me no or they'll make up an excuse as to why they can't go. The only time I ever get a text, which is maybe once every other week, and that's when they want something. I live in a fairly small town, there's not many people who live here so I feel so completely alone. My mom freaks out if I make friends on social media, to the point where I'll have to stop talking to people because she acts like I'm doing something wrong. I'm not giving out personal details to them, 99% of the time I'm sending memes. The other 1% is talking about nerdy shit. I don't know what to do. I've tried talking with my mother about it repeatedly but all she says is okay, I'll let you have more freedom and then nothing changes. I want to go on walks to help me with my depression because nature calms me but I can't because she always wants me to take my siblings who are so deeply attached to their electronics that I get told no. I know its stupid to walk on my own but cops patrol my neighborhood religiously. Not only that but I have a large German Shepard Chow mix that I can take with me, but apparently thats not an option. I just want to have someone that I can joke with and rely on but that person doesn't exist. I'm not asking for an intimate relationship. All I want is a friend and I always get denied that. The one person I thought was my friend replaced me within days of me getting homeschooled. Since then I've told myself that I don't need anyone but I'm seeing everyone else- my siblings included- talking to friends and enjoying there lives and I hole myself up in my room because I have no one... what do I do?

94,"I just switched jobs fairly recently and I think I regret it for a couple of reasons. (Sorry if this gets a bit rambly)

 I used to work online part time for 14.50/hr, plus they would pay for my monthly home internet expenses. It may sound low but the cost of living in my small town is pretty low. I only really worked between 23 and 26 hours a week and it was a regular schedule which I prefer. Plus it was a brand new branch of a fairly large marketing company so there was a good amount of room to grow.

About a month ago I took a new job because I was made to believe I was going to be making 9.50/hr plus commission (less per hour but a full 40 hrs so it tends to be about the same), and I would receive benefits. So I thought about it for a couple days and decided to go for it. I quit my previous job and started there. 

Unfortunately I'm not getting the amount of hours that I was promised, I'm also at a low traffic location so my commission doesn't make that much of a difference. Along with that, I have to drive so I'm spending more on gas, don't have as much free time to be a part time student, and have to pay for my home internet. 

But at the same time I hate quitting a job I just started, I like the people I work with now, and I'm not sure if my old job is still available. I liked working online a lot because I had more free time and was making a good amount of money but I was in customer service so I constantly had to deal with unrealistic expectations and rude people. 

Am I crazy for wanting to give my old manager a call to see if I can come back to my old position? ",04Feb2019,1
95,"I've been friends with B for about 6 years now, we've known eachother longer but lost contact between our first meeting and the real friendship.

Only thing is, I'm beginning to doubt this friendship. She is very sweet, but has a massive dark side that is starting to take a toll on me. A couple of years ago I heard rumors about her being a compulsive liar, of course being a friend I ignored this and told them to shut the fuck up. Unfortunatly, the last year I did start to notice small inconsistensies in her stories. The more I focussed it, the more it fell apart. I'm talking about small lies at first. The more I focussed on that, the more I started to doubt bigger things as well. To be honest, I started asking questions (not ""are u lying to me"", but for example more details about an event that happened) and she always has this peculiar way of talking when answering those questions. It is very distant, superficial and businesslike. This doesn't suit her behaviour overall. The lies I think she is telling are really big and concerning her health. 

Apart from this she is quite demanding, but gives almost nothing in return. For example, her boyfriend broke up with her in the middle of the night. Even though I had to go to work early the next morning, I went there, sat there, gave support and she thanked me. I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago (and it was a nasty break up of the wewanttobetogetherbutwecantkind) and I was just broken. But, because she had a bad day at school which I didn't ask about, she was angry with me so fucking ignored me for 2 days. Afterwards I heard she said ""Well everybody knew those two werent going to happen"" 

The thing is, she is very insecure and my point being: speaking about this with her will absolutely break the friendship. But if I don't, it will also fall apart in the next year or so I feel. I feel so bad about this and I don't know what to do. We have a lot of mutual friends as well... It sucks badly and I want to know what to do. She is very jealous and agressive when ""under attack"" (aka any remark about something she might have done in another way), so I'm so scared of her ruining my friendships by talking nasty about me, putting all the blame on me. I'm already depressed man. It's just keeping me up at night, I don't know what to do. ",04Feb2019,1
96,"Basically what the title said, my little sister is your average teenage girl with good grades and even practice ballet 3 hours daily, she usually doesn't leave the house outside school/ballet but the 2 times she has gone to a friend house, for a reunion and for a school project(different people mind you), we had to be called because she had drunk and was feeling bad

The first time was a party, my mom and I didn't think too much into it because sooner or later teenagers will try to experiment, my mom did yell at her tough to the point where my sister was crying and saying she regretted it and it wasn't worth it

Couple months later we received another call about how she drunk again and wasn't feeling well, she was supposed to be doing a school project in another friend house but I guess not. We go and pick her up and my mom exploded there, mainly because I guess she felt betrayed by my sister after she promised to not do it again. What we gather by asking one of her friends and my sister herself is that she got pressured into drinking, the same way she was pressured into drinking the first time. She told us she just wanted to fit with all the other kids. She probably feels some pressure from me and my other sister since we both had excellent grades at her age

This happened yesterday and my mom doesn't know what to do, if she tells my dad we can't imagine what kind of punishment he will think of, on the other hand, lying is never a good option for a healthy marriage. Should she go back to school on Thursday?  the same people who pressured her into drinking will gonna be there and will know what happened because my mom wasn't exactly subtle about saying how she is gonna ask the school principal to talk with the other kid's parents. What kind of punishment should my sister receive? We already talked to her and she feels sorry and full of regret but this is the second time she has done it, I don't think taking her out of ballet would be a good idea either in the long run

97,"I get anxious when I ask for annual leave in this job in general. I requested 3 days annual leave at work. 

I had it signed off by my line manager, and in this company you need it signed off by the MD too. I'm currently working on a new large project with my MP and 2 other colleagues.

When I went to my MD for sign off, they told me to run it by my MP (higher up in the food chain) first regarding the new large project. 

So I went to my MP and they rejected it stating the project is just starting and the dates I have requested are at a 'critical period'.

I don't think my annual leave reason is needed but I did mention to them it was my partner's 30th. I was and still am a bit irritated and unhappy with the situation.

I went to the HR person and expressed my unhappiness and wanted to know what 'rights' I had. 

Essentially I was told it was the rejection was fine and that I probably didn't pick my moment right and caught the MP at the wrong time...
Reason being, I had just come off medical leave due to being in a cast for a week and bedrest, there was no need for me to come in to the office, and the company doesn't have the greatest capabilities to work-from-home, all work was quicker done by my colleague than to have emailed me back and forth. 

And even in this instant, I hobbled in to work on crutches for a call with the client when I had medical leave from my doctor, my MP was in the room with me.

HR also hinted that maybe I wasn't 'showing that I was working hard' by working late. 

I don't see how my presence in the office is needed in those 3 days if I have colleagues on the project. I cannot believe that I'm needed in those 3 days or this whole thing will turn in to a shit show.

100,"I'm fucking sick of being overweight. I'm 19, 6'4'' and 265 pounds. I'm sick of having to suck in my gut to feel even remotely acceptable when I go out in public. I'm sick of being paranoid that my shirt is riding up too much. I'm sick of feeling like women are repulsed by me because of my weight. I'm sick of hating myself every time I look at myself in the mirror. I'm sick of feeling guilty when I eat anything unhealthy because I know it's only going to be part of the problem. I'm sick of hesitating to look at the number every time I step on the scale because I know I'll probably have to face the fact that I've gained even more. 

And yet, I can never *make* myself take the next step and actually start to lose weight. I always come up with excuses or things that don't actually solve the problem:

* Lately I've cut out sugary drinks like non-diet sodas (now Coke Zero is my drink of choice, whether that's for better or wose) in the hopes that that'll be enough to at least give some kind of tangible results to the point where I can prove to myself weight loss actually works.
* Going to the gym feels like an exercise in futility. It feels like everyone stares at me. I feel like a wimp for being exhausted after 30 minutes on a treadmill. I look around and everyone is in so much better shape than me that I can't help but feel like a gross fatass that doesn't belong, and that everyone is thinking exactly that.
* I'm marching DCI this summer, which I keep telling myself will force me to exercise and get in shape, but I know that it'll only help if I'm already in-shape enough to survive it. 
* I keep a vague count of calories, but eventually end up giving up because I don't know how much to limit myself to. Too many and I can't hope to work it all off, too few and my body will think I'm starving myself. I have days where I eat one meal if at all, and others where I eat four.

Different people have told me different things. My roommate has told me it's purely based on how many calories you take in versus how many you burn. The internet tells me certain foods to avoid, but the good ones I can eat as much as I like. Others say eat whatever you want, but in small portions. People tell me to skip breakfast, eat at night, run, lift weights, and it's all so fucking much that I have no idea how people lose weight and still function like normal human beings. 

So. Long story short. People who have lost substantial amounts of weight, I want to know: how did you lose that weight? I want to know what HAS worked for people, not necessarily what theoretically SHOULD. I know that this won't be easy or quick, and that it will take a lot of dedication on my part to see it through. That's why I want to make sure that whatever I try, *works.* I don't want to waste months of my life trying to lose weight through a method that isn't healthy, makes me wish I were dead, or just straight up doesn't work.

I started to get a little scared and tried to calm myself down because i knew i was panicking, i called for my mom and she told me to stop panicking, but it was so strange because i was perfectly fine, i wasnt scared of anything and i felt fine, but my body had an involuntary panic attack basically, as soon as i laid down i was perfectly fine and i still don’t understand why that wave of shock came over me when psychology i was perfectly fine and i wasn’t panicking, but physically my body was.",04Feb2019,1
109,"I kinda feel like I'm a little young to have stressed over this as much as I did, since I'm only still in highschool, but it's still been on my mind and I would really like to hear other peoples thoughts. Sorry, this is kind of long, and thank you in advance for reading:

So a while ago, (sometime in 9th grade) one of my closest friends (I'll call him Green) had asked me out. We had known each other for a couple years, and he was one of my closest friends. I told him no, because I wasn't really ready to date, and also because I'd just rather be friends with him. A little while later, I started liking a guy and dated him. Which turned out to be a massive mistake, so I ended up breaking up with a few weeks before summer break. We were moving that year, too, so by time the next school year started, I was in a new school.

After a little time passed, one of my new friends introduced me to a guy (who I'll name Toby). After talking a while, I really started to like Toby. I was super sceptical of dating anyone, however, because of how my first relationship worked out. He seemed to be nothing like the other guy though, and after a little while, I ended up dating him. Toby ended up being the best guy I could imagine being with right now, and I'm super grateful to have had the chance to be with him.

However, me and Green never stopped being friends, and even now, we still text all the time. But, while he never pressed too much about it, I know he still likes me. Every now and then, he sends stuff that shows that he still does, but I just dismissed when it happened and and moved on to something else with him. (Was that wrong of me to do? Should I have addressed earlier instead of brushing it off?)

Earlier today however, he mentioned it again, and I decided to tell him about Toby. Afterwards, I asked if he was upset, and he didn't lie when he said he was split. (Which isn't unfair of him)

We moved on and are talking about other stuff now, but I feel like its somewhat forced.

Would anything have turned out differently if I didn't wait so long to tell him? I had hoped that he would've moved on eventually, and thought I should've just waited until he did, but I couldn't look at the ""😍😘"" emojis he sent every now and then without feeling like a terrible girlfriend to Toby.

Was it wrong of me to want to just stay friends?",04Feb2019,1
110,"Just bought a wool sweater a week ago that quickly became my favorite article of clothing, ran it through the wash and dryer tonight and it came out looking like an 8 year olds sweater, I soaked it in the sink in warm water and conditioner for 10 minutes, rolled it out on a towel, stretched it a bit, and let it air dry, but I'm still pessimistic it'll come out looking the same.

What gives with washing wool? All the videos I see online talk about this tedious process to wash wool sweaters, but I know nobody sane actually has the time of day for that, do people just wash it on cold and then air dry it?

I feel incredibly depressed and stressed out. I broke my arm last year on vacation and it was an eye opener. I always got 90's in High school, I cant believe that i got kicked out my dream college because i was fucking lazy sat on Facebook all day and night (i deleted Facebook years ago btw)

I read online and saw that you can self learn programming with the plan on learning more about coding (java script, html) and more about SAP. 

I can't even intern at any company because they prefer students in their last year.

I am literally grasping on air to stay afloat. I had to turn to my family who I had no relation with for years for help. Things have improved after so much suffering and turmoil.

I plan on getting a part time job (hopefully if someone hires me) and just studying on the side.

115,"Long story, I got ridiculously drunk with some friends and ended up sharing a stupid, drunken kiss with my coworker. He wasn't being predatory or anything, just two drunk idiots not thinking next to each other at 2 am.
Immediately after this happened, I snapped out of it (interesting how these horrible things sober you up so quickly...) and immediately called my husband, who currently lives out of the state. 

I take full responsibility that I should have never been in that situation, that just because I trust my friends and have gone drinking with them a hundred times doesn't mean something bad can't happen the hundred and first. I have never done anything like this and it's completely eating me up.

The good thing is that my husband has been very understanding in the aftermath. Obviously his feelings were hurt, but he was mostly upset that I was borderline hysterical. I apologized, and we talked about my decision making that led me there. I said I should take a break from drinking for a while if I can't control my own actions. My husband just said that he loves me and that we are going to move on and not to beat myself up but just to learn from it. I also talked to my friend, who didn't even remember but apologized profusely. 

I am grateful he isn't considering leaving me or extremely angry. I love him so much. But I can't help but keep thinking about what I did. I broke my own moral code by doing something I swore I would never do (cheating). I feel like I disrespected him and our marriage vows, and I don't know how to start to move on when I'm overcome with grief and guilt over the incident. I wish I could be with him in person to talk things out  and hug. 

How do I get past this and stop feeling like the world is going to crash in on me? I'm trying to look at it from the perspective of I know now how much it hurts to disappoint my husband, and I'm going to do anything in the world to keep that from happening again, but that doesn't seem like enough.

I have never liked my dad very much, my parents were divorced when I was 3 years old and were almost always trying to find a new partner. My dad would only focus his attention on his girlfriend and her kids/nephews instead of me and my siblings though. Some examples of this are him spending Father’s Day with his girlfriend and her kids, him constantly leaving me and my siblings to hang out with his girlfriend for hours and just siding with her on every issue. I used to just deal with these problems by keeping my mouth shut and pushing through it, but now I’m 14 and am smart enough to realize I can change my problems.

Now that you have some backstory, let me tell you about his most recent girlfriend. Her name is Marylin and she has 2 kids. One of her children is a normal 16 year old girl, but the other one is mentally disabled. I don’t know what the disabled one has because whenever I ask about it I am just told by my dad to be quiet because apparently asking about what exact disability she has is offensive. My first idea was to be as rude and offensive as I could to get kicked out of my dads house, this failed because  I was sent back by my mom every time I tried. My next idea was to lay back and wait for them to eventually break up on their own, but this is not working anymore because my dad told me he wants us to move into their house in 2019. I’m now attempting to use the word “retard” and tell disabled jokes as much as possible to make my dad angry at me and snap in front of his girlfriend (who dated an abusive man before).

Starting from the beginning you know guy falls for girl, girl falls for guy what not and in about 4 months we part, sparing the details we had good times and bad but there was no reason for what happened to happen. Later on I find someone new having completely forgotten and gotten over my previous girlfriend I fall for someone new, this new relationship is still going on and has been for the past 2 or so months, and then today came. Me and two other friend decided to get together to watch the super bowl together because why not and we all have been friends for around 3-4 years so we are very close. Fast forward to about 4 hours ago we are all sitting in my friend, lets call him bob, bobs room and my other friend which we will call Jeff is siting in the corner on his phone. I'm really not sure how this whole convo even came up but Jeff brought up my ex which was strange because I actually never really told him about her. He went on  saying random stuff about her which didn't seem too out of place so i let it go on until he said ""yeah bro she actually sent me nudes once"". Upon hearing this i of course assumed it was a lame half ass joke because knowing him he tended to joke around a lot and mess with me. I just said heh yeah right in a joking way because i know he tends to create bull shit stories. He replied ""no dude I'm serious, i mean we weren't dating it was kind of a side hoe thing"". Both of them obviously having no knowledge that I was actually had a intimate relationship with this girl were confused. ""Wait what? when did you get these pictures"" I replied confused. He said idk like last march which was around the last two months of me and my ex's relationship. I, hoping this was not true got into an argument with him about how he was lying and there was no way she would ever do that, he was very confused and started yelling back getting mad wondering why i was so mad at him. I then ran outside and looked deep into my contacts to find my ex's old number and called it, oh boy do i regret doing that. She picks up the phone after one ring concluding with science. ""Did you ever send pictures to Holden when we were dating , and i know im probably getting pranked right now but if im not don't give me bullshit just tell me"" there was a long pause followed by a bunch of her bullshit about how it wasent really that big of a deal blah blah blah don't get mad at me. After a long confusing convo I hung up and called my current girlfriend telling her everything about how my ex cheated on me with my best friend and i was just finding out now.

129,"So long story short, one of my girlfriend's roommates (we'll just call her Karen cause nobody likes a Karen) who is a mural friend of mine got a dog (most likely a boxer pitbull puppy mix) this past May. She was great at feeding him, taking him out for walks, playing with him, etc. Overall she was a great dog mom.  They live in a relatively small  apartment that does not have access to a yard and is located next to a busy Street so letting him out is a not an option. The apartment is a 4 minute drive to miles of coastal beach that allow dogs even off leash (winter time) and there is a public dog park a few minutes more in the opposite direction. Karen met a guy and started dating him at the end of summer, and would often ask him to take the dog out for her, feed him, etc.  The dog is almost a year and a half now and is not properly trained (jumps on people, steals things, tears things apart, whines constantly, sometimes nips/bites us especially when being playful). Whenever people come over the dog  acts like a feral hyena while Karen  just sits there asking it nicely to calm down Saying thinks like ""Baxter, please don't jump, we don't do that here"". We all say how extremely poorly trained he is, yet Karen does not discipline the dog but offers him treats when being bad in order to get him to stop doing what it is he's doing.

Anyway Karen recently got a job which she works 40-60 hours a week with about 8 hours of commuting on top of that. She often leaves the dog for my girlfriend and thier other roommate or bf to take care of (feed, play with, take out to potty, etc.) Since they are in grad school and are home more often than Karen is.

Often times though, Karen and her bf will leave for work at 7-8 am, work all day, come home for 15-20 minutes, change, eat a snack and head to the gym for an hour or 2. This brings us to around 6-7 or even 8pm  at night on some nights. She'll then feed the dog and ask it to sit with them on the couch while they eat. Karen will sometimes go out for drinks after that and will not return until 11 or midnight. Having never given the dog exercise, taking it out to potty, or playing with it.

Both roommates talk about how horrible the dog is to me whenever I show up and how bad he had been or what have you. Yet they are both too shy to bring it up with Karen because they don't want to cause tension with her. I've said a few things but my gf always tells me a few days later that she overhears Karen complaining about how I talk to her about her lack of dog skills to Karen's best friends who have also tried to tell her her dog is untrained and not properly cared for.

How can we tell Karen what she is doing is considered Animal Neglect and make it a point that if we weren't there to care for her dog that we'd report it but in a nice way?",04Feb2019,1

When we first got together, he didn’t stand up for me to her even when she hit an all time low and sent naked pictures to him. She would constantly trash talk me (he and I got together about a year and a half after their divorce) and try to get back together with him. He never defended me and would just ignore her sexual comments and constant efforts to rekindle things. This ended with me resenting him and basically falling out of love four months or so into being married.

Over the past 6 months, his son has lived with us exclusively and I have been tasked with doing 100% of the housework, child rearing, and working full time. He will work weekends and come home to just expect a cold beer waiting and leave me with zero options for a break myself. I feel like I’m just a convenience rather than a partner.

There was a big honeymoon period and everything was great. I was extremely lonely before I met her and I think her asking me out excited me so much that it clouded my judgement.  


With time and familiarity I've come to realize that she's very immature and lacks any self motivation or goals. And I've come only recently to find out that she's schizophrenic and has delusional episodes where she sees figures and it makes her freak out. I've found out that she doesnt brush her teeth and she showers once weekly.  


She genuinely loves me, and we're together all the time. We sleep in the same dorm, walk to classes together, eat lunch alone together. I would love to make friends with people of my major but I feel trapped because she always needs my help or attention in some way.   


I've met her parents and grandparents and theyve been great to me, fed me and gave me a place to stay over school breaks, etc. Her mom even got me nice boots for christmas.  


But her immaturity and lack of values or drive makes me yearn for someone more fitting for me.  


She's told me before that if i died, she would kill herself, and that I'm her only reason for living, I fear that if I end the relationship I could be responsible for her harm.  


I don't know if I should just accept her flaws and be happy that someone loves me, or if I should leave her and look for a better match. I'd hate to see us grow to be a dysfunctional and eventually divorced couple like my parents were.

I explained to my mother that my aunt would pay her own and my father his, but my mom insisted that if my aunt shows up and sits at the table, my mom would stand up and leave right there in front of everyone. 

My mom started blaming me for letting my father invite my aunt after all that’s happened.
What happened is that my aunt sent my mom a message on new years day saying that she was not letting my father see me and my brothers, that my mom was being childish by taking us away from him (which isn’t true).  

Then my mother told me that I must tell my dad that she would not tolerate my aunt going to my graduation, and that it was all my fault. 

So now I don’t know what to do, because my dad will get mad at my mom and she would be getting in a lot of trouble with my dad’s family. 

Its my graduation, I just want to have a good time with my friends and not worry about this whole mess that is not my fault at all.
I can’t tell my aunt I don’t want her to go because she would do horrible things to my family and my dad would also get mad at me and blame me and my mother, but I also don’t want my mom not to go to my graduation.

142,"It is a long story and I’d be so grateful if anybody read this. Basically, I was best friends with this girl since 7th grade. It ended last May, the end of 10th grade, because I was not being a good friend to her in the months leading up to then. During those months, there was this new girl who entered the picture and I gave her most of my attention, I’d often brush my best friend to the side without even realizing it. I admit that I overlooked her a lot. I was so blinded by this new girl who was quite controlling and I’d put her first because she would get mad at me if I didn’t, and I was afraid of that. My best friend saw very clearly how controlling this girl was and grew frustrated with how I’d continue to give her my attention even though I was pretty miserable. The truth is I was afraid of everything. I was afraid of people being mad at me and I was too afraid to stick up for myself. I tried to balance between the two of them but I’d end up neglecting my best friend, and most of the time I wouldn’t realize because I was too busy worrying about the other girl getting mad at me. Eventually, my best friend had enough and decided she was fed up with the situation she was in; she was frustrated watching me give this other girl all this attention when she treated me horribly. One day she told me she didn’t want to be friends anymore because it was one-sided and I was negative and judgmental. She stopped talking to me completely and blocked me on social media. She had no friends after that and I always saw her alone. I heard that she started drinking and going to parties. 
Fast forward to December, I decided to finally cut off the other girl. It was an awful friendship in which I cried at and after school daily. I often thought about suicide and overall felt absolutely terrible. I’ve stopped talking to that girl completely. 
Fast forward to now. The second semester of 11th grade just started, and I had my first class of the year with her on Friday. Seeing her again and hearing her voice and laugh did something to me. I haven’t stopped thinking about our friendship all weekend. It’s really eating me up. I regret the way I treated her more than anything. I know I wasn’t a good friend, I know. I regret it every day. I’ve been having dreams in the past months about her really often. Good dreams where we are friends again, like old times. Dreams where she suddenly talks to me again and we have good times together. Waking up in the morning sucks when I have those dreams because I realize it’s not real and I wish so desperately that it were. 
Both she and that other girl have gotten closer now. I see them laugh and talk at school. I can only imagine that they talk about how they both hate me and bond over their mutual feelings towards me. It’s weird to see because back when we were all on talking terms, they really didn’t like each other. But now they’re friends. 
I wish that I had the guts to just tap her on the shoulder and ask if we could talk. I want to apologize to her but I feel like she hates me so much that she’ll tell me to fuck off or something. I’m so afraid to do that. I’m afraid to even make eye contact with her because I feel so guilty and stupid. I’m not asking to be best friends again, I just want to be on talking terms again. But I feel like she hates me so strongly and would not want to hear it. I miss her but I am too afraid to do anything. ",04Feb2019,1
143,"Hi, I am in a leadership position that I worked my ass off to get by being the absolute best in my position. I know for a *fact* that I'm not getting paid what I should but I kind of had hope that I would get to the next position quickly but now that I'm in management, I have so much to juggle so everytime I make a mistake, its taken seriously by the people above me and that makes it hard to ask for a promotion, because there is so much work to be done, i just can't handle it some days. I am capable, and I *am* great at my jog, or so I think. I am only getting about 50 cents more than my subordinates and I'm not only responsible for my huge workload but I literally got written up the other day because someone didn't do something K had already written them up for the previous day. They said it was my fault because I didn't ""follow up"". I've already been told that my shift is the hardest shift and they don't know how I do it, and yet they're reprimanding me whenever something isn't perfect. There's also a faulty grading system for which they use to do my performance reviews and ""help"" me get my raises, and it's unfair because it's based on results and not behavior or actual work. Great example would be the amount of good reviews I get on my shift by the time the quarter is up. I work I work the shift least likely to get reviews based on the time of day. So I could be working harder than another manager and my numbers can still reflect worse. 


On one hand I dont want to invest energy into something that is wasteful. On the other hand i don't want to give up and pass up on the experience to become more well rounded.

144,"Throwaway because it’s kinda embarrassing. I’m (24M) a straight male (born male) who has been mistaken twice that I know of as a transgender person.

Once, had an acquaintance ask a friend if I was transgender man, the other and most embarrassing time, had a bartender ask me, in front of my girlfriend, what she should refer to me as. I can only assume she thought I was transgender. This has happened twice in my life both in the past 2 years, and it really shook my confidence.

I have a pretty severe baby face and am fairly short (5’9). I have to keep my face shaved for work, but I don’t have a high voice, long hair, or dress out of the ordinary.

Not sure why this has started to happen, I don’t look much different (other than aging) than I ever have before.

I’m going to be moving and looking for a new job soon and I’m worried it could affect my career if people perceive me as transgender (discrimination sucks but it’s real) and it has definitely affected my confidence and given me anxiety when meeting new people.

145,"First off, this is a repost from r/FriendshipAdvice (identical first post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/amlqc9/long_distance_friend_of_a_decade_ghosted_me_whats/)) because I'm new to reddit and don't know where the active/helpful subreddits are. If this is breaking a rule please let me know but I only got one response on my other post and I'm hoping for multiple perspectives if possible.

So to start, I (21F) have known this guy (about 3 years older than me, our future Ghost) for many years and have been close with his family since middle school. We come from a  conservative background, but he and I have always been more progressive than most of the people we grew up with. I moved out of state for college while he and most of the rest of our high school friends went to state schools a few hours from home. We hung out *around* each other a lot in high school but became much closer when we were both living independently and started experimenting with sex/alcohol/weed (which none of our other friends would dream of.) We'd text nearly every day and when I was sexually assaulted sophomore year he was the only person I felt like I could talk to about it. We had brief flings here and there that always ended with him meeting someone local or us deciding we were better off as platonic friends (which we are, that's not just a line.) We've always been good at communicating clearly with one another and when we pushed each others buttons (it  happened a lot) we could generally resolve it quickly and move on with a better understanding of one another.

Fast forward to this past summer. Ghost was abroad for the summer and we didn't talk as much due to time zones. I got drunk one night, slept with one of my close male friends at school (call him R), and it turned into the healthiest, happiest relationships I've ever been in. My relationship with R got very intense very fast, and excluding our respective visits home every few months we haven't spent a day apart since September/October maybe. Obviously this has changed the dynamics of many of my friendships, but he's always been supportive of my independence and my friends love him almost as much as I do. My friendship with Ghost understandably makes him uncomfortable given our history, but I haven't seen Ghost in year and have never had a problem with monogamy anyway, so it never caused a problem for the relationship.  Despite that, I can admit I invested less energy in my friendship with Ghost than I used to so R wouldn't feel any reason to worry. Ghost got back to the states a few months ago and I found we had less to talk about now that I was out of the dating pool and had my mental health in a better place. He had changed also, as people do when they live abroad, and I liked his new open-mindedness but was annoyed by his new condescending attitude. I also felt he was unsupportive of my relationship, so I tried to bring R into our conversations less.  Naturally we drifted apart a bit, which is normal as people grow and  situations change. Regardless, I still consider him family and had no intention of cutting him out of my life any time soon.

I  can't tell you quite when his attitude changed, but as winter set in Ghost got very distant. He rarely if ever texted me first, his responses  to my texts got less thoughtful and open-ended, and he would never respond to my snapchats. The last time we spoke was Christmas Eve when I sent him a meme and got a half-assed response. I found out later via his Instagram that he spent several days in town hanging out with our friends and didn't even tell me he was home for the holidays. I was hurt and stopped trying to initiate conversation after that. I've included him in drunk mass snapchats maybe twice since then and, as usual, got no response.

At this point, I've given up on the friendship. I've never been one to force people to be in my life, and if he's done being my friend then that's his choice. However, I do feel like I'm owed an explanation. We've seen each other through too  much shit and been too close for too long for him to do something as juvenile as ghost me. What I don't want to do, however, is text him out of the blue sounding whiny or entitled to attention. I guess what I'm asking is this: do I let him go his own way without ever knowing why and take the injustice on the chin, or do I call him out (and if so, how?)  Any and all objective insight is welcome. If you think I was an ass in some way, I want to know if I need to apologize. And if there's a subreddit better suited for this question, please let me know as I'm new to the site. I'm just seeking some clarity here and maybe some closure if that's possible.

151,"Hey Reddit,

I’m a 21 year old female and I have a pretty negative relationship with my parents since my childhood. When I was younger and still to this day, I blame my parents for all my mental illnesses which I’ve experienced and one of the reasons I feel like this is because they have compared me to my brother numerous amount of times, and sing praises about how they wish they have had 1000 more sons like him but never talk about me like that to anyone of their friends, family members they are close with. 

I want to say that my childhood is a pretty interesting one because I’m the youngest of my family and my extended family from both my parents’ side are older than me by 10 years at least, so for me going to any family events when I was younger consisted of me being older individuals boring myself to death (or annoying my older cousins because what can a 8 year old talk about with a 24 year old). The only kids around my age that I could have played with that were around my age were with my friends from school and the kids the lived in my neighbourhood. However, whenever I got invited to a birthday party from a kid from school and it required my parents to go out of their way to drive me to said kid’s birthday party, they would make an excuse to not take me the day of the party and I wouldn’t be allowed to go. Looking back at this now just really irritates me because as this progressed throughout the years, I picked up a habit where my parents would decide to make the call that I wasn’t allowed to go to these parties, or even hang out with my friends and I would bail on them the same day. In regards to the children who lived on my street, my parents would only let me hang out with my friends who lived on the same street as myself, but for the kids (and my best friend) who lived on the other street, my parents banned me from crossing the road and eventually my friends started excluding me from hanging out with them because I wasn’t allowed to cross the road or go to a friends’ house. 

Moving from my childhood, to my teenage years I became a sneaky child because my parents were really strict. My friends all moved away in my neighbourhood by the time I was 11/12 so during summer break I would read books and write short stories. My friends from school would all be hanging out or something but I was never allowed to meet up with them anywhere, neither did I have the permission to use any social media to contact them until I got a phone when I started high school. Eventually I started dating a boy at the age of 15, and we got caught butt naked after a year of dating by my parents. My parents reacted to what I believed was to be expected, with them taking away my phone for nearly three years as well as restricting my access to any forms of social media and any after school clubs. I was not allowed to really have friends and I didn’t really have any friends and by the time I was able to afford my own phone and pay for my own phone bills I was already too socially awkward and I was unable to upkeep any of my friendships. 

Today, I’m a 21 year old female, and since I’ve completed high school I’ve been working and going to school full time, never asking my parents for any money since I started making my own. I’ve been a lot more annoyed these days because I’m graduating in a couple of months, I have a full time job where I make a good income for my age and I’m giving my parents money every month to help cover some expenses for themselves. However, my parents are still continuously ruining my social life because I have a curfew at 10 pm every night. Every time I go out, I get interrogated or I’m simply told that I cannot go out because I have gone out too much already etc but whenever I try to negotiate with them with my curfew it always turns to an argument because my parents are too ignorant to listen to me and thinks that I shouldn’t have a later curfew. To top it all off, my parents won’t let me drive alone either, although I do believe that I’m a good driver since I have had enough practice with my driving instructor and also with my parents, brother or my boyfriend. 

I personally do not think any of this is fair to me because I really do think that my parents damaged my ability to be in a social setting without being extremely awkward. But most importantly I believe that my parents’ interference with my life has led me to resent them because I’m not able to make any meaningful relationships with “friends” because I have a curfew at 10 pm which is just the beginning of the night for my friends and also because I cannot take my brother’s car (which he has granted me permission to use) because according to my parents, it’s because they said so. I’m not really too sure what to do because if I tell my parents I’m going to move out, or I’m going to take the car they’ll go through a toxic series of thinking I’m being irrational to them throwing insults at me and then guilting me into making me believe I’m wrong in the situation even though I’m not. 

I’ve looked at options about moving out, and although I’m legally an adult my parents have made it clear to me that I’m “not allowed to” because it’s not apart of our culture or tradition for someone that’s not married to move out.

Can anyone relate or give me any advice on how to deal with strict parents who are continuously ruining your life? 

TL;DR my parents have been strict and toxic since day 1 and I feel like it has mentally damaged me and my life. ",04Feb2019,1

154,"I'm not sure if this is the correct forum to post this in. 

A lot of my anxiety when it comes to forming friendships comes from my inability to be authentic and problems with approving of my behaviors. 

I often feel like I can't express what I think or how I feel on the spot or in real life. This is obviously a problem because most interactions occur face to face. 

I was never concerned with defining myself, but up until 19 I felt very content with who I was. After 20 I feel like I lost my identity and with that I lost all of my interests. Now that I'm 22 I want to become the person I was. After trying for a while I've come to the conclusion it's better to bury who I was and create someone knew. This has been proven to be the tough part as I lack consistency with who I am, if that makes sense. 

Throughout college I've met people and have experienced anxiety but never in relation to connecting with people. I wouldn't engage with them first out if fear but once I did I was never concerned with them not liking me. 

This changed when I met someone I'll refer to as R. I think very highly of R, they're sweet, funny, caring, thoughtful, smart, [keep inserting positive adjectives]. R is just a genuine and wholesome person. R is also very peculiar and interesting. 

We met through a mutual friend but for about two years only spoke via text message. I would experience anxiety when speaking to R but was able to feel uninhibited for a while. 

Then I started to feel ALMOST as though I needed R's approval and felt very anxious during our chats. R isn't mean or rude, so these feelings aren't caused by anything they're doing. I managed to keep this feeling under control up until I met R about a week ago. Ever since then I haven't been able to speak to them like I normally did. I feel as though I'm inhibited and not myself. I also feel annoying and boring. Usually I have to fight the urge to stop talking to everyone because I feel embarrassed. 

I hate these reactionary feelings and not having control over what I do, say and think. 

I've tried journalling, I've tried rationalizing my thoughts since I know there's no real reason to feel this way, I've tried pushing through these feelings to no avail. 

What else can I do to be comfortable around my friends? How can I stop feeling like a phony all the time?

156,"So, I dated this girl about 4 years ago for less than a year. The relationship was very unhealthy to say the least and I eventually ended it and never looked back, glad to have moved on.

Over the years she'd occasionally try to get in contact (trying to follow me on social media, messages, etc), however, lately she's been more persistent than ever. She's even gone to the point of following me on PlayStation for God's sake.

157,"Okay, here I go. I have planning on writing this up for a long time, and have been thinking about this constantly. I just didn't know who to go to and what to say, but this is the last straw.

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently moved twice, less than six months apart. I was okay with the first move, since I didn't really have any friends, or anyone I deeply cared about. However, the second move was heartbreaking, as I had made my first friend, at the age of 14. I have been struggling heavily since then, crying nearly every night. I have no motivation for anything, and haven't talked to anyone in a while. I mostly spend my life burning time on Reddit, and Overwatch.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad hates it when I cry, and I cry often. He believes that ""boys don't cry,"" and threatens to beat me when I do. He has anger issues, and has beat me in the past.

\[Possible trigger warning\]

I have a detailed memory of me curling up on the ground in fear, in a fetal position, and him kicking me until my nose started to bleed, and it has stuck with me since then. Although he has tried to control himself recently, he still loses his temper often.

\[Trigger warning over\]

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is exremely narcissistic. Although she hasn't physically beat me much, she has mentally scarred me. She does not care for me at all. She constantly yells at me for the smallest things, and makes herself the victim. For example, this specific interaction takes place in our household at least twice a week: I try to get something to eat, or make something, or am eating something she made, and I make a small mess. I offer to clean it up, and she responds with: ""You are just going to make it worse. You can't clean anything. I look like a servant to you, huh, you keep making messes and I keep cleaning them. Ungrateful child.""

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have insanely high expectations, and I have never seen them be proud of me, despite the pain I have gone through to make them happy. The entire family is Indian, and I have spent over 8 years of my life in India, so education is important. My parents coerced me into taking the SAT in sixth grade, and to take Algebra I, Algebra II, Honors English 9, 10 in seventh grade. In eighth grade, it only got worse, and it was around the time I developed an anxiety disorder. They signed me up for Honors English 11-12, Geometry, and Precalc, and AP Comp Sci which had never been done before in the history of the advanced program I was taking. Three courses had never been taking, and even the director of the program told us not to do it, and unenrolled me. My parents fought with the program director to let me take the classes, and they won. I tried many times to drop out of Honors English 11-12, and my parents said they would wholeheartedly support me if I wanted to. However, they bribed me with a gaming PC, and overall coerced me, constantly telling me that just wait till the end of the semester, and to wait a bit longer, but never did.

&amp;#x200B;

I still managed to get an A in everything, giving up all the free time I had, and never hanging out with friends. I thought it would finally make my parents happy, if I did all this. But it never did. They always showed me headlines of a 12 year old starting a company or getting into college early. They always compared me to others; they always wanted more. And I just couldn't keep up.

He thinks that if I am officially diagnosed with anxiety and depression, it will ruin my chances of getting into a good college, and that is everything to my parents. My mom on the other hand, doesn't even believe in mental illnesses, and mocks me for ""having anxiety."" When I am crying, she even pretend-cries to mock me. I have no clue how to seek professional help. What should I do to get treatment?

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think this was my fault. My parents always told me how privileged I was, and that I had no reason to be sad. However, a week ago, I found [this letter](https://imgur.com/a/k8n30q5) by my sister (10), that showed me that maybe it isn't my fault after all, but my parents. My sister reads upwards of 10 hours a day, and barely talks to anyone. I don't want her to go through the same things I did. Today she came to me crying, after my mom had slapped her for holding her food the wrong way, as it could make a mess. What should I do, Reddit, for both my mental health, and the future of my sister?",04Feb2019,1
159,"Hello! I was invited last Friday to a game night at a friend of a friend’s house. They have this really adorable new rag doll kitty that’s around 6 months old and are new pet owners. There were some things that raised some alarm for me on how they treated their cat. 

1. They constantly pick up their cat [by the scruff of its neck](https://imgur.com/a/eZ4U3GE) to move it from one place to another. You’re not supposed to do this. This small patch of skin cannot comfortably supports the cat’s entire body weight comfortably and can be potentially painful for the cat. 

2. They punish their cat by locking it in the bathroom, squirting water in its face, or knocking it on the head lightly whenever the cat scratches at the couch. Punishing cats don’t work because it doesn’t teach cats what to do. When you punish cats for behaviors you find unpleasant, the cat will associate the punishment with whoever is delivering the message — not with his own behavior. 

I don’t want to overstep any boundaries since they’re not my friends so I’m not sure what is acceptable. I’m not an expert or veterinarian; I am just really obsessed with cats. What should I do (if I should do anything)? ",04Feb2019,1
160,"I’ve had issues with accidentally breaking things due to carelessness that I really want to be able to curb from happening in the future. Just as an example, I busted up my car (turned a corner into a narrow parking space too quickly/overshot the angle and hit a pole) and cracked the screen of my phone (although the cracks arent very large or noticeable, I was carrying some stuff out of a car and didnt realize my phone was mixed up in the jacket I was holding and it fell out of it and onto the street) within days of each other (my phone being only a couple of weeks old). Although it’s rare for incidents like these to happen so close to one another time-wise, making these kinds of mistakes isn’t entirely new. I am extremely frustrated with myself and just want to know how to be more careful in the future and make that mentality stick.
My issue is that I’ll be mindful for a while and think I’ve gotten the hang of curbing my behavior and then a couple of years or so later, I do something like this again. 
For people who have these same issues or are just more careful in general, do you have any tips to help out? I’d rather save myself from spending a couple of hundred dollars on my own screw ups in the future if I can. ",04Feb2019,1
161,"So over the weekend I’ve been moving all my belongings into a new apartment in my hometown. Everything was going well, met a few neighbors who are nice enough or kept to themselves. Seemed pretty perfect. I have to wait until Thursday until my internet provider comes out and hooks everything up, so I’ve been living at my parents and bringing my belongings over car by car each day. My realtor, building manager and landlord all seem very reasonable.

Today my dad and I were picking up a bed frame that the store realIzed was too small and replaced and we hung up a portrait. I’m in a basement apartment. On the next floor up, across the hall all of a sudden we hear someone screaming. He is livid and telling someone to “shut the fuck up” and more. He’s just angrily going off on them without any care, and as loudly as possible. As we’re leaving he even opens the door and continues yelling at this person in the apartment. I didn’t hear any response from them, just his yells. I went outside and packed some baskets into my car, and saw him exit and continue to yell “this fucking door” as he walked out to his car to grab something and go back inside.

When I got back to my parents house I immediately texted the realtor about it. She was very concerned and said she hopes it may be because it was the super bowl, but she said she’s going to contact the previous tenant to see if he ever noticed this behavior. She told me if I hear it again it’d be a good idea to anonymously call the police, but I also worry that since I’m the new person if this has been going on a while I’ll be targeted. I think in the morning I am also going to contact the landlord as well about this. If I see my other neighbors perhaps I can talk to them about if this is a common occurrence.

I’m super worried this is domestic abuse and I have no really good idea about how to handle it. I’m also worried that I just signed on to this apartment and services and have committed to a year, but also wasn’t made aware that this was a situation (was told the area was crime free and quiet). But I’ve also just gotten everything moved and have no idea what I’d do if I had to suddenly leave now. I’m sure my parents could take me back for a bit, but it’s a lot for sure. I definitely would appreciate any advice you could provide.",04Feb2019,1

167,"As the title suggests, my bestfriend who I have known since I was 11 (I'm 32 now) is a heroin addict and actually I'm finding out she pretty much does anything anyone hands her. I love this girl, she was there when my 1st daughter was born. I was there for her daughter's birth. Her mom is no better and used to drop her at my house in the middle of the night when we were kids because her husband and herself were in another one of their many drunken fights. She's lived a hard life and unfortunately she let it take her.

She asked me about 2 weeks ago if she could please bring her son and herself to our home. She begged saying she was ready to quit and didn't have any other way out. She had overdosed a week earlier and has since been hospitalized 2 or 3 times. It's some crazy shnit. For a little backstory here...I had my own battle years ago when the pill mill state (FL) really was going crazy. I was lucky. I saw that I was going to die and I wasn't ready and someone helped me save myself and I've been sober for 9 years. So I understand what she's going through somewhat and I think she thinks if I can do so can she. And I mean, that's true. I'm not some crazy superhuman I just made a choice to get sober and I've been lucky i haven't slipped in this many years. Plus...we are bestfriends...or used to be. I don't really know who that person on the phone was...

 I want to help her AND her innocent son. I want her to stay with me and help her get thru the withdrawals and get her into a program. She lives in Florida, always has. Has never been out of that state. I live in Oklahoma and moved here about 7 years ago after I married. Maybe if she was out of her ""comfort zone"" and couldn't initially find anything because she wouldn't know anyone then that would help? I had to leave that place too and it was a huge factor in my sobriety. But she keeps trying to control the situation, changing the rules, not listening. So, I went back on it and didn't get her. Then today she's text yelling at me saying she thought I was on my way (I had already said I wasn't coming because I couldn't put myself or my family in danger) but she obviously chose to miss that info drop? Her mother and her son's fathers mom called me begging...BEGGING me to come get her. Basically like this ""she's already died once (the OD) and she's going to die again if she doesn't get out of here! Please help her YOU HAVE TO!"" No pressure, right? When my friend finally got back in touch with me tonight...it was a jumbled mess. I'm truly out of ideas. I want to help but I am officially scared out of my mind. 

Also, she was supposed to help fund this 17+ hour roadtrip one way and she got $400 together. She spent it in less than 48 hours. So am I also supposed to fully become financially responsible for her and her son? The 2 moms said they would ""chip in"" and I'm thinking...""what? You're gonna give me a 10 spot when I get there??"" I don't know what to do so the question is obviously, what should I do? How should I handle this? If she did, God forbid, OD and it was the one that takes her...idk... I'm suddenly feeling very responsible for 2 humans I'm not related to, I didn't birth or marry.

168," Hi just wanted to explain the situation. First off, 22 F here, 3rd Year In Biology.   

I met my friend group during first year orientation, and expanded from there with friends we all met till there were at 11 of us. We mostly hangout as small groups of 2-4 people anyway but chill as a whole if we have a big event or whatever.  

To cut it short, theres a main group with me in it and 4 others which is the group i want to talk about.  When I talked to them before, they were actually good people and I enjoyed talking to them, got really close to one because of same love for kdramas lol. But recently I started not liking what and how they were treating me and made me feel like shit a couple of times.  Not really that smart so marks are fairly average, i do aim to get better tho all the time. But there are these two people in my group who are very rude to me calling me dumb and stupid or even one time said “I doubt u’ll be getting a good job when you graduate” which is really low. That happened a long time ago but still left a blow. One of the them even changed seats to a spot with another person in our group during a project meeting when I just came to sit down and that made me feel really bad because it made me think  “oh wow just cuz the other guy is smarter than me?” 

 The one friend i got close with and could even call my best friend, i find out is really toxic as well. She’d take advantage of people, calling them out or treat them like shit if things didn’t go her way. (Including me too). She just copies work and pairs herself with one of the smarter people in our group to get good marks and denies that she does it and one time, in an exam that almost no one in group was ready for, non chantingly just copied the guy in front of hers, she told me about it and said they looked right anyway and that he was “literally” asking to be copied with how he was sitting.She ended up getting a good mark, flaunted it to everybody who was struggling.  Mostly everything she talks about now are the guys shes going on dates with and met on tinder because shes single now, and its getting really annoying cuz I’d want to talk actual productive work. I still vibe with her with her kdrama tastes, but other than that she got really irritating. 

 Another thing is that one of the people in the group also goes to the same club as me since first year, and most of them also started to chill in the clubroom where I’m in as well. It’s like theres no escape!  

The other people in the group are more acquaintances but still chill with everyone that’s why I have no idea what to do! I chill with my Hs friends or even church friends sometimes, but they go to a diff university and have there own college friends as well that they hangout with so its kinda hard.   

Any suggestions on what I can do? Its hard tryna find another group in 3rd year because of everyone has established groups already. There’s this one guy in my group who’s also sort of isolating himself as well but is in different classes with them. (I’m in almost all of theirs.) ",04Feb2019,1

171,"long story short. i met this girl online. we met up before, fooled around with a bit, was able to titty fuck her boobs. she has J cups, but she is a really big girl (essentially overweight/obese)

she has no problems letting me see her and titty fucking her regularly, but she wants me to pay her, guess you can say it's prostitution. she's asking for $200 for the next meet up we have and then $100 for all subsequent meet ups. she basically told me i can titty fuck her multiple times, bust as many nuts as i want, record it if i wanted to, whatever positions, etc etc. only downsides would be: as i mentioned she is really large and objectively a 4 or 5 out of 10 to give you an idea. she also has a personality that can be very annoying at times. those are basically the two downsides

my question is, do you think this is a good deal that i should take? $200 for the next meet up, but all next meet ups are $100 each and basically she will let me have her on call, really big tits too. doesn't sound too bad..... fairly cheap too compared to getting a full blown hooker for a half hour and only getting 1 pop. thoughts?",04Feb2019,1
175,"This is my first reddit post and I'm on mobile at the moment so if my grammar and formatting are horrible I'm sorry in advance.

I have been diagnosed with depression for a little over three years and I've struggled with self-harm. I tried to go to therapy to talk about it and see how I could manage my depression. At first the therapy was somewhat helping but I have bad problems trusting people enough to tell them how I feel and I also struggle talking to people. After a couple of sessions (which was once a week) I could tell that my therapist wasnt all that interested in helping so I stopped being open on how I was feeling. A couple more sessions past and the therapist says they can't help me anymore if I won't be open about it and I stop going.

The healthcare center is known for not being a good place to go if you have mental problems such as depression and anxiety disorders but it's the only one in the area since it's a relatively small city.

When I had stopped going to therapy  my depression wasn't that bad and overall I would be content and sometimes happy with my days so stopping wasn't really a problem at the time. If anything ever happened I could talk to my boyfriend and he'd help me through it. I'm not at all close to my family and struggle telling them how I feel.

Recently my depression has been getting worse and I've been struggling to do alot of normal things (e.g. getting out of bed, sleeping, eating properly). Ive been having suicidal thoughts and I'm too scared to be open with my family about it and don't know how to tell them about it either. I also don't want to go back to the healthcare center because I know it won't be any help whatsoever.

What should I do?

177,"hello. first, id like to state that i’m underage and still living under my parents’ roof. so there’s nothing i can do about anything.

i have depression + anxiety + adhd (all professionally diagnosed). my parents seem to be against the fact i have adhd and call me spoiled instead. i am hurting so much and all they do is make it worse. i have friends (who have helped me so much, in more ways than my parents) i can’t talk to or see for the dumbest reasons.

everything they do makes all of my problems (the three mentioned above) worse. they make jokes about them, even after i tell them not to, and it makes me question if there’s actually something wrong or if i am just the spoiled brat they think i am.

they’re so strict. i promise you it’s not me being spoiled. they won’t allow things for the dumbest reasons. i don’t understand them. they won’t even put me on meds for my adhd because 1) “i don’t have it” and 2) “they’ll mess me up” but they fail to see how much adhd negatively impacts me daily.

i’m scared my dad might actually hit me. other than spankings when i was younger, he never touched me. there was one time when he was really angry with my and smacked my bowl of food out of my hand and made me clean it up. but that was the bowl, not me. each time he’s mad, i see it in his eyes. i feel that he wants to hurt me. he hasn’t yet, but i’m scared he will. 

not parent related. school isn’t my thing. my grades are dropping fast and there’s nothing i can do about it. i can’t understand the material no matter how hard i try. i know i will never be successful. my plan is genuinely to die before 25 so i don’t have to worry about anymore stuff like that. i know i’ll never amount to anything.

i have a problem with self - harming. recently, ive been trying to stop. i hadn’t done it for 29 days, until tonight (‘twas a bad night). 

i just lost my best friend. argument, didn’t end well. “are we even friends anymore?” i asked him. “idk honestly” was his answer. 

i do not want to continue living. i don’t see the point anymore. i don’t want to feel like this but I can’t help it.

180,"Hey everyone, I \[M\] want to say thanks in advance for any advice or help you can give me. I have never posted something like this before, and I would love to hear an outsider’s opinion on this.

Alright, so it all started when I began to like this girl, who for the sake of this post will be referred to as Carter, about three years ago. I would call it a crush, but it was more of an infatuation, as I could count on one hand the amount of real interactions I have had with her. Now Carter can turn some heads, as it is no secret that many (both guys and girls) are seeking her attention. To me, this seemed to place me at the bottom of the 'romance list', as we attend an athletics focused school, of which Carter actively participates in, whereas I am more unathletic and nerdy in comparison. No shame in it, but compared to some of these others, I didn’t fancy my odds. However, Carter is also very intelligent, meaning we both reside within a relatively small advanced placement branch in our high school, so we shared mutual classes for several periods throughout the day, albeit our seating was always at furthest sides of the room from each other. 

I can only describe it as some weird kind of torture. Torn between satisfaction of stealing a glance at her when the teacher turns their back, and a subtle anger at myself for how pathetic it must of looked, then repeating daily. Hat-trick there, I guess. Like the overthinking, affection-longing boy I was (and still am), I constantly looked for any excuse to talk to her, as an unprompted approach might make me seem creepy. I wouldn’t go so far as to say there was anything like a clique involved, but it would have been clear I wanted something.  The opportunity never arose needless to say until first semester last year, when I -for better or worse- did just that anyway.

As a little context, I began to slowly get bolder with the encouragement of my friends, and the bullying of myself, to take action. It was junior year, and I had learned that Carter and I took the same path on the way to our Physics class, which was on the other side of the school. Considering it was about a five minute walk, I figured this was my opening, as there was plenty of physics related nonsense  that we could complain about together. This was the chance I had waited for! Despite that, it took a few days for me to work up the nerves, but I did eventually break out of my shell and initiate conversation. In fact over the next few days, she started some herself, leaving me shocked at how well things were going. Being the generally shy guy I am, I became pretty confident. Looking back, perhaps…too confident? I followed her on social media, and then sent her a text, which given we still didn’t know each other that well yet, I may have been rushing it a little. Nevertheless, what was done can’t be changed and after a sparse two or three responses, I was getting a strong vibe that she wasn’t nearly as engaged as I was. Maybe I psyched myself out, but I tried a week later and had similar results. I didn’t say anything expressing overt interest beyond friendship, but my sudden shift away from introversion wasn’t exactly a covert change towards Carter. I left it alone, and as if this disconnect wasn’t enough, she changed the path through which she traveled to Physics, and made a new Instagram account. Perfect fuel for an overthinker like myself, lighting the mental flame that kept me awake at night. Real cherry on top right there.

Long story short, I haven’t talked to her since, which brings me to the more recent day. Having been about a year, I had been trying to just forget about her, as I couldn’t deal with the added stress of what Carter “might” be doing or not doing. I never felt entitled to an explanation  as to why she stopped talking, or even if the whole thing was intentional or not. Not to mention, when I inevitably caved and checked anyway, social sources suggested thought she had a boyfriend, which was far more than I could handle. Senior year began and we had no classes together anymore. As such, Carter became a backburner thought. Well, until last week, that is. I randomly ran into her, as we both were running some unrelated errands, and it was like all my feelings came flooding back. I mean, ALL my feelings. I froze up! She merely smiled and said “Been a while since I’ve seen you.” then left on her way. That night I checked her socials, which I hadn’t in months, and she seemed to make a lot of “I’m fine being single” related tweets and what not. I didn’t want to get my hopes up, and tried to push it out of my mind, but I still had my curiosity. Even if nothing came out of it, I still wanted to get to know her. The unknown of having someone who has consumed so much of my mental time being “worth it” or not is just too aggravating. It may just be some inexperienced “puppy love” kind of thing, but it would offer some sense of closure, or open the door to something more.

My issue is, Senior Year is coming to a close, and I know some big life changes are going to be taking place soon. I have been accepted to college, and so has Carter. In fact, Carter is going to a specific college across (American) state lines. If I confess how I have felt about her, I may just come off as creepy, and I would prefer a neutral avoidance over giving her a reason. If she, by some manner of miracle, returns my infatuation, I still would only have a little time before she has to leave for college regardless. I certainly wouldn’t want to complicate her life choices, as she has chosen a path that would make her happy. I don’t even have much to offer aside from friendship and affection, and I don’t even know if we would be compatible with that. So after this long essay of teenage drama, I conclude that my feelings make no sense, and I need help.

TLDR: I like a girl. Failed to slide into the DM’s and I can only assume she is avoiding me. Left it alone for a year, but feelings for her suddenly resurfaced. She leaves for out-of-state college soon, and I don’t know if I should confess or not. Advice or help? ",04Feb2019,1

Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism?
can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls?
what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls

I was in a relationship for 2 years in high school, then was single for 2 years, then was in a relationship for 5 years beginning in later college and ending when I was 25.

When I was a kid, my family moved a lot.

When I was 15, my stepmom and I smoked weed together. It kind of creeped me out after a while because we would have weird sexual conversations, so I stopped and distanced myself from her when I was 16.

I was depressed for a while in my late teens and early 20s.

Both breakups were bad. I ended them, my partners freaked out, and I felt really guilty, like I'd done something horrible.

I've always only had a couple of close friends at a time.

I occasionally go to parties, but don't really like them because I don't drink much, and I tend to feel nervous in groups.

Specifically, I was bullied a lot as a kid and fear I'll be humiliated in groups. That actually still happens to me from time to time. It doesn't bother me as much these days, because I know how to handle it now, but I still don't like to put myself in situations where it can happen.

I'm a PhD student.

I'm impoverished, and usually pretty stressed about money a few times per year.

People describe me as thoughtful, reflective, intelligent, kind, and sensitive.

I've been told I'm attractive my whole life.

Im extremely introverted.

I don't want kids.

I've tried getting out there, being more social, etc, for a few years actually.

It just feels fake, and I have some cringey memories as a result. Also, I'm not really looking for someone who wants me to be those things.

I've gone on a few dates, but women lately say they'd rather be friends, which is totally fine by the way, as it's been my feeling too - it seems like I can't find that romantic spark with anyone.

In a partner, I'm looking for someone who is reflective, kind, sensitive, and independent.

Up until now my parents have provided alot; food, clothes things I need. I have been very blessed that they are still providing for me for all the things I need

Some of my closest friends have decided to rent a place together, they need one more person and have asked me if I would consider.

I'm conflicted and don't know what I should do.

On one hand I want to move out and experience living by myself without depending on my parents. As this would be a good test if I would be ok on my own living independently

But on the other hand I feel as though it's a waste of money when I can live at home and have everything provided for me while saving the cash for my own place. 

There's no issue of not being able to afford the rent I have a good job and the price isn't a factor it's more of the savings Ill have if I keep living with my parents

Point being, there is work that needs to be done within our relationship. 

The biggest issue that we have ever faced is this. A few months ago she got really into VRChat. My wife plays a lot of video games so this was not out of character for her. However, mid December she met a guy in England on the game. These conversations transferred into Snapchat conversations. 

Right before the holidays I started getting suspicious. She never used Snapchat before and started sending a lot of messages to a lot of people. Thinking it could be fun for us, I joined her on Snapchat. I watched her take a lot of pictures throughout the evenings but I got very few of them. She also didn’t post many in stories. So I got a call one day on my phone from her mom and her mom wanted to talk to her, so she had my phone. I needed to look something up so I picked up her phone. After I was done I popped open Snapchat because there were several notifications and I wondered what they were. Turns out that she was talking flirtatiously with this other guy. 

I confront her regarding this. She says it’s nothing and that she’s treating it like a dating sim. I say it’s a bit messed up but most of what they were talking about in the chat was benign so I left it at a request that she stop. A week later our daughter is playing on my wife’s phone while sitting on my lap and more notifications pop up while I’m watching my daughter play her game. They were from him on Snapchat. This time I look, they are far more intimate than flirting. 

This confrontation was far larger, we were at a Holliday party and she starts screaming. She later calms down and talks me through what was going on and that she’s sorry and will delete Snapchat. She says she wants to be with me and it was dumb for her to have taken it to the level that she did. 

A week later she’s playing VRChat. I offer to join her and she tells me no. She likes saying a bunch of nasty shit on vrchat because she thinks it’s funny and she thinks I might be offended. Now she normally spends hours at a time telling me of funny shit she saw on vrchat or asking me to watch her play other games. And when she explained why she started talking to this guy she said that she thought we didn’t spend enough time together. So I thought it would have been good to join her and she is adamant about me not joining her... this set off red flags. The next night she says that she is going to play vrchat for the evening and not to join her in the garage where she plays. She smokes out there. I gave her a few hours then she came upstairs and said that she was going to take a bath... this is weird too, she never takes baths... and she tells me not to come upstairs while she does... something fucked up was happening. I go upstairs 20 min later and hear her talking on the other side of the door, then hear an English guy respond from the speaker of her phone. I’m now angry and hurt. I confront her right then by knocking and talking through the door calling her out for lying about not talking to him anymore. She unlocks the door and lets me in and begins to lie. It was porn, I was master bating to it. It is interactive role playing porn where it’s all pre recorded. Being a novice expert on porn, that’s all bullshit. I walk away furious and tell her she’s a fucking liar. 

She runs out of the bathroom, naked and starts swinging at me. She broke my glasses off my face and landed a few hits. I left the room after she was done saying that we were done and I’m going to call the police. It’s not the first time she’s gotten angry and hit me but I was serious that I was going to. She calls me back attempting to calm down and asks me to sit and talk to her. I tell her that it is never right to lay a hand on your spouse and that’s messed up. She then stated, I didn’t do that... I’m like, “what?” She just did it, less than a minute ago. She says, you have no proof. 

I’m furious at this point and don’t know what the hell has gotten into her. I discretely then hit record on the voice memo on my phone. I proceed to question her and get angry she refuses to take responsibility and apologize for hitting me. After several minutes of continuing to deny it she finally says fine I hit you and I’m sorry so can we now just go to bed. I’m not done though, the hitting was only the beginning. I then question about the other guy. She refuses to admit anything so I walk away. She says I have to drop it and end the night on a positive note or she’s going to load the kids up and go to her moms, 2 hours away. I reminder her that our 6 year old has school so she then says she’s going to take them to a hotel then, that she needs to just get away from me because I’m being crazy. I tell her that if she takes the kids or attempts to I will call the cops to stop her because I think she’s been drinking. 

Backstory, she’s an alcoholic. She was charged with battery against me before because I attempted to prevent her from driving drunk and she kicked and punched me to get me away from blocking her from leaving. Through a series of unfortunate events that night she ended up calling the cops on herself and going to jail for the night and dealing with the consequences which led her to 2 years of sobriety. 

Back to the story, she got pissed I accused her of breaking her sobriety. Immediately picked up one of my sleeping kids to bring him to her car and I called before she got down the stairs. She then broke down and confirmed she had been drinking and fucked up. She got put in jail for the night again (in case you’re wondering, in Virginia, a person doesn’t press charges in the case of an assault, the state does so I couldn’t even dispute it to keep her out of trouble). 

While she was gone, I confirmed that she was in deed talking to this dude that night. She promises to stop again, I take some time off work and we attempt to repair the damage between us. I go back to work and we meet with a marriage Councelor the following weekend. She promises not to talk to him and we try to move forward in our relationship. Out of obsessive anxiety, I check her phone and see she’s been talking to him since she got out of jail. 

I confront her and tell her that this is the last time I’m going to give her another chance and if it happens again, we are done. Less than week later you know what happens. Again I catch it. I am detached at this point. I’m sad and in pain but I’m beyond anger and I’m just done. I start my recording again and approach her. For hours she tried to get upset with me for going through her things, downplay the situation, inquire if I’m going to fuck her out of spite in her court case coming up or take the kids from her, then finally apologize sincerely. But I’m still about to be out the door. She is begging at this point for me not to go. She then stated that she would give up all electronics. Laptop, phone, everything. In an effort to prove she won’t talk to him. I accept and change the WiFi password and take the phone. She had saved all of their conversations and videos that she had sent back and forth. I tortured myself by watching all of them and reading everything. They talk about how much they love eachother and all this bullshit. 

I save all the videos and all the voice recordings. 

A week later she is bored out of her mind and things had been pretty good between us. So I give her the laptop back to play some games offline. She enjoys them but then wanted to redownload the second bioshock, she had just spent the time and beat the first one so it made sense. So I reconnect the laptop to the internet and leave her connected. 

The next day I get a message from the guy actually. See every time that I found out they were talking I tried pleading to this douche to stop. At first he spouted the lies he had told her about not being with her anymore and that we were separated. Then it was that I am in denial and that we are actually over. Then finally after the night she begged for me to stay and that he meant nothing to her, I trimmed the recording and sent it to him. Just a minute of her saying that he meant nothing and that She only wants to be with me and that she’s sorry and asking me not to leave. I sent it to him with a simple text explanation... if we are so done, why did she say this instead of letting me leave. He then apologized to me whole heartedly and told me the two of them were done. Sure enough he sends me a message with a screenshot of my wife reaching out to him an hour after I connected the computer. 

I confront her again, quite calm. Knowing he said nothing nice to her meant that it didn’t hit me so hard this time. She apologized and says she was stupid and that she is sorry. And that since it’s apparent that he doesn’t want anything to do with her, she’s not going to do it again. 

I don’t take away the computer this time but she ends up seeing his messages to her after he heard the recording. He laid into her for lying to him and he called her a cheater. She was pretty messed up and ended up crying a lot... it felt like she was upset like it was a breakup. It also felt like she wanted me to comfort her through that pain which felt fucked up. 

There is one final fuckup on her part. The next day she is back online and reaches out to him again. This time it was stating that if she was going to blow up her whole existence she wanted to know hed be waiting on the other side. 

This one was a week ago. She was caught after sending it and he never responded to it. I was going to leave that night and she convinced me to stay. She apparently had taken 7 xannex and didn’t even remember sending it. She was apologetic and promised to be much more loving and work as hard as she can to better our marriage and she has, honestly. 

So here is where I need advice. I have recorded every blowup argument since the assault incident. I have all of the information regarding the emotional affair. I have it all saved. I’m keeping it because I don’t know if she’s going to leave me and take my kids from me. Call me greedy but I believe that if someone is destroying a family intentionally than they shouldn’t get final say in anything regarding the family. I don’t want to take the kids from their mother but I believe they should live in their home, not in a one room bedroom of their grandparents because their mom cheated on their dad. So I kept all the evidence so if the time comes, I have it to explain my argument. She is asking me to delete them. 

Please explain any advice you may have. I love my family more than anything and want to keep all of them together, including my wife. I want to work through this pain but I don’t know how to trust her again. 

TL;DR: wife cheated online with another man and wants to tell me it’s over now and work on things, I have recordings and all affair communications she wants me to delete as a sign of trust. What do? ",04Feb2019,1

189,"Please be nice. I really don't know what to do and I'm a little fragile right now.

My\[20F\] boyfriend \[21M\] and I have been dating for a year and a half. We're open about pretty much everything to the point where we have each other's passwords for most things including phones (my fingerprint is on his phone even). 

Anyway, sometimes when my phone is dead, I'll go on his phone to use reddit. He knows this and has never said anything about it. So, last night, while he was sleeping, my phone dies..I'm like whatever, I'll use his. So, I open the reddit app (reddit is fun which isn't the app I usually use so I was a little confused about how to navigate it) but I'll admit, I went to his inbox (I've never suspected him of anything, I was just genuinely curious and I know snooping is wrong). Anyway, I find an exchange from a month ago (my birthday) along the lines of:

**bf:** Hey, I saw your post of your friend on \[porn sub\] and I was wondering about her dick sucking abilities. how does it feel? How good is she? Do you have any more pics or details?

**user:** yeah, she's great and super petite it's incredible. I can send you pics and videos if you want? I also have more friends like her.

**bf:** Yeah, my kik is \[kik\] (I didn't even know he had a kik)

**user:** ok, I sent it to you. (I don't know if he's still getting pics or not)

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is...what is this? How should I feel? Because I feel like this is emotional cheating in a way but I'm not sure. I know he wouldn't send a nude himself but to receive some of another girl? It's not directly from the girl so does this qualify as just a porn thing (I've never cared if he watched porn). I don't know. I know it was wrong to look through his inbox so that's definitely my bad. I've been contemplating whether this is worth bringing up.

I recently decided to drop both my ""closest"" friends. This is due to alot of reasons but mainly due to that the last year I have been the only one contacting them and they always cancel our plans without making new ones. They have started to just make me feel more lonely with them then when I'm actually alone. They both forgot my birthday even if I contacted them both the day after just to chat and one of them has not even addressed the fact that I have moved in with my boyfriend even if I have posted it on social media. They never asks me anything anymore and they simply do not know what's happening in my life. My boyfriend that always tries to see the good in people has even asked me ""why are they your friends? You never meet and when you do you are just miserable!""

So I now need new friends. I have a few friends that I hang out with occasionally and I also have common friends with my boyfriend that I meet at least once a week. But to be completly honest, real life friends takes ""so much time"" so I would like som sort of Internet pen pall. I simply want to chat with someone and I'm a bit weird in person and can make myself more clear in text and not having the pressure to... Socialize for hours to end

One of my roomies already has a dog but she a sweetheart and gets along with every person and dog she comes across. 

I'm wondering how much I should expect to pay to care for a mid-sized dog (ie vet Bill's, good costs, etc)
I also dont know if I should maybe wait until the house is less crowded (2 other roommates and 1 dog). 

I have experience training and working with dogs but never had one to call my own. Am I maybe rushing into it? 
For me I'm most concerned about the financial side of owning a dog. But atm I have enough free time to raise, train, and care for a pet.

Would a tablet be cheaper to buy to play the game on or would a phone be the better route?

What phone for the price would have the best GPU/RAM to run a game like that? I've seen higher priced phones with lower specs than a cheaper Sony phone so I'm wondering what exactly am I paying for.

Basically, I want to know if there is a cheaper phone that has better gaming specs than those $1000+ phones that seem more about the camera.

196,So I’m a busser at a restaurant. The restaurant is like a hooters joint but a barbecue version of it.  Most of the waitresses there are respectable. I graduated two months ago. I’ve been working at this restaurant since the last semester of my undergrad. I know for sure I am the hardest worker at that restaurant because my bosses and co workers tell me but lately I’ve been feeling down and lazy. I bust my ass just because it’s innate but lately it’s been rough since working full time for a straight a month or two. I used to work part time.  The reason I feel like quitting is because of the girls. “I’m planning to shit where I eat” I know it’s something that people hate but it’s true. The pay is good but I would really appreciate someone to go out with at that work place. It’s been 6 months working there and I’m running out of motivation to just to work there. I don’t know why I bust my ass there but I really need something or someone to continue working there. I also have been treated like an option with women which has me really bummed out. I’ve kiss about 2 girls and both have not given me the chance to have some type of  relationship with them. I have needs and I know the world doesn’t owe me anything but the way how I am working is ridiculous. I bust my ass Jane yet my self esteem is just getting fucked with. I don’t complain at work or give my managers problems but god I really need sometype of motivation to continue to work there. This post maybe dumb or looked down on but I am being as honest I can be.

199,"I was so excited to be up for a promotion. Long story short another person got promoted over me after working for the company a couple of months. They needed to fill the position and she applied. Severely under qualified, but she got it. I wish I would have applied but I have no one to blame but me. 

A new higher position opens up. I apply and end up being the only one in the store who interviews. They may have interviewed outside candidates. I was told I’d hear back quick- I don’t. But my application status is still active so they haven’t made a decision. I get excited. Im paid so little and have so many problems which could be solved by money. I already do a lot of the job which I applied for and I regularly out perform the other promoted coworker in my dept. I start thinking I might actually get the job plus a nice raise. 

A week after projected decision date I get an email saying I was not chosen. I’m so bummed. 

I’m embarrassed that I couldn’t get promoted when the other worker (we make up the whole of our department) did easily and continues to be in trouble for performance. I work so hard. I have a chronic illness that makes everyday a challenge to even continue on and ward off the thought of giving up. I can be charming and bubbly when needed but I’ve always been second choice on personality which I know now I’m low energy because of my illness. 

I guess I’ll just continue scraping by. 
I’m always choice #2 no matter how hard I work and I’m certain it’s personality based. I’m not an ass, but I look like I’m exhausted and low energy as a constant. (I am even though I hate it). 
I work extra hard to prove my worth too. Despite my constant misery and exhaustion.

205,"My grandma has 4 children with my mom being the youngest daughter. She has 2 other daughters and 1 son. They are all not very good children to say the least. They all try to do something but it’s just for the sake of it. 

My mom, being the youngest, has the least say in the house. You can call me biased but I am quite sure my mom is the one who tries the hardest to help my grandma. She used to work a very hectic job and had very little time to spare, but she have already resigned. Resigning comes with its own cons, the main one would definitely be lower income. 

My grandma saves every single penny she can for her children. The way she suffers just for people who don’t return her affections is just sad. She doesn’t buy an air conditioner despite the weather being so hot and humid, she eats leftover food for a few days just to save money on rice and gas for the stove. 

That’s enough for the backstory, I’ll be moving on now. Because of how much she’s saving, she lives in a small apartment with a helper her children hired because she’s an elderly living alone after all. She has several neighbors and there’s just one family across the lift lobby who are just a literal pile of shit and the epitome of a fucking asshole. 

This already happened quite some time ago and I thought it was all over, I didn’t know it was still happening. Hence I’m writing this post, I need some advice. I forgot what happened exactly, but my grandma had a small scuffle with the wife of the neighbor. If I remember correctly, it was over something petty. Things escalated, the neighbor’s husband came out to help her. Well now, remember my grandma lives alone. At that point, she didn’t have a helper yet. She was completely alone. The husband punched slapped and punched my grandma. Twice. She’s an old lady and they were younger than her, probably in their late-mid ages. I don’t know how or what the fuck they were thinking but he could actually, especially being a man, punch and slap and old lady without feeling any shame. 

We called the police but nothing really happened because there was no evidence. All of her children knew by now and no one did anything. Some of them even blamed my grandma for starting something even knowing well she can’t beat them. It’s ridiculous. My mom suggested the use of CCTV to get evidence, however she was scolded by her siblings instead. She was told she was being a busybody and was told off that if she’s so rich, she should foot out all the costs. My mom doesn’t have enough funds to pay for the costs every month so she kept quiet. Initially, she was also the one who suggested the use of a helper because my grandma needed help to get around the house now. No one wanted to help, so my mom did everything on her own. She paid and talked to the agency, sent the helper to checkups and other complicated stuff all by herself. At that point, she was still being hated by her siblings for being nosy and “creating trouble.” Now? They’re all happy that she has a helper. Fake ass bitches. 

Anyway, I can tell that my mom is being tired of being the good kid and being bashed for nothing. So now, I can really tell she’s not trying her best to change something. It’s bullshit. 

Present time, it’s almost the lunar new year so naturally my grandma hung decorations for the festive season. I didn’t know her asshole neighbors came to cut off the decorations. They even cut some parts of the plants and flowers she so painstakingly grew. They would pour water all over the common area and not dry it up all the time, except when people visited my grandma, like now, I’m at her house and the neighbors pretended to dry it up. It really pisses me off. 

I asked everyone why is doing no one anything. They said they don’t wanna start a fight, because they might end up in jail. No one wants to fork up money for the CCTV, the police wont help without evidence even though we already called several times. We thought of lawsuit, but my grandma doesn’t want to blow it up because it would be difficult to live here otherwise and she doesn’t have enough money to move houses.

Sure, maybe they're just ""wild,"" but China doesn't view that. The government is willing to eradicate substance abuse from this country, by means of detaining, jailing, or deportation. By continuing and spreading substance abuse, these druggies are endangering my friends and siblings who will attend those schools.

I have zero sympathy for those addicts. I  know that reporting them will hinder or stop them. But I also know that reporting them is a question of morality, as it will have other side effects.

What should I do?",04Feb2019,1
212,"I despise my cousin so intensely that I always wish death upon him. The reason why I hate him so much is because he is extremely narcissistic and extremely loud. He is almost 30 and acts like a kid still. I can't avoid him/eliminate him from my life because I am dating his girlfriend's sister. (i did not know this beforehand). Therefore I see him lots because she is living with them for school.. What has he done to me personally? He went through my phone and looked through my photos when I charging my phone and saw some personal photos. He once slapped my girlfriends ass. Hes always craving for attention from my girlfriend constantly trying to relate to her. Hes wiped boogers on my phone before. etc etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I see him or even hear or just even hear his name being mentioned my mood changes so fast (usually anger) then my hands want to punch him but obviously I will not. I tried to forgive him but I just cant pass that (perhaps this is just my ego). We are complete opposite, I want to avoid him at all cost, even if it meant if I had to break up with my girlfriend .

213,"So I've been talking to this girl for like a week. That said, I've never had a conversation go past a few texts cus she just stops replying. She says she is really excited to meet and stuff like that, but she cancelled our first date cus she said she was sick. Me being the dude I am, texted her the next day to see how she was feeling. She didn't respond. I texted again making a joke to try and get her to respond. She did eventually, and then I confirmed that the rescheduled date was still on. She said yeah, and then I asked when she wanted to meet. The plan was noon before, so I just wanted to check if that was still fine or if she wanted it later. That was a day ago. She's seen the text but hasn't responded. Should I show up? The date is today. I don't wanna get stood up. That'd be really annoying and a complete waste of time. That said, I don't want to text her again cus she's probably sleeping at this point and that seems really clingy and desperate. Help?",04Feb2019,1
214," I dated this guy for about a year. First 6 months, then broke up for 2 got back together and dated like 3 months. We broke up because I didn’t love him how he loved me. I was honest with him and told him I saw him more as just a friend and that I felt it was unfair to be with him, if my feelings weren’t as strong as his. I told him that I would still love to have him in my life, due to us being friends before we dated, but understood if he no longer wanted to talk to me because it was too difficult. He said no that me not being in his life would be harder. 


We still talk every day, but not as often. He continuously tells me how he still cares and wants to get back together and I keep shutting him down. Telling him that I’m sorry he still has feelings and suggesting that we stop being friends, if that’s what he needs. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t really help that he still cares and I know I don’t wanna date him. Should I just stop talking to him all together, even if he doesn’t want me to?

216,"Hey everyone.

I’m just wanting to get some advice about my family, specifically my sister. Her and my relationship has never been great. As we’ve gotten older, my feelings to antagonise her have faded away (we both used to antagonise each other) and I prefer to keep to myself rather than interact with her. However, whenever I do have to interact with her, she is very condescending, rude and often makes remarks that she knows will hurt me, while I am just calm and reserved. She thinks so little of me, and it shows. 

She is 20 and I am 17. I have so much more to learn in life, specifically in the next 5 or so years. However, I feel while I’m maturing, she is remaining the same inconsiderate person she has always been. 

I’ve tried talking to our parents about it, as well as directly to her, and she has not even attempted to change. I am not sure what to do, as it is negatively impacting my already bad mental health, and I can’t handle her vitriol in my current state. 

Thanks everyone. ",04Feb2019,1

Today we talked for most of the day, she didn't even realise the time when we stopped talking.
I think she's cute, funny, etc etc
I genuinely feel comfortable talking to her and I'm not looking for sex or anything, just her time.
She said that I'm easy to talk to and that she enjoys talking to me.
Only problem is she has a boyfriend.
She told me her boyfriend isn't very supportive of her emotionally, like comforting, or sympathetic. Which is bad because she is bipolar and has depression n stuff.
I told her if she needs someone to rant or talk to feel free to hmu.
She said thank you and we continued talking.
I really like her but I don't want to ruin her relationship cause she says he treats her right n such.

(like... bigger stuff. like if i eat a piece of pizza and it burns my mouth i'll remember next time like wow! that will probably be hot! i hope that was obvious though)

229,"I made a post a while ago about this, but something changed so I wanted to get some more advice. To summarize it all, my best friend (19F) started crushing on a past teacher around the beginning of our senior year in HS (M in late 20s/early 30s) and changed, or I assume she changed— she could’ve been acting this way before for all I know. When kids bullied me on the bus (throwing stuff at me) she did nothing, actually made excuses as to why we couldn’t carpool. When my grandmother died, she ignored me after one text and didn’t offer any help, didn’t even come to the funeral. (She knew my grandma personally.) and when my cat died a month later, a cat that was basically my best friend that I’d grown up with, I begged her to take me somewhere, to distract me, to even just get me out of my house. She refused, making excuses again. Meanwhile, I sat there and gave advice and offered help any time she was upset. I listened to every problem she had, I never spoke up about these issues. 

Now, though, it’s gotten to a point where I can’t hold it in anymore. I leave in two months for the Air Force, so I haven’t said anything yet. I’m scared to, I don’t want to hurt her. She’s my only friend left and I don’t want to lose her either, but every conversation is about her. This guy she liked just cut off all contact with her and seeing as this was her first crush, she’s devastated. I gave her a second chance, I offered my help, my advice, yet I still held back from diving full in. I don’t want to invest in this and her hurt me later on when I’m upset. I just had to cancel plans we had because I knew this guy is all she would talk about and I wouldn’t be able to hold my tongue in person, I would end up hurting her.

I just want to know if my feelings are justified— am I in the right for canceling plans and being more short with my responses to her? Should I call her out for how she treated me this past year or so and try to repair this? Or should I let the friendship slowly drift away? I’m not somebody who others can make mad easily, but this entire situation had me to the point of tears— I felt so disrespected.

I work part time at Target, and I have a specific manager/team lead that has made me uncomfortable from the beginning. Lots of weird touching (back and arms mostly) and a weird sense of humor but I just kind of brushed it off.

I’ve heard him make inappropriate comments to some of my other female coworkers (quick story: a coworker was talking to me about how a perfume she loves is on clearance at our store, he asked to smell it and then suggesting getting “up close and personal” so he could smell it on her?) but they all seem to think he just has an odd sense of humor.

To make matters worse, he’s almost 50 and I’m barely 18. As a joke one night with my friends we set our tinders to like 45+ only, and he popped up almost immediately so I got weirded out and obviously turned my age settings right back down. But that also means he has his set all the way down to 18??

The other day he mentioned I wasn’t my “usual cute bubbly self” and I payed it off like I’d been sick, and he called me standoffish and rude. I just don’t feel comfortable working with him.

What’s the best way to get fewer shifts with him? I’ve considered ongoing to my HR but I’m scared he’ll find out or they’ll think I’m over reacting. What do I do??

245,"I live with my partner and our friend/roommate in an apartment we got some months ago. My partner and I are getting a washer/dryer ourselves, our roommate is not in the financial place to chip in. We aren't comfortable with him using our hookup for a few reasons. We also intend to pay extra towards bills for it.

Firstly, he's very disrespectful with our other things. He doesn't clean our(me and my partner 's) microwave when he uses it, he used over half a bag of road salt that me and my partner bought without asking(for a portion of sidewalk that we NEVER use btw), he throws himself on our furniture and it sounds like something breaks every time, and he takes our things without asking(an old futon frame I wasn't using but was planning on using, several smaller items we pay for). Additionally, we ask him to change said behaviors and he never does. Some of this is easy to work around, we keep our own belongings in our room, but we can't actually keep a washer and dryer in there of course.

He also is very wasteful financially, and so if something happens and it needs repairs, me and my partner are screwed there. His parent's house is also a few minute walk away where he does laundry, if I don't give him a ride myself. Everything else in the house that didn't come with it such as the stove is me and my partner's. We bought all of the dinnerware, pots and pans,  the microwave, the furniture, which he uses regularly, and does damage regularly. 

I can understand that this might be inconsiderate of me, as the rent is split equally between him, my partner, and I. He needs to do laundry like anyone else, and it's in his house. But I am not willing to be in the hole hundreds of dollars down the road because he is being inconsiderate himself. I don't want to be unfair, but I also need to look out for me and my partner.

246,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post, I am going to try and condense it as much as I can. TL;DR at the bottom, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this.

  
A little back story, I am a senior Psych major with a minor in chemistry and general science, attending a private university and set to graduate in May. It became apparent to me last semester that I was going to need to take the remaining classes in my program online so that I could work full time to support myself financially. I mention the fact that my university if private because this is where my issue stems from.

&amp;#x200B;

My journey down the bureaucratic rabbit hole started at my school's counseling offices, where I regularly met with my counselor Mrs. Amy since I was a freshmen. After explaining my situation and my reasoning for wanting to take my classes online, she gave me the name for the first person I should speak with to facilitate this. Long story short, I met with that person, who referred me to someone in my school's online education department. She pointed out to me that in order to completely my chemistry minor (I am two credits away) I could not change from being an online student as the online curriculum did not offer any chem courses that could satisfy the requirements for my minor. Because of this, she told me her best advice was to remain a main campus student and to speak with the chemistry department chair to decide the best choice for me.

I met with the head of the chemistry department, explained my situation again, and the advice he gave me was to do two hours research with a professor in the department while taking my remaining psychology courses online to maximize the time I could spend working to support myself financially. He told me that in order to do this, I would have to meet with the Dean of the school of education, which psychology falls under at my school, in order to receive approval. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mention my school being a private university for this detail specifically. Speaking with friends who attend other public schools, none of them have had any issue in taking online courses. The fact that I have met with five people up to this point is absurd to me, but unfortunately my story continues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met with the Dean, explained myself, and received the approval necessary to facilitate my taking the online courses and the research. All while this is going on, I was balancing things over at the VA department to make sure I would be able to take advantage of my full benefits next semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Along the line, I had explained to the two professors I was going to be doing research with that I was unable to add the research to my schedule. They both assured me that this was something we could take care of the following semester and not to worry about it, and so I didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in that semester and here's how things have played out thus far. I met with both the professors I would be doing research with the first day of classes. I will refer to them as Dr. W and Dr. K. Neither of them had an exact idea as to what my research would be on, but had a rudimentary plan. I explained to both of them how the research course was planned on my schedule but I was unable to register myself without their approval. Dr. K explained to me again that it is nothing to worry about, that we will sort it out later. He also asked me to meet with him the following week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unsatisfied with their answer and seeking the confirmation that I will in-fact graduate with the minor I have worked so hard for, I decided to stop by the registrar's office. I met with a woman there who explained to me that courses such as these can be added to a schedule as late as April, and that the registrar requires a syllabus written up by both Dr. K and Dr. W in order to approve this. This is information that both these senior professors should be familiar with, as I am not the first student they had done research with, but neither had mentioned this to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I met with Dr. K as he requested. He explained his plan for our research, that it was going to determine a relationship between a student's completion percentage for the online homework the chemistry department uses, their overall grade in the class, and the position in the classroom where they sit. I was excited that our research was seemingly going to be fairly easy while also being more psychology related. He then assigned a book for me to read, which I did, and asked me to research metacognition, which I did. In my opinion, he seemingly ended the conversation in such a way that suggested that he would contact me when he was ready to continue, not the other way around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up finishing my reading and research in about a week and a half after Dr. K had assigned it. I did not hear back from either him or Dr. W until this past Friday, in which a very upset Dr. W accused me of not doing any work but rather trying to abuse the system by having them approve me for the course without me actually doing the work. In this email, Dr. W had cc'ed Dr. K, the women I corresponded with in the registrar's office, my advisor in the Psychology department, the head of the psychology department, the Dean of the school of education, my correspondent at the VA, and two people who's names I do not recognize. I was incredibly embarrassed and upset to say the least. Dr. W said that because I have not met with him and because the research course is still not on my schedule, it indicates to him that I am not working in earnest to complete my share of the research. I explained to him that I do not understand why I am not registered for the course still, despite my efforts to ensure that I was. After emailing back and fourth, he seemed to backtrack for reasons unknown to me (perhaps Dr. K emailed him directly to point out that I had in-fact made it clear I couldn't add the class myself and that I have been doing the work that he had asked?). We agreed on Saturday to meet today, the 4th of February, to continue our research. All seemed well.

&amp;#x200B;

Early tonight, I received an email from my advisor, someone I have looked up to my four years at this school and who I believed to think of highly as me as I did her. She said I was ""obviously quite capable of navigating the system,"" and accused this breakdown of communication to be my fault rather than anyone else's. She followed this up by saying ""whatever ball he dropped with regard to making a possible independent study arrangement for the CHEM course is on him and, based on previous interactions, a not unfamiliar pattern."" Ouch. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took this as an opportunity to write out, in great detail every single interaction I had had from the start of this hold mess up until this point in an attempt to prove my innocence. The email was frankly way too long to post here but if anyone is curious to see that email and all the others for context, I will gladly share through PM. Anyway, I am not sure where to go from here. Since sending my response to the group explaining everything I did and how it is most definitely not me who dropped the ball, I have decided that I will also go meet with the head of the Psychology department to discuss not only this issue, but the sheer level of unprofessionalism exhibited by my advisor, who had been a professor at my school for nearly two decades.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I am desperate for any advice you may have. I fear I may lose out on my minor to what seems to be a bureaucratic nightmare of my own creation.

  
TL;DR: Due to a extraneous financial situation, I requested to take all my classes online in order to be able to work full time. This resulted in one of my professors and my advisor attacking my character in an email thread including the dean, the department head of my major, and several other important figures, threatening my ability to complete my minor.

247,"Hey everyone,

I have a concern that is addressed in the title. My question is to seek more about the pedagogy of the issue. I want to examine this in a hypothetical speculation that would apply to someone in my position.

I am a grad student in a STEM career. In this major, there are not many girls to talk to. The ones that are in attendance, I do not find particularly attractive. I figure that going to a library wouldn't yield any positive results, seeing how no one there is really there to meet people. I can't really join any clubs to meet people. 

Any advice?",04Feb2019,1
248,"so basically I’m 14 years old and I took booty pictures in the mirror. my face is in them. and yes, everyone, literally everyone at my school has seen them. I’ve had boys walk up to me in the hallway and ask me about them, I’ve had people ask my friends about them. and the problem is I know exactly who it is and they won’t come forward about it. I never sent the pictures to anyone, they were just kept in my my eyes only. so my ex guy friend and I got into a fight and I let him keep my streaks (let’s just call him Ethan, that is his real name) so I let Ethan keep my streaks awhile back and I never changed the password because I forgot to. So he logs into my snap and he knew my phone password so he just typed that into my my eyes only thing and he found one picture of me that I had taken for my self esteem because I thought I looked pretty hot and sent it to himself and I woke up with a notification “Ethan saved to camera roll” then I was immediately logged out of my Snapchat. so he sent them to his friends in a big group chat who then sent them to their friends and it spread and spread. So, I went up to the counselor crying about it and I really never said I why I was crying I just brought his name up, said he was bullying me. He never admitted to doing it but I’m not fucking retarded. I never told the counselor about the pictures though so the other day during lunch the day after I had went to the counselor over the intercom I heard Ethan please come to the front desk. I looked over at him and he just says “shit” cause he knew it was coming from me and I mean why would he do that if he wasn’t guilty. I never sent the pictures to anyone no one has enough motive to go against I mean because no one really cares about my existence at the school except him because of the fight we got into. So he gets called up there and nothing happened he didn’t bring up the pictures. So I have some of my friends coming up to me saying it’s my fault it’s probably just one of the guys I sent it to (keep in mind I NEVER SENT THESE TYPE OF PICTURES TO ANYONE) calling him innocent and stuff so I lost some friends over this and my reputation is ruined. honestly I could care less though ab that type of shit.So is this gonna ruin my life when I want to get like jobs and stuff in the future and when I’m applying for college? Is it illegal for me to posses pictures of me in my underwear when they’re only for myself? If not then could I get all these boys in trouble for having these pictures of me? I’d really like to.",04Feb2019,1

This isn't a throwaway, and I will try to be as objective as possible.

I have a problem I really don't know how to handle.  I know I am not a perfect employee, I make mistakes, but they are few and far between.  Each time I make one though, instead of being coached, I am written up.  To me, it seems like I am being targeted.  I guess that's my main concern, but the problem is, I am not the most stable of minds and I am prone to over thinking situations and flat out paranoia.  If I am NOT being targeted, then advice on how to deal with and talk to leadership would be helpful.  If I am, I would like to know the steps I can take to protect myself.  Here is a list of my offenses:

1st (@10 months ago) I was off the clock and in the office.  We are allowed to use the 3D printer for personal stuff so I was working on a costume piece for another employee.  While I was, I had an idea on how to get the conference room equipment to work, we've been trying for a week to no avail, so I tried it.  It worked and I documented it.  I figured since things are really lax, and they've given me a lot of stuff in the past, an hour of free labor wasn't an issue.  Turns out it was.

2nd (@6 months ago)  I left a mess in the server room.  I was doing a lot of soldering work, but got fluxed out because we have no fume extraction equipment.  I went outside to cool off and get some fresh air and forgot to put away (it was re-tinned and turned off though) the iron, throw away my shop rags, and clean the bench of flux.  This one I felt was deserved.  I mean sure it wasn't a big mess, and I clean and sort both rooms every week, but as one of the biggest proponent of keeping that place clean I had it coming.

Final (last Thursday)  I left a few devices sitting on my desk that security handed me as I was leaving the the building.  We have no rules in place against this, and we aren't wanting for devices as peak season is over, I figured I would just take care of them next shift to see if an RMA came in to replace the broken parts.  This write up was odd because both my new supervisor and HR said I was displaying a pattern of not doing rounds and leaving messes every where.  This is the first I heard of this.  I told them that these devices were given half way through the shift, there are cameras and badge logs that can show this.  I also make damn sure to do my rounds.

At this point I thought that I made someone angry or that I was annoying someone, so I left all our non work related group chats.  I also started doing an extra set of rounds to make sure all devices that could be repaired were on my shift.  I also cleaned my desk of all personal effects, even though we are allowed to have them and everyone else has a whole lot of them.  I am worried now because last night was my last shift for the week, and I just got an End Of Shift report from day shift saying they had to repair a lot of iPods in both buildings.  Couple all this with the fact that people have done A LOT worse than my 3 offenses (direct insubordination, telling HR and our manager to fuck off, constantly coming in hours late, almost getting into physical fights) with NO repercussions and I am starting to fear for my job.

I know that some of my co workers read reddit, and that this situation is pretty identifiable, but if you are reading this, please, put me on blast, tell me what I am doing wrong.  I am asking but all I am getting is that I am doing fine, even after these write ups.  I'm doing everything they ask me and more.

I am asking strangers on the internet for help because I am affraid to bring this stuff to light to either my leadership or HR.  I don't know how close they are, and the last time we answered a survey honestly, they went on a hunt to find the people who gave bad scores.",04Feb2019,1

254,"Hello Reddit I usually don’t post on stuff like this but this is something I really need some advice on.. so let’s get into it. 
I’m a 22 year old I’ve been with my bf for over 7 years we met in high school freshmen year and have been with each other since then. He was my first in everything he will always have a special place in my heart.  Let me say now it hasn’t always been pretty over the years. In high school I was madly in love with him and he just treated me like crap he would always try to control me and make me stop talking to guy friends etc . I never felt valued by him, he would just try to control me  , anyway we stayed together all of high school. After graduating high school it became all about us , but even then I never felt I received the value and love I deserve. It’s been up and downs since then for almost 5 years now. It’s always been breakup and make up all the time . The long breakup was a 3 months and I had fun those whole months before deciding to get back with him.I have put my foot down many times but it’s always it’s over bye then we start talking again. I love him I do I’ve planned this life with this person and walking away hurts me. Every-time I say I think we should take a break it never happens. He still continues to text me talk to me like nothing ever happens. 
The day I decided to I couldn’t anymore was when he put his hands on me.. it started over me talking to this old guy who had a crush on me nothing inappropriate. He lost it it ended up getting physical and he embarrassed me. This hasn’t been the first time this happened in Nov the last was in July .. Ive tried staying with him but I’ve lost a lot of love for him. I can’t forgive him anymore and I can’t move past this anymore and look the other way. This past year has been hard for me I have never had a good relationship with my familyI’m always been very independent, and he’s the only family I have. I don’t have many friends besides my bff who’s a mom and has a life of her own. 

If you have read this far (which I hope you have) you would have read I was single for a 3 months. Those 3 month I was single I met a guy we’ll call him “Toby”.  I went out on a couple dates with Toby and every time we talk we always seem to stop talking and talk again. We will text for a day then won’t text til another week. I made the error of having sex with this person which I don’t regret but I should’ve waited. The times When we did hang out it was one day out of the whole month we still talk here and there but he only seems to reach out when he wants something usually texts me Fridays . He’s never really ever has really tried to get know and doesn’t seem to know how to talk to a girl and ask much questions. 

I’m a very sweet, kind person. I’m quiet and shy at times but once I’m comfortable I’m a bubbly person. I’ve recently lost a a lot of weight and have a total different look now I have taught how to love myself . I have school and goals for myself I wish to accomplish. I just get very disappointed I just feel like no one is out there for me. I just want to be happy. 
I know I deserve better my question is how do you let go? How do you start something new when that’s  all you know ? I need all the advice any one is willing to give!

However, after speaking for a few hours on Tinder he asked me for my Snapchat. All night on Friday we were chatting back and forth and then he suddenly asked me if I wanted some “steamy” pics; I felt really uncomfortable but didn’t know how to say no. I replied stupidly “surprise me” and he sent me a few of him nude, but he had put something over his genitals. He then asked me if I would send him some “steamy” pics and I told him I felt uncomfortable doing that. He asked me once more and said “don’t send me anything old,” I ended up reading that and not replying. He then messaged me again saying I didn’t need to send anything and I didn’t. He keeps making jokes about us living together (we’ve only been talking since Thursday) and keeps sending me shirtless pics. Yesterday he tried having this “sexy” conversion with me, to which I asked why he was on Tinder. He told me he was looking for a serious relationship and I told him I was too. Ever since he asked me for “pics,” I’ve been feeling kind of weird about talking to him. Today, I told him I was really busy and would talk to him later; after two hours, he sent me a message. I didn’t reply for 6 hours and when I did, he replied right away.  Lastly, I think it’s important to mention, whenever I message him back, he replies instantly... every single time. And if I don’t reply to something, he’ll message me within minutes until I do. 
I feel like I’ve definitely seen some red flags but then I worry I’m overthinking, which is a big problem of mine. Do you guys think I’m overthinking or do you see red flags as well? And how should I go about this situation? Thanks in advance for any advice. ",04Feb2019,1
258,"So I'm currently a sophomore in high school and I'm hoping to start working next year. Like a part time job that I can make money to help my family, save for college, use for my own stuff, etc etc.

But the thing is my mom seems to not want me to get a job..

Every time I bring up things that are kind of ""going on to the next stage of life"" things, she gets super defensive and discouraging. One example is driving. I'm already 16 and in my state that's the age where you can get a driver's license (15 for your permit). My mom was so against driving and actually didn't know that the initial Driver's Ed course was necessary and thought it was just a driving test to get a license. Most parents teach their kids to drive because its more convenient and cheap, but my mom refused. She said she didn't trust her own driving and when I offered my dad or brother (25), she gave other reasons. My dad, not being home often, and my brother, for also being a bad driver. I complied and agreed to just take a class that was with an instructor, but she didn't ever specify when. And when I asked she'd just respond ""You'll get your license before you graduate."" Anyway, the only reason that I'm even able to do the initial online Driver's Ed course for my permit is because my friends (who are also her friend's children) have already taken it and have their permit. The thing is, I'm always compared to these friends. They are also my two closest friends that I've known since elementary school. My mom would compare me to them like grades, school ranks, skin care, and even height.  School is a completely different case, but I have good grades and I'm ranked pretty high, just not as high as my friends (I'm in like the top 8% but one of my friends is one of the top 5 students). They don't have a job yet, but are also looking to get one. Of course, if they aren't doing it then my mom has no reason to agree for me to do it?

Also one of the main reasons why I'm trying to get my license in the first place is so I can drive myself without having to bother my mom. A lot of times she gets really annoyed when she has to drive me (even for school events or volunteering), she's even pretended to be sick or say that I forgot to tell her about the event (even though it's written on her calendar) just so she doesn't have to take me.

Anyway... I want to get a job so I can help my family financially. I know that in high school, a lot of stuff already cost money, like AP tests and school events. I want to be able to pay for these things because I know that my family isn't as well off as some others may be. And I'm the type of person that commits to doing something once I set my mind to it, especially when its related to a group of people that I don't want to let down. When I bring up getting a job with my mom she just says ""No, you're not going to be able to get a job."" I ask why and she responds ""It's just not going to happen so stop talking about it."" Or other times when shes in a better mood she'll bring up some other excuse like ""We'll just sell the house and find a cheaper place to live so we can save money."" Moving is a really big step, considering we've been living in our current house for 10+ years. Maybe that's just me being a child and not wanting to leave what I've considered my home for my whole life, but yeah. I feel like me getting a small job for a while would be so much easier. 

So... what do I do?  How do I convince my mom to let me get a part time job and actually grow up?

Also if you're a parent, I'd really like to hear from your perspective because I feel like it has something to do with the whole ""I don't want my baby to grow up"" sense. 

Thank you very much!

259,"I am currently in my second semester of my third year of university. Throughout my university experience, I have generally been pretty unsatisfied with my education. I attend a very small private school that doesn't have a lot of funding. My university is a good one out of the smaller ones around me, but it depends heavily on the field you're in. For example, if you're interested in biology or becoming a nurse, this university would suit you well. The major I am in is neither of those things and it feels like it is often put on the back burner when it comes to how well rounded each course is.

Last semester, I switched majors, despite nearly being finished with my previous major. I wasn't happy with what I was doing, the courses were sparse and limited in content, and it seemed like it was getting me nowhere. After switching, I have realized that I love what I am doing now much more. The issue with this, though, is that now I really only have my core curriculum finished and have a little ways to go with my major courses.

It feels like I'm not getting all the knowledge I would at a bigger state school. I have been told in the past that it doesn't matter if you go to a state school or a community college because it's all the same information. I do not feel like that is what I am experiencing, but I wouldn't know because I have only been to this specific university.

Another thing to mention is that I am definitely going to have to get my master's degree for this field of work, so I will not just be attending school for 4-5 years. Instead, I'm looking at 6-8 years.

The one thing I worry about most is whether or not it's worth the money, changing universities so late in the game. What would your guys' advice be? Should I finish up here for my bachelor's degree and get my master's elsewhere or switch now?",04Feb2019,1

We’ve now gone on a lot more dates and things have really picked up. We started cuddling and making out in her bed. She stopped me when things were getting heavy and told me she wanted to take it slow with me. She thought I could be special and wanted to wait and see where this goes.

I’m completely understanding of that but she said she still sees that guy friend. So now I’m worried because she’s taking it slow with me while having sex with this other guy. 

I’m starting to really like her but I don’t know what to do. My friend told me I should tell her these concerns so I did the next time I saw her. She said she’ll stop seeing him because she really feels strongly about me.

I guess where I need advice is am I insecure to still worry that’s she’s seeing him or should I actually be worried? I feel like if we start a relationship, that’s all I’ll think about.",04Feb2019,1
264,"I was at my 24 year old daughter's house and I was snooping through her room while she was in the bathroom. I found a couple pregnancy tests in her bedroom garbage can. She is not married and my husband and I have told her she is not allowed to kiss or have sexual intercourse until she is married. I feel like sprinkling holy water around her house because I am so upset. 

Earlier today I drove past her house and there was a car in her driveway that was parked next to hers. I drove past a couple minutes later and I saw a man probably in his mid-late twenties outside smoking a cigarette. I drove by a couple hours later and that car was still there.

When I got home I called and she answered. I asked her what she was up to and if I could stop by to drop off something. She told me that she is busy doing housework and needs to run errands and stuff today. I knew she was lying. I drove by tonight and the dudes car was still there.

What should I do? How do I confront her? Who is this man?",04Feb2019,1
265,"Tl;dr at the bottom but I encourage that you read it for the full story.

Oh god where to begin. For some background,  I have this friend, let's call her Alice, who I've known for 3 years. She is very socially awkward. Around the start of last year she develops a crush on me amd isn't subtle about it constantly following me or touching me. I find this somewhat creepy and I DO NOT like being touched but I put it to her social problems and after awhile I ask her to stop touching me. She stops for about a week then will start again and have to be told again and the cycle continues. Recently she had been playfully hurting my feeling and overstepping boundaries.

Right before the incident, we are at a speech and debate tournament. Me and my best friend are laying on the floor next to eachother with some space between us. We're working on some homework when Alice comes in and sits herself without a word right between us, squishing all but Alice. Me and my friend exchange glances before asking Alice to move in front of us where there is room. She insists that it's no problem for her. We repeatedly try to get her to move but she keeps insisting its okay for her. Eventually I tell her to get up and stop touching me so she leaves. I go get a drink and come back to find her, seated so that if I sit down I'm squished next to her. I tell her to get up for stealing my seat but she keeps insisting that I can fit until eventually she has to go somewhere and I take back my spot and reinforce the fact that she shouldn't touch me.

Then the incident. My best friend turns on netflix so I lean i close and fall asleep watching. I wake up to see that my friend dozed off as well. I go to pause the episode as it was running, but something warm stops my arm. I look over in horror to realized Alice has latched herself next to me with one of her arms on me. I freak out. I can feel her too well and I jolt up amd leave the room. I'm freaking out. She betrayed my trush and VIOLATED me when I was asleep amd vulnerable and couldn't give consent AFTER I HAD REPEATEDLY TOLD HER NOT TO TOUCH ME. The next school day, I told my Coach and she anonymously addressed everyone. Saying the incident without any names and saying whoever was responsible should apologize. Alice later asks coach if it was her and my coach tells her if she feels responsible she should apologize. But it's been 2 weeks and nothing. 

I don't know what to do, Is there anything I can do?. Do I confront her or her parrents or the school or the police or someone? I have no clue what to do, so I came here for help, Please. It's still haunting me every night and I need to do something.

Tl;dr My friend layed down next to me and latched onto me when I was asleep and had already told her to not touch me and now she isn't taking responsibility and I don't know what to do.

266,"My best friends parents have been fighting a lot recently and she’s really worried that they’re going to divorce.

How can I help her?",04Feb2019,1
267,"I’m sorry if it’s long. I keep trying everything I can. I write almost every thought I have in a journal and I try talking to my husband but I still can’t get these weights off my chest. I need help I know I do but now being a new mother I’m afraid to. What I hate about now being a mother is that any thing I complain about I fear they’ll just diagnosed me with postpartum depression and I hate how people view that as you don’t love your child. Since having my daughter I’ve been less lonely but for years I’ve struggled with these thoughts of feeling lonely and wanting to kill myself. 
When I was younger I tried speaking to my family about how I was feeling and my mother would tell me I was just being dramatic and wanted attention. When I would have panic attacks she would yell at me to stop faking it, yet when my sister would go through the same thing she would rush her to get care. ( Yeah I know pretty shitty but I was never my mother’s favorite. She always liked me least and I’ll never know why.)
Since I was little I thought of the idea of death. I wanted to know if it was really as peaceful as everyone said it was. I often thought (still do) that if I were to die no one would really care. I’ve always been the easiest person to step all over and replace when they’d get bored. (I have a bad habit of putting everyone before myself and even knowing I do this i continue to keep doing it.) Everytime i tried to kill myself I’d find myself stopping myself because i hoped one person might still want me. Ever since having my daughter I tell myself she needs me, but I’m still tempted.
Because I bottle in all these thoughts and emotions I tend to hurt myself and after that I would shut off. Now I’ve never cut myself but I tend to still cause physical pain of somesort. For the longest time I would dig my nails in my skin. Two years ago it turned into punching my thighs til they felt numb. Once I became pregnant I stopped. I would just put myself to sleep. Now I basically try not to do anything but I get these huge headaches and I just get so frustrated and bitchy and I’m constantly trying to stop myself from doing something I’ll regret or shut off..everytime I shut off it’s harder for me to come back..

I can’t afford to stop caring because my little girl wouldn’t have anyone. Her dad never really seems to have time for us because of work and whatever else he has going on. I basically can’t go to my family for help because I’ve always had a rocky relationship with them (plus my husband hates them being involved in our business). His family is complictated and I basically have no friends I can talk to about this because no one ever likes hearing how the “silly” girl who cheers everyone up is falling apart..

Even opening up to my husband is hard. It feels like he doesn’t take it that seriously. I feel like sometimes when he sits there staring at me he’s waiting for me to say I made it all up because when we were just friends I was just that “silly” girl he knew.. I feel like he’s just waiting for that fake persona to come back.. 

I cant fake it anymore. I’m here in a room all day everyday in a home I’ve over stayed my welcome in and I just want to find  peace. If anyone has any suggestions on how I can change my horrid outlook I would greatly appreciate it

So, I’m a university student living on my own. I’m a junior and this is my 2nd year away from home. My parents have been helping me with rent and the bills for these two years so I’ve been very financially dependent on them. 
Recently, they found out that I’ve been seeing a girl. After they found out it prompted them to tell me they were not going to help me and that I was basically on my own.

When i am interacting with anyone, I will listen to what they have to say and in response, just smile and agree.

I hate this about myself as it makes me a very boring person to be around and because of that, I don't have any close friends or anyone to hang out with. 

I know this comes off as sulky, and it probably is, but it is completely in my nature to be nice to everyone and their mother and this hurts me more often than helps me.

280,"This is kind of a long one apologies in advance.   


three years ago I had to take a break from college so I could help my mom keep her house. She nearly lost it to foreclosure so I moved back in, I got a job at a factory, and I put my nose to the grindstone and got the house back to current payments. all the bills are caught up, she now has a job covers the house payments, but not the utilities. (This job requires she travel so much that literally last year she was home roughly a cumulative 12 days.) This all happened with my grandmother and uncle still residing in the house. I moved out because of how they were before, they haven't changed at all. they never contribute bills wise, they are abrasive at best, and have no respect for the house that is over their heads. I am talking like yelling at you for fifteen minutes for grabbing a bottle of water out of a case that you bought and bringing that bottle into your room.   


besides that I don't know why my grandma is here at all given she has her own house 60 miles away in a different state. But, Here She Is! if she ever does leave its for two days Max, and I will never get notice outside of two maybe three hours before she gets here if I'm lucky. Y'all I am 23 now. I saw these years going a lot differently but somehow I am still in this house, nowhere closer to graduating, heaven forbid I drink at all. And I refuse to have a relationship on the off chance that that poor person might in some way have to Meet these people in this house.   


I digress, I got injured working at that factory twice and nearly lost my life a number of times, and I am not an incompetent guy. I was out of work for about 9 months before I got the job where I currently work and yet I was still paying the bills. any money I had saved is gone, and I am back at square one yet again. but I was talking to a co-worker and she told me her rent and utilities are just $400 a month. that means even living on my own, I would actually be saving more money than I am now and I would not have this nightmare of a situation. the only problem is I know my mom. If I move out again then this place is done for. there is maybe only 40 or 50 thousand left on the house, but if its not hooked up for utilities, and having them paid for, I was told the city can foreclose on it? I'm not sure if that's true but I am so sick of this constant stress brought on by literally two people.   


Tl;dr: I'm a college dropout seeking to go back but first I need to save money again, there is an opportunity but I have to potentially screw over my own mother who I had set out to help when I left college, and that doesn't sit well with me. like at all. but the situation where I live is borderline intolerable.   


Do I leave? Do I stay and tough it out for another year? how is college even an option when all I can afford is rice eggs and broccoli for every meal I literally only save $20 a month this is painful.

282,"Hey guys. First of all, I know that I'm the only person that can make this decision, but I feel it would really help to talk it out with people. I am 25 and 7 weeks pregnant. This is beyond surreal and a huge shock.

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely emotional. I've never felt this kind of pain before. I already care for the fetus and feel very attached to it. I have always planned on eventually having kids. I am distraught because I feel as if I have let it down, because I haven't been taking care of it thus far. Admittedly, I drink too much alcohol. On top of that, I have an eating disorder. I have gone days without eating, I have gone days binging on junk food and then throwing it all up, and I have taken OTC meds that I didn't medically need. 

&amp;#x200B;

Gene wise, I have a disease that has been in remission for years, but it can be fatal. The father suffers from mental illness and has been institutionalized more than once. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a grad student. I plan on graduating August 2019, but I'm a piece of shit unmotivated procrastinator with absolutely no job or apartment prospects. I have $250 dollars in my bank account right now. My parents and the father's parents are both very wealthy but I would never dream of pushing my child onto them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not in love with the father. He was not remotely affected by the news and very blasé about my feelings. He STRONGLY pressured me to abort and acted like it was no big deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially my options are:  
1. **Have it.** Cut off the father completely. Deal with him/his family possibly freaking out about custody, etc. Continue the pregnancy with my parents' money (which is shitty). In a perfect world, I would then find a job, get an apartment/car, and live happily ever after with the baby... but that is a long shot. The more realistic outcome is that I move back in with my parents (which would make me *miserable*) and get a minimum wage job, giving up on all I've worked for in grad school.  


2. **Adoption.** Cut off the father completely. Continue the pregnancy with my parents' money (which is shitty) and give the baby up for adoption. The father and his family would RAISE HELL about this, and most likely try to gain custody. He and his family are extremely toxic and the baby would have an awful childhood and life.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Abort.** This honestly seems like the best option for everyone involved, but it would *destroy* me. I would never be the same. I am a pro-choice feminist and support the fuck out of women who abort, but no matter how I think about it, my possible abortion just feels like I am straight up killing my child. The child that is depending on me. The child that I already failed.

The damage was so bad the back of my car was crunched in and my dad’s truck was parked in front of it, smashing the front of my car as well. My aftermarket headlights and tail lights got destroyed as well as the cat back exhaust. I was fully covered under my insurance. But they told me my aftermarket parts are only a “preference” and there will be no money back for that. When this first happened, I had the decision of going through the other driver’s insurance, which he admitted fault to, or mine. His insurance has “limits” to how much can be paid out. So in a rush, I made the decision of going through my insurance as I needed them to quickly set up a rental car, which is a service I added to my insurance a few months prior. So now, after discovering the write off amount, I want to know any way I can get some kind of reimbursement for those parts.

I don't think I'll get over my fear and I don't really want to try. Living with an alcoholic was a large part of my life especially in those childhood years.

The problem I have right now is my girlfriend. First I'll say that I love her so much. More than I've loved anything. However she does occasionally like to drink on a night out with friends. Never around me thankfully but she does enjoy drinking none the less. But sadly for me just thinking of the love of my life doing the thing I hate most makes my heart race. It's all I can think about in the moment and will really mess me up. I'm never going to tell her not to even though I wish she would stop for my sake. I don't want to be controlling and telling her she can't do something just feels wrong. She doesn't do it often at all but any at all makes me uncomfortable. Is it too much to ask of her to never to drink for my sake or should I try and accept the fact that the woman I will spend my life with likes to do something that repulses me?

One more thing I'd like to say is that we have talked a bit about it. She texted me one night and asked if it was gross that she occasionally liked to drink and I couldn't lie and said that it is. She responded with something like ""slightly offended"" and that really ruined my night.

We still are friends, even fwb, which I agreed to after I knew that he was over me. He told me he is  so I didn't see an issue because the Sex was good and yeah. 

Now here is the problem: I started seeing other people, and got to know a girl who is super hot and really cool. And I told him about it, because I thought he would be happy about it. But he told me not to tell me about it. 
The other thing is that we haven't seen each other in a month due to me having exmas and when I was back in town, we couldn't meet because I was the whole weekend with my family and he seems so freaking angry now from everything. He is not answering, I don't know what to do and why. 

Is it just because of us not seeing each other? Because I'm seeing other people? Both?

290,"Okay so firstly this is not abusive. I promise my little sister is in no harm and I would never let her be in a abusive domestic situation like I was. So my brother recently turned 18 and he has a habit of playing “the parent” in our household and he has done so for many years. My little sister is 6 and when she misbehaves my brother takes it upon himself to discipline her usually by a slap on the arm or bum and/or yelling at her, this always results in my sister crying and extremely upset. I try my best to stop this acts of “punishment” but I have no power and my mother continues to allow him to discipline her, it seems likes I’m the only one caring for her wellbeing in this certain situation and I don’t want her growing up with a unhealthy attitude towards males. I know for a fact her father would be furious if he found out my brother slapped his daughter, but I’m afraid to tell him out of fear it will escalate and make everything worse. Where I live it’s socially acceptable to physically punish children so I know the police will not intervene. Personally I believe a child should only be disciplined by the parent and I know all too well how humiliating and degrading it is to be hit by an older sibling and have no power to stop another attack. I want to make it clear that I don’t believe my brother is emotionally unstable, maybe he thinks he’s doing the right thing and helping out?!

Should my brother be allowed to punish my sister? Or  should he live it to her parents and if so how to I stop him? ",04Feb2019,1

I am 25 year old guy. A year ago I moved to a small town halfway across the country to be with my best friend of ten years, who had moved here before me. I sometimes get the feeling that she doesn't actually like me and only tolerates me because I'm really enthusiastic about how much I love her. Sometimes she's enthusiastic about me too but she's often not, and although she struggles with her own depression, Im really not sure if she likes me or not.
She is easily the most important thing in my life and she's called me irreplaceable but I just don't know. and it hurts a lot to care more for someone than they care for you. This is not a ""friend-zoned"" type situation, as I am asexual. She has a boyfriend who I get along with very well. 

Im a bartender, and I hate it. I hate it because I got into it solely for money, I am not a big drinker, I think alcohol brings out the absolute worst in people, 99% of the time. I feel degraded by the incredibly disrespectful way older generations of people treat service staff. However, it's the only job I've ever had that can provide me with an adults source of income. My only other legal skills really are technology repair, which doesn't pay enough to provide the quality of living I want (eating solid meals, having a car and going on occasional trips). Thinking ""what can I do for a career?"" Is often a thought that keeps me up at night. I have ideas of possible jobs but I just feel SO apathetic. Like, I don't have to worry about the future because it's SO LONG AWAY. I know logically that it's a ridiculous thought but I'm lost. 

I've always wanted to do grand things, like being a amateur filmmaker, and getting in shape. I don't have enough friends here to make any short films, and although I go to the gym quite often, it's hard for me to find the motivation to do anything. Often instead of working towards goals I'm truly passionate about, I'll just sit around and wallow in feelings of apathy. 

I eat pretty healthy food about 85% of the time, and I work out, so I feel as if the ""low hanging fruit"" for depression cures are already taken. I used to feel grand personal growth from use of psychedelic substances like LSD and psylocybin, I can attribute that to me ending a lot of bad habits in my life, but my current living situation (living with family now in a town with stricter than usual cops) doesn't allow me the freedom of self exploration that those bring.

I feel as if many of my problems stem from having a low sense of self confidence. I used to have much more back in the city I grew up in. I knew a lot of people, I felt like I could be my true more eccentric self better. Now I'm really overwhelmed by the fish-out-of-water feeling I got from moving from NY to FL. It's hard for me to make friends here because I feel like I'm missing that sort of jump off point.

What should I do?

We moved to another apartment a few months ago and said kindly but explicitly that we don't need any help. My parents bought tickets to come help us anyways. They just bought the tickets and sent us the photo of the tickets. 

I want to downsize my stuff so I gave away more than half of my clothes to the charity. And I toldmy mother that I don't want her to buy me clothes (she buys me clothes sometimes when she goes shopping for herself). Then she told me she needs to tell me something and that I shouldn't be mad at her. I tell her to go ahead and she sends me pictures of clothing items. She says she bought me things. A friend of hers that went to Turkey and came back brought the clothes and wr picked them up. 

I told her on the phone today that I thank her for the clothes but please not to buy me anymore, that I don't want to break her heart but the next time she buys me things I will send them back. She says that I am being mean to her. I say that she doesn't understand otherwise, because we've had this conversation a couple of times before. Now she's mad at me.

I live in a family of 7 and I'm the second brother. I have 4 brothers with one who is 2 years older than me and 3 younger ones. 3rd in my family (father's favorite) is 8 years younger than me and the other two (twins) are 10 years younger than me. I'm 15.

So I know this may sound stupid of me but I really have to write this down. My father favours my third brother which most of the times I don't really care. But there are times where my father is blatantly treating me unfairly. 3rd brother is very naughty and likes to call people names. He calls my father a ""bad father"" or ""stupid"" but my father doesn't care. But lo and behold when I raise my voice slightly my father slaps me and goes ""DO NOT DISRESPECT ME I AM YOUR FATHER. "" and then proceed to ignore me. He wouldn't answer me and would get my mother or my elder brother to tell me something (very immature). My mother is always busy with work so I don't really get much attention from both parents. 

My father would also call me a useless son just because I use my laptop/playstation during my free time. I kid you not most of the times I ALWAYS help take care of my brothers or do house chores and etc whether asked or not. Then if I use my phone or not do anything I INSTANTLY get scolded and insulted by my parents. This, of course has made me severely depressed and there are times where I just want to end it all. Most of the times I hang out with friends and avoid my parents since I don't want to be causing any trouble. Why should my parents give birth to me if they know that I would get treated this way by them? My friends and grandparents are probably the only reason why I haven't committed suicide.

306,"everything in my life, everything about myself just feels completely devoid of the life and experiences that i see in everyone else

i'm a 15 year old girl taking classes online due my inability to attend any public schools. i have severe misophonia. this is something which rules the entirety of my life and there's absolutely no treatment for it, or at least none that is available to me. i cannot perform basic things such as eating dinner with my family or going outdoors or attending school or just sitting in my room or talking to people without it hurting me. 

the triggers for my misophonia are so erratic and unpredictable that it is near impossible for me to function around other people. i sit in my room with a white noise machine and headphones blasting loud music in an attempt to erase as much outside noise as possible.

i stopped attending school not even halfway through 9th grade in which my misophonic symptoms became so severe that i was partially hospitalized twice. that period was almost traumatic for me. i don't want to describe what i went through in school because it's just too horrible for me to think about

i never had friends in school past fifth grade, i sat solitary at lunch and listened to music. i never tried to talk to other people because i didn't want to annoy them, and people never tried to talk to me, so we had a nice symbiosis there. 

other mental illnesses that i've been diagnosed with are depression, ADHD, anxiety, and a few that are suspected but not yet officially diagnosed, most notably autism

i've never made online friends, either. it's even more confusing and hard to make friends online so i've generally abandoned all social media and just use it to look at art and general wacky stuff. the closest thing i have to a social media account is like, a neocities website. i tried to join discord servers but i just don't understand it. i don't know how to talk to people, and i'm not sure if i want to. the more i attempt to socialize the more i realize that maybe i'm just not meant to do it. this might all sound a bit theatrical and dramatic, but it's what i feel. i feel alone. i don't feel right. 

i think friendships and relationships are such beautiful and precious things. people can just form these wondrous bonds with each other and together they can just live and experience life in the beautiful world around them. but the more i see these bonds i realize that there's no way i could ever earnestly live like this. i can't imagine anyone caring for me or about me in anyway. even thinking about such an idea makes me feel sick and uncomfortable. the thought of myself being a person is just wrong. the world is such a beautiful place, and i'm not beautiful.

i've tried to talk about this stuff with my mom but i don't think she really understands what i mean, partially because i'm absurdly crummy at articulating my emotions. my mom is really great though and she helps me through other things and i love her =) i am seeing a therapist but we've only recently started, so i haven't had time to explain everything.

the reason i'm posting this to reddit is simply thanks to the format which allows people to see it because i have absolutely no followers or whoever who'd see it so i'd just be yelling into nothing. the thought that someone might read this is a little comforting to me so i shall cast this post to the abyss in prayer that someone will stumble across it and bother to read it. sorry if i messed up anywhere - it's 5AM and i've been shaking all throughout writing this, i just needed to write it somewhere. there was a lot of things to express here and not nearly the quantity of words needed to properly capture it despite the length this post already is.

308,"I'm currently in a pinch with trying to organize this mess to get my brother to come out on top. Long post warning, written on mobile. ANY advice welcomed, hard to boil it down to one question...

Lots of backstory: my younger brother (YB, 17) has had a slow decline into depression the last year. He has been reluctant to share anything, so we didn't really know until recently. We all suspected though, but he doesn't talk much. I am one of his closest contacts through this. 

We come from a TINY place and finding a group of people to fit in has always been hard. YB goes to school a long way away and has a shit social circle at school. He feels like he doesn't fit in anywhere and the people in his loosely defined ""friends group"" are friendly at one turn and mock him the second they find something to get him on. They made fun of his mom after finding her facebook, mocking her looks in front of him, and whenever he talks to girls they make comments about how he is desperate and shit. Small school, not that many other options for a friend group.

YB had a crush/relationship that didn't last, which stresses him. He doesn't want to end up a crazy Incel or something, typical teenage stuff.

At home, our parents try to be supportive but he doesn't have the strongest connection to them. They want the best for him, but there are always chafing. He likes gaming, and they are not the most supportive of this hobby. He has used it as an escape (from lack of friends and chafings with parents), but my parents cut out the internet if he doesn't help with dishes or other stuff like that. The gaming hobby, when used as an escape, also makes him shut off from everything/everyone, hindering progress in his life.

His depression has made him skip loads of school. He has almost not been to school since Christmas break. This of course stresses him more, since his grades decline, making parents mad, making him feel like a failure, making him MORE stressed. Its a vicious cycle. We are trying to help him, and would love advice to things that might help!

We have talked to him about the future options he has for next year: moving to Australia for a year with me (he will work/vacation while I study abroad for a year), take a year at a for-fun special school (folkehøyskole i Norwegian, no grades, no tests and you can study arts, camping, e-sports or whatever). Maybe join the military (utilizing his liking for exercise and physical achievements), or finding some work.

The challenge now is what to do the rest of this year. We want him to finish the school year (2/3 highschool) and are thinking of transferring YB to another school closer, with more people he has some familiarity with, and one of his closer friends. Finishing this year will honestly make finishing highschool much easier in the future. Doing all of the three years in one go is out of the question pretty much, next year will be something different.

Advice and comments about anything appreciated, as I have no clue what to ask specifically. I feel the best thing is to get him away from the small place he lives in, to give him options to find his group, and give him new conditions to fix his own life and stuff. This is hard since it's mid-year. I can't seem to end the post so I'll just say I'm done...

I'm on phone so sorry for the format. (this is fairly long I apologise in advance) 

I have no idea how to even begin to compose this but I'll just give you a brief backstory.

My mom and dad have been divorced for 19 years now.
My brother (24) and I (25F) did not (I still don't) have a good relationship with our dad growing up, he has always been irresponsible and detached from us emotionally and financially even though he did pay a small amount of alimony, not even enough for 1 child, let alone 2. I have, in the past 3 years, tried to mend things with him but It doesn't seem to work, therefore I have primarily given up on ever having a good and healthy relationship with him.
My mom and dad had, from my understanding, a horrible relationship where my dad cheated on her with multiple women. My dad has since remarried and he has been married for the past 16 years. (no kids with current wife) 

Back to present.
I have recently found out by a close family member that my dad confessed that he had been contacted by an 18 yo guy 3 years ago claiming to be his son. (now 21)
Which means that one of the women he cheated on my mom with got pregnant. 
My dad never responded to the letter nor did he care too much about it and made the family member promise that they won't tell anyone ever, even though they told me and my brother. 
I was left speechless and sad.
Sad because he doesn't care for the pain he caused to his alleged son by rejecting him and refusing to even acknowledge his existence and speechless because you would think that after 25 years of disappointing us he would finally come to his senses and take responsibility for at least one of his 3 children, at least emotionally.
I have nothing good to say about him, he has hurt, rejected and belittled us anyway he could. 

I feel awful, I don't know what to do, on one hand i just discovered that I have a half brother that lives in the same country as me and I don't know who he is, how traumatised he is due to this and how his life is in general, on the other I know who his dad is and even if I could by any miracle find him, he would be even more disappointed of the reality, but I guess its not really my place to decide .
My dad has made it clear to my family member that he doesn't care and that he is not interested but I can't leave with my self knowing that I have a half brother not 2 hours away from me that my dad rejected and I can't meet.
I am finding my self wishing that this is false information so I can rest my head because the alternative is way too disappointing to me. 
I need advice, I don't know if I should try and find him, give him some sort of clarity or leave it alone and hoping my dad will come to his senses (though it's been 3 years so I don't think thats happening)

Please, help us. ",04Feb2019,1

311," 

I have a lot of guilt over some shit when I was a teen. I'm in therapy but I need some outside, objective input. So it's a long story and a half, practically a bio, and I apologise. Excuse me while I pour my guts out. I was diagnosed with Aspergers as a teen, if that helps. And I'm female, 25yo.

&amp;#x200B;

At 18, I had been in a very codependent relationship for around 2 years. The guy was 20ish, and had a pretty terrible reputation for drugs, dealing, lies, theft and cheating. He smoked weed all day every day and would occasionally go on drug benders lasting up to a week or so- on which he was hard to contact. The whole relationship I had felt responsible for keeping him safe and regulating his mood. His mood swings affected everyone, but himself the most. I never felt consciously intimidated by them, but I would shut down.

I'd lived at his parents' house with him for around a year. A lot of nights, he would pressure me into sex with consistent whining, and touching me when I said no until I would give up and let him start having penetrative sex. He called it 'getting you in the mood'- yes, bleurgh. I'd usually give up and lie still and let him- if I just wanted him to stop during it, he would tell me to wait (maybe act like he couldn't hear me the first time, too), and just keep going. I remember at least 2 occasions that I tried at that point to squirm out from under him, but he was a LOT heavier than me and I'd give up and feel paralysed from doing anything more. Extra pressure came from the ways he'd react the times when I could project enough confidence into my voice to get him to stop- he had rejection issues and it clearly made him feel terrible, and would be moody the next day, yell at his siblings (aged 4-14), smoke a lot more and be generally distant. It almost felt like we had an unspoken agreement that I would let him do whatever and regulate his mood, and he'd avoid destructive behaviour. Though I'm sure that wasn't particularly conscious on his part- it was my codependency. He was himself a victim of serious and repeated sexual assault and rape as a child.

In regular daily life I wouldn't let him physically touch me at all. Some weird unconscious thing, I guess.

Anyway, I was 18. He'd cheated one too many times and I dumped him. A few weeks later, I told a friend that I thought he'd been raping me- I was hesitant to use the word, but I even did some googling and I got the message pretty conclusively. I still felt like it was half my own fault, but I wasn't ready to talk about that- in fact, I didn't give any details to the friend about the pattern. I told her he'd raped me a few times, thinking in a couple of flashes of the times when I had tried my best to get it to stop, but mostly I wasn't thinking. I was just feeling. He had made me feel like dirt, I was a fairly happy, functioning person before I'd met him, and I knew I had been taken advantage of and treated like I didn't matter. I didn't turn my thoughts to his intentions yet, I just said how I felt: raped. She convinced me to at least make sure people knew, if I didn't want to go to the police. I had just wanted to tell someone that the relationship had been worse than the drugs and cheating everyone had long come to know about him, but I agreed. Largely because I was angry and hurt and wanted him to feel hurt, too- I felt like it couldn't just end there, with me a wreck and him zipping off into the sunset to do a line. In retrospect- very obviously- we both needed therapy. I didn't even try to talk to him about how I felt- he wasn't known for accountability and I couldn't face it.

It all kicked off. She told a couple of people, I told a couple of people and it spread like wildfire (small town). I hadn't come to terms with what he had done and I felt very quickly that people were viewing him as far more vindictive than I believed (and still believe) he was. He had always been far more self-destructive than anything else- he made poor, selfish, short-sighted decisions and others got caught in the crossfire. I became seriously angry when I found out he was telling people who didn't know me, and had heard nothing about it, that I was making it up- but also guilty, since I felt the situation was being interpreted as violent rape, or somehow more... legitimate? And that this was due to me not wanting to talk about what had actually happened, and not wanting to be victim-blamed for not doing more (which I already had plenty of guilt about). To my merit I guess, when I did speak with those few people about it, I made it clear that all I wanted was for him to get therapy.

That's when it took a truly downward turn. I felt so much pressure when a family member of his demanded to know why I didn't tell her or shout for her (her room was next door to ours), I didn't have an answer. So I said 'he told me not to'. It was completely untrue, as we had never discussed it, in that moment I just couldn't face what I felt was going to descend into a lot of questioning and picking me apart. I had enough self-torment about not leaving a lot sooner or finding a way to get him to stop- the true answer was that if I had told her, I felt he would have inevitably broken up with me, and that answer seemed pathetic. 'I don't know' seemed pathetic. It haunts me to this day because of what it obviously suggests about his intention. Since then others have suggested to me that he deserved it (he's not well liked) and that my self protective instinct was completely understandable, but my regret is strong.

I then felt I had to repeat the lie, and did so to a mutual friend and to one of his friends who later came attacking me, saying that he wouldn't hurt a fly. The ironic thing is that I think I agree with her that he doesn't intentionally hurt others most of the time- he's just a mess. From then on I agreed with and encouraged those who suggested his actions were intentional rather than reckless, and felt that people believing that was safer for me than having to go into the whole story, which I had only become more afraid to discuss, and which I felt made him less culpable just due to our relationship dynamic and the lack of violence/threats. I don't recall any further lies about the specifics (and I believe I would, given that that specific one haunts me), but I certainly feel that I was manipulative in not discussing the whole story including codependent factors or my freezing/giving up, which I felt shifted some blame to me. I also felt/feel guilty that I failed to mention any of my own faults and mistakes in the relationship- I didn't do the things he did but I certainly wasn't perfect, and my codependency had led me to lie to him about things before to make him feel better on a few occasions.

I now swung ferociously between extreme guilt and extreme anger. I had carried on seeing him and having sex. In person he would say he'd get therapy and that we could fix things and potentially get back together, but when I wasn't there, he was denying all. Apparently its very common for people to keep seeing an abuser to feel a sense of control, but I couldn't understand my own actions and neither could anyone else. They told me I was being manipulated but in truth despite still loving him, I didn't believe that he would actually take accountability like he'd tell me he would. I actually got the sense when I saw him that he didn't have much awareness of what he'd done and was still seeing me in part for sex and in part was hoping to get me to retract everything. He'd look at me like I was the devil sometimes, which made me feel like I was. I had realised more and more that he had been reenacting past abuse with me (likely word for word) and that it being wrong was just not something he had the capacity or emotional maturity to notice.

My self image suffered to extremes. At times I felt evil and tried (and failed) to embrace it so I could feel like I had some kind of power. I even went to a distant friend who I'd had a very teenage bravado-relationship with and said that I'd made it up from the start, then took it back when I realised it didn't make me feel any better and I couldn't own the picture of myself as just bad and my ex as innocent, which I'm sure made me look crazy. I couldn't integrate the fact that extreme anger was normal, I thought anger along with my guilt and stupid mistakes, made me bad. I was gaslighted as a liar and manipulative by my (NPD) mother as a child despite being extremely naive and generous, which obviously worsened it.

A lot happened over the next six months or so.

I found out there was another girl who said the ex had raped her at a party, but she didn't want to go into detail, which makes me think that she was potentially in something of a similar position and didn't want to be blamed for not doing more to prevent it.

I went with him to a therapist who said that he had Borderline personality disorder.

He faked going to intensive therapy when I said I was considering going to police if he wouldn't. His brother in law was a cop and wanted to report it, causing huge issues in his family, who kicked him out but did nothing else. He had to leave our small town for a while due to harassment. All more guilt for me.

He 'dated' someone else while I was still meeting up with him and I didn't care that it was cheating, at that point i just wanted to hurt him and was glad. It at least made me feel powerful, and it felt like a small fuck you for all the times he'd cheated on me.

And then my next mistake- I messed with a pregnancy test for a positive result which I sent to his family member. Oh dear. This was partly to make him feel like crap and harm his relationship to hurt him. And partly to try to elicit a change in his behaviour- we'd had a pregnancy scare previously, during which he had stopped all drugs and started to get on track. I knew that his constantly smoking weed was not helping the situation. I do understand now that this was my codependency acting out again- trying to control the situation, like when I'd try to keep him at home to stop him going out to do drugs during the relationship. I was constantly angry that (I felt) I was suffering more than him and he was moving on with a new relationship. I actually haven't felt able to date again since. But obviously I feel like complete shit about this. I didn't have any real understanding of how bad this was at the time, though I knew it was stigmatised. I only said it to his family member, himself and I think one other person, and I didn't keep it up for long. It had made me feel even more that I must just be a bad person, I knew I needed to start actually working through this by myself and I cut all contact.

We had no contact for around 4 years other than a barrage of messages blaming me when he was dumped shortly after we cut contact, as the girl couldn't trust him after cheating with me.

Since then, I've changed a lot. For a while, I was very aggressive and would lash out a lot, and frankly I was allergic to vulnerability, and lived in fantasies in my head and on the internet. I was unable to keep jobs, stopped going out and seeing any friends whatsoever, avoided human contact and spent almost all of my time sleeping. I was basically your typical borderline personality for a while, minus the self harming traits. I saw myself as manipulative and kept away from others so that I couldn't hurt them.

I was diagnosed with 'attachment disorder' (complex PTSD) and put on a short stint of antipsychotics, which actually helped a little, though they caused weight gain. I experienced another incident of coercion by a family member. A few years later, I was diagnosed with PTSD, moved out of my family home and started learning how to process my feelings. Like actually letting myself feel guilt and anger instead of being scared of them and ramming them down into numbness and unconscious reactive behaviour. I learned and enforced proper boundaries, which I shared with my family and which helped them to grow and change along with me. Even my NPD mother. I learned gradually to trust for the first time ever, and grew an understanding that so much of my behaviour was born out of defence mechanisms to avoid rejection and anger. I have learned to be assertive and to recognise codependency in myself and others. I've learned how to be a good friend, and my friends tell me that I have helped them.

I went to college (UK), and am now in my second year at a top university.

I saw the ex recently, who apologised for his actions whilst half trying to downplay them, which made me feel moreso that I had caused something huge out of something small. He said that his actions were 'partly drugs, partly just me \[himself\]', and that he now understands that no means no. He had some scrapes with the law since, but went to anger management, though I still feel he needs in-depth counselling as his issue is triggers and emotional regulation in whole, including his own guilt, and past trauma. He thanked me for not letting him continue constantly taking hard drugs, suggesting that he'd otherwise be dead. Which I don't like- it just reminds me of how I shouldn't have been put in that situation with that responsibility in the first place, and how it was my feelings of obligation in part which led to the trauma.

I confessed about the pregnancy- he was shocked but said that he forgives me, and I made clear that I was extremely sorry about having outright lied about the 'not telling' thing, which he doesn't seem to feel was a big deal. He is in a stable job and relationship and says that nobody even brings up what happened between us anymore- which I'm thankful about, and have said that if he gets trouble from people, he can direct them towards me and I will give them my view on it.

More than anything, I wish I had broken ties right away, sought therapy immediately and only discussed it with friends in confidence if at all- hopefully leading to being able to discuss it with him in a way which would make him more self-aware and not treat partners the same way in the future.

I swing between believing he didn't even notice when I would try to squirm him off as me, as I would give up so soon and he was, well, preoccupied, and believing that he did notice but instinctively rammed down the awareness. Either way, I do understand that it was wrong, but I still haven't gone into real detail with him about any of it, as it would be morbid for me and I don't think he is ready to deal with it himself, so it wouldn't be productive. I never found out if he did any of the same with his previous exes, and whether they registered it as wrong, and what this says about me.

I went to the mutual friend who I had originally told about the assaults and explained much of it, that I'd lied about detail and gave a brief outline of the pattern of our relationship RE assaults. She forgave me immediately, said she understood and apologised for the pressure on her part to tell people, saying that it was because it's what she wished she had done in her own case. I gave her (and him) full permission to tell what I had told her to anyone else who brings it up. I don't live there anymore and don't plan to, and I can't face doing some public statement about it. My therapist and friends have said that I certainly don't owe it to anyone to dump my guilt and full explanation on them and have any negative reaction make me feel worse about myself right now.

Yet I cant seem to get past this, six years or so later. My self image is still pretty bad, and my lows can be pretty damn low. I struggle to socialise as it all feels like some awful secret that people don't know about me (which also prevents me from processing what actually happened to me) and I worry frequently that it will haunt me into the future, in the form of accusations and character smears. I want to be able to own my story and my growth but it's complex and the notion is petrifying.

Please throw out some honest opinions and advice. As I've mentioned, I'm in therapy and I talk to friends, but my fear of judgement from people in general, and from those who could feel duped by me, is huge and heavy. I have learned to be flexible and open to change and will take any suggestions seriously.

Way too long;didn't read:I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by an ex who was himself a trauma victim. I publicly made him seem more vindictive and intentional than he was, tried to hurt and manipulate him, and ruined my self image in the process. I have grown and done work to put things right but it still haunts me. What do?",04Feb2019,1
312,"Alright, so my dad has cancer. It's just prostate cancer, but he's 66 years old and suffered two strokes last year. His medications are keeping his blood pressure at an all time high, and he's recently had two separate eye surgeries.

On top of all of this, he lives in a campground in an old Airstream trailer with his 80lb watchdog. He has no heating, no air, and no phone. I only see him when he comes to visit, and even then he can barely make his way up to my family's porch. The other night he was headed down the porch steps and fell face-first on the concrete below.

I'm trying to move out of my mom's house as soon as possible. I don't want to live with her forever, and after some military service, I've got a nice chunk of change set aside for a down payment on a small house. I've been trying to get the old man to move out of his tin can and into a real house where I can keep an eye on him, but he's convinced himself that he'll move out of town to an empty lot he bought before the stroke, build a small house on it, and live there forever. Still with no phone and 20 miles away from anyone who could help him if he has another stroke. I can't begin to convince him that this is a bad idea.

316,"i’m in a tight spot at work because my immediate supervisor (NOT my boss) had her vape stolen last week. and i’ve been feeling her disposition towards me change which makes me feel like she thinks i did since i vape as well. but i pushed those thoughts aside thinking that she might just be tired or busy that week.

however, today i was summoned by the admin representative of my department and questioned about the lost vape. i felt it was an insult but i was polite and i answered their questions truthfully.
but now i am sad cause now i know that my coworker REALLY thinks i did it. and now i’m pretty sure the admin believes her since they questioned me.

its really upsetting because its just my 3rd week on the job and i’m 23 and this is my first job. and she’s 50 and doing what i feel are very childish things like ignoring my “good morning”s and such.

i am sad that our relationship turned out like this because i really respect her. now she doesnt even meet my eyes. and its awkward because her work bay is right next to mine. i cant work properly. 

i am diagnosed with anxiety and the creeping feeling that people hate you or are talking about you behind your back is the worst thing to me.

i want to tell my boss what i’m feeling but will i seem like a tattle tale? i dont want to tattle. i just want someone to talk to. its my first ever job and i’m such an outlander here. 

i just want this to be cleared up and over with so that i can work comfortably again. and also for the sake of my integrity, especially in the eyes of any future employers i might have.

TL;DR: I’m pretty sure my immediate supervisor hates me because she thinks I stole her vape. I was summoned by the admin and questioned about the stolen vape. I feel insulted and i am very upset because its only my 3rd week at my first job ever. What should i do?",04Feb2019,1

319,"*Context:*

My Dad is very smart, works hard and has big ambitions. Throughout my childhood, he has been in the start-up world working in tech. He started several companies, raised money ($1 millions), hired smart people, but never exited (never sold/made significant money). As I was growing up, he was travelling constantly to Europe and Asia, living his life on the road. He was a part of my and my sister's life but he was not very involved with the day-to-day routines of the family - that fell to my Mom who looked after us. 

My Dad's relationship with my Mom was never harmonious as a kid. They did not seem to be compatible people and barely enjoyed each other's company but he was always away so things just sort of ticked along. 

As a kid, I worshipped my Dad and was very proud of him travelling the world and really believed in him. He always had big dreams, worked hard and really wanted the best for us. However, the family finances were insecure and on several occasions we have been close to selling our house, and me and my sister were pulled out of private school last-minute. I never doubted him, however, and would always champion what he was doing. 

*Now:* 

My parents are divorcing, which is no surprise, except they are still living together as their finances are so tenuous right now. My Dad was working on a tech company for some time and they seemed close to an exit but the investors lost patience and replaced him as CEO and made him redundant. 

My Dad is building a new company but it took a lot of time and the family finances are incredibly precarious and my Mom is freaking out because she has been the only person bringing in a pay check the past year and my Dad has used his last savings (really, the last) to fund his new venture and contribute to the mortgage. If his new company does not get funding so he can pay for himself, it is very bad news.

*Me:*

I graduated college two years ago and have begun working with my Dad because he needs the support and I can take on a bit of risk. However, over time, I have begun to feel resentful and angry, which sometimes makes our relationship tense. I find myself questioning all of his decisions because I don't trust his leadership. I think he can be arrogant and make poor financial decisions. He has a small team who are helping him build this new tech company and some of them are really smart and respect him but I feel so uncertain. I love him and want him to succeed but I just cannot blindly have faith in him anymore, after decades of 'almost' success and risk taking that has meant our family's lifestyle has always hung by a string. The divorce proceedings have shown that we have no savings, no significant equity in the house and that the mortgage was a sham which was interest-only.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel torn between helping my Dad to make this a success, therefore helping the family, and following my own path and doing it myself. I am a risk-taker and can handle uncertainty but right now I just want to feel like I am on an even footing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apologies if this does not make sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Want to support Dad's new company but he has shown some bad decision-making skills although he is smart and ambitious. I feel emotionally torn because I want to help him but feel insecure and concerned for my future career.

320,"[I've already posted this on the bipolar subreddit but most of the comments were removed before I could actually read them (reddit says there are 25 comments but I can only see 12). Any advice appreciated]

During secondary school (I was 15-16 at the time so middle school I think for Americans) and puberty I had lasting spouts of depression. I never did anything about it because I assumed everyone got depressed time to time so I just kept on keeping on.

But occasionally I would transition out of depressive episodes (without realising) to a point where I felt almost on top of the world. I would feel invincible and have grandeur illusions about myself. Thinking that I was the best person, understanding the world and the universe in a way others couldn't, feeling like I was the centre of life and literally couldn't die. 

It wasn't until I started getting depressed again that I realised those thoughts weren't normal, but I've never told anyone this until now. These thoughts started to come back after I broke up with my GF late 2017 but I didn't notice that I was falling into it again. 

This time was different however as I actually started acting on my thoughts of superiority. I felt like a new overly confident person and because of the positive feedback I was receiving from my new personality my ego was hugely inflated. This is when I started abusing drugs, pushing away the people close to me, ruining relationships and generally acting recklessly.

Looking back I definitely have some regrets and currently I'm dealing with depression, mild paranoia and insomnia. 

I need to know if this was just me being stupid or if I possibly have a disorder and if it is disorder related what can I do to prevent myself from transitioning back into reckless behaviour.

Should I talk to someone qualified about this or am I just being paranoid again? ",04Feb2019,1

323,"So I’m 22 from Switzerland and I recently started my first real internship (I did one for 1 week related to school when I was 15 or so). The internship description mentioned a minimum of 3 months. It’s unpaid, but they subsidize some of the transport and food. It’s 4 days a week 10-5.

After the interview they asked me by email if I preferred to commit to 5 or 6 months. Fearing the possibility of losing out on the internship, I didn’t say anything and committed to 5 months. I’m in my second week of the internship and I really would rather stay for 3 months. My personal view is that for a first internship 5 months is too much and I have a bit of anxiety about committing to it. I’ve talked to friends and family and they, for the most part, agreed that 5 months unpaid is quite long. I’m probably going to send my superior an email, hoping to simply change the committment length in my contract.

As I learn more about the kind of person I am, I am tweaking the way I approach certain discussion points or certain topics of conversation. I have learnt very well what he’s like and how he deals with problems and I am adapting myself to how he is. He gets angry very easily. If I have a problem or need to discuss something that’s been bothering me and try approach it as a discussion, it always ends up blowing up to this huge thing where we both end up being so damn exhausted. 

As much as I have adapted myself to what he is like, I don’t feel he has done the same for me. I think he struggles to let go of his anger to try be there for me when there are problems. 

I don’t know how to help him. He has insisted his anger is something he cannot change. He says, I have a good heart and that’s just how I am and that he is angry sometimes and that’s just how he is. It won’t change.

I am happy to accept this make compromises when I can so I can be with him. He is such a beautiful person. It is just he doesn’t get sad, he gets mad. Not at me, just at situations. He holds onto anger. It’s hard to describe. He’s not violent in any aspect and he doesn’t raise his voice, but he kind of just shuts down. I’m the opposite, I don’t get angry I just get incredibly upset. I think I’m very sensitive.

327,"So I work in a childcare environment,
I am an apprentice but have been working there for 5 months, I feel like I do my job pretty well, and I’m happy to take constructive criticism from coworkers about things I could do better.

I recently gave in my notice at my current workplace because of a better opportunity closer to home.

Since I gave in my notice the person in charge of my room (we will call her x) has been giving me tasks that take more than one person, expecting me to do them alone, and then rolling her eyes at me, or telling me I should be doing it better or different.

Even before my notice X would pick at things I did to find something I did wrong and over exaggerate it. For example if I left a toy out one night, she would say the nursery was a total mess when she came in, even if everything else was spotless. I often overheard X saying unkind things about staff when they left the room, and she often directed things at someone while announcing it to the whole room. 

The day before the incident I’m worried about I overheard this manager, X obviously talking about me, and the whole day she had just been telling me off, even though I was doing things the way she had previously told me to do them.

There’s a huge problem at this workplace with talking about other staff behind each other’s back and it does make me very uncomfortable, I had raised this with X , who told me she wasn’t aware of it (total lie, as she is usually partaking in this) and if I hear anything please let her know.

So after being knocked down all day I spoke to my deputy manager, who I trust a lot more, about how upset I was, and she agreed that things aren’t right and she had already made complaints to higher management about X.

The next day when I came in I still felt very upset about being knocked down by X and being talked about, so I just felt like I couldn’t do anything right and there’s no point trying.
X came in saying to another staff member “Its just banter, if she thinks that’s me being nasty I can be nasty” 

A few hours later I am sat at the table with a child and a toy, we are about to tidy away and the child refuses and puts a piece in his mouth, I tell the child they need to take it out of their mouth and they are refusing- then they begin choking, so I do back blows and the child spits it out. 
Me and another staff member tell the child to go and wash his hands for lunch, and I am quite shaken up by what just happened. 
X comes into the room and without missing a beat tells me the child needs to put their toy away before they wash their hands- I stand my ground here as the child has just choked and I want them away from the toys, X insists this is the rules even after I explain the situation.
I couldn’t take it anymore at this point due to already feeling terrible and shaken up, I burst into tears and left the room, and for the rest of the day I just avoided X.
I spoke to higher management who have offered no solution, just that it will blow over and I can go back to working with X when I’m next working.
I know it will not blow over as the staff will keep talking to each other about it and making it worse.
I know they already discussed it as I had another staff member come and tell me that I am in the wrong, they don’t see why I am upset and that I am overreacting.

So my question is, I have 2 weeks left of a months notice, I’m not sure I feel comfortable going back, should I just not go back?

long story short, my ex after dating for a year and some change was showing me signs of her liking my teammate who was her best friend and became that tight when me and her began dating. mind you i was told that teammates are supposed to be brothers and so her showing these signs hurt and after getting advice from my friends and family they say just leave her because i mean she doesn’t respect me enough to not even get one after i told her my recent experiences with ex girls who had bestfriends.. so i did just that and shes my ex til this day

months later her cousin (through marriage i believe or a cousin thats barely a cousin i believe) told me how she likes me and wishes i was the one i was with and her cousin is a cutie, nice body and just a great person in all, before all this we were good friends and i honestly had a feeling she liked but i always told her that it would probably be messed up if we had something going on considering the fact that she was my ex gfs cousin so i always told her maybe in a few years or so because i didnt want to just reject her snd hurt her.

I tried to get in contact with him over grindr (as we were now messaging on snapchat) and got no reply. I tried on facebook as well and no reply. 

And on facebook I found he had 'in a relationship' on his bio.

I eventually asked if one of my friends knew him and they did, and gave me his number. 

Now, I'm just debating what I should do. I genuinely wanna talk to him, idc if he doesn't want a relationship, that's fine I just wanna know what I did wrong. 

I'm thinking about calling him or talking to him in person, the only thing is he might not pick up. And in real life I fear he'll just ignore me even after saying something to him (which will upset me a lot haha) 

What do you think I should do? Call? See him in person? Or just fuck off completely?",04Feb2019,1

340,"My step-nephew let my dog out and he almost got in the road. My stepmom screamed at the top of her lungs my step-nephews name paired with come away from the road... he never responded. I have literally never seen her punish that kid(he’s 10), and I was filed with a blinding rage(I literally couldn’t even see straight) because he didn’t listen and my dog or him could have easily been hit, its a very busy road. So I yelled at him and it really freaked my stepmom out, she came in between me and him which basically negated everything I said, which were true things, respect authority and somebody could’ve gotten hurt. As anticipated my stepmom didn’t discipline him at all later aside from taking him to the back room and giving him a talking to, so I confronted her with yelling(because I was still piping mad) in front of my brother and dad, and she still refused to see it as anything more than a mistake. I said if I was his age and I did that my dad would’ve beat my ass, and my God she did not like that, I probably shouldn’t have said that, but I was so mad, and she’s a conservative Christian! Spanking is not a foreign concept in that religion. While running through the house screaming some bullshit about me attacking her family, she grabbed my step nephew and took him back to his mother. I have never had a problem with her family aside from her and that kids mom and the kid himself. I never got a follow-up from his mother, but my stepmom promised that her family would never be around again while she was yelling. I don’t want this though because I don’t want to drive a wedge between my dad and stepmom. I just want some freaking discipline. I’m scared talking to her again will just hurt more than help, but I probably should. I don’t think she can see that just giving him a talking to after that is completely unacceptable, and that needs to be said, and knowing her she’ll flip out again if I accuse her precious grandkid of anything wrong. He lied about what happened too, I know exactly what happened because I was facing the gate. He had a tennis ball that he was playing with the dog with. Ball goes over the gate, he goes up to the gate and opens it just enough so he could get out but not the dog, gets the ball comes back and does the same thing, so I’m like “he knows better”. Ball goes over the gate again, but this time he runs up to the gate. opens it and dashes after the ball. Then he made up some bullshit about how he was getting the ball and that’s why he didn’t respond to her. Now I know for a fact she’s not gonna respond well to hearing that he’s a liar. I’m at a loss, I think she’s avoiding confronting me, I even extended the olive branch first. I went in the house to confront her (i live in the garage basically), and she wouldn’t leave her room, apparently she was doing schoolwork(she’s a teacher), but I’m pretty sure she’s avoiding me. At this point because she can’t discipline or let me discipline maybe it’s for the best her family doesn’t come around, because it puts the child and my dog in danger whenever a strong disciplinarian isn’t present.

342,"Hi all, currently I am employed at a large corporate in the Finance department. My job can sometimes be quite demanding and I sometimes work long-hours and at home, but there are also days where work is less busy.

I have been working there for almost 2 years and my managers have gave me great feedback. They are happy with my work and at my latest performance review given me the opportunity to pursue my Masters in Finance, next to my full-time job. Some former colleagues who used to work in the department have done this (they then show up to work super early, i.e 6am and leave super late i.e. 11pm).

My managers are expecting me to follow something similar, but they are concerned about my work-life balance and thus suggested that I opt for an 80% contract when I do start my masters (therefore I come to work 4 days instead of 5). My managers have said that either way it is my decision and they will support me along the way the best that they can.

After looking at the courses and my work-load at work, I think that staying with my 100% contract might be super difficult and demanding. I mean others have done it, but I truly won't have any social life, the former colleagues have also said that (they'd literally work on weekends and late nights and early mornings).

I wonder if I won't break down during these months?

I mainly want to stay with my 100% contract for the following reasons:

* I earn significantly more with the 100% contract than when I am on 80% contract (I've done the calculation).
* It'd be more impressive on my CV if I manage to pull this off (work full time and study full time). In any way, others have done it and it's only 1 year. I hope I can manage to do the same?
* My managers have hired more people (3) to support me in my work-load.
* My managers are super supportive, I think there's less chance I'd be fired without a fair-warning.

I think the 80% contract will be the safest way but then:

* I will earn less. I can still get by and save money (but a lot less than how much I save now and I'm afraid I will stress over my personal finance).
* It's less impressive on my CV.

Can anyone give me any advice? I'd really like to try to stay in the 100% contract but I am scared of taking too much and end up messing either my school or work. I really love my job and I don't want to lose it, but I do know that in order to get to my next position I need a masters degree (stated by the future hiring manager). I also want to learn more specific things.

I just hate the idea of earning less with the 80% contract, I am a stickler about how much I save a month and it'll be a lot harder when I earn significantly less.

Thank you so much in advance, and I really appreciate your help.",04Feb2019,1

351,"I know that sounds bad, but let me explain. 

Basically, I had a dream a couple of nights ago in which it was mentioned that my cousin has cancer. Then, when I woke up I was left confused about the origins of this information. Did my brain make it up for the sake of the dream? Or is it true, and the information came from a conversation I actually had in real life?

In the dream, I did not act suprised upon hearing this information, but I believe I have an explaination for that. I have a vague memory of a conversation with my dad where he told me about my cousin having cancer. However, seeing as I can't remember anything specific or unique about the conversation, I'm led to believe that it was also part of the dream (I could be wrong about that, though). 

Also, it's worth noting that it would actually make sense for her to have cancer, because our grandmother had cancer and she's always having all sorts of medical episodes.  

I am now left unsure of how to figure out what is true and what is false. Obviously I can't ask anybody about because just imagine how that would sound. If she does have cancer, I would sound like a horrible person for forgetting about it, and if she doesn't I'll sound like I've lost my mind.

360,"Hi Reddit,

I  need some advice concerning my mother (55f). A few months ago my dad  landed in the hospital with some unexpected medical issues and it really  took a toll on my mom. She was under a lot of stress because she had to  find ways to pay the bills without my dad's income since he wasn't  working. Eventually we received assistance, but this didn't relieve her  stress. My mom has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since her early  twenties and I've seen glimpses of her episodes as a child, but now that  I'm older (19f), I see her bipolar coming out more.

While  my dad was in the hospital, my mom was making several irrational  decisions such as spending the money that our friends gave us on  material items such as clothes and getting her hair done. Even though  she would first pay the bills with the money, she would go and spend the  rest on things that we didn't need. Every time I would try to voice my  concerns to her about the money issue and how we should either be using  it to buy groceries or save it for future bills, she would start to  become very upset at me and would basically shut me down. In addition to  this, she has had several episodes of rage, where she will yell at her  close friends and insult them and has called the police on me several  times thinking that I've stolen from her. I think she is quite paranoid  as well.

Eventually, a mental health  evaluation was done on her and she ended up going to the hospital and  staying there for 2 weeks. They readjusted her bipolar medication and  that was basically it and she was released. My dad is home now and we  have family therapy once a week, but I can still see the same attitudes  she had before her hospitalization coming out again. I'm just so  concerned because she is spending money on material things again, has  pushed all her close friends aside, and is make irrational decisions. I  really don't know what to do know. Sending her to the hospital again  wouldn't do anything I think. Do you have any suggestions? Any help is  appreciated.

I feel like I never have enough time and if I moved closer to school that extra 8 hours would really help both in terms of giving me extra study time and allowing me to be closer to potential networking opportunities to advance my career.

To give some context about my financial situation, I have decent credit (only decent because I have a limited credit history and because my balance every month goes above 70% of my credit limit BUT I always pay off the full amount as soon as the bill comes in, I'm working on increasing my credit limit), I have about $6000 saved up, no car payment or debt, I'm currently working part time (20-22 hours per week) as a receptionist for $10/hr, and my tuition is fully covered by scholarships.

I've found part time jobs in the city much closer to campus that I'm qualified for (I have office experience, my AA, and I'm a third year business student) with pay ranges between $15-$20/hr along with rooms for rent as cheap as $500 including utilities within 10 min of school. The first part of my question is, does this sound financially feasible? If I really low ball the amount of hours I work along with the pay I'd be offered, after taxes I'd be bringing home about $1000 per month.

According to my budget I can make this work with some to spare but I've never done it before so to people who have actually moved out on a limited budget, does this sound feasible? And, what tips do you have to stretch every dollar while not becoming too stressed out or overwhelmed?",04Feb2019,1

373,"So I enjoy drawing from time to time and would love to get better. I write as my main form of art, and one of the things I love about doing it is that mistakes don't matter- nobody else will see/read it till I let them, and they can just be removed as many times as I want. I'd love to get good enough at art (the pen and pencil kind) over time to experiment with graphic novels/comics. But something that digs at me when I draw is how, if I've spent ages doing a piece (usually copying from a pic I found online), a mistake late in the game can make it look dreadful. Like messing up penning the outline or trying to colour but doing it badly. It's one of the things that puts me off doing painting or anything like that. Physical art (so pen/pencil and paper) you can only erase so many times before you wear out your paper. Digital art is better, but I often find myself stressing over minor details before I've even got my outline done, when really I should just be throwing down a general outline to improve on. 

Those of you who draw/paint/sketch as your main outlet- how do you deal with mistakes? When you're drawing and something goes wrong/you realise you've done something wrong earlier, how do you handle it? And when you were only just starting out, how did you keep from judging yourself too harshly? ",04Feb2019,1

381,"I'm not sure if this is the correct forum to post this in. 

A lot of my anxiety when it comes to forming friendships comes from my inability to be authentic and problems with approving of my behaviors. 

I often feel like I can't express what I think or how I feel on the spot or in real life. This is obviously a problem because most interactions occur face to face. 

I was never concerned with defining myself, but up until 19 I felt very content with who I was. After 20 I feel like I lost my identity and with that I lost all of my interests. Now that I'm 22 I want to become the person I was. After trying for a while I've come to the conclusion it's better to bury who I was and create someone knew. This has been proven to be the tough part as I lack consistency with who I am, if that makes sense. 

Throughout college I've met people and have experienced anxiety but never in relation to connecting with people. I wouldn't engage with them first out if fear but once I did I was never concerned with them not liking me. 

This changed when I met someone I'll refer to as R. I think very highly of R, they're sweet, funny, caring, thoughtful, smart, [keep inserting positive adjectives]. R is just a genuine and wholesome person. R is also very peculiar and interesting. 

We met through a mutual friend but for about two years only spoke via text message. I would experience anxiety when speaking to R but was able to feel uninhibited for a while. 

Then I started to feel ALMOST as though I needed R's approval and felt very anxious during our chats. R isn't mean or rude, so these feelings aren't caused by anything they're doing. I managed to keep this feeling under control up until I met R about a week ago. Ever since then I haven't been able to speak to them like I normally did. I feel as though I'm inhibited and not myself. 

I also find myself putting things I need to do or want to do to do what others want to do. 

I hate these reactionary feelings and not having control over what I do, say and think. My main issues are not having an identity or a defined sense of self, and then not bring able to express myself in a way that doesn't make me feel embarrassed and that I approve of.

I've tried journalling, I've tried rationalizing my thoughts since I know there's no real reason to feel this way, I've tried pushing through these feelings to no avail. 

What else can I do to be comfortable around my friends? How can I stop feeling like a phony all the time? ",04Feb2019,1

We met randomly. I thought he was hot &amp; I just wanted sex but what surprised me was the connection. 

Our first date was 10 hours long and every time I spend time with him I knew I’d miss him. I never felt that way about anyone before. We dated seriously for a bit but I’m really just not ready for a ‘serious’ relationship, like meeting the family and friends. 

We broke up because I thought it was the best. A few months later he contacted me and asked to be friends. He missed talking to me. I was happy because I felt the same, I missed him. 

Our ‘friendship’ well... were FWB now. We’re insanely attracted to each other, that plus the chemistry. We have the same values, we want the same for our futures, it’s like.. if I was ready for something serious we’d be an amazing couple.

But now that were FWB it comes with some rules. We cant really be romantic towards each other except when were hanging out. I can’t really text him and tell him I miss him. But I DO MISS HIM. I miss him so much. I got depressed. I hung out with 2 different sets of friends today and all I could think about was how I wish I was with him. 

Its just so hard to find a genuine connection these days. My friends, they feel like they’re colleagues I’m doing the motions with (coworkers i should drink with sometimes) but with him, i genuinely want to talk to him, know his opinions etc. We don’t text a lot like we used to but Im SO TEMPTED to say I miss him. 

I might move away to a different country in the second half of this year. My time with him, it’s limited. I know I should respect our rules, I broke up with him after all but Im the type who likes do do things and not wonder ‘what if’.

I’m a 21 year old male. My whole life has been very sheltered. In my upbringing, I never went out much and I didn’t hang out with friends. All my life, I have suffered with Social Anxiety. Being out in public and interacting with other people has always made me nervous. This fear has pretty much held me back my entire life. It has held me back from making friends, getting a job, learning how to drive, etc. My Social Anxiety was not that bad during my childhood, but it skyrocketed during my adolescence when I was 14. My adolescence was by far the worst years of my life.

I’m always worried about what other people think, I have a fear of being judged by others, I struggle making eye contact, making small talk, ending a conversation, I don’t like being watched or observed, I want everyone to like me, etc. Everytime I step outside of my house and into the outside world I get nervous and I feel vulnerable. My social skills and self-esteem are very poor.

I’m sick and tired of living in fear. I am sick of having low self-confidence. I am 21 years old and I still live with my parents. I do nothing but sit in the house all day on my laptop because it is my comfort zone. I hardly ever go out and I have no friends. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life living like this.

I’m trying to gather the courage to step outside of my comfort zone and apply for my first job. However, that fear of “What if?” is intense. I know getting a job, I’m going to have to interact with people, I’m going to have a responsibility to fulfill, etc. I have a fear of failure. I’ve been putting off getting a job for the longest because of fear. However, I can’t keep wasting time.

I want to start being a functional member of society. I want to have friends, I want to learn how to drive, I want to just go out and feel free without being nervous and caring about what other people think. I feel like I have a lot to offer, I just need to get past this awful fear.

391,"Hi reddit, 

my sister is 3 years older than me and she has always been a bit introverted and a little bit odd when it comes to contact with other people. She was bullied a lot in school and is still not getting along well with people in her live, like co workers or other sudents and it´s always the fault of anybody else and not her's. I don't have that much contact with her because we have so different personalities and it is difficult for me to get why she does certain things the way she does them, for example she hates hugs, I'm her only sister and she will be mad at me if I hug her at christmas or something. In the last few years we didn´t see each other often maybe 2-3 times a year during holidays or birthdays, also she only shows up when she knows we are going out for lunch and she knows I'm going to pay for it. She doesn´t have that much money and I can affort it so that is not the problem, I just don't like that she is always expecting it like it is the most normal thing that everybody has to pay for her. 

She also doesn't have the best relation ship with my dad, he can be a bit rough sometime with his jokes, but we know that he's only joking and doesn't meant it like that, thats just his humor. In the last years he had some serios health issues and it looked pretty bad at times but he fought his way back to live, in the time when he was sick my sister wouldn' even touch him. We were at a family gathering and she sat at a different table with my aunts and uncles (we are a big family so there were a lot of tables full of people) because ""dad smells so bad I can't stand sitting next to him"" (which is not even true). She also called me to let me know that she's planning to move back to my mom and fix the house, but only when my dad passes away, like what actual the fuck? I don't get how she can say something like that.

Anyway in the last 2 months she changed a lot, normaly she meets with my mom at least once every week and speaks to her on the phone on a regular basis, but she barely calls her anymore and that is bothering her of course. She also didn't show up for christmas at my parents house because she had to ""learn for school"", she met with my mom but never even called my dad. She normaly also gives me quick call or texts me to say merry christmas, but that didn't happen either. At new years like every year, we call our parents when we are not there to wish them luck for the year, again nothing from her. Then it was my dads 73rd birthday a few days ago and you can guess it, she didn't even bother to call him. Now I'm starting to think that there could be something really wrong with her, but I don't know how to find it out and I thought that maybe anybody has an idea.

400,"TLDR: my six year old son has recently started being bullied at school and no longer wants to go. He is experiencing anxiety with going to school. Looking for advice on the best way to approach the situation with my son and with his school.

I apologize in advanced for poor formatting, I’m writing this on mobile. 

I’m going to start this with a little backstory; my son G is six years old, and in first grade. G has always loved school, and had lots of friends between his school and his daycare. Anytime he was asked how his day was, he’d answer with enthusiasm. For both junior and senior kindergarten G had the same teacher, and the same ECE and he developed a close relationship to them both. Majority of the students that were in the JK class, were also placed in the same SK class aside from a few new children. Several of these same children attend the same daycare as G both before and after school. So basically my point is that these kids have all been very close since before they started kindergarten. 

My SO and I were kind of worried about G going into grade 1 because we knew that he would have a new teacher, and we were concerned that because he had the same teachers and mostly the same classmates for the two years prior that it would take G some adjusting. Sure enough, on Gs first day of first grade we learned that the teacher that he was supposed to have, the teacher that he had met at the end of SK, had a medical emergency and would be taking an indefinite leave. So as parents, we were kind of frustrated for our son and worried that he would have a different substitute every couple of days. Thankfully the school was rather accommodating and had the same substitute for the duration of the original teachers leave. G seemed to really like this teacher, and he definitely looked up to him. G was his happy, regular self up until about two weeks ago. 

We noticed that G wasn’t eating all of his lunch, which was rather unusual for him. And nearly every day G complains that his belly hurts and that he doesn’t want to go to school. At first we took it for simply that; he didn’t feel well and didn’t want to go to school. But it didn’t stop. Then G started saying things like “Can I stay at daycare all day, I don’t want to go to school” and then we started thinking that this was more than just a belly ache. G has always been a very sensitive boy and has experienced anxiety here and there. We spoke with the ECEs at his daycare, and they told us that when they get the daycare children from the school that G always says that his stomach hurts, but by the time they make it to the daycare he’s laughing and playing with his friends and says that he’s okay. We sat down with G and asked him if his belly hurt because he felt like he may throw up, or if it was more of a nervous, butterflies in his belly kind of feeling. Sure enough, he told us that he feels nervous but he doesn’t know why. 

Fast forward to this morning, and naturally G says that his belly hurt and he didn’t want to go to school. This time he was very upset, so much so that we decided we would keep him home and try to get to the bottom of this and finally we got G to open up. He told us that some of the other boys in his class big him and make him frustrated and laugh at him when he gets angry, and as a result he gets sad and doesn’t want to go to school. He also told us that whenever he tries to talk to his new teach (his original teacher that is back from medical leave) always tells him to keep it to himself and she never talks to the boys that big him.

My SO and I want to speak to the school but I’m looking for advice on the best way to approach the situation. ",04Feb2019,1
401,"When I was applying for colleges and scholarships in the fall I came to the conclusion that I wasn’t ready to move out after senior year. My parents fully supported me going to a university but they had made it clear that they think it would be better if I stayed home and went to the community college my dad works at. I agreed because that means no rent, no food payment, just my phone bill + car insurance  and probably gas (I don’t have a car yet but my parents are kinda planning on buying me a real cheap one to get to work) and the requirement that I get a job while in college. 

With that I turned down a presidential gold whatever scholarship from an ok university that wouldn’t quite pay for it all. I heard that they overload you with courses and a lot of people end up taking five years for a 4 year degree, so I decided against it.

Now I need to decide what to do. My dad is a pretty well known web developer/designer/server guy in the industry. He got cold called by google for a senior position in another city. I could get an A.S. in comp Sci which would be about 45 credit hours because I have all of the general requirements from AP classes. Problem is that the A.S isn’t transferable at all, so that pretty much rules out going to a university without redoing everything I did in community college. At the same time I could get an A.S. in two years with an extra 15 credit hours in comp sci electives which  would mean a lot more actual knowledge in more specified areas. I could pretty much come out after two years with pretty solid ability in programming, data science, web design and some database stuff. This degree also gives a couple of technical certifications and a 50 hour internship. 

Option 2 is to get an A.A/university transfer. I could get that degree in about a semester because of all of the AP/dual enrollment credits I have. After that I would probably transfer to the local university that I turned down a scholarship for or transfer to UF online, which costs like 130 per credit hour I think. That’s about 8k. I’m probably gonna start working this summer so I don’t know how I would pay for UF online. With some money saved from whatever job I get plus FAFSA and no big bills I think I could probably handle it. If I really needed money my parents could help me out and my grandma is giving me (and all of her grandchildren) a thousand dollars for anything having to do with college.

I don’t really know what I want to do after college other than that I want to be programming and possibly doing data science stuff. A lot of people like my dad and my comp Sci teacher say that the private sector is much better for making money and it is more lenient on education.",04Feb2019,1

The organization is has graduates yearly so this could be a recurring stream.

I put it in quotes because i am not sure if my 55 year old parents are actually correct in the diagnosis since they may not be understanding what the doctor is actually saying. at any rate, my father has a nebulizer that he uses regularly. Unrelated he also has hypertension. he has blood pressure medication for this

upon getting ready for the doctor visit my father took a hot shower which triggered a coughing attack, he quickly ran to his nebulizer, but it did not get better. My mother whom was not home yet called for an ambulence.

My father was admitted early friday afternoon and given oxygen and i guess a more potent version of his nebulizer. he was told to stay cuz he was coughing bad (he has been for 2 years) and his blood pressure and blood oxygen was bad. It is known that my father has hypertension, and on top of that he gets anxiety at hospitals and his blood pressure is higher there. It is called White coat hypertension.

at any rate he was around 110-120, the highest he has been was 220 when he was diagnosed with hypertension 2 years ago.

He sees the lung doctor saturday, whom tells him his that he should be okay to go home since his blood oxygen levels are only 2 below the recommended levels, and given his history, his blood pressure is ""normal"" for him.

He also cannot get tests and a real visit with this lung doctor until he is discharged, or so im told through the grapevine. It is now monday.... if they suggest he spends another night i am strongly urging my mother to take him home anyway so that he can see the lung doctor, or maybe even get him discharged from the hospital and go right to the doctor.

Sorry for the length, just a lot of uncertainty. Idk why he cant see the lung doctor for a real breathing test, and get the underlying issues fixed. Seems silly he cant see the doctor while in the hospital, but has to sit in a room all day which is raising his blood pressure..",04Feb2019,1
409,"recently my mom quit her job because of stress and it was not working for her. she is currently supporting just myself and herself. i haven’t bothered her asking for money in the past months because i found a job and do work online that generators income. 

i asked her if she could open a saving account for me since i plan on going to college. she laughed at me saying my little $5,000 is not even worth the time to be bothered and said how she had more. i wasn’t trying to brag or anything just wanted to keep my money in savings not my checking account. 

since i’m 17 the account is attached to hers. recently she has been doing a lot of weird things for money including using money i saved for a trip to take my stepsisters on. now she took $3,000 to pay her bills, i can see the withdraws and the statement to where the money is going. 

most of the money is going towards materialistic items not crucial bills which maybe i could understand. i just don’t know how to speak to her about it, would think she would at least ask me. 

TDLR; my mom took $3,000 out of checking account after she quit her job to buy nonessential items and i have no idea how to ask her about it.  ",04Feb2019,1
410,"I have a coworker (She’s worked here 35+ years; I’ve been here 2 years) that seems to be nitpicking everything I do.  I actually avoid her as much as possible, as rarely anything good comes from the interaction.  Basically, each Friday, before she leaves for the day, she tells my boss what I did that week to get under her skin.

Most recently, this last Friday, she told my boss that I am very patronizing and fake.  The specific encounter that she referenced was a 30-second phone call that concluded by me saying “you’re the best”.  She had called to let me know she was about to do something that benefits both of us, and I appreciated it. 

I don’t normally let petty things bog me down, but when it seems to affect my boss, I feel there is something I should do or say to rectify the situation. 

This weekend, I googled “you’re the best“. I couldn’t find anything referencing a patronizing nature of the comment. Essentially learned that it was a way of saying thank you that originated in the 60s or 70s. And the common response for it is “you’re welcome“or “my pleasure“.  Silly, I know, but the exercise of googling this made me realize how messed up it was. 

Anyways, I know this sounds ridiculous, but what could I say to my boss to put this behind me?  How can someone best explain they are not fake, but rather simply cordial in the workplace?  ...",04Feb2019,1
411,"I’m in the process of applying to jobs and I wanted to know if background check companies give direct feedback to the employers in real time.

412,"I meet someone. I hang out with them and their friends. I become interested in them.

Gradually I start to express my feelings (through stuff like sending wholesome memes and being generally nice to them and giving hints). They respond positively at first, giving back hints, but then suddenly start ignoring me, before we get close.

This normally happens immediately after we have some meaningful encounter (such as a feely dovey exchange). They start to take infinitely long to respond to texts and we somehow stop seeing each other for long stretches of time, and when I stop initiating conversations, we essentially lose contact. 

Everyone tells me I'm fairly good looking, and I've never confronted anyone in the past about what went wrong (they remain friendly, but I can obviously tell they're suddenly not interested at all).  

This has happened several times now. Could someone please help me identify what the problem could be?

413,"So, to start off, I will be graduating from a masters program in business this coming spring and have two main job prospects lined up. One of the positions would be a data scientist at a very large company working with their mergers and acquisitions team. The other job would be an analytic consultant for a small consulting firm that specializes in data engineering and more “back end” data work. Both jobs have their pros and cons and I am having a hard time making a decision on which one to go with. 

First off, I believe I would be more interested in the data science role and being involved more in the predictive analytics space as compare to the data pipelining space that would be more prevalent in the data engineering role. I do understand that both jobs rely heavily on the ETL (Extract, Transfer, and Load) process that is needed to make data available for analytic purposes, so there is a fair amount of overlap when considering the two positions (around 60-80% of the time spent at either job would be doing virtually the same tasks). The data science role would jump start my career without having to be a data analyst/business analyst/ more generic role that is normally required to become a data scientist. However, the data engineering role is at a company that plans to grow a lot over the next few years and could lead into a data science role, and, from talking with employees seems like a better place to work in terms of work life balance. I’m concerned that if I go for the data science role I will have missed a great opportunity at a smaller company to grow tremendously and lead to other great opportunities, but the smaller firm also comes with risk and many “ifs”. But I am also concerned that if I pass up the data science role and the smaller company stalls it would have been a few wasted years where I could have been advancing up through the larger company while also competing tasks that I am generally more interested in and gaining valuable experience. 

In summary, would you recommend taking a bit of a chance with the smaller consulting firm, hoping to grow with the company and take advantage of the better work life balance and more relaxed culture, or, go with a big company in a data science role that would possibly be more intriguing to me, put me two years ahead of where I thought I would be, but also may not advance my career at the same pace the smaller firm would and is also a more of a traditional 9 to 5 job? 

Thank you guys! ",04Feb2019,1
415," I just started my first job in an advertising company. Since I was a fresh graduate, I was given a low salary but because I liked the company and felt like I’ll learn a lot from them, I accepted the job. (Even though I got offers with higher salaries.)

Now that I started the job, I feel like I’m not given many tasks to do that involve me actually learning. I’m not creating anything new, all I have to do is using other people’s templates that they already created and add some new stuff to them. My job position is “content producer” and according to the job description, I’m supposed to take the lead in copywriting and social media posts creations. However, I’m not involved in the creative decision process at all. The marketing team comes up with the copywriting and the post ideas and then tell me to paste them into an image. If they feel like the post is too creative, they’ll assign it to someone else instead of me.

I was excited to work with the Marketing Director because I wanted to gain knowledge in marketing and branding. (She was assigned as my manager when I signed the papers.) However, only when I started my first day of the job, they assigned me with someone else.

In addition, one of the employees asked the Marketing Director to add me to the form where they give direct feedback from the clients (on the posts I made) BUT the marketing director said that is not my “role.” Which I find ridiculous because, the employee ends up screen-shooting the client’s feedback and emailing it to me. 

It’s just my second week, but now I’m wondering if I made the right decision by joining this company? I really want to increase my salary after my probation period but after this, I feel like I wouldn’t have added much for to company to negotiate for.

So my options are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Talk to the CEO and inform her that I want to be more involved in the creative process. (She told me to talk to her if I wanted more work.)
2. Confront the Marketing Director and tell her what my exceptions were.
3. Do not say anything, and just work hard on my given tasks.

417,"My mother uncontrollably goes on temper tantrums and loud yelling sessions over the most menial things such as dishes, taking out the trash, waking up late etc. She can't go a minute without knowing where any of us are and what the fuck we are doing. No matter if we're legitimately working, studying, doing recreational stuff or just plain going out with friends every once in a while. Mind you I'm already 22 and already kinda independent (living alone elsewhere is expensive as fuck unfortunately). She shit talks our friends like they're all devils and despises anything we do outside of the benefit of the home. She has been physically abusive to my sisters which infuriates me (and is the reason why I don't want to leave the house). My dad is frustratingly passive and submits to her.

Tonight she started yelling and waking up the entire house in the middle of the night because there were dishes in the sink. Yes, that. Usually me and my siblings would just stomach it, stay quiet and let her blow her steam but something in me snapped. My thoughts were running about grabbing the bat... and beating the shit out of her. I'm so mad. And tired. This shit has been going on since I was 12 (long story) and I'm sick of seeing and hearing her ruining everyone's shit every day.

I'm feeling massively guilty about the thought but I'm very afraid that if she goes (and she will) on another tantrum tomorrow morning, I might break and do something I may horribly regret. 

I hate her. And I hate my dad for letting her be. And I pity my siblings (except my older brother who I haven't talked to for years). I want to try to get away but it feels like I can't. This home is so toxic to me. I already have both physical and mental health issues I have to deal with and this shit at home stresses me out every single day. I've recently stopped working and went back to finish my degree but studying under all this stress is heavily affecting my livelihood.

418,"Alright; so I'm 30, living with my best friend and his wife. They've done a lot for me in the past, and now the living arrangement basically works out for all parties (my rent allows them to have a second house, and renting a bedroom from them is cheaper than anything near work).

The problem is... well, mostly with me. I really value my ""alone time"", but I really don't feel like i get any time to myself. I work with my friend (he actually got promoted to technically being my boss), so we see each other quite literally all day, every day.

So usually, as soon as we get home, I just go to my room. I'll either go to sleep, or play games a little while and *then* go to sleep. We're gone for 11 hours a day, so I'm honestly pretty wiped-out most of the time anyways. It's actually *really* been wearing me down.

Well this past weekend, I'm not gonna lie; I was in a super shitty mood. Work has been overwhelming me to the point I've thought about quitting, so I've just not been in the mood to deal with people. Irony being, this is the weekend they have people over *all freaking weekend*, including a superbowl party yesterday. I was in a bad mood, so I just stayed in my room the whole weekend, and decided ""Okay, I really don't like spending my precious little PTO, but I'm just gonna day Monday off and relax at the house by myself"". I let my friend know I'm taking today off, and proceed to be miserably, looking forward to today.

Except... they apparently also decided to stay home. I'm sure my friend is just ""working from home"" (something that's *sometimes* allowed, but usually requirements permission from upper management), and my friend's wife I think has a job that's pretty flexible. My friend probably just didn't want to deal with traffic, so decided he'd work from home.

Now, full disclosure; right now, I am fucking FURIOUS. I spend nearly a *month's* worth of PTO just to take today off, and I don't even get to enjoy it. Meanwhile, my buddy gets to just work from home, and it's not going to cost him anything. I know that's a stupid way to look at it, and it's not as thought I communicated *why* I was taking today off, but it still sucks to have wasted all that PTO and to be fucking miserable for the day off.

Anyways...

Now here's the problem; I am living in *THEIR* house. So it's not like I have any right to ask them to vacate the premises just so I can enjoy being at the house by myself. I feel like even *asking* for that would make me come across as an entitled asshole.

Yet... I am seriously on the verge of a mental breakdown. Since late-November, my job has been stressful and overwhelming, and it just doesn't feel like I'm getting any kind of a ""break"". I can't really relax when I'm home, because my friends are both ""do'ers"", constantly either working on the house, or working extra for their jobs.

And, to be perfectly frank, I'm getting the feeling that my friend -- who is now technically my boss -- holds it against me that I don't do extra work in my personal time, like he does. He's constantly suggesting I do stuff to ""get ahead"" over the weekend, and it feels like there's some resentment (the other two guys in our department also don't put in any extra work, and he's made comments that he thinks they're lazy or half-assing it, and he doesn't even *live* with them).

I dunno... right now, I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking down, and I'm just trying to find some kind of mental relief. I just want a day to lounge around, watch TV and not have to worry about *shit*.",04Feb2019,1
419,"Late 80s, Here’s the back story, in the 7th grade this boy bullied me tremendously. Calling me names, to the point I was broken over it. Seriously, it was traumatic. I never forgot him. I remembered where he sat. Where he stood. What parts of the building he hung out. I avoided this kid at all costs. I hated my bully. Hated him, so much I remembered his name. 

Fast forward, it’s the 90’s. I’m an adult in a obscure rock band. Doing music and writing my own songs. It was a small scene and my 26th Birthday. The place was packed we all got trashed it was a good night. I have good memories. 

20 yrs later, 2018...I’m still involved in the art scene, playing music in small venues. Nothing special, had a show at a Coffee House. Enjoyed the hell out of it. Nothing, stood out of the ordinary. Had some friends show up. Played songs I wrote. We left the coffee shop and hit a bar that evening. Again, no one stood out that I could recall. 

A year later...2019, a friend texts me. You should met this guy he knows you? It sparked my interest. She said, he mentioned the  show from the 90s and coffee shop gig.  Odd, I thought. Who is it? This guy? Who remembers that old band from the 90s? Weird, haven’t heard the name in years. 

Turns out my bully from the 7th grade, who was in the shadows of my guitar shows. Never apologized. Never made himself known, but managed to talk to a friend of mine? After all these years? It’s so weird to me. 

My female friend was like, give him a chance have coffee with him. My trust meter went off the chart. I suddenly became angry and defensive. I didn’t even want her to know why. He doesn’t deserve the satisfaction. It took some major texting to figure it out who he was. By that time, I was pissed. It hit me later. This guy knows me? He’s seen me play and never had the guts to come forward. I don’t like cowards. 

My friend was upset I wouldn’t give him a chance... he had his chances. Does he deserve a chance? 

Why would he do this? It’s so weird.

420,"First of all excuse me for my use of English, I’m extremely nervous as of writing this...

First of all I’ll call for convenience and to hide their identity the main people concerned, so my buddies Jake and Rob, and some girls (Skylar, Rebecca, Audrey and Alvena aka the Alpha whore).
I’ve been pretty positive about the situation in class for a couple of weeks now maybe too positive.
So this is how it all started...
It was Sunday around 17:00 and I asked everybody out (note that we are a small group... like 6 people, in the class we’re like 12 but long story short there were two couples and two people from the couple cheated on the other two together and so we’re divided and the atmosphere is shitty). 

And as almost always only my dude responds (we are 2 dudes and 4 girls) and then a girl saying that she could one hour later (Alvena), one didn’t respond for over 2 hours and a half (while having seen the message, Audrey), one said that her parents didn’t want her to (Rebecca) and the last said she din’t know (Skylar).

After a long fight between Alvena and Jake, who hangs out with the other half of the class but is still my friend and of some girls from our group as well, I’m like ""yo you gotta fucking stop right now or else I get the fuck out"", they continue and I quit. Then Alvena creates a new group without Jake and I straight up say I’ve had enough of you (plural) and of the internet for today and quit that group too (I only added this part because it’s an important detail that you’ll see later on).

If it wasn’t for the fact that I kind of knew their excuses were all a bunch of bullshit (always had it in the back of my head ‘cause it has already happened a few times now), I’d be okay with it, Alvena sends a vocal message saying she is coming... That’s when I start to get upset and angry, I message Rob being like wtf is going on? He’s like no fucking clue dude... We decide to not give a fuck for the rest of the day and just take the doubt down and go do some intensive fitness to get rid of my nerves...

A couple hours later (21:00 and something) I’m seeing a story of Alvena on Instagram and they’re in the club and I’m like that’s how it works for real? They say you don’t come in the club (which is true because I live far away from it and I can’t sleep at Rob’s or Jake’s because Rob doesn’t like it and Jake doesn’t hang out with our group) and you said ""I’ve had enough of you for today"" and I type to her I’ve got nothing to say...

Then I text Rebecca (which is [not sure if she it is a “was” at this point] a good friend of mine), that’s how it works and she’s like yeah... 
I go angry on that keyboard, I’m like what’s annoying is that we’re like wanna hangout and you all invent excuses (I specified but for the sake of time I’ll not rewrite everything), you can’t even tell us straight up ""No"" and while we stay at home cutting our veins we could have easily taken a drink and splitted when you would go to the club. 

And then the two bitches (Rebecca, Alvena) in the same vocal message are like you said you’ve had enough and we only went out to go to the club (knew it wasn’t true, the next day I discovered all 4 of them were at Skylar’s eating pizzas just before).

Next day at school I’m pretty mad and they can see that on my face they don’t speak to me, at recess Alvena and Audrey call me and I go and they repeat this only that I’m like why didn’t you ask Rob out then? And they respond saying he wouldn’t have come without me and that sort of BS... and I’m like ok then why didn’t you say that you were at Skylar’s (not exactly like that she said that just before and I asked them).

Alvena says for that you ask Skylar or something and I was like so you’re admitting you’re wrong and she says no it’s Skylar’s fault, I just move pass that...

In English class I and Skylar have a weird type of conflict (as always when we are in that mood you can’t really get mad at her for nothing) we call each other monkey and shit like that just for fun and Alvena interferes every time, so I respond whotf did talk to you and she replies with I don’t need someone too (something that only a cocky ugly bitch can say) and we continue and she keeps interfering and then starts insulting me. 

As a result I start insulting her, nothing bad yet. However at a certain point she starts bringing to the conversation my sexual orientation (I’m straight so I don’t give a fuck no offense to any gay people ;) and at the end I mention the fact that she and Audrey did hickeys on each other, no biggie, no one gave a fuck (forgot to mention we are 11th graders and we are in class with 10th graders because we are small classes).

Next thing you know, Audrey comes at me and is like wtf is wrong with you, you said I’m a lesbo and now 10th graders think that (Alvena got roasted by me in front of all of them and she gets roasted and cries every time she talks shit about them, they use the sentence I used, since then they’re all careful around them... I’m really not a dude that likes getting into trouble but after two months of ball breaking she just deserved that, funnily enough I’ve not done shit the last six years so I couldn’t have been the one provoking the tension). 

The Alpha whore starts bringing in stuff like it’s not because she doesn’t like you that you are allowed shit like that (once I said she was pretty imo to a dude and that son a of bitch went straight up to her and told her).

Tbh I don’t give a fuck of being their friend (speaking about Alvena and Audrey, even if only the former really bothers me while Audrey was cool with me until that) I just don’t want them to slander me to other people and I want Skylar and Rebecca to understand why I’m mad at them. Also at this point I’m pretty concerned about my worth to them, guess there’s no real dude-girl type of friendship. Good news is next year I’ll be 7000km away from them for probably the rest of my life so I’m happy about that, I feel like I deserve better than this...

Just for extra detail in case it might be relevant to problem, I use kratom five days a week to help with school, I smoke marijuana before bed, and have a vape with nicotine. Maybe this could be related to the issue. Anyways I hang out with my girlfriend a lot and lately I’ve just been freezing up and my mind starts running. During these times I want zero physical contact, I don’t want her to mess with me, or talk to me. And if she tries to tickle me or anything I just get really jumpy for up to ten minutes after. Also I am incapable of realizing the worth of other people in my life during these “freezing” periods. It’s been happening for a long time but it’s been worse lately. 

My parents are great to me, a bit harsh sometimes but they’re great, my girlfriend is nothing but loving and supportive (together for 6 months) and I couldn’t ask for anyone better...

So, with that out of the way, let me explain exactly what happened. After the first exam 2 girls invited me and my friend to coffee to talk about how badly we did on the test. We started walking towards the coffee shop when these 2 dudes mentioned previously started following us. They would randomly ask us where we're going and all of that and we were just telling em ""nowhere"" and such. We got to the coffee shop and they just randomly sat next to us at the same table. The whole thing was awkward af with the dudes constantly making sexual jokes and everybody feeling uncomfortable. One of the girls said that she doesn't really like a classmate because she's always a bit snobby and she feels like she's way too entitled to associate herself with the rest of the class. That was all she said. After the whole thing was over the 2 dudes immediately snitched on her and the girls started fighting (online).   


The following day I entered the class and started joking around as I usually do with the girl that the girls were talking about. As soon as the teacher walked in I got called by the 2 girls that I went to coffee with telling me to stop interacting with her and ""her group"".   


How do I avoid picking sides? I like being everyone's friend, laughing with everyone, etc. I really dislike this sort of ""choose a side"" type of a scenario. Atm I just decided to ignore her and continue my random jokes but they didnt seem to like that.",04Feb2019,1

433,"Its the last semester of school and my careless youth is coming to an end in my brain. Reading posts doesn't seem to solve issues these days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately i had this strange feeling to do something with this flesh I am wasting but to my amazement, It would appear its far too late to reach any of my sudden interest in doing something that would benefit my future. Blindly throwing away any power to do anything, i instead prompted to waste away and escape from reality with the use of technology. Recently the age old thoughts of just ending my life have been getting deeper and harder than ever before due to my own actions and choices. Recently my thoughts have rose to were I have sat at a final place but some how I am still remaining. 

With the failure to do such a simple task, I have fallen on a goal in life i told people as an excuse to make them believe i actually had some plan in life before. 

The goal in life i spoke of was to become an esl teacher at one point. something that appeared very simple, so i always used it as ""my dream"" when people asked. 

The problem with that exact goal is that i personally threw all my academic grades out even before i had this thought. i let my brother convince me that aiming for university was too hard an eventually i stopped caring once i found out there was nothing i really wanted to do. so i lived day by day, going to school blankly. parents never knew anything, they never really cared for me and projected their own dreams upon me like a normal parent to me. 

So with this lie spread out to the very few people around me and me, convincing my other wise unambitious self to follow through with something for once, I wonder how might i even reach any higher than another lowlife like my parents grew to be?

&amp;#x200B;

the program needs a bachelors degree at least in something, anything. i tried to get enrolled into grade 10 English so that i could upgrade it to higher levels, but recently the areas around me have low student count causing for a low amount of classes to be available. the online course i could take was also filled after i waited a months for a spot. i do not even know what to do now. i am not iep, never got put into it even with my issues so i cannot stay for 2 semesters more. i don't know what to do now. i have been thrown into random courses in my final year too, and last year i had to take courses such as french which i wasn't able to actually understand, i failed co-op classes, dropped into them i was not mentally ready or smart enough to do well and i failed another course just because of my own foolishness and self pity. 

I know that failing has been the product of my own actions with no excuse that i could properly explain here. 

My years of hiding and reading forms and trying to run from everyone is at its end and now i ask the place where i have lived for my past 9 years of my short existence, where i was aware of my choices with their consequences and choice to ignore them. and like many I assume, I came running back crying after i ignored everyone.

We discussed the idea of having children before getting married, both of us were on the fence and knew that if we did want to have a child, it would be years down the road. No problems there, we are on the same page- if we decide on kids, we will start trying before I'm 26.

Well, it has been some time now, and we're talking about a possible ""timeline"" for trying to conceive, if that's ultimately what we decide we want. We are financially stable with good health insurance, both mentally stable with supportive families, both physically healthy, both wanting to raise a child, both capable of raising a child...but it keeps coming down to one specific concern for the both of us: Our sex life.

Sex is a very important part of our relationship, physical touch is the #1 ""love language"" for both of us, we have sex about 4x a week on average and we love the emotional intimacy that comes with that. We bond over other things too, of course. Our hobbies, loves of cooking, traveling, and music, quiet time togetherr, time with our pets and more, but sex has always been very important for our bond. Obviously, we understand that having a child means you wouldn't have the energy or time to have sex THAT frequently, especially during the baby and toddler years...but we've also heard some serious dead bedroom horror stories from our friends and family members with children. These stories scare me because lots of them end with ""aaaand now we're in a sexless and emotionally distant marriage, living only for the kids.""

Is this the reality of having children? Or this the reality of marriage? Or...is it the reality of marriages that should not have resulted in children? Do you have to sacrifice that bond with each other in order to have a bond with a child? Is it worth it? I'm looking for any advice, insight, or opinions from people with or without children.

TLDR: My husband and I would love to be parents, but we worry about our sex life and marriage suffering if we become parents &amp; are unsure of the best choice...

458,"Hi!

So me (20 yrs old) and two other friends planned a 3 day, 2 night trip together this weekend. It's my first time driving myself 5 hours out, and I have to be there for a military meetup for an officer program I want to do. Figured I'd plan a trip around it to convince my parents.

1st day would be driving, 2nd day would be me going to a military meetup in the morning, and then thereafter just spending the time in the city, go to a concert, and 3rd day would be driving back.

We rented a room, and were gonna buy the tickets until one of them (we'll call her A, 21 yrs old) gets a call from their specialist about a mandatory appointment that weekend. They are closer and their families know each other more, so when A fell out, the other (Z, 20 yrs old) was still excited to go but after her parents found out that the other was not going, Z's family pretty much pulled out too since I'm a guy.

I'm trying to really read whether Z wants to go as well. I asked if there was anything I could do, and they said talk to their parent. So it SEEMS like they still want to go.

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point I have two options when I call:

1. Try and convince the parent for next weekend,  the birthday of Z, and ask the parent about making it a birthday surprise for Z. This was A's idea, but A also said she can't guarantee she won't have a follow up appointment that weekend and means I have to convince my parents. This also leaves me alone on my first road trip, which I'm okay with but I get a little anxious on doing things on my own for the first time. I can live through that though, but I'm not sure how my parents will take it.
2. Try and convince the parent to go through with the original plan, and have just us 2 go together. I don't know how to do that and make them comfortable with it, though.

There's a lot of moving parts and any advice on how to socially approach this situation when calling her parent is a bit difficult. Which would be more effective? How could I be more effective in leveraging a conversation towards letting her go?

463,"My 22nd birthday is in August and I’m growing frustrated with my stagnant place in life. I grew up with immigrants from Central America and navigating the US was difficult for sure but I generally floated through school unchecked because of parents unaware of how the system worked. I always did the bare minimum so I barely got away with being lazy. Studying right before the exam etc. I’m a good information sponge but school just makes me want to collapse on myself especially since the older you get the more mundane learning becomes. 

I have had an obsession with psychology and people with as a result of my constant need to answer “whys” and my difficult mental health growing up. I just know psych degree is so out of reach because I know in my heart I’m not a scholar. 

I’ve worked with kids as a party host and I’ve worked as a salesman for Toyota. Two main big jobs, never went through the fast food path. I’m really good with words down to being manipulative (though I *try* make a conscious effort to never be malicious.) I did fairly well in both jobs but ended up ditching them as I do with most things. I feel like I’m in a cycle of intastability. 

I thought I’d be someone to help people because I grew up so troubled with the injustices and unfairness and I obsessed over war and poverty. My mom and I often got into arguments about giving to the homeless where I’d end up in tears. 

Growing up is a frustrating experience because it’s so disillusioning as the hypocrisy of our existence becomes apparent and evil isn’t the devil, it’s those fuckholes who know enough about the human psyche to take advantage of the basic human insecurities we all experience. I do believe in. On the other side of the spectrum, I believe in our core kindness and compassion and it’s what will save us as a race. 

I just don’t know where to go or do. I don’t really have rules or anything telling me what to do or how to really use the skills I have. I’ve thought about saying fuck it and doing something out there like drag. Because life is a stage.

Sorry this turned into an existential rant. I don’t have anything higher like god or a Kardashian’s to look to in order to keep me going. I need to find my own purpose and happiness outside materialistic and wrapped desires and I just don’t know how.

I explained to those classmates how it's not mine and gave them enough believable reasons to convince atleast some of them and most of them believe me. From others I still expect an answer.

So bit of insight on my excuses: our google accounts are constantly logged in on the computers even during the whole year so basically anybody can post shit on it like a dickpic.

Anyways... I'm a guy who's been in love with his male friend for years now, he's straight.  
We met at school, when I was thirteen, I wasn't very sociable so I usually spent recess alone sitting on a bench while drawing. Sometimes somebody would approach me, but they never stayed for too long because I was very awkward. One day, though, this kid comes over, sits next to me, introduces himself and just starts talking with me. At first I wasn't very receptive, but soon we started having a nice talk. He would come see me every day, to make sure I was feeling alright and to talk for a while, it became a habit pretty quickly and after a few weeks we became friends. Since he was pretty much de only person I knew at school I would always follow him around, he didn't mind at all and actually seemed really happy that we were friends. We slowly became closer and closer, I considered him my best friend.

A few years later I realised I had a huge crush on him, I had completely fallen for the guy. I would think about him before going to sleep, after waking up, I couldn't help but smile every time I saw him, and every time he left I felt slightly sad. I felt like he was the greatest person in the world, the best thing that had ever happened to me. So of course, when he suggested that we share an appartment I eagerly agreed. We still live together, sometimes we even sleep on the same bed and many of our neighbours think that we are a couple. I wish....  
A huge problem with being in love with this man, though, is that he is really flirtatious and very sexually charged, towards women, of course. So he will very often bring girls over, which hurts like hell. I can't really help it, I just can't help but feel like shit whenever he talks to other women, or starts a relationship with them. Obviously I don't hate any of the girls, it's not their fault at all, I just hate myself for not being able to get over my friend and for being so scared of actually telling him what I feel.  
I don't expect him to go out with me, I understand that he doesn't like men, but I feel like I can't go on like this anymore.  
Should I tell him? I still don't want to lose his friendship...  
Should I move out? Maybe it'll hurt less  
I just need advice, I don't know what to do.",04Feb2019,1

So my gf and I were in tough situation financially, and needed to make quick money. There is a website we found where you send Fetish type videos to guys for money. We did it for a couple of weeks and made the money we needed. 

The other day my I got a friend request on Facebook by a new profile with the name Michael Masters, I immediately blocked it, then got a request from @michaelmasters19 on Twitter. The Twitter was also just made. 

He tweeted something @ me along the lines of “you’re going to make this difficult for me, now are you?” I’d already blocked the account from my twitter, so I used a different one to message him, below are the message.

After those messages he blocked the account. 

I tried unblocking him on fb and there were so many profiles with the same name, and no photos or information, so I couldn’t figure out which one to message.

I unblocked him on my Twitter after making it private. I tweeted @ him “I unblocked you on Facebook.” He then messaged me, below are two screenshots from the conversation.

470,"I don't know where to start. 

I (25F) have been best friends with my ""gay boyfriend""(26M) off and on for over a decade. To protect his identity I will be simply referring to him as GBF. Lately, I've felt so defeated over him ignoring my feelings and pleas for constructive conversation/reconciliation that I really don't know what else to do but ask for help on here. Unfortunately there are a few underlying factors to our issues that I can't exactly bring up to a mutual friend, so that leaves me here. 

Before I dive into what has been going on with him and what I should do about the situation, I want to be as transparent as possible about my own shortcomings. I am certainly no peach, and dealing with my depression and anxiety can be..a lot. I definitely am sensitive and prone to overthinking and jumping to conclusions. However, I pride myself on being hyper aware of my flaws and try to always apologize if I find myself acting out of pocket. GBF is the exact opposite. If he hurts me or anyone for that matter, he pretends it never happened. He refuses to say he is sorry for *anything*. You could be sobbing in front of him saying ""you broke my leg! you stepped on my leg!"" and he would look right at you, roll his eyes, and tell you your leg shouldn't have been where he was walking and to get the fuck over it. 

As I was saying earlier, we've been friends for over a decade with a couple breaks throughout. About 4 years ago we lived together and it was a blast. That being said, we partied way too hard, him especially. He was dancing on weekends (good for him, he made bank) but that led to some more bad decision making and drama inevitably ensued. One weekend I traveled 3 hours to see him dance, but when I arrived he didn't answer the phone, nor the door to his hotel room. He was passed out and forgot about me. I was locked out and it was freezing and it took me an additional 5 hours after arriving there to find a place to stay. When he woke up the next day, the apology was very casual. If I harped on the issue he downplayed it and made me feel like I was being melodramatic, considering I did find somewhere to sleep. I was hurt, but mistakes happen, and I chose to just get over it sans apology. Flash forward a month later, he is dancing at a new location (still a couple hours away), gets in a car accident and needs me to pick him up. While I am getting ready to pick him up, he begins to start ignoring my calls. I can't get in touch with him anymore. At this point I learned my lesson from last time and decide not to head out and get him. Wise choice, because he was so wasted he forgot he asked me for a ride and ended up hitching one with someone else. When he finally showed up at the house, I lied and told him that I left to get him and turned around when I realized he wasn't answering, and that he wasted my time again. I wasn't trying to lie to hurt him. I wanted him to understand that my time is valuable, and it is so hurtful for him to keep giving me the runaround like this. I thought maybe if I fibbed and said I was already driving to get him, with what happened weeks prior, he would be sympathetic and try to change his ways. This ended up backfiring immensely, as a mutual friend told him about my lie. GBF was so enraged about this lie, he packed his stuff and moved out the next day. I was beyond heart broken. Even though he moved out, I tried like hell to maintain a relationship. We hung out a couple times after he moved out but I felt the shift in his energy. One day he stopped answering. All of a sudden I was blocked and word through the grapevine is he *hates* me. I don't see him for 2 years. The first 6 months I cried myself to sleep every night. It felt like I got dumped but it cut so much deeper because it was a friendship and you don't foresee break ups occurring in friendships. I was blindsided and it took a really long time to get over. He didn't even blink twice over losing me.

2 years later he reaches out to me and wants to reconnect. I was extremely hesitant. When I did finally agree to meet up, I was looking forward to a deep conversation where we could discuss our ""break up"" and work through our previous issues but instead I was told ""it's in the past, we shouldn't go there, I was in a really bad place"". I wasn't planning on becoming close again and I was just happy to not have bad blood anymore, so I dealt with the lack of closure and just chose to move on from it. It was nice to be on good terms and I'd be lying if I said I hadn't missed him. 

Over time, we become best friends again. This is partly due to helping him get out of an abusive relationship and partly due to him getting sober. His sobriety changed him for the absolute best. He got *so* into fitness and was just mellowed out and more insightful than I ever remembered him being. Life seemed to humble him and everything was going so great until very recently. As I said earlier, I'm very anxious/paranoid and if I hear something that sets me off I am definitely not afraid to express my disdain. A few months ago, tension started occurring out of what I believed to be seemingly nowhere, but he expressed that he was annoyed at my over-reactive nature. I agreed that I was having frequent down days (depressive episode) and promised to chill out. All of a sudden, he is off the radar. We go from texting morning until night to not texting at all. He cancels on a cabaret show my mom bought us tickets for as a Christmas present that we had been talking about and looking forward to for months. He had a somewhat valid excuse as to why he couldn't go but my intuition still tells me he lied about it. Additionally, my Christmas present for him was to put down a deposit towards a sleeve he had been talking about getting forever. I had to find time to go into the parlor to set up appointments for him, as this artist is so busy she can't call or text. Now at this point, I haven't seen him in person for 2 months. This is insane considering we usually would see each other 5x a week, but he was acting like everything was fine, and since I know he hates when I'm ~dramatic~ I didn't want to keep pressing the issue. I get decal stickers from this tattoo artist to put in his Christmas card in which I wrote out what exactly his present was and on what days we had to go to the appointments. I kept telling him I'd really like to see him to give him his Christmas card, and he kept ignoring me. Finally I had no choice but to tell him via text what his present was because the appointment was coming up and I figured by the time I'd see him to give him his card with all the details mapped out, it would be way past the day of his consultation. When I told him what the present was he acted elated. He was really excited, knew what day we were going, and was sending pictures of ideas for his sleeve. The day of the consultation, it's late in the morning and I start feeling funny knowing he hasn't texted yet. We have a window of time in which we can go to the parlor, so I text and ask what time he'd like to be picked up. (it should be noted that he no longer has a license so I tend to drive everywhere) He then responds and says he ""doesn't know"" when he can go because his little sister wants to work out. I said alright, let me know when you have a ballpark time of availability so I know when to be ready for. He then says he doesn't want to go. He wants to be alone. I then have a full blown panic attack. I truly can't fathom how someone could be so rude and so inconsiderate to someone else's feelings. How you can't put aside two hours for your life to accept a gift, is beyond me. He didn't care about my time, feelings, or money. He didn't care about what went into orchestrating this, or how it was going to make me look not showing up. He didn't care. He doesn't care. I text him, and ask him what the fuck is going on. I explain all these things calmly and rationally while expressing how much he is actively hurting me. I apologize if there is something I did that I wasn't aware of while I urge him to reconsider and do the polite and morally correct thing and just *go*. He refuses. Not only does he refuse but he completely downplays my feelings on the matter. He gaslights me to the point of telling me that I'M the completely irrational one for being so hurt that he ""just wants to be alone"". He then punishes me for expressing my feelings by going ghost on me again. I am devastated. He doesn't say sorry until I say ""you're not even sorry for hurting me"". He simply says, ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" A month passes, and we slowly start texting again and forget that this happened. Obviously, I want to talk about it and get back on the same page, but he seems to be unable to express how he feels without getting mad and disappearing. We start getting back on track but things aren't the same considering I have to start censoring what I do and say to make sure I don't upset him. I obviously know by this point if I say or do anything that doesn't sit well with him I could be dropped as a friend in a millisecond. Typing this out is making me feel like shit, jesus, I don't want to live my life walking on eggshells. 

Last weekend we hung out for the first time in months. We went out of town and had an overall good time. However, it should be said that the sobriety I mentioned earlier is court mandated. He was able to drink on this weekend trip, and started acting really out of hand one morning. Without diving into details as this post is too long already, he was blacked out and we were kicked out of a bar. He was screaming at a mutual friend in the street and spit and hands were flying everywhere. It was just really mortifying for me. I kept trying to keep the peace and kept being ignored. He called me retarded and told me to go home. Obviously I know he is drunk and doesn't necessarily mean these things but given the tension that had been brewing between us, it made me feel beyond awful. A couple hours later when he woke up from his black out nap, I started tearing up and tried to explain that I had a really stressful few hours trying to manage the drunken fiasco, and that maybe he shouldn't drink at all. He rolled his eyes back so far out of his head I had never felt more embarrassed for trying to say how I felt ever in my life. I start crying harder and he doesn't give a fuck, yet again. He tells me ""we come here to get crazy and if you're not down to get crazy, go home"". He then falls back asleep. He wakes up a couple hours later, we go out, we don't talk about what just happened, and we have a decent night. We come back from our weekend trip and everything is fine, we're texting in our group chat with mutual friends all night. The next day he goes ghost on me again. I am worried thinking he got into some sort of legal trouble. I text him and say, ""it's ok if you don't wanna talk just send an emoji so I know you're alive"" and he ignores me. I start asking mutual friends if they've heard from him and whadddyakno, they had, he was just ignoring me on purpose. This leads me to last night when I sent him a text saying I know you are icing me out again on purpose, please tell me when I do something that doesn't sit well with you so we can avoid scenarios like that. No response. But then hours later he texts in our group chat and acts like nothing just happened. I am not sure how much more of this I can take. I'd much rather him tell me he doesn't fuck with me anymore and just try to move on. Instead, when I express what this feels like, he makes me seem crazy and that this is all in my head. Of course we're friends, of course he loves me, we text still. I really feel like it's a form of gaslighting and it's driving me insane. 

It should be known that over the last few months he has also developed an alter ego, if you will. He has an online persona by a different name in which he is often naked and has gained a decent following from posting his naked pictures. I'm beginning to think I may not be the problem and his ego is. He is talking to his cell phone 24/7 and seems to be completely out of touch with reality. If this is how he treats his friends bc he's gained a few thousand followers, lord knows what type of person he would become if became actually famous.

I want to conclude with the fact that even though I'm writing about a really sad situation which doesn't put him in the best light, he is really a great person. He is smart, funny, handsome and an amazing person deep down. He has been through a lot of hardships in past relationships and life recently dealt him a lot of shitty cards, but he has risen above all of it and become a better person from it. If I thought he was simply an egotistical piece of shit who didn't care about my feelings, which I gather it does seem like that, I would cut off the friendship. I have pride, and I don't want to be involved in a one sided relationship. I want so badly to believe that there's underlying issues here and it's not so black and white. He has reddit and I am praying he doesn't catch wind of this and bitch me out then promptly dead me. I just really have no one to turn to. 

**TLDR;** My (25F) best friend / ""gay boyfriend"" (26M) has been treating me like disposable garbage and I'm at a complete loss of what to do. We have so much history and it would break my heart to lose our friendship but he refuses to communicate about our issues.

475,"The title explains it all. Now for some prefacing: 

I've been with this company for a year. I started out in the retail stores before getting ""promoted"" to the main office of the factory that supplies the stores some of their shirts. I've got a data entry and receptionist position mixed in one (yay me). 

I've been here a little over two months now, and as we all know, it's tax season. It's an opportunity for my fiance and I to finally buy the necessities, like some nice furniture that we've had our eyes on for a while now. And to boot, my fiance plans on doing a proper proposal and dropping a ring on me when we get the extra funds. We've been extremely lucky to get our necessary paperwork right away and get our taxes done early. 

So I wanted to take at least an extra day, a Friday, to extend the weekend a bit and clean up the house and have enough time to assemble everything we'll need to, and get the house back into ""homey"" and nice and cleaned up. I also see this as an opportunity to go through some things and get rid of them/donate them, which takes time. 

I work 40h a week, which leaves me with very little in the week. My mental illnesses and physical conditions make doing more than the usual on the weekends challenging (I'm already medicated). 

So having that extra time would be nice. I even have the PTO, my personal vacation day I have to use before the year is up. Which is next month, on the 12th I believe. 

I asked today when they would prefer I would request this time, like a week in advance, etc. Except I was told to wait, because they couldn't give it to me due to one of my co-workers being on maternity leave. And guess what? She's on maternity leave until next month. 

They offered to give me a half day, which I already regretfully said I was okay with. But the more I think about it, the more irritated I get over being put on the back burner because somebody else had a baby. It's not my fault they pile so many responsibilities on me that I can't take a day off. And I don't want to have to wait until the last minute to take my one day off I'm allowed to get, without everyone else getting extremely catty about it. 

Is there anything I can do? Or do I really have to sit here and deal with this? I was already denied a day off because they handled dangerous weather wrong and made me come in anyway, in a car that couldn't handle the snow.

Saturday prior to the start of the show there was a dance party, a trial cast member (I’ll call him Jake) walked over to me, grabbed my wrists, tried to pull me to the stage while saying come dance with us. I told Jake that I would really rather not, as I wanted to take a few moments to reflect before the show started. He continued pulling saying “come on it will be fun.” I say no thank you, I’d rather not. He tells me to take a shot and walks away. (Mind you, were not permitted to drink when we have a show. 

Yesterday we have a scheduled meeting and it is brought up that Jake has been in the trial period for 4 months, and that we should vote to either make him a full cast member, partial member, or to let him go. 

A few members speak up of likes/dislikes about him. One person spoke up and said that Jake is too pushy. They stated that as a director, they do not feel comfortable having Jake rehearse in their home. I then told the story of Jake grabbing my wrists and pulling me.

The cast voted Jake in as a full cast member. I am very hurt because I feel like no one cares about what happened to me,  or about not feeling comfortable. This group always prides themselves in being exclusive, that everyone is safe and welcome, but when something like this happens the victim is silenced by others. 

I’m currently considering leaving the group. I am very hurt that others chose to vote Jake in, even though multiple people have expressed dissatisfaction with Jake, or being uncomfortable. I will be giving up something I truly love, but I won’t be touched again by him. ",04Feb2019,1

I had gotten the help I needed and I'm better even picked up a job that I enjoyed. Now that it's been a year my family is encouraging me to get back into college so I'm currently taking 4 classes right now. Since I've started the semester I've had three major mental breakdowns and I can feel the thoughts creeping back in and I feel like college is one the main factor. 

I want to become a translator in ASL and Spanish but honestly, I'm more than happy to just work at a reptile pet store or a pet store that at least contains reptiles. I just want a job where I'm not stressing about not making enough money. Also, I don't want to be drowning in debt either from student loans. I know I'm young and should be grateful I can even attend college. I'm sorry about that. I've been trying to do my research on whether I can live a nice life without worrying about a college degree. There's also the factor of my family and my s/o's family indirectly pressuring me about attending college so I don't look like some kind of failure or loser.

Should I push through this block and continue on with college? Or do I muster up the courage to tell my family how it's affecting me? I'm genuinely at a loss and I desperately need some advice.

—

My cousin is a sophomore in high school and we go to different schools. Lately she would usually text or call me after school telling me that her teacher keeps calling her out on personal business. 

Such as, telling the whole class that she basically has 3 F’s and how she needs to do her work. Even this one time he brought up something about her life and how she should really fix herself. 

It’s like he has such a passion on bashing at her. This happens at least everyday and she really does try to do better in school, trust me. 

So obviously that’s humiliating and now people in her class always talk about her. 

She already has really bad anxiety and has a stressful life. The fact that he calls her out is so ridiculous and it is not his place or business to say such things. 

This person might seem just every other teacher, but he’s already a big problem to top off of her stress in school.

Her and her mom are planning on going to the school and telling them that. But most likely they could care less and won’t do much. Except for maybe switching her out of his class.

Is there any ideas on what she could do besides just “try to ignore it” and continue on with her day? Something she could say to prove that he’s just a bad teacher?
Like I want to email her teacher so badly and call him out. Then again, what would my words do?

487,"I am not as involved in the in-person volunteer stuff in my daughter’s 2nd grade classroom as I would like — my husband and I both work relatively flexible 9 to 5s — we attend the conferences, concerts, etc., and send in money, supplies, treats, and the like when needed, but neither of us is in a position to handle full time “room parent” duties, which is why I feel perhaps it’s not my place to say anything, but —

Recently, the current room parent, a mom, in planning the Valentine’s Day class party, has stripped out all the dads from the classroom email list and begun sending emails to only the women, even starting them with things like, “Hey Mamas!” (This phrasing is why I thought to check the distro list.)

She’s sent about 5 at this point, only to the women, and when I’ve responded, claiming various items we’ll bring and CC’d (or just straight added) my husband, she still replies only to me. 

My husband and I share responsibility on things like this, so obviously I would like him to get the info, and there are potentially other kids in a single dad or two dad situation who are missing out by virtue of not being in this “women only” email list (or even just dads, like my husband, who have a wife, but, y’know, love their kids and want to stay involved), but I’m not sure how to address this with the room mom without seeming like I’m telling her how to do her job (a job I cannot take over), and could use some advice on how — or if — to address this!

488,"I have been with my girlfriend for 6 years and we have a good relationship.  I love her very much and would never cheat on her or do anything to compromise our relationship.   I also have a co worker who I have had a crush on for about a year, and recently we’ve been becoming much better friends.  We talk a lot, take lunches together a few times a week etc.   We have a ton in common and I sincerely just enjoy talking with her because we get along so well.   She is also in a committed relationship which I feel is partially why I’ve let myself become friends with her which I think I wouldn’t have if she was single.

489,"To preface: obviously they’re the bosses and they can do whatever they want to my schedule, but that shouldn’t overrule the assurances they gave me when I began working there IMO.


Alright, so I’ve had this job for nearly a month. Great job, love the work, good at the work. It’s a restaurant job and I’ve worked as a waiter and runner so far there and the people have been great, even the boss which not everyone can say for their jobs. The place just recently opened and I can on a week or two after they did, and a few people have been hired since then. 

I’ve had no complaints, but the last few days have raised some concerns, and today I am going to address the boss about them. So what what happened is that the last few weeks I’ve been working good hours, more than 35 a week, less than 40. We share tips and the tips are still great, and they pay double what they have to pay wait staff here in the US. It’s great money at a great job. Last week, they said I should clock out early a few nights because it’s slow, which was fine, but I come in on Friday and they told me the schedule had changed and I was off completely, along with Sunday. Okay, so I thought it was just because they were training a new waitress and didn’t need me, and that we wouldn’t get much business on Super Bowl Sunday anyhow, being an ethnic restaurant. Then I come in today at my usual time and they tell me I’m not on until 5:00. This was a red flag, because they said they’d work with us on schedules, but they dropped this one on me without any discussion before hand. So I figure I’m there so I might as well pick up the new schedule–they print them out– and find that I’m working 12.5 this week. Down from 39 last week.

However, it won’t even be that, because I told the boss two weeks ago and reminded her last week that it was my birthday this Wednesday and that while I didn’t want the whole day off if I could just have the morning shift that would be great, and she said that was okay. I’ll add that she gave another newer employee an entire day for her birthday two weeks ago, so my request wasn’t outrageous. But on my schedule, she has me working the night shift *only*. I would understand giving me the entire day even if I didn’t request it, but giving me the evening only after telling me it was okay if I only worked the morning on that day, feels a little rude if not blatantly insulting. So I asked about it nicely and she just said “that’s the schedule now” as if that settled it and said I could just not come in for it. So now I’m working about 9 hours if not less this week.

I guess I’m wondering what this change in attitude to me could be caused by? What should I do? It’s my only job right now and I don’t have school, so I can work any hours at all, but they still give their student workers (high school) and workers newer than me with this as their second job more hours than me. I’ve been told my performance is great and I’ve been doing a great job, and I have regular customers that ask for me. What could the issue be? Please help.",04Feb2019,1
490,"I used to never stutter in high school or tumble over my words unless I was talking to a authoritative figure, but now that I'm in my second year of university, I stutter very frequently in front of new people.

495,"Over the past semester, I’ve had a difficult time with my IB Theory of Knowledge teacher. There’s been several occasions where she’s marked me absent in class, and docked me for points of participation (a big part of this class’s grade), amongst a lot of other things that I will explain in a moment. This started in October-ish. 

In early October, she started grading us on participation. I noticed many times I’d had my hand up to participate to get credit for the day, but would find myself ignored for the period. Sometimes I’d have to verbally say that I’d had something (could be 20-30 minutes of waiting, other times I’d give in). It was very stressful, because I’m not someone to call a teacher over as if I run things, but my grade depended on it and after the fourth class period of getting points deducted, I caved in and found myself doing it. I never did it in a rude way, however, it was always like a “I’ve got something to add to the discussion if that’s alright”.  A week later she had told us about how she’s wanted to give kids she doesn’t like a 0 on an assignment when they’re gone. This was a weird thing to tell us. 

Later in October, we started an optional project to which we had to write a parody in the theme of IB. She asked if anyone did not want to be a part of it, to which I raised my hand. She told me I could have an alternative assignment, to which I agreed. We worked on the project for two class periods, and then didn’t work on it again (this will come up later.)

In early November, my grandfather committed suicide. The class period before I left we started watching The Village and were given an assignment. I started it, but left the next class period to attend his funeral out of state. When I got back, I asked if I needed to see the rest of the movie to finish the worksheet (it was questions like, “what was an enemy of foreshadowing?”), to which she said yes. I didn’t have a Netflix account (where she said to watch it), and I had to wait until payday to get an account to finish the movie. I really didn’t need to watch it to finish the worksheet, but I did what was asked. I turned it in the following week of my return, to which she used as an example to tear into me in front of the class. She said something along the lines of,

“Why is this so late? You could’ve done this IN CLASS. This is an IB class and you’re being lazy.”

Given the circumstances for the reason of my absence, I could hardly stomach it, but I just let it go. 

In December, she ripped into me about being late to class. Before the bell ring, I said I was going to the restroom to which she said, “okay, just take the pass.” I came back within two minutes of the bell, and she had said,
 
“Be on time. You shouldn’t be late.” 

I responded with,

“You said I could go.”

She didn’t respond. 

In late December before Christmas break, she marked me absent in class. I approached her afterwards and she corrected it, but I didn’t think too much of it. 

In early January, we pick back up the project that we started. It was for the full diploma IB students that had the induction ceremony, to which I was not invited because I am not full IB. I’m working on an assignment because of the agreement that I’d have an alternative assignment. She came up to me, and was four inches from my face. 

Her: “Why aren’t you singing?” 

Me: “you said I could have an alternative assignment.”

Her: “no I didn’t.”

Me: “yes, you did.”

Her: “well I must have been in a good mood that day then.”

She walked away and didn’t say anything else, but I had gotten 30% of my participation grade ripped away. I wasn’t an IB student so I couldn’t even attend. Later that week, she took off a third of my grade on a very big assignment and dropped my grade to hardly a C for it being late, even though it was turned in on time. I didn’t have time to address it before grades were finalized. 

Last week she gave me a 0/60 on a presentation I did in class. I started crying— that was such a big assignment that I was given a 0 for. I told my mom, and she wanted to call the school. I’d had myself convinced this was all a coincidence.  

When I went in to have her correct it, she was on her phone with her daughter. She started on the phone for 10 minutes, but had told me I could come into her classroom. I waited patiently. When she decided to get off the phone, she tried to tell me I didn’t do my presentation, and when I was very insistent, she said she accidentally gave someone else my grade. I left the room and said thanks. 

The next day I had her class again. She marked me absent, and I overheard the person who never did their presentation say that they got a 100 on it and didn’t have to do it. 

I told my mom, and she called the school, and listed off all of her issues. I checked my email today and saw this:

—————————

Hi [smashpokie],

I've noted some tension recently and talked with Mr. [Counselor] about some concerns today.  Since I will be gone on Monday, I thought I'd send you an email to assure you that I have no axe to grind.

Please don't misconstrue a couple of bookkeeping errors for any problem with repor.  We are good. :-)  I explained the presentation issue yesterday, aologized, and  remedied it immediately, but you still left abruptly as though I'd intentionally made a mistake.  As for attendance today, I write it down each day and just inadvertently used an incorrect line when I entered it.  I've fixed it.  Sorry for causing any alarm.

I do enjoy having you in class. You are a little shy, and I would love to hear more from you at times.  But I know that for some kids this is tougher than others.

Have a great day!

I don’t know if it’s just me, but I feel as if this is very passive aggressive. My mom said to email something back regarding all of the other things she’s pulled this year since the school district monitors the emails. I just need help, I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if I’ll be able to to deal with this any longer. I don’t want to drop the class because it’s weighted and I need it, but I’m just not sure anymore. Please, please, please help. I feel like I’m maybe overthinking and she doesn’t have any ill intent but I just don’t know and I’m questioning my own every move. 


TL,DR; teacher in a crucial class that I don’t want to drop is “accidentally” causing several issues and tanking my grade severely. She sends a passive aggressive email.  Need help.

To keep things (hopefully) shorter I will give a brief time line. I am happy to answer any questions if needed. My three ex best friends will be B, K, and L.



K says she is going to kill herself that night. She has attempted before, so this really worried us. She disappears for 4 hours. B, L, and I are freaking out, I call the police in her area (we are all online friends) and tell them exactly what is going on. 5 grueling days of not knowing if she is alive or dead pass, a lot of late nights and tears are had, and she comes back from suicide watch. A few days later she expresses her anger that I called the police, calling me a ""busy bodied cunt"" who is ""too emotionally fragile to handle [her] over the top drugging."" Obviously upsets me very much, but I hang back from it and we make up. She starts doing things that she knows no one is OK with, but since it's her decision to do these things, I just distance myself from her and let her know that I am not interested in being around it. During this time, B and L had given me money for commissions to help me out as I have been struggling with money. When I leave I let L know I don't want to be a part of the commission, so I will give her money back AND draw the commission for her excluding myself from the group. L tells me that she is fine with NO commission and that she just wanted to help me out so she did NOT want me to pay her back. After much protest from me, we finally agree with that, but I tell her if at any point she wants me to draw something for her, or wants her money back, I am more than happy to do either. I finish B's commission, but wanted to wait for him to return from a trip before I send it to him. B and L start to act very shady, the way they talked became very much like the way K talks. I figured I was being paranoid because I know K like the back of my hand and I know she is very good at manipulating people to get her way. But, to be safe, I distanced myself from them. We are all in mutual Discord servers, so even though they are not on my friends list, they are very much able to contact me, as well as via Twitter. 



B gets back, and asks for the commission. I ask him for an email and I'd send it to him when I was next able. He provides. I send him the email 3 times without him receiving it before I finally just send him the commission via Discord. He does not respond.



This all happened over the course of 4 or 5 months, the last point of contact being with B about 2 weeks ago. Come to yesterday. K goes in to another person's server to start talking about me indirectly. I ask the owner for permission to respond (I didn't want stuff to start without knowing I was OK to respond) and I get the go ahead. I basically tell K that it's incredibly immature of her to talk about me in a public setting rather than coming to me directly. She tries to play the ""you blocked me!"" Card, I provide screenshots to prove this is untrue. Then K hits me with the, ""you have scammed my best friend. And I want people to know."" So I explain again if she had any concerns she should talk to me PRIVATELY instead of starting drama (which she L O V E S) in some one's server like a middle schooler. I then provide proof that B got his commission and that L told me no Com+no pay back. She still fights it saying I'm a scammer and that they have told people about my shady practices (which I noticed - I went from 40 followers on Twitter to 23). My wonderful friends came to back me up including the owner, which meant so much to me, saying that the commissions have literally nothing to do with her and it's none of her business. I also found out that she basically has rallied a TON of people in this small community we are a part of against me. No one has once come to me to ask if any of these lies (scamming, using people, etc.) are true. They just jump straight to, ""wow, Bardic is a bitch!""



The reason this stresses me out, is because the community we are in is quite tightly knit. My friends are fairly influential, but it's been too late for weeks-months without me knowing. This is my business. My passion is art. And people in a community I LOVE are being told I am a scammer and to avoid me. It's so disheartening to know that 3 people who used to be my best friends are ruining my business because... I don't talk to them anymore? And I don't know how to move past this. I have severe general and social anxiety, as well as severe depression, and something like this is a MASSIVE hit.

I'm on disability income ($1500 a month) as I'm unable to work. I tried some online work but I'm not based in the US, so most of it is not available and you work for minimum wage anyways. I quit most hobbies such as graphic design, drawing, pixel art, programming except surf the web &amp; video games all day.

515,"So the other day my wife and I went out with 2 other couples to celebrate a birthday. We are on a fairly tight budget by choice as one of our goals is to spend less. On the way there we discussed what we were planning on ordering so that we’d stay in budget. We stuck to our plan just fine but at the end another couple (not birthday guy) picked up the tab for the whole table by secretly telling the waitress so no one else had a chance to pay. For some reason this made me feel uncomfortable.  I want to stick to my own budget but I don’t want to feel like someone else is subsidizing me. Should I learn to be ok with things like someone buying my dinner? Should I offer to buy everyone’s dinner once in a while even if it includes expensive items or cocktails that we wouldn’t order? 

I don’t like to try and pry into the personal finances of others so I can only assume that they can afford to spend what they do spend, but I know my own finances very well and objectively we have a very good saving rate so by many metrics we could afford to spend more. 

I guess in the end I want to both reach my savings goals and also not be a cheap bastard who takes advantage ",04Feb2019,1

517,"Thank you for taking your time to read this post. I will start with the people involved:


Person |    Age |     Description
------|------|---------------
Me | 21 | University student, met Kelly at a club in University. Virgin, had a few dates but no relationships. 
Kelly | 24  | Graduated University last year, works full time. Has had 4 relationships in the past and currently has a month-long FWB. We are friends for 4 months now, we've been hanging out literally every single week since we met for 3 to 6 times a week. No sex, no kissing (until yesterday, deets below), just hugs sometimes. I caught the feelings for her 3 weeks ago.


#Preamble

I did not think I would ever be into Kelly. She is someone that has an FWB right now and I found it weird as hell that a relatively conservative guy (in terms of dating) like me would be into this girl. I can not tell if this is desperation/taking whatever I can. I am confused myself, my self confidence is pretty high and I do not feel depressed/bad at all. I still like her dearly--I am just confused a bit, that's all. Keep in mind also that before I was into her, I'd tease her about her FWB and how she'd get into a relationship with him (she said NEVER! but eventually caved in to the possibility that it might happen).


#What happened, pt. 1:

Kelly was supposed to get minor surgery done day before yesterday. She asked me the week before to give her company after the surgery and I showed up yesterday. I hid a teddy bear that I bought for her in my bag, and asked her to open it when I got to her place. She loved it, shortly after we went to lunch and then a walk in the park. 

#What happened, pt.2:

On the way back from the park to the car, I asked her to sit in the backseat. She was confused, but then went in. In there, I asked her if she enjoys my company (yes), I enjoy hers, and I was wondering if she wants to be more than friends. She gleamed up happily with ""REALLY?"" and eventually I kissed her on the cheek and had a conversation. She said that she has a lot of bit of feelings for her FWB (I was right unfortunately) and she has been meaning to talk to him about it for a bit. I said okay that's fine and just left it at that. We then cuddled, I kissed her on the cheek a couple of times and eventually started driving while holding her hand the whole time. She said whatever we have right now, we can let it grow to whatever it is, but before she works out the  whole FWB and relationship, she can't say anything.

#What happened, pt. 3:

The synopsis of the whole thing was this: We both agreed we want each other in life. She actually said I am important to her and I was pleasantly surprised. We agreed that if this whole thing does not work out, we remain friends. 


#What is bothering me:

1. I don't like the fact that she is going to a trip in a few weeks with her friends including the FWB (I was invited but I have exams).

2. She didn't give me a yes, but let me touch her/kiss her and hugged me at the end while I kissed her. Wat.

3. I missed her before, I miss her 10X now. Today was very unproductive because I ruminated about her everywhere.

#Conclusion:

I am really confused on what I should do and I need all the advice I can on this situation. I have never had a serious relationship which is pretty embarrassing enough at 21 (All my friends have had multiple) and this situation is a lot to deal with.


TL;DR 21M likes 24F friend, he confessed to her and kissed her. She says she is not going to say yes right away because she has feelings for her FWB too and needs to work on that before she gets back to me. She also says we can let what we have now ""grow"" and she will get back to me later.

520,"I’m 30 years old, with a PhD in engineering. I graduated a little over a year ago, and moved across the US to take what I thought was my dream job: Very high salary in the private sector in an inexpensive city in a cutting-edge field I’ve been wanting to work in for years.

1 year later, I’m finding myself miserable. I hate the city I live in; it’s high-crime, boring, and far away from the people and places I love. I’m constantly homesick, both for my hometown and the cities I went to school in. I’m always stressed out/overloaded at work, and I’m finding out that it’s just going to get worse this year now that the training wheels are off. The work is still interesting, but it’s not nearly as exciting to me as when I started. I’m finding myself less- and less-passionate every day. I was burned out at the end of all of my school and this just feels like an extension of that.

All that said, I feel trapped. I really have no idea what I want to do, or what’s even possible. My academic training and research was very specific, and I feel like if I apply for a “normal” job, they’ll just tell me I’m overqualified. Ideally, I’d like to leverage my degree and talents but change fields and possibly use it to break into something more creative, but I have no idea what that would look like. None of my classmates have done anything like this. In the interim, I don’t want to quit, as the money and benefits are hard to give up. If I do move and take a lower-paying job, I want to have decent savings, especially since I missed out on having a real career in my 20’s. I should mention that I’m single, so I don’t have to worry about uprooting a family.

I’m really sorry if this post comes across as whiney. I recognize my immense privilege and that I’m basically asking for advice on how to give up on the amazing opportunities I’ve had, opportunities that many people dream of. I just don’t know how long I can go on in my current position. I don't just want to vent, but I want to figure out what concrete steps I can take to change my life.",04Feb2019,1
521,"So I kind of have a bit of a social issue with friends. A lot of the time when I meet someone I'm super outgoing, introduce myself and engage in conversation. I find it really easy to being friendly with people I meet but a lot harder to actually become their friends. Often I will meet someone, get on (what I would consider) really well with them but then we never really talk or they dont seem keen on hanging out again, let alone adding me on socials. For a really long time I just thought this meant they didn't like me but recently as I've been going out more I've bumped into people I've met in the past. Including people who I used to party with quite a lot (but only through mutual friends). 

And almost everyone who I thought disliked me as told me how much they miss me, and famously that they always considered me ""cool"". Like ""I know we don't talk much but you're a really cool person"" or ""you're honestly one of the chillest people I know""

525,"Hey, so before I start I just wanna say I’m relatively new to reddit, so please forgive me if I mis-format anything. 
Also, sorry to the mods in case I’m breaking any rules.

So I’m gay. Always have been ever since I was a child, although I haven’t come out to anyone (I live in Kansas so it’s pretty looked down upon) except my Xbox friends who don’t know anyone in my life but me.

So I met someone on line a while back, I won’t say her name here so I’ll just call her “GF”, and we became super close friends. She would constantly come vent to me if she needed to, and I was cool with it. We’d watch anime over FaceTime and stuff, I even got her into $uicide boy$. So we’ve had a lot of time as friends and then her really shitty boyfriend ended up cheating on her, they broke up, and I was there for her, it was a really bad breakup to be honest. 

So, one day, I wanna say maybe 3-4 days tops after the breakup she asks me if I wanna date her. My dumbass said yes, as I didn’t want her to feel like nobody wanted her and stuff (that’s one of the things she said during the breakup, long story). When I got home that night I thought about what the hell I had just gotten myself into, and I came to the conclusion that it would be just a casual relationship, probably wouldn’t last more than a month. It was (and still is) just over the internet. Then about 4 days later, she cried on the phone saying how she was in love with me, and didn’t want me to ever leave. So, now we’re here, a couple months in and she still loves me, and I feel like shit. 

Now, I know this all sounds like a a huge dick move, and that’s because it is, but I don’t want to be with her. It’s seriously tearing me up inside, and I just can’t process the first step on how to deal with it. She is such a sweet person, and I don’t want to hurt her. I just want things to go back to when we were friends. 

TL;DR: I’m gay and said yes when a girl asked me out because I felt bad and now want to break up with her, but don’t know how.

Again, sorry mods if this breaks any rules. I checked and I don’t think it does, but I understand if you take it down otherwise.

Please don’t beat me up for this. I already do that enough to myself, trust me.",04Feb2019,1
526,"I'm 23 and my dad has been with her since I was 3, she's never made an effort to be close with me and honestly treats me like I'm repulsive.

Throughout the years I've tried to find some common ground with her but she never reciprocates the effort so I ultimately give up.
When I was younger she used to play tricks on me and put me down but my dad would always take her side when she denied it.

I've tried to tell my dad how she is but he never does anything about it / I almost think he doesn't believe me. He's wrapped around her finger so much that it's pretty much ruined our relationship.

At this point I don't have a clue what I can do but living like this is ridiculous.
She acts as if I'm not here, doing things like walking past me with her head down so as to not make any contact at all and doesn't even say hello when I come home.

So I'm 15 years old, currently in love, single and have a facked up life. 

1,5 years ago I played soccer in my country's highest league, after 8 months of extreme grind with 15 hours techincal/physical training. Per week. I travelled 4,5 hours to play 1,5 in a pretty good club, and I ended up making to the first team. 4 days later I got injured, today I'm still injured. The injury is not normal, but some growth-problem shit, so I can not work it away. 

Next year I'll be going on what in USA is high school (I think), And I imagine having some money in the pocket wouldn't be any problem. Now for my dilemma:

The doctor said, that the injury might be over next week, and it might be over in 3 years. I got it early, and have already had it for 1 year now, so there's a good chance it's gone within the next year, but that's what I've thought for the last year.

Bonus fuck-up: I live on a small island, with a population of 7000 people (mostly old people)

that means I don't really have a lot of opportunities. The ferry takes 1.5 hours and cost a lot, so there is no opportunity there (though I used to play soccer on the ""other side"")

Also I don't want to have a job if I actually get together with my Crush.

531,"I can’t go into every detail, but here it goes… 
I was in an abusive relationship from age of 15 - 20. I'm 28 now and I still have emotional reactions from triggers, including my own thoughts. No one knows the extent of this, but two people do know about the ""highlights"" from the relationship. I have support from my mom, a trusting relationship with my fiancé, but very few *real/close* friends - an issue since 16.

Some back story - I will not be able to cover everything, so ask questions if needed.
Age 15 I started dating my first boyfriend (15m) and oddly we had our first kiss in kindergarten (his idea) which led to later justification that he was ""the one,"" but I'll get to that. I knew him on and off through school, but freshman year of high school he tried to get to know me in gym during swim. I thought he was weird even though he was sort of popular. Eventually I grew to like him (and the attention because I was 15 and holy shit I had a boyfriend sort of thing). 

He asked me to be official end emphasized exclusive. He acted obsessed with hanging out and what I didn't realize was that he was mirroring me when we were together - actions, beliefs etc. to get me to like ""him."" He would also ask me the weirdest shit to gauge my reactions (aka what he could get away with) We became closer, or so I thought, and he pressured me into sex at almost 16 years old because we dated two months and ""every other couple........"" I complied and regret it to this day. He was my first and it felt important to stay with him because of that and everything else going on.
He started talking very badly about my mom who I was close to, to the point where I stopped speaking to her. My best friend too. And all my other friends. 
It came to just him.
He started acting like I was stupid, would put me down, bragged that he had 22 girlfriends and if anyone of them talked to me to ignore them - they were ""liars."" Even one that claimed to be in a secret relationship with him at some point....
He told me about his first serious girlfriend and how she cheated on him and if she told me anything to ignore her. The other serious one too was a ""psycho bitch"" and I should avoid her - this was all age 15 and under.  I later figured out he likely did to them what he claimed they did to him.
I had no friends, was an alien to my family and he reminded me of this one year into dating. He said we should take a break. I couldn't understand how someone who said they'd love me always and forever could say this, who ""gave up his virginity to me"" (lie). He proposed we have a secret relationship ""for my benefit"" because I had no friends and it would help.
I accepted since it was the only way (I was 16 and insanely naive so don't judge me too hard) he would be with me. He threatened that if I told anyone, even our pastor, that he would never speak to me again. He only wanted me for the little money I made, sex, my car to drive out fishing or to his music lessons, and conversation when we did have it...
He told me that he was going to pretend to be in relationship with his ex, the psycho bitch, and they started hanging out. I correctly guessed they were actually dating but didn't know what to do. I was in such denial at this point and we were “together” in a lovely secret relationship 3 years. She stopped talking to him convinced we were FWB. Again, before you judge me too much he took up a large percentage of my life and **actively worked to alter my reality**, often saying ""thanks for the trust, I haven't given you any reason not to trust me..."" **HAH :/**
He kept me around while looking at his options, I know that, and I knew it, but I genuinely believed that we would get married and everything would be better - and I couldn't (even though I found proof) get my head round what he was *really* doing to me. I had no control and I didn't have anyone to talk to. He made me emotionally dependent and intentionally fucked around with my head to the point of abuse. I have no case damages because he never tied me down, or ruthlessly raped me (**rape by fraud, DID occur**), and I have no proof, except my documents that counselors have could be helpful. He went through my phone, iPod, everything. 

He eventually met some girl who was 17 and he chased her, and his excuse was her cat that he adopted (his mom was mentally ill/didn't discipline his ass) and paid for it all). He made up so much garbage about how if he dated her it would be better for me - I was too dependent and tell me how we'd probably get back together anyways.....

This is where I lost it - finally. I came to my senses - no more.

The last day we were together he asked if we could have one last time together while being ""official"" with his girlfriend. We went to a concert and before that he was laying in his new bed (that I essentially paid for by dropping his debt to me. I came over and he dry humped me then said we shouldn't have done that, and he was tired, like he was drunk.

He claimed he told his girlfriend and said we shouldn't see each other anymore. What he told her was NOT THAT but acted like I touched him inappropriately. I read his journal and it said, ""after years of denying her, why would I be interested now?"" Oh, that killed me. His ""journal"" was his ""creative writing,"" but it was obvious what the intents were. He probably had her read it.

Anyway, I grabbed my stuff (not all the gifts/stuff he needed that I got him, unfortunately) told his mom what he did who told his half-sister and they didn't believe me. I told them that, honestly it was for the better because he was a sociopath and I needed out.

Fast forward to today...

On the one hand, for my own sake, I forgave him, and it has helped lessen the real estate he has in my head. He had a shitty father who allegedly abused him and an unstable mother who did act nuts sometimes. He has no chance for a REAL relationship, no REAL bonds, because he reinvents himself - he is no one - a phony religious to not to religious again to not based on who he was after, insanely racist to not, into metal then hating it because of his new girlfriend aka the less intelligent version oh him (yes he said that). Not the best way, but I forgave him because he is below human and its hopeless for him.

I have been very good at setting boundaries with new people since him, I have become strong and know who I am and what I will stand for. 

I don't want to be silent anymore. He threatened me and said he would make me look crazy if I spoke up, which he did, but I was afraid of how malicious he was. I’d watch him lie to people so convincingly over the years I knew him.

The advice I'm looking for is:
How can I be open about this with more people, but emotionally detached? I feel huge blame in myself for what happened, but at that point he took up 25% of my life, so I cut myself more slack. 
I work in a field where it would be beneficial to be open about struggles to share empathy.

*I don't want to hide it anymore.*

And here's the reason:
I don’t have any close friends. Only the amazing people I've met through my SO who I see out sometimes. I was at a bachelorette party and I said how it was my first one. It got a reaction and I had a hard time explaining how my life is like this. 
I want to be able to show the ways I understand people, based on my experiences.

534,"I have a friend who has a speech impediment that's pretty much exactly like this https://www.stutteringhelp.org/cluttering:

They don't seem aware they have a problem. I've told them several times I'm having trouble understanding them but they just slow down and focus on pronouncing the words for that one sentence then go back to talking rapidly and slurring/mispronouncing everything for the rest of the conversation.

I don't want to make them feel self conscious by asking them to slow down for every single sentence. They really need to see a speech therapist but I don't want to make them feel embarrassed by suggesting it. What should I do?

537,"First off, don't panic or assume I'm trying to get attention. I am trying to get guidance and also get some stuff off my chest.

I grew up in a home with a verbally abusive mother. She loved me a lot, so did my father. They both said a lot of mean stuff to me like that I was lazy, why would I always act like a girl, that I was so selfish, etc. My mom would say stuff like ""get your fat fucking fingers off this!"" My weight was and still is the topic of conversation with my parents.

I don't know why, but I have a phobia called phallophobia. I am afraid of my own penis. I have never masturbated by touching myself. I can count on one hand the amount of times I've looked at my own genitals. Aside from making out with one guy I met off a dating app 3 years ago and a kiss in 8th grade from a girl, I have never been touched or loved. I avoid sexual situations even though I want physical and emotional intimacy. I crave it.

I got bullied and made fun of my whole life. People always called me fat and a ""fag"" etc. I look around at students who are upset they are offended, and I cringe. I wonder what they would've done if they actually had gone through shit. I was told I couldn't shop in a store because I was too fat....twice. Armani Exchange. Straight people have treated me like shit because I seemed gay enough and an easy target. Girls in high school, etc, would tell me to go kill myself and how they would laugh if I did because I was a fat gay freak.

I've been in therapy since I was 18. I've gone to psychotherapy, cbt, paid $500 a week, etc. Nothing seems to help. I keep throwing money at the solution, but nothing seems to fix it. I am too scared to force myself to do exposure therapy, plus isn't it too late for me? I'm basically 12. Barely been kissed, never had sex, never even cuddled before. Being a human being without feeling physical contact of any kind other than friend hugs and parent hugs (which are great, don't get me wrong) is like torture. No one has ever loved me or wanted me. I'm not even horrible looking but guys on dating apps don't even respond. Plus, who would want me once whey know they have to put up with a fat, broke, 40 year old virgin who can't touch his own penis?

When I was 19, I catfished a guy on AOL. I fell in love with him. He found out about the real me and he wanted to stay but because I felt what being wanted was like over the phone, I would get mad and threaten him for leaving me. I would tell him I would out him, but I would never have, and I never did. He rightfully never spoke to me again. 20 years later, that was the only amount of love and attention I have ever felt.

I wake up in the morning, and the loss of hope pushes down on my chest so hard. I go to sleep at night and all I can think about is what kind of life is waiting for me? Past my prime. A life full of being overweight. Never finished college, never could hold a job because I was always afraid people would discover my secret. Why I don't date is not only because I was hiding my sexuality but because I am so afraid of my own body, so disgusted by it, that I can't even touch my own genitals. However, all I want is to be cuddled by a big strong guy? It's too much to bare.

My parents are almost 80 and are fading. They are the only ones who love me despite their problems. They pay for me financially for everything which I also lie to people about. No attempts at my keeping a job have stuck. Anxiety always gets in the way, and I find that I can't move.

I am on medicine, zoloft, wellbutrin, klonopin for anxiety attacks, but things just keep getting worse and worse. A life lived alone as a ward of the state because I can't even take care of myself sounds miserable. Who is going to love me or know me or even check on me after my parents pass? I am alone, and I don't have the resources, skills, or life lessons to take care of myself. I was never wanted. I was always treated like I was a burden. There are no happy endings. People always told me things would get better. They never do. No psychiatrist wants to help no matter how much of my parents money I give them. They really don't seem like they know how to help if I am being honest. A life without hope is not worth living. Wouldn't I just be happier not conscious? Wouldn't the world be better off without me? How can I go through the rest of my life without love, without touch, without self esteem? I can't even take care of myself. I am such a loser. All the self help books, new neuroscience research into anxiety/depression, psychiatry does not seem to help. Every day is such a struggle. I have no will to live or exist anymore. Yet I am such a spoiled brat. I am so lucky to be sitting here in America in my comfy chair complaining about now being loved when people don't have food, shelter, safety? How can my life really be that bad? It makes me feel terrible that I am lucky but still feel all these ways.

I've spent half my life trying to get better, I only get worse. What is the point of carrying on with this struggle? Literally no one cares. I have no one to tell besides a subreddit of people who won't remember they read this a few hours after they do. This existence for me is torture. All I wanted was to get married and have kids, instead I am fucking gay, fat, and unloveable, and I can't even freaking touch my own penis. Whoever says being gay is a choice should read this, it's not a choice. It's a death sentence for some of us.",04Feb2019,1

14 years old who lives in Quebec, homeschooled my dad works for a large retail store from 3:30 pm to 1:00 at night, I'm busy with home schooling 8:30 - 11:00 in the morning then I take a break to spend time with my dad before work then after he leaves I work on my homeschooling from 3:30- 6:00, my mom is almost always home, I go to public school once a week for a teck class from 9:00 - 10:00, I go to army cadets but I'm not good enough friends with anyone to go to there house, all of my other friends outside of army cadets are 15+ minutes away. learned of reddit from a friend in army cadets. don't worry  I also made sure I would see porn or anything when I made this acount. also my mom isn't the brightest.

Story

tried to go on a diet when I was 12, I weighed 140 pounds then, my diet was not eating breakfast that's it, when my parents learned they told me to stop and gave me a lecture on how im to young to lose weight and I need the fat, it was stupid and I know they were being stupid but I was a mommy's boy so I stopped dieting. fast forward 2 years and I'm trying to diet again, I started 2 months ago, my diet is not eating breakfast unless I'm doing something active and eating a small lunch, I still eat the same amount for super, since I started I have lost 10 pounds, i havent told my parents in dieting since i dont want a repeat of last time, earlier today I tried to bring up to my mom that I thought I was fat in a hope I could get her support, as soon  as i said I thought I  was on the heavy side she ran to my dad told him I thought I was fat ran back told me I wasn't, and we all have our own build, which again is stupid, then told me we were going to make cookies. I helped her with it and ""accidentally"" eat some raw egg while helping her, when we where done she offered me 10 of them I then said I didn't feel so good so I wouldn't have to eat them, right now I'm sitting in the bathroom writing this and pretending to be sick from the raw egg.  what I need help with is how to either get there support or make it that they won't notice me losing 40 pounds, I would rather not have to get so fine else involved, thank you for any help.

I go close to her while she's eating chips, she screams (she always thinks im doing something to annnoy her or taking something from her). I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I've already tried doing everything her way yet she still finds a reason to scream (or screams so our parents think im doing something ""bad"" or beating her up).

Thanks in advance and i hope you can help me.

543,"Throwaway for the typical reasons. 

Quick backstory. Boyfriend and I have only been together about six months but things have been going very well for us. We immediately clicked and have a very enjoyable/healthy relationship. I am in my last semester of my masters program located at a relatively big school near a very large/major city. 

Like the title said my boyfriend and I have been talking about moving in together soon. Neither of us have ever lived with an SO before so it is a little nerve racking but in general we are optimistic about it. My current lease goes until the end of July 2019 but due to issues with apartment management and an unfortunate roommate situation I would like to sublease my room for the summer and move out of my current housing basically ASAP(potentially moving in with bf in May). BF can move out whenever but there has been a tentative plan to move in with a mutual friend as well who would need a place by June at the latest. 

However, since I am graduating and have been chatting with advisors, fellow students, etc... they have very much encouraged me not to limit myself to the city/suburb area that I am currently in when I am searching for jobs. 

I normally consider myself to be a logical and straightforward person but am having a hard time figuring this situation out. I just have so many thoughts/worries running around my head! What if bf and I move in together in May but I get a good job offer somewhere else? I don’t want to stay in current city and resent bf if I am unhappy with the job I take. I think mostly I just hate how little control I have over the situation. I’ve just worked so hard the past 6 years to finish my degrees and pursue my passion now I’m worried I may not find a job in this area that continues me on that path. 

Boyfriend has been showing me houses and setting up walk throughs the past couple of days and it started to worry me . I expressed my concerns to him and he said he wouldn’t pressure me to move in and he wants me to pursue my passion but it makes me even more sad because he is such a good guy and I don’t want to lose him. 


Any advice or thoughts are welcome. I may be getting ahead of myself but I’d like to have a better idea how to proceed with this",04Feb2019,1
545,"I’m a 20 year old girl. I’ve only worked there for a month.

I walk into work yesterday and ask where they want me to be. My shift leader says the window for the drive thru and I go there and do what I think needs to be happening. Ten minutes later, my boss wants to talk to me. She hands me a piece of paper and says to read it. It’s about communicating with customers and she explains how some district people weren’t happy with what they saw in the store (nothing directly at me yet) . Nothing its fine, whatever. But then she brings up that my shift leaders didn’t want to criticize me cause they said I would get frustrated and tear up. I then told her I didn’t cry since the first day (put me on the busiest time and didn’t expect me to get frustrated). But I was over that. Anyway, I didn’t know this at all I thought I was getting along with everybody. I was getting frustrated at this point and asked for a second. I went to the back and cried, yeah. I’m an extremely sensitive person and have social anxiety. She comes back and we talk more. I told her I thought I was doing a good job. But she said I was suppose to be on bar(making drinks) after a week of my first day. They didn’t tell me this until a month later. Other employees told me they usually don’t put new people on bar util they’re comfortable and put them on front so they get use to everything. A while ago I was on drive thru and guess who came up to me to tell me they were proud of me and hugged me? My boss. But she was telling me something completely different. Telling me I didn’t want to be better at my job and I was suppose to ask to do drinks this whole time. Basically saying I wasn’t thinking the way I was suppose to. But I was literally doing what I was being told. I didn’t know. I told her that I didn’t know. And I’m frustrated and confused.

546,"I live in a mid rise apartment and happen to have the beautiful corner with floor to ceiling windows. 

I was real smart and didn’t think about the heat during the summer. It gets around 105 degrees during the summer. 

There is a building directly beside us that is owned by the same property management. They are our sister property actually. Their windows have tint on them that reflect on the sun. But our windows do not. 

I reached out to the property manager to ask if WE paid for the labor and tint, can we tint our windows. Property manager told me she reached out to their territory manager and was told no. I just want to know why. She advised I get curtains. But why wouldn’t they tint one building and not the other? It doesn’t make sense. It’s only 75 degrees now but the heat is already heating our apartment up and our AC can’t keep up. Our property manager had maintenance come out and they said our AC is working just fine. 

But the sun is pointing directly at us. 

We plan to move to the other side of the building when our lease is up in December.  

But I just am genuinely curious as the reason why they won’t tint these windows. It’s only a four story building.

547,"My friend came up to me today and told me that three of the popular kids had been talking about me in their History class. They were making fun of my hair and how thick it is, calling me a 'gypsy' and arguing over whether my body looks like a bowling pin or a bowling ball. It really made me upset to hear that these people were talking about me behind my back, and I don't ever talk to them unless I have to. Two of them I would have expected, but one of them I had thought was nice.    
 

I know I am fat, but what they don't know is that I have been on a diet and exercising since the start of the year, and I already have lost a bit of weight, so it hurts me that people are still making fun of me. I was so happy at the beginning of the school day, but now my confidence has completely gone and I am so scared that everyone is looking at me and judging my looks.   
 

I looked in the mirror this morning and thought that I wasn't actually as bad looking as I used to think I was, but now I think that I saw myself differently to how everyone else sees me. I don't want to confront them or let them know that I know, and I don't want any teachers finding out because they always seem to deal with issues in the worst way possible. Plus, I would get bullied even more if someone knew I had snitched.

I posted this on r/medical but only got one response and couldn’t think of any other appropriate places to put it.

(If anyone could help me out with identifying the problem or telling me a way to help stop my nosebleeds would be amazing.) I’ve had nosebleeds ever since I was a toddler, I’m now 16 and have had 8 cauterizations. When I was around 13 I had a streak of really bad nose bleeds to the point where I had to go to the ER and this past week I started having a new streak of bad nose bleeds, equivalent to what I’ve had in the past. Before this week it was my longest time without a bad nosebleed, I’d have a few small ones that would last 10 minutes tops and I could just shove a wad of tissue up my nose and it would stop. With my last cauterization I saw an Otolaryngologist where I was told I would have to put ointment in my nose everyday because my blood vessels were so close to my skin. This past Wednesday a nosebleed started and rather than dripping like my rare ones had been, it poured but I did the wad of tissue thing I usually did but it bled through. I went in the bathroom and applied pressure but it wouldn’t slow so I went downstairs slowly because I began feeling faint and when I got down I was extremely close to passing out, my whole body was pins and needles and I was in a cold sweat but it went away after five minutes and I drank a ton of water and felt fine after that. The next day   During the last half hour of school I sneezed which triggered a nose bleed so I went to the nurse where I explained I can’t apply pressure to both sides (its bleeding in my right nostril) because the blood has no where to go (In elementary I went to the nurse who insisted on holding my nose as tightly as she could and it came out of my tear ducts.) she did anyway and not even ten seconds later blood pours out of my mouth with a huge blood clot my mom picked me up and it ended up stopping in the car. Saturday (yesterday) I got a nose bleed and it was pouring out and it came out of my tear ducts and I coughed up at least 10 clots and my mouth kept filling with blood so my mom decided to take me to the ER it stopped when I got there and they went through the stuff every other doctor/nurse had ever told me humidifier, ointment, head forward, apply pressure they packed my nose which I still have in now and hey gave me meds to prevent me getting s sinus infection (they aren’t fun). I’m seeing my family doctor tomorrow where he might refer me to an ENT but I doubt any things going to come out of that. I know I don’t have it bad, just seeing the things some people have to deal with everyday in the ER shows me I shouldn’t be complaining but I don’t want to deal with this for the rest of my life and I don’t want my parents to keep burning money trying to find a solution when nobody has an answer.

I can’t get another cauterization or it will create a hole in the skin dividing the nostrils 

Worries: Nervous I could possibly bleed out one day because of the amount of blood I lose or have. A blood clot form that blocks my sinuses so I can’t breathe through my nose and it blocks my throat. I thought I might have. A blood clot disorder but I’ve had a lot of blood work done so I don’t. If I’m bleeding in the back of my nose when I’m sleeping and it goes into my throat and I’m swallowing it throughout the night I’ll lose too much blood.



TLDR: Been getting nosebleeds that cause me to cough up nose bleeds all of life. Get streaks of really bad ones been recently having them. Causes me to feel close to passing out and had to go to ER because mom doesn’t know what to do.",04Feb2019,1

559,"Hello. I want to say that this is genuinely the only reason I just created a reddit account. I've always needed help with stuff but I ended up figuring them out myself. But I genuinely need help with this and I know that reddit is the perfect place to ask for advice. So before I begin, thank you. 

Honestly, it's nothing TOO serious. It's just really unfair. So we are both school students. Most people I know from not only our school but many other schools is that we have a little bit of freedom. When I come back from school I chill, study and then go to the gym to work out. Some other students do similar stuff like going training for sports, maybe working out, maybe music, could be anything really. Well, for my friend it's completely different, and I guess for the people she's with too. She gets too many private lessons at night and gets too much homework specifically in her classes at school. Basically, she wakes up at like 7 30 am, goes to school, comes back at 3, has little to no time to chill (just eats lunch), then starts doing homework. After that, there are the private lessons. 2 to 3 hours of lessons even after school, EVERYDAY. Things will get tougher in 11th grade too, and later on. And honestly, I know its SUPPOSEDLY for her best to have a good future with a career and all that, BUT shes freakin' tired. She needs her own freedom especially these teen years. She has experienced what it's like and thirsts for it. Hence why she actually chooses to stay up til like 12-2 am and then sleep and then doesnt get any sleep or since she gets nightmares as well, could sleep at like 2 and wake up at 5. With not more than 5-6 hours of sleep everyday, she is completely weak with huge ass black circles under her eyes. I know she doesn't deserve this, I've known her for years and she's truly an amazing person but I genuinely don't know what I should do to help her (this is the only idea I've come up with so far, posting here). Getting used to this is very unhealthy so it's definitely not a choice, plus it'd last for 2 more years and maybe even more. She even wants to work out but doesn't have the energy to do so, even tho she's really fit (somehow), but if any girls are reading this, you know how it is... 

So please, I really cannot think of anything, the only day off she gets is Sunday and honestly it's not enough since even then she has to sleep early and before that study as well. 

What should she do? Or what should I do for her, if it's possible to do ANYTHING. ",04Feb2019,1
560,"Being purposely vague on details here, sorry.

My friend was hired about a year ago at a company, after completing half a year as an intern. They performed quite well, and was known for doing good quality work, if a little slow. In the end, the manager explained that even though my friend had a slightly lower output total than their peers, their work had virtually no errors, whereas the other submissions would have to be combed over again, and overall lose time. This fits their work ethic - they're very methodical and perfectionist, and take their time to do things right the first time. My friend's always been insecure about their perceived intelligence and slowness. My friend has worked very hard, putting in long hours in and out of the office, to ensure all work is completed, but also completed perfectly. They also spend hours on the weekend studying and reading work-related materials to excel at their job too.

However, recently while at a company meeting, one of the different managers for a project they're assigned to had a chat pop up saying ""yeah, \[my friend\] IS slow, what's their deal?"" The manager went to close the chat, but opened up the window instead and there were a few lines questioning my friend's intelligence. It was closed and the meeting continued like nothing had happened, but my friend had to excuse themselves towards the end due to a anxiety attack rising.

  
My question is what resources there are for my friend to speak about this issue? As far as I've heard about companies in general, HR is generally unhelpful, and it's not like this manager is: a) their direct manager, or b) has a history of ""bad"" behaviour. There isn't really ""proof"" unless they were to dig through (presumably) private chat logs, and overall the company, and their direct bosses, have always been supportive and appreciative of their work; it's just this one overseer of a project they're working on. It's a really big deal as it's my friend's worst insecurity, and the incident likely poisons all further interactions with their workplace, wondering if everyone they work with is secretly criticizing their work.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Friend inadvertently sees a conversation between (indirect) managers questioning my friend's intelligence, which is a major ""trigger"" for their anxiety. What can be done, or who should be talked to?

I've  been thinking of adding one into my outfit for a long time now, my  brother says he will buy one for me, but i've been thinking twice,  because no one in the family actually likes them, and i'm British and  bolo ties are an American thing, i don't want people calling me a ""teddy  boy"" and as such, I'm wondering if i should pull the trigger or not.

I've  also been wondering what kind of clasp it should have, i like anything  that has wings (think bentley logo or an eagle) something religious  (like a cross or star) wouldn't be bad either, i do know people who are  non-religious who wear religious stuff, but i fear it would attract  crazy people and it may only be suitable to wear on a sunday, i fear  wearing anything religious on any other day would make me look a freak.

After some initial conversation, she sent me a couple photos of what I assumed was her. She asked for a pic back with my face in it and I was drunk so I sent her one. Immediately after, “she” demanded money and showed me that she found my facebook profile where she threatened to send the photo to a number of my friends. “She” wants me to send her $200 by tonight or else she will release the photo. Do I have any other options?",04Feb2019,1
573,"I'll try and explain the situation as best as I can. We are both 22. 

Me and ""Ben"" have always been good friends. It started in middle school where we just instantly clicked and we have maintained this friendship throughout high school and university as well. As a result, I've always felt like I could discern when something was going on in his life or when something was bothering him.

Over the past few weeks, and even months, I have been noticing some concerning changes in the way he has been acting and who he has been spending time with, etc.

It's almost as if he goes through periods where he is super paranoid about things, for example a couple weeks ago he was telling me how he thinks that his parents are trying to sabotage his university studies because they don't like what he chose to study. He didn't go super into detail regarding his parents, but he said that he thinks that his parents are intentionally causing him stress by burdening him with family issues so he will not be able to focus on his studies. As well that his parents are ""probably"" talking to his professors about him and ""influencing"" their opinions of him. 

He also accused me of wanting to sleep with his ex-girlfriend, which I have NO interest in as I have been with the same girl for almost three years. He of course didn't have any proof of this so he did drop it. Just super bizarre and out of place statements like that. 

Two weekends ago, he asked me if I wanted to go to a party at a friend's house. I said sure because I like to have a good time as well and honestly I knew he had started hanging out with some new people so I was also curious about who they were and he was practically begging me to go to the party with him, so I did. 

Well, when we get there, I immediately can tell that it is a ""bad scene"", so to speak. There was a lot of bizarre and sketchy people there and I just felt super uncomfortable. At one point, Ben told me he was going to the bathroom, and when he came back, he was acting super wired and accelerated. He was definitely on some kind of drug, but what kind I'm not sure as I'm pretty naïve on the subject. 

Another situation that I can think of is that he has starting dating this girl, who is so extremely not his type it's uncanny, and after two weeks of knowing her, already has a tattoo relating to her. Incredibly fast and weird relationship that I honestly see spinning out of control. 

All of these stories to say that I don't know what is going on with Ben. A lot of this behaviour is super uncharacteristic of him. I know he has struggled before, but not like this. All of this behavior has almost been escalating to a point now where all of this stuff is happening and I don't know how to help him or what to even say to him about my concerns (if anything). 


Do you think I'm overreacting with my concerns? If not, do you think I should try and talk to Ben about my worries? What should I say to him/how should I say it?

tl;dr: My friend's behavior is spinning out of control and I'm worried about his mental health. ",04Feb2019,1
574,"Hey Y'all 
So I've been in love with pretty much my best friend for about a year and a half now. Last year around this time we ""dated"" for about a week, but her father had just passed away the month before and she was having trouble processing intimacy. So we stopped, and that was ok, I respect and care about her enough not to push it. Then, in June, she started dating a guy from her hometown in NJ (We are in MA) without telling me. This hurt a lot, and there was several situations were I had to see the other guy, and it was painful to even look at him. Flash forward to today, where her and I spend every other day together, we confide in each other, share music, go to concerts together and everything. All the music I love is associated with her, every waking second I'm trying not to think about her, or over analyze every little action she does, trying to interpret it as she's interested. Her mom and sibilings love me. 
Anyways, I need to know if I have to force myself to give up, that if a year and a half of pining is too much, or if it's not, and if I should stick it out and wait. Because she is worth it. 

Thanks Guys. 
Please help me

575,"So I'm not the greatest gift giver in the world, and this is also the first time that I'm celebrating Valentine's Day with another person. I want to show him how much I appreciate him being there for me while I'm going through physical therapy. What do you guys think is a thoughtful gift to give to a guy?",04Feb2019,1
576,"Okay. This is a crazy story. I'll start by giving you the context. I had/ve a crush. Since 1st grade (she was my crush for a loooong time, still is) . Last year, we got super close into each-other. We weren't dating, but at least I was her best friend! Here in to the play comes an another girl, she was my friend (still is). Let's call her D.    
          
So, I photographed some pics of my crush to look ""super air-headed for her"", I showed them only just to D. I had only three of them, but I told her I had way more (to assert my obession). Those photos weren't sexual or something close at all. I didn't masturbate over them, since she's my friend, and that would've just been stupid. I just used them to assert my obsession (even though everyone in my class knew how much I liked her, especially D).          
          
Around the same time, I manipulated my friend to NOT socialise with her. I threatened him. To this day, we don't talk anymore with him.                
       
Here's probably the worst part. Around two weeks later, I was chating with D on Discord and some other stuff. My friend dared me to send D... my schlong... or he would've talked shit about me to my crush and stuff. So of course, I did it. I wasn't scared, because I'm above average, so I showed off. The pic was just my schlong next to a ruler. The schlong was drawn and blurred over, and only the tip of it was left, just for confirmation.        
        
That backfired.   
         
Day after that, we had a class trip. Everyone got to know about it. D wasn't my friend anymore. Altough my crush wasn't aware... Yet...  . I lost a friend, everyone made fun of me, I wanted to just kill myself. I spoke about that wish to my crush that day (with no pretext as to why), she helped me cope, so I didn't do it.     
         
She got to know all of this around the time school ended (June 25-ish).     
         
She didn't respond to me on discord, so I thought something was off.       
        
In July, I went to a summer camp for a week. I got a new friend. Let's call her S. We could both relate as with failing to establish relationships. S wanted to help me to know as to why my crush ignored me. I accepted, since nothing mattered anymore. My crush told S all of the things that I did to her or her friends. I also got to know that sometimes my humour might've creeped my crush out (it's anti-humourish, dark humour, and unfunny on purpose, ironic humour). Never knew that, and I asked my crush to tell me if I say some wrong stuff. I got embarrased, because S got to know about this as well.        
         
I regained friendship with D. But I cannot talk to my crush anymore. And she doesn't want to as well. It's awkward, since almost in every lesson we sit near each other (not even that I want to, or took the place intentionally). We once had to guide school's guests together, TOGETHER. She talked to me, but didn't get personal, like she would when I was her buddy. Also there's this running joke in my class, that I love French girls with long legs. She basically told to me, that her friend (which I am familiar with) is tall, and can speak French. Awkwardly, on Christmas, I had to gift her a gift. The gift was super great, as told by her friend, which is my friend as well. Recently she saw my Instagram story as well, she doesn't follow me, and when we we're friends I didn't have IG. It was a video of Anthony Fantano screaming ""damn boy, you's thick"" 
       
What can I do? I definetely at least want somehow to apologize to her, to get rid of part of my pain. I also want to regain my dignity, since I look like an sh*t head now. Since I think she might want to regain someone like me, because I listened to her always, was up to chat always, was looking to help anytime. It's harsh to lose a best friend. She probably got that too. Not of her friends could to do her what I did, since they didn't have time.

579,"Hey guys, first time poster, long time lurker.

Tl, dr; I'm in love with someone who is very far away and have never met but I also care so much about someone nearby. What do I do!?! 

I desperately need some advice.

When I (25 yo student) went back home to New York (I live in London), I met an amazing person (A) on a dating app. We talked and talked and talked since both of us were bored at home. The thing is, we never got a chance to meet up since I was there for such a short time but we do chat via video and snap pics of each other and everything. Two months in, we've had this amazing connection to the point that despite the long distance and time difference, we have talked for hours during the day, are each others first and last texts and basically have fallen in love and we both feel this strongly about each other. We've even talked about kids and marriage as Nd what our future could look like. The thing is, we don't have a future. I am going to be in France for atleast the next two years if not more, and A has no plans to relocate for me as NYC is home. We haven't met in real life and have no plans to visit thus far.

Enter person D. I met them in real life and we hit off really well. We've been on four dates here in London and they live 45 min away by transit from me. We have soooo much in common and while we don't text as much, the connection and convo in person is amazing to the point hours go by without realising. The thing is, until now, I know I would pick A over D any given day. But I was coming back from vacation and my flight was delayed so person D invited me directly from the airport to their place to relax for a bit. That turned into me spending the entire weekend with them and we talked and cuddled and cooked and had mind blowing sex as well. I obviously spent the night and made breakfast as well next morning so it was so sweet and wholesome. D even remembered little details about what I like and don't like and made the evening extra special food wise. I finally felt like a real couple for a change and it was just soooo perfect and amazing since that's exactly what I need from life. We also just cuddled and talked and walked tv in our pj's which was pretty cute. 

The thing is, I don't know what to do. Things with D are getting super serious and the time has come to pick a person and move forward with them. The main issue is I love A more than D, and A is much more responsive than D to my messages, but with D I can do the amazing couply stuff like staying in on weekends, proper dates, talking in real life, conversations etc. I have a much more chance of a future with D and would be happy to introduce them to my family and friends since they are actually here. And I felt love for D over the weekend but not as strongly as for A which is obvious since I've known A for a lot longer than D.

The complicating factor is that A doesn't want to let me go but won't commit to a long distance either as they were cheated on in the past and feel that they can't trust me 24x7. I also get it's a lot to ask from someone especially since they haven't met me in real life.

So reddit, what do I do? I want both of them but that means hiding a part of me from each person and, since I want one of them long term, it's not an option. Moreover, it's not fair to either person.

Thank you so much. ",04Feb2019,1

581,"I (21F) am a mechanical engineering student. I'm currently on internship in my home town and I will be working until the end of April. I will start my final year of university in September. 

I'm struggling with figuring out what to do between May and the start of school. I currently have a few options that have potential to be done together: 
1. Take two electives online so I will have only 6 classes per term next year.
2. Get a part time job.
3. Get a full time summer student job. 

I'm really debating on just taking the summer off to do the online classes and just post a babysitting ad to earn some extra cash once in a while. I've either wòrked or went to school every week since i was 17. I have never taken time off just for the heck of it. I have some pros and cons and I can't stop focusing on the cons, perhaps for a good reason. 

Pros are that I would lessen my course load for next year and have time to get fit again, volunteer more, and focus on my mental health. I lost a lot of family members last year, including my mom April 2018. I never really got a chance to just sit down and morn after her death as the funeral planning and final exams happened within a span of three weeks. I could use this time to just relax and heal. My internship is mainly a desk job, so with sitting all the time and emotional eating, I have gained some weight that I would like to lose before school. 

Furthermore, I have saved enough money to pay for tuition and rent for next year. This is without considering a scholarship and a fund my mom set up that I need to use before I graduate. I should also have more than enough saved up for the summer. I live with my BF (together for 4.5 years) and rent a property from his parents. The rent is fairly cheap and my BF usually pays it as they only charge us to cover the upkeep. For the most part, I will only be spending money on food and gas. 

Money is both a pro and a con. I am having a hard time imagining not having a full time job nor being a full time student. I could be saving up more money for a house or a small wedding. I'm also scared of becoming more lazy than I already am if I'm not forced to go to work everyday for 4 months.

585,"Three years ago I thought I had met the love of my life. I met him through a mutual friend and after a couple of dates, we were inseparable. I was young and full of energy, under the impression that I had found ‘the one’. 

As time went on, reality began to set in and cracks started to form in our relationship. He started texting less and whenever he did they were merely one-word responses. We started to see little of each other as he kept cancelling plans to meet while he posted pictures on social media of him hanging out with others. Whenever I asked to hang out with his friends, he shot me down and told me ‘maybe some other time’. I later learned that his friends had never even heard about me. At the time I wasn’t sure if he simply wanted some space or if he was getting bored of me. At night I struggled to get any sleep and I would be playing back every conversation/interaction between us, wondering if I had done anything wrong. The stress was overwhelming as every waking moment was spent waiting to hear back from him. At last I couldn’t bear it  anymore and finally confronted him. I wrote a long passionate text telling him how much I loved him, how much he meant to me, and whether he wanted to meet in-person to discuss it further. It was then that he confessed to me that he wanted to see other people. My worst fears came true. 

Part of me died the day when I learned about his true feelings towards me (or lack thereof). To make matters worse, at the time I was unemployed and struggling to find work. I also had a falling out with some close family members. It felt like I had lost everything and I had no one to confide in. I was so ashamed that I had ignored the signs; as a result I became a recluse and hid from the world. As for him, he never checked up on me once, despite knowing how hurt I was. 

Two years have past and my life has improved drastically. I’m working at a high-paying office job, I’ve restored my relations with the ones I had conflicted with, and in general feel more healthy, physically and emotionally. As for me ex, we have since met up and he’s apologized for ‘ruining my life’. In the time we’ve been apart, I came to realize how awful and cowardly of a person he was and my feelings for him have long diminished. In the end, I felt that he was no good for me for us to stay friends, and I politely asked him to stay out of my life - to which he has respected. 

Although it’s been long over, the experience had changed me as a person. These days I’m quieter and more introverted. I find get-togethers with people draining and would much rather be alone. It’s been a while since I’ve last been on a date and have little interest in pursuing anything serious with anyone. Even though I’m over him, the pain of rejection and the days I spent completely isolated still haunt me. 

Is it normal to still feel like this two years later? 
How do I get over the pain that still haunts me?

Hey guys, I’m a sales director at a large US company. There’s a female employee who works two direct reports under me, named Ashley. Ashley is an absolutely gorgeous blonde, very athletic, and she usually dresses very professionally and wears pantyhose to the office frequently. This is important to note because I have an intense fetish for women’s legs in pantyhose.

Apparently I got caught looking too many times, or was not as subtle as I thought about it, because when we had an opening for a sales manager position, Ashley applies to interview. She was wearing a business suit, black pantyhose, and heels; basically the perfect outfit to turn me on. I won’t go too much into the meeting, but she basically teases me, asks me if I’ve been looking at her legs, getting me to confess my fantasies to her. We have a nice and friendly conversation about my fetish, and then she offers to let me feel her hose, which I obviously accept. Then after I’ve gotten massively turned on, Ashley offers to let me cum on her pantyhose in exchange for the giving her the promotion. I couldn’t believe it, as she’s one of the hottest girls I’ve ever seen, and I accept. Not gonna elaborate on the details here, but the following few minutes were one of the hottest experiences of my life.

After I empty my balls on her silky pantyhosed legs, I tell her how amazing that was. She smiles and doesn’t comment on that, but instead gives me a very high salary number and also a big signing bonus. I tell her that that salary wasn’t part of our agreement and it was going to be very hard to make that happen. She responds by lifting her skirt and saying “Maybe, but I don’t know if it’ll be as hard as explaining how your semen got on a female employee’s pantyhose.”

At that moment I knew I had fucked up. Hard. I was dreaming that I would be able to have a hot office relationship with a girl way out of my league, but instead I think I got manipulated and maybe blackmailed.  I absolutely understand that this entire thing was a huge error in judgment, but at the time with the way it was unfolding I couldn’t stop.

The pay isn't anything spectacular and I could probably find better pay elsewhere. I'm just unsure if I should stick it out here or just cut my losses and try to find a better opportunity. 

One thing to note, this job is pretty flexible with schooling. They let me do schoolwork when it's slow and if I ever need time off for studying or school events, they usually allow it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Ruined chances of getting references at current job, pay isn't great, but it's convenient. Should I get a new job or stick it out? ",04Feb2019,1

596,"I know this is a dumb reason to be so wound up it’s really just stupid ass high school drama but it’s really been fucking me up. To put it very basically, my friend and I joined winter colorguard because we both love music. We’re the only two that are not super good at it because we’ve never used the flags before/ we weren’t in the fall season... anyways so my friend just started dating the coaches son, and she has been going to his house after practices to hang out with him. Already this made me and a few people uncomfortable because sometimes our coach would talk to her in a more personal way than the rest of us, but for the most part we just kinda brushed it off. Anyways a few days ago she told me that she was getting promoted to rifle and that the coach had given her one to use for the fall season. I was shocked 1 because she has not mastered flag yet, and also because there are 2 people that were in line for rifle that were in the fall season(and for the most part you need to be in fall guard to be promoted to rifle) however there efforts have gone unnoticed compared to my friends. Also, my friend and I have been doing marching band during the fall, and we’re in the smallest section, so she’s kinda leaving us in the dust for this. 

So basically, this dumb ass thing has been really weighing me down because I’m friends with her, but she’s clearly gotten promoted through favoritism. I don’t know what to tell her or if I should tell her anything at all, or maybe if I should talk to the coach. This girl is super outgoing and often gets things handed to her, so I’m just left with a feeling of putty because she never worked for her rifle, and because she’s leaving our section in the marching band. Also jealousy because idk it hurts seeing someone else get special treatment.

Hey folks, my g/f and I want to start streaming our gaming as well as our life in general. The tentative goal is to set up a stream and keep it active for 1 week - longer if we gain some interest. She thinks we're funny; I think we're ridiculous. Either way, we hope to be interesting and will be dedicating ourselves to this project for the foreseeable future.

Contents of the stream will include but not be limited to:

\~ One or both of us being on-screen at all times, interacting with our viewers. We're going to do this in our bedroom and I think it may be amusing/compelling to watch us work around this restriction.

\~ Gaming on Xbox One X, Switch and PC.

\~ Chatting/playing games/assorted activities with viewers

\~ Everyday stuff like eating and sleeping - pretty much anything that doesn't involve us being nude or otherwise need to be censored. I've also considered taking the stream mobile when one of us needs to go out for groceries, etc.

My questions for this community:

&amp;#x200B;

1)  My thought is that Twitch will be the ideal platform for our stream based on the research that I've done - am I missing the mark here? If so, what would you suggest?

2)  I'd love to be able to have one constant stream and add a second at times so that we can stream separate games and take the stream mobile when we leave the house. Is there an software solution for this? We do have an additional computer that could be used for this purpose but it's pretty weak (Surface Pro 5).

3)  I wouldn't mind buying some relatively expensive equipment. I intend to get an elgato for the Switch - is there other equipment I should consider instead or in addition to that?

4)  We're toying with the idea of creating some additional rules to spice things up. For example: ""No one is allowed to be off-screen for more than 5 minutes at a time."" Any ideas?

5)  Does this sound interesting to you? If not, what would make this concept more interesting to you?

My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months, we really get along and he treats me like a princess. Im 18 and he is 17. He moved 800 miles away (to California) about 7 months ago.

His mom is extremely abusive. She hits him so hard, in the past he has needed stitches in his mouth and she has broken his nose. She leaves bruises on the sides of his face. She does it over little things, like him not bringing grocery's inside fast enough (that was the time when he needed stitches). He says when he tries to cover his face, she just hits harder, so he just has to let it happen. He cant really defend himself because he will get kicked out, his parents are holding his college fund over his head (including money he earned himself and what his grandfather left to him). He has been kicked out before, slept on the street for I think a week when he was 16.

My mom is aware of the situation, she says that a spot is always open for him at our house. The only issue is that again, they are holding his college money over his head.

His parents are out of town and coming home today. They found out he skipped school this morning and he is just waiting for his beating. Im in a call with him right now, just kind of waiting for them to get home.

I dont know what to do anymore. I try to be as supportive as I can but it is hard. If anyone has any advice on what I can do to be there for him, or what I can say, it would really help. Thanks

604,"A bit of background- My parents are renovating their townhouse (they own it, I live there when I'm back from college) and are planning on putting new flooring in. Two nights ago (Saturday night) our dining room and living room flooded due to melting ice. We spent the entire night pumping it so the sub floor ( Is this the right term for the concrete base under a floor?) didn't get damaged. It was long, cold work, and we had to buy a second shop-vac to keep up. It came in at a rate of (at least) a gallon a minute. We were going to have the new flooring put in this Thursday, so the old flooring is already out, thank god.

Management didn't respond to our calls on their emergency hotline until 8am, 8 hours after flooding started. They put maintenance on it, put a sump pump outside, and maintenance says the landscaping is not up to code (it is above the foundation, which is part of the reason we had Noah's flood in our living and dining rooms, the other part is because the gutters were messed up and brought the roof water directly below our window, which maintenance fixed) and that there may be damages to the drywall because of everything that happened. Management says that they ""won't spend thousands of dollars to check the foundation just to look for one tiny crack, and that fixing the landscaping will not happen.""  In addition, they won't check the drywall or do anything else to fix this issue.

Now on to my problem. My father and I want to press the issue, but my mother doesn't want to ""make waves or get on the management's sh\*t list."" How can we convince her that we need to? Once the new flooring gets in, this will be an even bigger issue if this happens again. And, by extension, what can we do to force management to fix this? They are in charge of any exterior issues, and we are in charge of interior.  Literally any advice is appreciated. ",04Feb2019,1

607,"Basically I was ""dating"" a girl, to be honest spending nearly every moment and night with, though we both agreed we wanted nothing serious. I had just been out of a relationship and was really hurt and didn't want to form any real attachment to anyone creating the potential of being hurt again so soon, and she was adamant she didn't want lables, yet we enjoyed each others company so much we continued to spend all our time together. Fast forward several months she becomes pregnant and tells me. She was on BC but tells me an antibiotic for a sickness messed with it and here we are. I voiced my opinion that because of our (my) financial and relationship situation that bringing a child into the world wasn't viable. She was on the fence, when we went to sleep that night. The next day everything changed when she went to the doctor emotions came into it and the rest is history. Fast forward another 3 weeks or so of fighting ensues, cops are called on me once at her house after a great dinner date and evening she flips and calls the cops when we get home when an argument flares up for seemingly no reason (I guess I'm half responsible for that argument and she's emotional I get it). I said some hurtful things in my panic over it in text, her seeming unwillingness to budge despite my financial circumstances really really not being good for becoming a father nor do I think I'm ready (but it is her choice). Considering I did not know her well at all relatively it scared me to think how determined she was to now go through with it (her choice) and I began to think she was being fake to me/perhaps not being honest with her intentions and simply wanting a child the whole time (speculative and irrelevant, I made the choice to do it unfortunately).

&amp;#x200B;

After a month or so things calm down, she wouldn't let me come to her house anymore, we agree to meet with a therapist present despite my protest, it goes well though. We become cordial now, and I begin to notice her distinct lack of emotion in our communications. She's very matter of fact almost business colleague like to me. Not outwardly upset in the slightest, very forthcoming with a ""thank you for agreeing to meet, were going to make a great team, my next visits to the doctor are xyz"" attitude. We meet again one more time now almost 2 months pregnant over coffee, discuss a wide range of topics, it honestly escapes me at this moment but things are very civil. In fact I can't make eye contact with her the entire time and she stares me down the whole time with an upbeat, nervous confidence and trepidation. Seems genuinely just happy to divulge information to me and hopes I will participate but has no expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of that meet up for coffee we have a small discussion as we come to our cars and she tells me she's not sure we'll ever have a romantic relationship ever again. I knew she had been giving this vibe and it had been discussed previously, and it was due to the hurtful things I said I mentioned previously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do plan to be there for my child. The mother of my child has frequently cited how well off she and her family are as the main reason for wanting to keep the baby, and that she has always wanted to be a mother, maybe not in these circumstances, but she has. Like I said she has been very nice and cordial to me, and always makes sure to let me know she's happy I want to be involved (though that was never a doubt for me that I would accept this eventually). She said she expects nothing from me financially and will never seek that through legal system either. She is also very educated with a good home so really I am very fortunate this didn't happen with just anyone but nonetheless I still feel emotionally confused and bewildered as to how to proceed with her and this, I am just taking it day by day. Today I'm going to have to tell my mom about this over dinner. I'm thinking I should just tell her right when we get our waters brought to us so we have the entirety of the dinner to discuss. My mom knows about (let's call her Lindsay sorry I didn't give her a name for this) I've told her about her several times but they have never met. I know she may be disappointed in me since me and Lindsay aren't married and haven't been together for long and especially because I can barely support myself financially at the moment, which is why I'm very fortunate Lindsay plans and says she can handle everything financially including child care provided through her work (she is very organized and smart to her credit).

&amp;#x200B;

How should I present this to my mother considering my situation? I really don't know how angry or not angry she may be, if getting her first grandchild will mean anything or if she will react as if I've totaled my car.

608,"Here's the thing: I don't understand how life, or anything contained therein could have any meaning. We're floating in space, amidst the grand structures we've built - our cities and governments and economies and particle accelerators and telescopes - but ultimately, everything is bound to end. This is made bleaker by the fact that each of us, individually, will likely not ever do anything significant enough to affect any of these structures. We're all insignificant, and we don't matter. 

The argument that we're still surrounded by people and we still affect the world simply by existing doesn't work because well, anything we affect will also ultimately mean nothing in the grand scheme of things.

The pursuit of unraveling the mysteries of the universe, or just creating art or science or engineering marvels worthy of affecting people's hearts and minds also seems ultimately futile. 

Telling myself that all of these beautiful things are ends in and of themselves does not do for me, because I feel that in doing so I am applying a cosmetic fix to mask a reality that is deeply meaningless and depressing. 

I can spend days on end just focusing on the present, and feeling happy. But I ultimately know I'm cheating on my own self, and all it takes is a few moments to myself in silence that I realize it's all a facade.

I've known this one girl for about 5 years now since my parents are friends with her parents. As of the end of my Sophomore and start of my Junior year we've been talking a lot more than we use to. During the summer we would always talk and these conversations would go on for multiple hours. The longest conversation we had went from 8:00 pm to 1:45 am. During that conversation however near the end she mentioned that she wanted a boyfriend who wasn't like the rest of the guys at my school. Someone who she knows would be a kind person and would always be there to support her. I tried messaging her after she said that but she did not respond and left my snap on open. My idiot stupid brain didn't pick up on this and laughed it off. Whenever we see each other in class we're always friendly towards each other as well as how my friends in middle school used to say that we would be a great couple. I've been wanting to ask her out since Sophomore year and I've done nothing to help my cause except the fact that we still talk very frequently. 

Also, my junior prom is slowly approaching in the next couple of months and was thinking about asking her to that but I'm still unsure of what to do. Me and this girl have never had a fight before, we're practically always on good terms with each other and always love talking to one another. Her parent's think that I am an amazing person and always say how nice I am of a guy to be there for her whenever she needs it most. Even though I've been wanting to ask her out since my Sophomore year I'm afraid that if she says no I would lose our connection and talking to her wouldn't be the same again and it would just be weird.

612,"Deep down everyone wants it, or at the least wouldn't mind it falling in their laps, even if they won't actively chase it. And when one pursues a vocation passionately, they want to be as original and their best at it, and getting fame and recognition becomes a part of that. Even more so in art. Even people who start bands have it at the back of their heads. Getting to live a certain lifestyle, mingle with famous people, get it on with women etc.

But then all it does is try and satiate ones ego, which is insatiable. So fame and recognition doesn't really guarantee contentment, it's just another pandoras box where you have to deal with certain negatives, and there might be a possibility of becoming more depressed because the meaninglessness of existence might hit more (why do I not feel happy despite all this  wealth and fame?)

Socially, people and media tend to focus on very select individuals, based on very arbitrary metrics, irrespective of their net influence on humanity as a whole. People who are outspoken, wild, narcissistic and cringey tend to shortcut their way into it. What the media doesn't show is that for every single famous person, there are millions who're not, who are trying to get there, and might even be better artists who lack the shortcut qualities, or the descipline. And out of those millions, there may be some content with the lack of fame, yet doing work that is more of a net benefit to the universe at large.

I feel that if one feels a need for fame, it has to do with their need for attention, which in turn is also associated with how strongly they associate with their ego. The more the fame, the greater the ego, the lesser the empathy. The world starts revolving around them, and they start lacking the ability to look outside their heads, becoming self obsessed, and as a consequence, feeling incomplete and unhappy. I think a huge part of pursuing anything passionately and sincerely is being aware of the ego, and minimizing it as much as possible, so that it doesn't seep into the work. That includes the motivation for doing something. Doing it because you feel it'll make you famous vs doing something that is an exploration of you, creating something that you feel you and the world need. And a huge part of that is building a discipline to put hours and hours into a craft by yourself, alone, without the need for external validation. That's the boring part we never see either in media, or irl. The kind of humility that would build by that would also be a clear extention of the relationship that person has with themselves and their souls. They wouldn't be as self centred, because they wouldn't need external validation (because self contentment) , and then will get more clarity to look around and help others, without expectations. They wouldn't feel the pull of external desires as much, and would live a life where they'd be able to balance out all their physical, emotional, intellectual, sexual, mental needs.",04Feb2019,1

So to begin, i've been looking for a new job since early November due to being fired for reasons that make no sense to me but are irrelevant. It depleted my savings account and on the week that I was about to go through the literal last amounts of money that I had left, I finally managed to get a job and of course I accepted and was excited. I had no choice since I was down to the last two hundred dollars that I would have to use for bills. I have my first paycheque for the last two weeks coming on Thursday and that alone will keep me covered until the end of February.

**I want to quit** but I'm not sure if I can. It took me a while to get this job but to be completely honest, i'm miserable. I knew from day one that I wasn't gonna stay there for long because of a few reasons:

* The boss has called me numerous things including pansy, pussy, pretty boy, faggot, etc
* When I ask coworkers for help, they act annoyed and ignore me, leaving me clueless.
* I've overheard coworkers talking about me behind my back in rude and offensive ways
* I simply hate the work
* Safety is next to non-existent, with the entire shop being filled with cigarette smoke, people welding without masks, and a focus on speed rather than the health and well-being of the workers.

This, along with some other reasons unrelated to this job have caused me to harm myself, think about suicide, and even write fake suicide notes. I have already skipped one day per week with today being the third day and i'm not sure what to do. Am I just being a bitch? Should I suck it up and keep going to work even though it's destroying my mental health?

623,"Hello Reddit,

When I first joined college I was heading straight for medical school as most kids do when they enter into the biological sciences. I soon realized that I had a bit of an issue, the stress of college coupled with the fact that I have OCD, anxiety and many other mental issues has made the work load and mental health very difficult to manage. So for the first 3 years I struggled a lot and almost lost my mind. Then when I got to my upper divisions I started taking school slower and I started getting A's in all my courses which was great but I realized that I simply wouldn't be able to handle the load that medical school needed me to handle. I could go into research but I really like socializing with people and helping people directly and I feel that I will be bored out of my mind in research. People have told me to go into nursing or become a paramedic but I feel like if I did that I would be unsatisfied that I could never go all the way and become a doctor. Are there any careers that are biology related that I could get into that would allow me tot interact with people and help people that are not the ones I mentioned above.

I recently read through the lease and realized significance in a line, ""USE: I will notify my insurance company and HFS immediately of any damage to or loss of the Vehicle, ...""

I didn't notify HFS immediately in any of those cases, though I'd imagine my insurance would have. I'm also not sure genuine Honda parts. SGS already came out and did the pre-inspection which of course picked up the body work, but didn't assess whether or not the parts were genuine.

Is there a chance I could be liable or held accountable for not keeping them in the loop? What would you recommend I say or do when I bring the car back in, should I just hand over any maintenance receipts I have? How transparent should I be? Thank you.",04Feb2019,1
625,"I am in my senior year of undergrad. For two years now I have been regularly meeting with an advisor to students in my major to discuss the next semester's class schedule, my goals, and the requirements I need to graduate. Over the summer of 2018, however, I sent my advisor 6 emails (over the course of probably 2 months) talking about various things to which she did not respond. I didn't mind, I figured out the answers to my problems and went on with my life. 

In the fall, I emailed her again a couple more times about a foreign language requirement. Since I was coming up on my last semester, I had been told repeatedly by other faculty that you only needed 1 foreign language course to complete the foreign language requirement. What I did not realize, was that this foreign language class that was required was the second class of two, and you cannot take them at the same time, meaning that my on-schedule graduation was now in jeopardy. I kept trying and trying to talk to my advisor, and kept walking in to her office hours and calling her to no reply. Finally, after almost three weeks of radio silence she finally shows up to her office and from there we have a conversation about the foreign language credits. 

I was mad already, but I am a generally polite person and did not show this in any way. I truly wanted to just be done with the situation, and graduate on time. The advisor said essentially that I was shit out of luck and that I can try to pass an exam hosted outside the university to get the credits for the class. I tried signing up for the first class i needed but it was full. If the advisor had been there during those three weeks it would have been open. 

It's my fault for not knowing the exact requirements to my major down to the last detail, yet I was relying on her for that type of information. My plan right now is to just try and pass this community college foreign language test before the deadline to sign up for graduation is, which is in less than 2 weeks. I am pretty well versed in Spanish also, which is the funny part about all of this. 

I guess my question to ask here is that if anyone has been in a similar situation, what did you do? If I could somehow talk to the dean and explain what happened, would it be possible to relinquish my obligation to take the courses? Overall, I have a plan. However I'd still like to hear what anyone has to say. ",04Feb2019,1

627,"So recently, I've been having a slip. Grades have been slipping. My Practice SAT scores are at my lowest. I'm forgetting to do my volunteer applications. Et cetera. It's been a rough time for me. What made it worse is the constant negativity I've gotten from my parents, exclusively my mom. I've tried hard for every test, and I do want to get straight A's. The issue is however, I have this kinda addiction with gaming, and my parent's hate that. They've blamed every failed test, every failed SAT test on my gaming, and I've always felt so bad about my self, but I just can't stop gaming. They've made me feel horrible about myself, and I just feel like they've reached a point where they've become only my harshest critics and never encourage me.

The fact is that i'm in a relationship and i have a gf since 2years, I don't really want to leave her.
I'm pretty lost in my feelings, but the question is not should i leave my gf for the other girl cause i know it will not work with the other girl. 
The question is, should i tell the other girl that i have feelings for her ? Cause this situation is making me more depressed and when she's asking me what's wrong i don't know if i should tell her or not. I'm afraid to scare her or some other shit like this...
Should i tell her or not ? Just tell her, not asking her for a date or anything, I just want to be honest about my feelings, but i don't know if i should.

629,"TLDR In a house of 4 friends one roommate can’t stop going on anger tirades and is rather help him instead of kicking him out. 


About a year ago 3 good friends (men all mid 20s)  and I (M26) all moved into a big house together in order to save on rent in an area where rent goes up exponentially. I’ve had a couple issues with one of them and (with the help of r/advice) we worked them out and things have improved drastically. Except for one of the roommates. 

So one of them (let’s call him Bob) lived with me prior to moving in to this house. He’s an angerball and always has been. He’s very opinionated and easily the highest educated in the house. But Bob dumped his gf about a year ago and his anger has been getting worse ever since. The break up was very hard on him and made worse when she made it clear she hadn’t cared in a long time. Since then, he’s lost countless jobs, including two in a month’s span. He’s now working for his parents and it looks like he might get fired from there too because now he’s expecting special treatment for his issues. 

Around the house, he’ll go on long angry rants about whatever might be bothering him. Whether it’s the video games were playing or the other roommates in the house, he’ll find something to get mad about. And if he can’t find anything he’ll look up the news and rage about that. His anger often comes in waves with the low points being the normal. In those times something will trigger him into a few minute rant but nothing that a “ok. That’s enough” won’t take care of. On the high point of the wave he’ll be on such a hair trigger that anything will spark a fiery loud rage that will often devolve into a racist or demeaning tirade. 

We’ve had enough. But we don’t know which method to approach him with. Bob is so mad at one of our roommates that he’s to the point of avoiding him. This roommate did nothing but mind his own business. 
A close friend to the house, who has felt his rage multiple times, has offered to talk to his mom (who this friend has a friendly relationship with as well) 
We’ve also talked about staging an intervention but Bob is pretty fragile and might take it as an attack. If he does he’d either ignore us entirely in a new fit of rage or he’d say exactly what we want to hear while only doubling down in his own mind.
We’ve started confronting him each time he has an episode by showing him what his rage has done to other people and it works in the moment but there are no lasting changes. 

On top of all the rage, Bob’s obnoxious to the point of provoking violent anger in everyone who passes through our house. Nobody has hit him but over the weekend we narrowly avoided a fight. 

If you’ve gone through a similar situation I’d love to hear from you. Despite all the issues, Bob is an old and very close friend to all of us, and when he’s not acting out he’s genuinely a good guy and a blast to hang out with. I’d hate to see all that go up in flames because he couldn’t get over a girl. ",04Feb2019,1
630,"So I’ve been on my high schools lacrosse team since it started two years ago and I’m a senior now. We all used to be bros but now lot of football players joined and they hate me. I don’t really know why but I know they think I’m weak and nerdy etc. I don’t really care. 

Last week, at practice, I was talking shit about someone and I really shouldn’t have. I learned from it and not afraid to admit I did. However, one of the football players told me that I shouldn’t be talking shit when everyone hates me. I know all of them hate me but I’ve got a lot of friends at school so I knew this wasn’t true. The guy who told me this, let’s call him David. 

So the same practice, I overheard David talking to a bunch of his friends about how he was gonna beat this guys ass named Joe. Earlier this school year, Joe got expelled and he’s generally just a crazy dude. However I used to be friends with Joe until he got expelled. After practice, I texted Joe and asked him why he and David were gonna fight. Joe apparently didn’t know anything about it (I think I’m not sure). So  he screenshotted the short conversation and sent it to David. David saw me at the end of school today and tried putting his hands all over me and was saying “You’re a piece of shit” “You’re really gonna get it now.” Not gonna lie, I was really intimidated but I stood my ground and said “Go ahead buddy” and walked away after continually pushing him off me. 

I’m not a small guy at 6 foot, but David is literally 6 foot 5 and could whoop my ass. All the football players like him and they are all so toxic and are now on the lacrosse team. I just need some advice on what to do now because they all really hate me now and that’s a good 1/3 of my lacrosse team who all want to beat my cheeks. How do I handle this? David won’t listen to reason and will always hate me and all the football guys and their friends are now gonna try to make my life hell at school and on the lacrosse team. I’m just trying to graduate and leave but have 4 more months. I want to be able to go to basketball games and stuff without all of them making my existence miserable. ",04Feb2019,1

634,"My boyfriend is a single dad with two fantastic kids. Very well behaved, listens the first time, no major behavior issues, etc. The custody agreement with his ex is that she has them weekends and we have them week days. 

When he and I don't have the kids, he's very relaxed, cheerful, playful, and in generally a pretty good mood most of the time. We click really well on those days.

However, on days where we have the kids, he's irritated 90% of the time by EVERYTHING (not by the kids necessarily). He even starts getting in a bad mood the morning before we get them (he picks them up after school in the afternoons).

He loves his kids and often expresses his desire for full custody. They have a great relationship with him. But for some reason, when they're here, he's uptight, irritated, distant, and has this storm cloud hanging over his head. He even pulls away from me a bit, not wanting to talk, touch, or have sex.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a colossal project this semester that the entire class is working on as a team, 23 of us. It's basically to develop an absolutely massive game. The problem that the 4 of us are running into is something that we were nervous about from the beginning...14 of our classmates log anywhere between 8-12 hours of Overwatch a day. It can be during our group meetings, when they're at home, or even during the class while the professor is lecturing/watching us work. It's extremely frustrating, and the solutions that come to our mind are things like ""get over it, you'll succeed, they won't"" type things, but the scary thing is that this is an entire semester's worth of a project that likely will have a huge impact on our careers and our schooling outcome. It fills us with an extreme rage as we stay up until 4 am two, three, four nights in a row to get a presentation done for Friday with zero communication from the rest of them. We've spoken with them, and they don't care too much, and we've spoken with our professor, who is concerned, but doesn't know how to motivate them, and he isn't really allowed to fail them, since it would reduce our department into nothing.

653,"My boyfriend of 6 months has a lot of issues. I love him deeply, but I cannot continue the relationship after what I have learned about him. However, I care about him, and want him to get help. I literally do not know where to start, since I'm not even sure what he has.

&amp;#x200B;

He is very sexually aggressive with people. 6 years ago, a woman violated a restraining order against him. He cannot understand when people are creeped out or uninterested in him. I have personally seen a Facebook Messenger chat he left open with a girl who he had been sending suggestive sexual messages to over the course of FIVE YEARS. She NEVER responded, but he continued. Eventually, she responds with ""You're absolutely crazy. LEAVE ME ALONE!"". He sent a laughing emoji back. 

&amp;#x200B;

He to this day believes that the restraining order wasn't something to be taken seriously- rather, a 'test' this woman did to have him prove to her that he was willing to take a risk (ie, violating it) to be with her. So, he did violate it, and she called the cops, and he spent a night in jail. He STILL believes she wasn't creeped out by him, and actually wanted him. I'm dead serious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, he believes that multiple woman (the original restraining order girl, 4 of her friends, and her MOTHER), were all in on this ""coded messaging communication"" whereby they would post public pictures and messages solely meant for him and as a message to him. For example, the mother posting a run of the mill inspirational picture with quote like ""When the going gets rough, remember why you fought this long"", and him interpreting that to mean the mother wanted him to keep pursuing her daughter who had filed a restraining order against him...He has written a 130 page ""manifesto"" rife with these delusions, ""evidence"" (just their pictures, and his bizarre delusional interpretations) that they were all in on it.

&amp;#x200B;

He firmly believes this to be true, and nothing anyone says will make him acknowledge he is suffering from some type of delusion. I looked it up, and it seems like he has some combination of narcissistic personality disorder, sex addiction, erotomania, and maybe even schizophrenic-like delusions.

&amp;#x200B;

He is sexual with almost every woman. Two weeks into our relationship he told me he was sexting an 18 year old girl and telling her he wanted to have sex with her. Yes, I'm stupid. But that's not what this post is about, so please don't comment that.

&amp;#x200B;

Wtf is wrong with him? The delusions are becoming more apparent in everyday life and he needs serious psychological help. He is also 30 years old but doesn't function like a successful adult, is in debt, has no money, no relationships, has pushed away his family, etc. His family does care about his health but they just cannot have any emotional ties to him because of his problems.

&amp;#x200B;

It would hurt me to walk away, because I literally think he might be homeless. His parents I don't think will take him in. H doesn't have much money, as I said. I was thinking of staging some kind of intervention for him where I get me, his parents, and his best friend, to get him to go somewhere. His parents do have a lot of money and I believe would help with this. But I don't even know exactly what's happening, or what is truly best to do.

I started university when I was 19 and quit it at 20 to travel and because I wanted to feel free and indipendent (and couldn't really focus, I always had a really difficult situation with my family), I came back to my home town, found a job as a Taekwondo instructor and personal trainer, then re-started uni at 25 and I still have to graduate (3-fu\*\*ing-year duration, I think I suffer from ADHD). I couldn't study properly, neither could I work with my mind always wandering away with things like ""I'm wasting my time I should be studying so I can get a damn job I vaguely like afterwards"" so I decided to quit everything (sport and job) to devote my time to studying, but I feel like I'm worthless and completely out of place.

I workout everyday but I have no income, I tried to work from home as a social media manager, I gave it a try with photography, I always put 100% of myself on what I start, but I've never received positive feedbacks, I could never generate any kind of income.

So I started studying harder the things that could make me generate any sort of income (smm, photography, youtube videos (?), counselor for people in need, etc), sacrificing the time I should be investing on uni books, imprisoning myself in a deadly loop - ""I should be studying -&gt; but I need money -&gt; I should have an income -&gt; find a way to have a part-time or a home job -&gt; no results -&gt; frustration -&gt; I should be studying"".

I really don't know what tf to do, my frustration levels are sky-capped, I'm really trying hard to focus on studying for university (psychology btw) but I can't do it without an income. Nor can I study if working full time. I know my future is somewhere after the bachelor because I had some experiences and some really interesting feedbacks in many psychological situations with people. My vocation is to help others and I want to do it with this degree.

655,"This is a really really hard thing to ask for advice about and honestly i don't know where else to go besides anonymously on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Hold on, I'm going to give a lot of background info before i get to the point and what i need advice with, so bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating my partner for about 8 months. Everything has been so amazing and our whole relationship has been a dream since i got out of a toxic one with my previous boyfriend. I couldn't be happier with the person I'm with now.

About two or three months ago, my partner began becoming comfortable with their femininity and became less worried about being the strong man that society expects him to be. Which, IMO, is great! I love that they're comfortable with me to express them self like that. Around the same time, they expressed a desire in crossdressing as a kink, and although it's something I've never delved into I was willing and supportive. After awhile of this, my partner began to express that they think they may be trans (they are amab).

m as

Now, the idea of my partner being trans is not the problem. I like women too! (I am female.) I (and their family,) are worried because this is something they've never, EVER expressed before, and it seems like a total switch to how they were growing up and even up until a few months ago, they never expressed the idea of transness to anyone. I had a conversation with their mom who expressed her worry due to my partner's whole life changing due to this decision and that she thought her child might be making the wrong choice, because a lot of times people who come out as trans do so a little earlier in their lives and my partner is passed that age range. I worry about our sex life and strain on our relationship due to transitioning and worry that on top of my own medical problems and identity issues it may result in our breakup, which would absolutely devastate me as I feel they're the love of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The other issue is that my partner does not communicate with me AT ALL about these things and it's something I've had to ask into existence ever since they started feeling this way. I was recently lurking through reddit and found that they have been posing in trans subreddits and speaking publicly to the internet and never talked to me. Being honest, it hurts. I feel like they feel like they can't trust me or talk to me and it really worries me on the strength of our relationship. I just feel like out of all the people to talk to you'd go to your S/O, right? Maybe i'm wrong since I am here, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I guess my main concerns are that my partner is making the wrong choice, and just believes that their femininity is inherently trans, and i worry about the strain on our relationship because of it. I guess what I'm asking is how do I talk to my partner and voice my worries and concern without being insensitive and shitty, and how to initiate this knowing they probably don't want to talk to me about it. This is all a really new situation for me and the idea that they don't trust me keeps me up at night.

656,"Hey, I (17M) recently got some thoughts about changing myself, to be a man in my view. That means to start properly taking care of my future, my friends, my body etc, and also some things which I burried in myself for a long time. Relationships and insecurities.

I have some insecurities and fears, but most of them involve people. I am not comfortable with doing stuff I am not 100% sure with, and it's becoming a problem because I have to lose so much because of this. 

Step by step I started doing risky stuff, just to get used to some things. But, one thing I am quite nervous about and it's hard for me to explain so I will try my best.

Firstly, I am not ugly, I am like a 7/10 maybe more maybe less in some eyes. I am known in my small city, everyone knows I am cool and maybe smart etc. 

But I've never had a PROPER gf, not even made out with any girl. I was/maybe still am shy because I didn't/don't know how to kiss and I feared the other person making fun of me because of this. This still is a fear for me, and this is why I am asking for some advice.

It's not like I am blind and I don't see opportunities. I saw them, I was too afraid. Maybe I still don't know how to act when I see an ""open window"" but I want this to change. But no one was really that much into me.

I am invited to a big party and there will be a lot of girls, and one qt 8/10 ish who gave some signals and still does imo. They are kinda lowkey. Either she is fucking with me or she wants something, maybe to see how I react. I kissed her, but nothing big, when we were tipsy/drunk but at a truth or dare and she wasn't hesitating.

She recently broke up with her bf of not so long, so I guess she is open, anyway, I will find about this until the party. I know if I play my cards right maybe I can get what I wanted, and this maybe will open some new doors or give me some new views.

Let me make some things clear:
1.I am not going to force anything on her, or play her or anything.
2.I gave her as an example cause she is the only one in my mind atm

Give me anything you got, from how to act to how I shouldn't act. Really appreciate any help !;)

657,"I am a male (20).
I am going to be completely honest and i am trying to figure out if i really did something wrong. (also sorry in advance because my english isnt the best)

So there was this girl I got to know because she had/has a sex-only-friendship with my best bud. After i first met her she started sending me memes on instagram.

We were texting a lot and then we met up. i picked her up after school and we drove to her place (she is 17 i think). At this point i have to say that i honestly had not a single back thought in my head. I was looking forward to hang out with a cool girl i have a lot in common with, thats all.

of course something happend. she tried to kiss me after i said i was going to leave in halfe an hour because i had something to do at home. i was surprised and kissed her back but just a little. (i also have to state out that i never gave her any clues that i might want something from her)
then we were talking and i said i dont want more then a normal friendship (at least for the moment because this was the first time i met her). she tried to kiss me again and the whole situation got worse.

after i left we were texting again and i told her that i really like her and also find her extremely beautiful but i just dont know her good enough. and then she said, she doesnt like me more than a friend too but it was something like an action reaction.

then i told her that i never planned on having sex with her or kissing her because she was having sex with my best bud at the time (i really never thought she would want something from a guy and his best friend at the same time - it is not like my friend would care about me having something with her too but i somehow just did not expect it) and that upset her i think. she then told me that she would stop having sex with him at any time when she has a chance to have something with me, which is the opposit of what she said before (that she does not ""love"" me).

i was very polite because i really like that girl but after a long talk (texting) she now hates me for some reason. she does not want to talk to me anymore but that really hurts me. i mean.. i never thought about it but i could imagine getting into a relationship with her because shes awesome. it just takes a bit of time. i dont fall in love that easily and that fast.

also what can i do to make her start talking to me again. i dont want to say ""hei maybe we can give it a try"" or something like that (i think this would only make her more sad/angry). i really want to meet up with her again and talk things out without stating that i could imagine a relationship - in the end i can not control if i really fall for her.

honestly i really dont know what happened. i am not even sure if she just wanted sex and was manipulative saying these things or if she really liked me.. because she would not have cut me off like that if she really did",04Feb2019,1

She also comes from a conservative culture (Indian Hindu) and I don't think she's had a boyfriend before. Those things might have something to do with it.

666,"Hello. So I am a 18 (19 in a few months) yo student and I feel like I need some bigger, more personal advice. It gonna be long.  


In a past, when I was in a primary school, I was perceived as a kind of prodigy. Long story short; it was to the point that I actually skipped 2nd grade of the primary school. Although I have felt that this was kinda exaggerated, this was a seed for the rest of the matter that I've wanted to discuss.  
This event gave me kind of, I don't know event how to describe it properly, a need or mission? to prove myself that I was actually eligible for this. It created a kind of ambition to know everything and be perceived as a paragon of wisdom. However, in a longer run, I haven't got a character to learn constantly as a kid. And it has created a kind of downward spiral. I began to prove myself in a subjects that I wasn't actually a fan of. I began to overestimate some of my capabilities. Etc etc. Combined with lack of self-discipline and a fact that I wasn't being actually learnt how to learn - and also due to the quite bad education system in my country (not only my opinion, but it's quite subjective still - at least the schools I've attended to).  
From the time perspective, I have a feeling, like I was misperceived and not actually not that gifted as it was claimed - although I find myself as a clever guy. Or maybe I've burned out my potential.  
Also overall - I think that it created in me the desire to be perfect. I think that being ambitious and perfectionistic isn't bad at all, but in my case I find it quite toxic. I sometimes cannot feel like I have a free will because of that.  
Let's go further, although you can guess it is a complex thing and might have a negative effect on the other branches of my life.  


Right now I'm studying at the best uni in my country (I'm living in Eastern Europe) in its branch, that also has great regional reputation and would equal some of Russell Group's unis in rank. I'm studying business.  
However, mainly due to the fact I've mentioned earlier I cannot make a full use of the fact that I study here. I lack motivation a bit and don't do my best.  
Basing on what I've written earlier, I feel like I haven't done my best and I have some weird need to fix it. In high school, I was this guy who wasn't learning anything, scored worst grades in a class and still got one of the best A-levels results. From the time perspective I kinda regret it, but I've lacked a goal and a motivation.  
In a final class of my high school I've got some thoughts about studying abroad (and I've actually applied for some renowned unis in Scotland, but I've decided to study in my country). These times, I've considered Oxbridge as something unachievable for me and considered it as ""a school for swots"", although somewhere deep I've wanted to try. But I've lacked faith and information about recruitment process, thus I gave up.  
When I've attended the university, I've met the guy, who tries to apply for Oxford this year. Albeit I've found him quite intelligent, I've thought ""if he can, why can't I?"" so I've decided to research entry requirements and I've been enstranged, that my A-levels score was actually eligible for some of the degrees, including PPE. However, I've realized it after deadline, thus I couldn't even try. All of the stuff such as additional tests and interviews didn't appear as tough to me.  
I've always excelled at typically humanistic subjects, such as history or languages, although I've always thought that it is ill-advised to study such subjects, when I've got a chance to apply for a degree of economics or business, that have also interested me. I also began to learn math (quite consistently, day-a-day) for A-levels, but I've failed this one somehow - thus I think maths aren't my cup of tea so far. But it revealed me, that I can learn quickly and effectively (I've began from a low level) - just the thing was I have probably never been interested by maths. I've also never expected that I would be eligible to study at Oxford the subjects that I truly like (I mean - only the ones that do not include extended math).  


Right now I wonder whether I should give up my studies and focus on the application at Oxford in a next year. Because I've heard that I would be not eligible for a student loan, if I've already studied two years somewhere else (and this is probably a must have for me - I'm from the upper middle class family, but to fully cover the tuition fee would be probably to expensive), I would need to put a lot on a risk that I would waste 2 years in my education. Also, on the other hand, I don't know if the whole Oxford climate is for me - the academic rigour, elitarism and full dedication to education throughout 3 years raise me doubts whether I would pass through the degree. But I don't want to regret that at least I've tried.  


Ok, so now the questions:  
1. First part of the text - is it something that I should discuss with some psychotherapist about? Any other advices how to cope with that feeling?  
2. Should I focus on finishing my actual degree with a perspective of doing master somewhere abroad (what was my original plan) or should I focus on applying to Oxford?  
3. Should I at least try to apply to Oxford for ambitional purposes and, even provided that I get through this, still try to finish the degree at my university?  


Long enough, I am truly grateful to people that would answer to this.",04Feb2019,1
667,"My father pretty much failed at his job and has left. Financially, we are doing okay. But I feel like I am playing an unnatural role in my family life. My brother has high functioning autism and is in high school and I am in college. Unfortunately I am the only person who can help my brother and take him to school but without my father and since my mother can't speak english well (or at least she thinks she can't), I have been helping my brother with his homework, going to teacher conferences, and emailing teachers about my brother's school performance. I am currently taking three classes in college on top of that. My mother always tells me that what i am doing is the least i should do in exchange for a college education and a place to sleep and eat. I also get yelled at if my brother gets a bad grade on a homework assignment and he doesn't get in any trouble. Others have told me that this is not my role. That I should help out but not be responsible for the things my mother makes me responsible for. Which I agree with. It seems that others believe I should aim for a life of my own in the future but my mom always makes it out to be that I will never have that and gets angry whenever I tell her that i want my own family someday. She says I will have my own life, but whenever I bring it up she gets angry. I tell her it's not normal for me to take on this responsibility and she gets angry and tells me to stop if it's so hard for me and that I won't be able to count on her anymore after that. She also gets angry whenever I look sad or upset and tells me I have no reason to feel that way and also whenever I tell her that others tell me I shouldn't have all that responsibility on me. I tried to just play it off and not tell her what bothers me but she forces it out of me. When i told her she wasn't helping by yelling and that others help me more in that regard, she gets offended and can't accept that others are better emotional support. She tells me I won't be able to get better support than with her and that if others help me more then I should just leave and live with someone who can support me emotionally. Which is a horrendous slippery slope sort of logic. I don't know what to do anymore. Am I wrong to feel this way? Is it my fault? Is this normal and Im just overreacting?

673,"Some background about this question:

""Don't focus on just having fun in your 20's, make sure you make some good career decisions you won't regret in your 30's"" - its a popular life advice I hear alot.  And yet, I don't feel like I'm really having that much fun and excitement in my 20's, and neither is the majority of the people in my environment.

So, I'm 22 and near the end of my engineering degree.  We're the program well known for most of us being pretty introverted people, and most of our weekends is defined by playing video games at home.  Talking to some recent grads in their mid-late 20's at my co-ops, I get the general impression that everyone feels more lonely after they graduated.  People are also usually too tired after work to hang out, and its much more difficult to find a time when everyone's free to hang out.

Second observation I've made during co-op, is how difficult it is to find people the same age group as me outside of my school's events (which don't match my schedule because of co-op).  I'm not saying I won't befriend someone in their 30's or 40's, but, I don't know, it just doesn't feel the same as a friend around the same age.

Alot of my friends believe that life after graduating will be amazing.  No homework, no exams every other week.  But so far, life at work has been, well, pretty average.  I used to really love playing this online game, which I no longer do.   I'm an introvert, so I'm not really somebody who'd be into partying or clubbing, which is a popular activity here among the extroverted people.  Overall, life is not bad, and I do enjoy the occasional hangout with friends over food when we all have time, but I also don't remember the last time I had ""crazy fun/excitement"" outside of the online game I used to play.

I guess this didn't turn out as a very specific question.  When I'm 30, I'd like to look back at my 20's and say ""that was an awesome decade"", and right now, its more of ""well, its not bad I guess. Nothing super memorable, but not bad"".

So, what's everyone else's 20's like outside of engineering?  Is everyone else also finding the same things after they left college? What did you all enjoy in your 20's?

But at the same time, I also recognize that the best place to find travel friends is probably while traveling, so I guess there's a bit of conundrum there...",04Feb2019,1

1. The first time we hung out, we went out 2 hours to drive to our favorite store and she said we should get matching t-shirts of this one design, but they didn’t have her size. I was thinking of ordering 2 of them online and surprise her with it. Problem is, I don’t know her exact size. But she’s only 4’10 so I’d assume the smallest size.

2. We went out to dinner like three weeks ago and she casually mentioned this website called Squishables which are just really high quality stuffed animals. There was one she said she REALLY wanted but it was limited time and discontinued. I’ve spent forever trying to find it, but no luck. Even emailed the company and asked around reddit. 

But I did find one on the official website that I know she’d love just as much.

676,"Trigger warnings for mentions of mental illness and suicide.

TL;DR at the bottom.

I don't usually go to the internet for advice but I'm desperate.

For context, I am 19F and I used to date this girl, I broke up with her in the summer (of 2018) and she tried to emotionally manipulate me. If you'd like to know the full story, I made a post about it in r/AmITheAsshole . it's my only other post so it'll be easy to find.

After she did all that, for whatever reason I still wanted to be her friend, even though she was the one who manipulated me, I decided to just tell her what she wanted to hear and apologise. Bad idea, I know.

She accepted and agreed to be friends, we were okay for a couple weeks, some stuff had been happening and she had mentioned suicide a couple of times, then one day she suddenly sent me a goodbye message. She didn't explicitly mention suicide but since she had talked about it recently I panicked and tried to keep getting ahold of her.

I should also mention that I struggle from mental illness so since I had worried she was gone, I wanted to die too because I thought it was my fault and that I should've been there more.

A couple of weeks later, she suddenly started posting again and making vague posts about me. Trying to gaslight me again.

I'm sad and confused and I don't know what to do. A couple friends of mine assured me that I had been gaslighted into thinking I was in the wrong. And even though I've been able to come to terms with that, I have been finding it so difficult to cut her out of my life and I don't know why. There are no romantic feelings there anymore, hence why I broke up with her, but there's still something there I think, or maybe I still haven't fully accepted that I was gaslighted, maybe I still feel some kind of guilt?? Maybe I let her get inside my head too much???

What she says about me haunts me. I need her out but I don't know what to do. The more I think about her the harder it is to forget. I'm scared for my own mental health. What do I do??

TL;DR: my ex girlfriend gaslighted me into apologising to her and we became friends for a bit, she decided to stop talking to me then starting posting about me again and she's toxic for me so I need to cut her out but I'm still attached to her for some reason.",04Feb2019,1
677,"I just moved back to California after 2 years of college, halfway through pursuing a 4 yr degree. 

I've got a lot of untreated health issues that I've been putting off for 5 or 10 years. I'm only on my parent's good insurance for another year and a half. So I want to get on this ASAP. Right now this is my #1 priority, above job, car, housing, job... Though, it seems like I need those things to be productive in any real way. 

I pulled $5,000 out of a long-term savings fund to get myself settled in the next few months. But I haven't made a lot of progress toward finding housing. 

My Dad is hoping I'll find a spare room for $400/mo \*somewhere\*, anywhere. Which is unrealistic, especially in the cities I'm hoping to live in; either Long Beach or Los Angeles, CA. Since those cities have a lot of work related to my college Major. I was hoping to find something for $850/mo or less. I've reached out to a few places, and visited a few. But no luck yet.   


Today, My mom told me she and Dad have been talking. And wanted to offer to let me move back in. My Dad is switching to a job in Long Beach (my desired city) and is looking to get a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment.  I'd sleep on their spare daybed. Help with dishes, walking their two dogs. And Mom would stay at our old home to prep it for selling. 

She also said that Dad is planning to purchase a new car for the start of his job, and said I can take out a loan for $3,000 to buy their old Hyundai (Blue Blook Value $5,000) and that they'd cosign on the loan. (I already have $11,000 debt in Student Loans that I need to begin repaying in 4 months). 

So I'd have a car, short-term housing, and be able to delay my job hunt for a month or 3 while I make the medical rounds. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, it sounds like a quick, easy fix to my problems. 

But there's a catch. 

My Mom is abusive. Verbally. At times physically. She historically has asked me to do +5 hours of heavy lifting, hard labor, disgusting type work as 'normal payment' for living under her roof. She is a nasty horder; I have found both live and dead rats, feces, roaches, and all manner of nastyness around the house on a regular basis. 

Dad and I agree that she and I have a toxic, unhealthy relationship. And that we should not be living together. 

And I mean. Supposedly she and I won't be together. I'll be at the new place and she at the old. 

But given it was her who offered this deal, I'm sure she'll be a regular presence 

&amp;#x200B;

I could always buy a/their car and become a transient homeless person. But I don't think that would forward my goal of regaining my health. 

Or stay with them just for a month or two and continue working for a place of my own while I'm there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, reddit. 

I feel trapped between the lack of resources and my abusive mom's offer of help.

680,"So, last year in the third week of December, I went to town with a few friends and came back to my uni house because I live in town and no one else does, plus it’s cheaper to go to mine than to get a taxi. My best friend, who the week before this all happened called me her best friend and that’s she’s never had a good friend like me, was going home that morning so by the time we got back to mine she was leaving home for Christmas. Everyone went up to my room, there was 5 of us in total. Everyone got into my bed, so I was sleeping on the floor. 

My back started to hurt and I knew my friend was home for about a month, so I thought she wouldn’t mind if I slept in her bed, as I’ve slept in her bed before with her and because it was only me, I assumed she’d be okay with it. I was going to make her bed in the morning and tell her that I slept in it because everyone was in my room. I’d let her sleep in my bed without a second thought so I thought she’d be fine because it was only me. However, this is where I was so wrong. My other flat mate called her up, saying that everyone was in her room and going through her stuff which never happened. I answered her call and she screamed down the phone at me and said she wasn’t happy at all.

The next day I called her because I wanted things to cool off, I tried multiple times with no answer, so I decided to message as I couldn’t talk to her in person as it was Christmas break from uni and she wouldn’t be back for 2-3 weeks. I apologised and told her I know I’m in the wrong for invading her privacy and I’m sorry for disrespecting her but she ignored me for two days and then finally replied. 

She basically wasn’t happy at all with what I’d done and said I’d completely lost her trust and her as a friend. However I’ve done so much for this girl, i bought her food when she couldn’t afford it when we moved in, took her to get her nails done when she was feeling down and still had no money, in her previous house with housemates she hated I let her stay at mine 3/4 times a week just so she didn’t have to be in that house. I thought I’d found someone I was close with but every time I always seem to be replaced with someone better. 

I’ve messaged her multiple times since this, trying to arrange to apologise in person, we live together so I thought I’d see her as soon as she came back, however she was never in the house when I was and when she did she came home at 1/2 am and she wanted to go straight to bed. 

Then I get a message saying that I’ve not tried to apologise to her and that I’m 3 weeks too late and that she thought we were better friends and that she meant something to me which she does. I have tried to message her, I’ve tried to see her around the house but she’s never been in and when she has it’s early hours of the morning and I’m trying to sleep for uni the next day. 

It’s been about a month now and I still haven’t spoken to her face and every time I hear someone moving about in the house I get anxious and scared Incase it’s her because I hate confrontation.

I feel I’m trapped in a cycle and can’t get out because now I’m just scared to see her because I know she’s mad and thinks I don’t want to save the friendship when I do. I never wanted to lose her as a friend and now she’s replaced me with another girl.

Follow from this before the fight, she was getting close with another girl and they went out a lot and she didn’t really hang with me anymore. Since our fight she’s been posting indirect posts on Facebook about me about bad friends and her and the new girl went on a weekend away together. I feel like I’ve been replaced without being given a chance. When she lost my ID I forgave her straight away and wasn’t mad about it, however anything small I do is turned into a big argument and she ignores me for days and makes a big drama of it 

I’d appreciate any advice thankyou ",04Feb2019,1

684,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 23 year old man who is about to graduate college this summer with a BS in Psychology. I am married to my wife who is going to school for nursing and we have a 5 month old son. Recently, we moved back in with my parents so that we can both concentrate on school and so I can find a better paying job. At first it started off decent as my parents are getting the basement remodeled for us so we can have our own bathroom. However, my mom has acted insane as of late since I've applied to numerous law enforcement positions as a Police Officer for a local town and Correctional Officer with the BOP.  She flat out called me stupid in front of my wife and son and was shocked when I defended myself by saying I am not going to be talked down to in front of my family even if she is helping us. She plays the concerned mother card well as she has always been fine with putting me down in the past but can't take it when I stick up for myself. 

Moreover, living with my parents hasn't been an easy transition as they do not respect our privacy and constantly open the basement door to yell for simple tasks such as helping my dad with bringing supplies in, moving my car, etc. I even asked my dad politely the other day to text me when he needs something and I'll gladly take care of it ASAP. I only asked them of this because we are still training our son to sleep in the crib and by them yelling down the stairs it gets my two dogs all riled up thus waking up the baby. Of course, my dad argues with me and says he didn't know my son was sleeping and said he doesn't have to text me. I told him I understand that but everyone just opens the door or knocks really loud when they need a simple task done when they could just send a quick text. Following this, I then asked him to just talk it out with my like an adult and he said no he doesn't have to. I tried appealing to my mom but she just defended my dad by saying I don't help with common household chores even though my wife and I pay rent, do their laundry often, clean after ourselves, take the trash out and drive my disabled brother to gym when we are able to. 

This is all just extremely irritating because my parents both wanted to help us better our lives but they are just tearing it apart and it hasn't even been three months. The correctional officer job with BOP is local or in Tucson, AZ where I used to live. I am starting to learn towards moving away and cutting them out of my life as we can't take this anymore. It starts off paying $20/hr and has lots of potential to increase with yearly step increases and unlimited OT. They also offer great insurance and tuition reimbursement for further schooling as I want to get my master's. I understand the job is tough as I have previously worked in a Juvenile Detention Center and enjoyed the line of work. I also know I don't need to justify my life to my parents but it's impossible to avoid the argument when I see them everyday and they bring it up. They both act like I'm a failure and tell my I'm stupid for wanting a LEO career because I WILL die. 

So, I guess what I'm asking is for advice on what I should do. My wife doesn't graduate for another two years and moving out of state would force her to find another program that would take her credits and is affordable. I don't want to do that to her but staying here is not happening and we both agreed it's toxic for our relationship and for my son since he sees my parents belittling me so much. ",04Feb2019,1
685," As the title says, someone passed me a link of an horrible snuff movie, probably from the so called Dark Web, where a woman get tortured, raped and killed (and even raped after death!). As far as I can tell, it's 100% real. No actors involved.

I got shocked and even though it's been days I can't stop thinking about that freaking video.

Both the victim and the raper are pretty clear and visible in the camera, so I wonder if I can do anything about it. It's likely the killer has already been caught, but I cannot sleep well until I'm totally sure he's paying for what he did.

Is there any way to discover if the killer is in jail or anything? I know how odd this request might sounds, but trust me that seeing that movie is so painful that you can't just ignore it.",04Feb2019,1

687,"I wrote this incredibly embarrassing email to an old co-worker explaining my reasons for something, as it turns out, no one cared about. I thought I was among good company, so allowed myself to be vulnerable and pathetic only to be met with silence. For someone that called me friend countless times, looks like I was always alone there. If it was just disappointment, that's one thing, but the entire tone of my letter reeked of desperation for understanding because I thought they were important enough to feel for. In hindsight, it could be interpreted as an attempt to get my old job back, which kills me on the inside. Below is some of what I said that I can no longer think of without wanting to throw up for lack of self-respect:

*""Was I the only one to feel like there was a real connection there?""*

*I don't mind looking pathetic for you three to remember me as I was, and not the worst of what you might think.*

This was sent a month and a half after events took place. Far beyond the time frame for any of them to care. It was also sent with the assumption this person would assist me, as I was enlisting his aid to speak to two others to explain what really happened on my behalf. It sounds like a sad letter to an ex for a relationship you're just not over. I don't think I've ever been this embarrassed in my entire life, but I wrote it because they're important to me. Because I thought clearing up a misunderstanding was absolutely necessary. Even if I'll never see them again, I don't want to be remembered poorly. 

Made three attempts to explain with no reply (A letter, an email + a phone call), and before actually deciding to contact them worried myself half to death wondering what they thought of me. Now I know. I'm being deliberately ignored.

701,"Hello,
To start of, i think we’re a happy family.
My parents achieved a lot (mom a little more than dad (her job is her hobby)). We don’t lack money so we’re safe on that part. But we don’t have it so much that we could just buy anything that comes to our minds.

A little bit about me:
In gymnasium, i was often bullied by teachers (who hid it extremely well, although all my classmates knew what was going on, we couldn’t do anything until a point where i was about to get expelled). As you can imagine, that caused a lot of issues in my family (trust issues, they thought i was lying, cheating etc...). After that, i got hit with extreme anxiety, depression and panic disorder. In the end (a week before i left gymnasium), they admitted to bullying me and some of them apologised. But that did not cure my mental illnesses. Fuck those fuckers.

My escape was programming. But since of the issues listed above, my parents never believed i was actually programming and not playing games. That caused even more friction in our family.

When it all got together, our family was probably on the verge of splitting up, i was on the edge of ending my life. Never did it because i felt bad for my parents.

Now as i got into uni, i was contacted by multiple teachers from uni, that university would like to hire me, that i’m an extremely good coder (not bragging, just telling the story like it happened). Now that is the ONLY thing that made my parents a little happier. They are only satisfied with my good grades, causing me to stress a lot, since i’m not a perfect student.

Now i always worry how to make my parents happier and that is also what is killing me on the inside. I think.

But what i am wondering is:
1. What can i do, to find a hobby (for them) / anything that would make my parents (dad especially) happier?

2. How can i make myself happier and stop stressing about every. Little. Thing...

3.  I’d just like to thank all and every one of you, that reads, replies or upvotes my post.

If you have got any questions regarding me, my past or whatever, shoot.

I talked to my ex about her cold shoulder and she apologized and sort of warmed up to her.
