0,"I'm a teenage girl and my friend group is made up of me, my brother, and 2 other guys. We all are into our different music tastes, but we rarely talk about them. All my friends know is that I love My Chemical Romance and the Jonas Brothers. Ever since the Jonas Brothers announced their reunion, it's all I've been talking about. I mean, I've loved JB since I was little. My guy friends (and my brother) keep teasing me about my crush on Joe Jonas and how I talk about the Jonas Brothers all the time. I know they aren't annoyed with me, and I'm not offended because it's friendly teasing, but how do I stop talking about them so much?",24Mar2019,1
1," So I (22, F) went to a concert and there weren't many people there and there was a band I really like, and the lead singer (26, M)was cute. He smiled at me several times and I Smiled back. After they were done I gave him my number and he looked surprised and he was like ""Thanks, love"" and he said it several times. calling someone love in my language can mean one of two things: a)you like them, obviously. b)its similar to when a grandmother calls you dear, hahah, like you would say it to someone who is much younger, and I look a bit young for my age

the impression I got was that he was like ""oops, I might have taken it too far"", maybe he has a gf or something, I'm not sure. what do you guys think? will he call or ignore?",24Mar2019,0
2,"     Hello, im in high school and an unknown person has been spreading rumors about me, i can tell from which friend group it started from, but i dont know who started it spesifically or if it evovled into the rumor that is now through multiple people as it spread. 
     The rumor is that i had a huge crush on Person A in 9th grade, i begged her to date me, she said no, and i cut myself because of it.now, i actually do have self harm scars, but they are because of depression and anxiety. this Person A they're talking about, i only became friends with her in 10th grade, never was interested in her, had nothing to do with her before. 
     Where the rumor spreading from is a friend's birthday party ( a small party of like 8 people) in 11th grade, where Person A also was. i was blackout drunk, because i had just discovered drinking, unlike everyone else at the party who had a couple years of experience. because i was very new to it, i didnt know how my body reacted, how much is too much or how to handle being drunk. i annoyed people there, i cried a lot,accidentally said a mean comment to Person B,that was mean because i said it with the wrong tone etc. at this point i was struggling with my sexuality( im a bi girl) so i asked Person A, who was also drunk, to kiss me. it wasnt like actual kissing it was just a peck on the lips. and i asked it one more time and we kissed (just a peck) again. and the third time i asked it she didnt want to so i stopped. when i was asking her to kiss me, i said like teach me how to make out etc., but again i didnt do anything without her consent.
     In the morning( because we stayed over) i deeply apologised to everyone and i apologised a couple days later at school too, our friendship ended, i was extremely embarrassed and my already existent depression and anxiety got much worse. i did not blame them at all, i was the one being weird, its %100 on me. i heard this rumor in 12th grade which is rn. i looked into it to find who started it but it was a dead end. Person B, girl i accidentally told a mean comment to which was ""they announced who got in and who didnt to the school club (she didnt know) i got in and you didnt"". Person B wanted to get into that school club because her boyfriend was in. i didnt mean to be rude, i was just informing her but it came out wrong. Person B cried a lot and went home instead of staying over. i called her on the phone in the morning to apologise to her too ofc. Person B is known to hold grudges and being mean so im suspecting she had a role in this rumor but idk.
     I took a break from school this year, im going to start 12th grade again next year, not because of this rumor (i heard it after i froze my education) but because of my mental health, so im not at school to experience the effects of the rumour but there is a 13th grade in my school so next year im still gonna be in school with these people and the grade that knows this rumour. im for sure going to run in to them because i have friends from that grade that i will visit during break time. 
     I am EXTREMELY embarrassed. because of my severe ocd and obsessive thoughts that come with it, ive been losing my mind over this rumor, cant stop thinking about it, cant stop thinking about how much im regretting my scars (regretting is one of the biggest triggers of my anxiety). i dont know what to do. please please give me advice. 


     I know this is very long so thank you a lot for reading and responding to it. it means a lot to me.

     tl dr: some unknown person started a very embarrassing rumor about me at school. because of my depression, anxiety and ocd, im obsessing over it and losing my mind. please help me. thank you.",24Mar2019,0

I honestly find it very hard to believe someone would be as interested in me as I am of them. I suppose I’m not looking for advice necessarily, I’ve heard it all. I’ve implemented a lot of the typical advice, and plan to implement more in the future. Someone once told me “be someone worth having”, that’s kind of been my compass in this whole endeavour. That being said, has anyone been in my situation and ended up finding a SO? How did you meet? How long did it take? I could use some reassurance that it’s not hopeless.",24Mar2019,2

6,"Hi everyone. Like the title says I’m 90% sure I have major depression. This has caused me to not be able to hold a job, and it’s not for lack of trying either. I’ve interviewed and been hired at 13 jobs in the past year and a half and ended up quitting all of them because I could bring myself to go in one random morning. I’ve been doing Lyft and flipping items on eBay just to barely scrape by on rent and bills. I dropped out of college with only 24 credits left till graduation. I’m 22 and completely isolated a part from my mother, brother and boyfriend. And they’re all in worse financial situations then I am. 

Lately I’ve even had trouble doing that. Today I slept from 3am to 6:30 pm.  It’s been that way for over a week. When I am awake I binge eat. I have major anxiety and dark thoughts.

I don’t want to live this way anymore. I have potential. I’m a smart person. I grew up in an emotionally abusive home which I’m sure has something to do with. I can’t hold a job so how can I afford therapy or how can I get on assisted income when on paper I just look like a failure and a total loser and quitter? I’m afraid of the future. I think I’ve been in denial up until now. No matter how hard I try I can’t get out of this state. Reddit if you have advice please help me out, I am lost. ",24Mar2019,2
7,"Throwaway because I feel this could be pointless and maybe I'm overthinking it. 
So, I walk about 2 miles everday to town to skate there. I was walking back home when this old guy, about 50-60, in a super beat up car stops and asks me if I needed a ride. I said no and he drove off, simple as that. The thing is, I'm 15 years old and this is an old ass man asking me if I want a ride. I probably look a little older as I am 6'2 but this was still super weird to me. I know I am probably overthinking it but I just need to hear something reassuring. Could this guy have had bad intentions? I wasn't even really scared at the time, more mad than anything that he could find it acceptable to ask that to a 15 year old. But yeah, I just wanna know if it isn't even a big deal and I'm thinking too much of it. ",24Mar2019,2

9,"I think I'm being unfair with myself when deciding on purchasing my first property. Note: I've decided that I rather not rent, especially in a city where rent prices are about the same as a mortgage. I'm 26 years old and I've saved up enough for a 20% down-payment on my own property. I make enough money to live comfortably in either a condo or a home. 

I'm currently living at home with my parents in the suburbs. I was dead set on purchasing a condo in the city to be closer to my job and my friends. However when messing around with the Trulia/Redfin app, I noticed that these big beautiful homes in the suburbs around me cost about the same as a 1-2 bedroom condo in the city. I fell in love with the pictures of all these bigger rooms, living rooms, kitchens, and even the thought of having my own yard. I also feel like it's maybe a smarter investment for what I'm willing to shell out for a smaller piece of property with almost all the restrictions of renting, i.e, having other tenants/owners in the building, limiting my noise, etc. 

The only ""issue"" (I feel embarrassed to say this) is that I feel like I'll be sacrificing my social life with my friends. My commute to the city for work is about 1-1.5 hours one way via train, so lately I've had less energy to make that same trip on my days off where it can take up to 2 hours [driving] just to meet up with them. My friend group is really active and social within the city, so every weekend I feel pressured to do something in the city with them otherwise I'll be missing out. Lately I've ""only"" been hanging out with them maybe one weekend a month, which is enough for them to pester me about moving in the city. In my 2 years living back home, none of them have ever bothered to come down and hang out around me, and to an extent I don't blame them since few of them have cars. 

On one end, I feel like I should enjoy my mid-20's and the single social life in the city. It's not like that's impossible to accomplish in the suburbs, I just don't know anyone out here. On the other end, I'm really starting to enjoy the thoughts of owning my own, big home and the freedom that comes with it. 

Thoughts? Have any of you ever been in this situation? ",24Mar2019,2

okay. here goes.

I'm in my second year of college away from home and I've made a new group of friends.It's a mixed group of guys and girls which is great and I really enjoy hanging out with them. I'm really close with two girls in particular, which is great :)

The trouble started at a night out. I kinda liked this guy in the group and we got together. We just kissed on the dancefloor after a lot of beers and then I had to leave early to make curfew.(strict parents, don't ask)

The next day he asked me to hang out with him. I said sure, and we planned for Monday. I still find him cute and we've been texting and he's interesting, but I just don't want a boyfriend right now, and I'm afraid ive given him the wrong impression.

We've only talked for less than a week, slightly flirty, but mostly current affairs. 

I'm under so much pressure, at least I feel like I am. I feel like if I break things off, the whole group will turn against me. And I can't talk to my new girl friends  because they were friends with him first and so will be on his side. I feel like I can talk to no one. 

I don't know what to do :( ",24Mar2019,1
11,"I don’t know what happened. I am in a very happy relationship with my boyfriend. I never found an attraction to other people although I’ve heard others say they do. I never thought I would find anyone else interesting enough to like in that way, but this friend of mine I actually haven’t talked to in a very long time ( couple of months)  nor have I seen him in person in over a year. 

Let’s call this guy Mark. I ran into Mark while shopping at his workplace. We chatted for a little and that was all. But ever since then I couldn’t stop thinking about him for some reason. And I started having thoughts of me and him being in a relationship. 

I don’t know if it’s because me and him have a different relationship with each other than any other person I know. See me and my boyfriend had broken up for about three months. I was heartbroken and completely lost. I had the support of so many friends but Mark was one that stood out. He helped me tremendously we stayed on the phone for hours talking to each other and he helped me get through the sadness. He made me happy in such a dark time in my life. 

I started to feel something for him but I didn’t think we could date just because he was too immature. Anyways. He was important to me and i liked spending time with him when me and my boyfriend weren’t together. 

Me and Mark slept together one night just for fun. And I don’t know if it’s because we’ve gotten so intimate with each other that, now that I’ve seen him recently those feelings came back ? 

I’m so confused about what’s going on with me. I almost feel like I should have gotten together with other people before I settled down with my boyfriend again. I for some reason want a relationship with this friend and I don’t know why. I am happy with my boyfriend and I love him very much. But thinking about being with another guy feels wrong .. . 

What do I do .. has anyone gone through a situation like this. I almost want to tell my boyfriend but I know he won’t take it the right way. I want to talk about it with this friend too but It’s not appropriate because it’s been so long we haven’t talked. 

I hope this all makes sense this has been on my mind and I’ve been very confused about this and how to deal with It. Please ask any questions on things that don’t make much sense. Sorry if it doesn’t 😓

TLDR; I’m having weird feelings over a friend of mine who was very supportive during a breakup of mine, and became an important person to me. I had developed feelings for him during that time, we also had a one night stand. I don’t know what’s going on. Or what to do. I’m in a committed and happy relationship. ",24Mar2019,2
12,"I'm not someone to post an awful lot but I feel like I'm at a stage where I need some life advice from anyone and everyone. I'm a college/university student doing business studies and I work part time in a coffee shop and although I do enjoy studying and working I feel like I am at a point in my life where I'm not achieving anything and everyday is just the same old routine. I feel like my head is in this grey cloudy space where I can't see where my life is heading which I know is crazy because I'm still only 20 years old (21 in May). 

&amp;#x200B;

I really am struggling to see the point in what I do because sometimes I feel I only study because everyone that I went to school with went to college when what I really want to be doing are the things I love, but then again I know it'll help me get a job. I know every day can't be rosey all the time but I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Is thats ok? I mean I don't know what career I want to go down, I wish I could find a career in the things that i love (music, fashion, football/soccer) but I don't know how to get into these industries, I don't know if I want to get in a relationship/get married in future because I have seen my parents marriage fall apart and my first girlfriend who I loved so much at the time left me wishing the space of 4 months. I guess you could say that since this I haven't really felt the same since my break up and my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am really struggling to find a sense of direction with my life and I know that there will be some of you out there who have felt something like this and all I am asking is that you help me, please.

13,"I’m 19 now, in my first year of university and am pretty hopeless when it comes to girls. Between the age of 16-18 I blew 4 obvious opportunities.

Used to talk to one girl a lot over the summer when I was 16. She was my prom date, suggested we should meet up I said sure, apparently was hesitant. Kept talking for a while eventually lost touch. Met again with this girl when I was 17 when she admitted she’d liked me ever since.

After that I got with a girl when I’d just turned 17. But looking back on it she asked for my number, I didn’t even get the hint because I thought she was a lesbian due to miscommunication. 

Later that year me and this other girl had a thing, talked a lot and went on a date. After the date she turned cold. Her friend told me I should have “ kissed her”, pussied out of it at the time. 

I then had a crush on a girl that lasted my entire last year of high school, during that period I missed opportunities from one girl when I was 18 ( this time it was out of choice though) and a girl at prom who literally asked me to dance with her but I rejected because I was too tunnel visioned on my crush. 

Later last year the same crush tried to arrange for us to get together twice, I was ill and had to cancel both occasions. Haven’t talked much since. 

I pretty much always choke when it comes to these situations and am horrible at picking up signs. It’s pretty hopeless at this point.

She even buys things she needs online and uses that Walmart pick up service but she sends her husband to pick her things up for her, she won’t even get those herself. She told me a few days ago that she is nearing a mental breakdown and I tried to convince her to speak to her doctor or to seek therapy but 2 texts later she will tell me she’s fine, not to worry. She tries to have decent relationships with her kids but it’s hard when she’s an anxious woman who is a little mentally incompetent. To be fair she was raped 12-13 years ago or so and I don’t think she’s ever fully recovered, she still talks about sleepless nights and dreams she has of him coming for her to kill her as he said he would when he gets out of prison, in 2-3 years or so.

I live with my 2 best friends (in a house with 7 other friends) and I don’t know how to tell them. I haven’t ever told them about the trauma. It doesn’t help that I am full of guilt and shame and humiliation about my depression and general life. I feel so stupid and disgusting for being so weak and sensitive. I feel that I’m not entitled to feel what I do. I feel like I’m a waste of space, and an inconvenience for people to be around. So why would I burden my friends by opening up? Especially now, after I’ve already repressed it for this long. They would probably be hurt to know I hid it from them. I can’t bring myself to say it out loud, we’re such a happy group of friends and I know it would shock and upset them to know how I’ve been feeling. I’m pretty good at hiding myself from everyone, including my family. I want to tell my best friends because I know that I’m getting worse and need their support, but I don’t know how to start.

17," My grandpa suffers from dementia.

Lately it happens more and more often that he doesn't come back from a walk and gets lost for several hours. I love my grandparents and it is very hard to see how the once always good-humoured grandpa often forgets who his closest relatives are. My grandma is still trying desperately to deal with it alone and does not want to accept help from outside.

What makes it worse is the fact that we're three hours apart. My dad has to work a lot and tries to go there as often as possible on weekends, but he doesn't always make it. He makes a very depressed impression, understandably.

My Mum and I don't know what we can do. We try to relieve him of as much work as possible. What else can we do to make this time a little easier for my dad?

To distract myself from this shitty situation I often stay longer at work and sit more often at the computer and play games with friends.

Just the thought that I'm standing in front of my grandpa and he doesn't recognize me kills me. Apart from the fact that he has to leave us sometime. I don't know what I can do, my grandmother and dad suffer so much from it and I don't want to burden them with the fact that it's a very hard time for me as well.

20,"I’ll try and keep it short. Basically my boyfriends parents are having a tough time (his mum has mentioned a divorce previously and again in current situation) and he wants to keep that part private but I can tell it’s breaking him and I’m worried.


He’s an only child so from my perspective it just seems like he’s got a lot on his shoulders. His mum wanted a weekend away on her own and asked him to drive her to his cousins house (they were away on holiday so empty house) and his mum has had a lot of health trouble, she’s had multiple surgeries on her back.  So worrying. 

But his mum has told him to not tell his dad that he knows where she is. To lie basically, and, I don’t know what to do because when I went round his house before and had a chat with his dad on his own and he was quite upset and wished he could be closer with his son and how other things like work was really getting him down. 

I didn’t tell my boyfriend about the chat because his dad said not to but I did suggest perhaps spending time with him so they can get closer and he completely shut it down he was like “not gonna happen, unless he changes the way he is” 

I do know him and his mum don’t like his dad drinking, but in the conversation I had with his dad we both came to the conclusion it was like a routine he has got himself into because he doesn’t do anything that makes him happy anymore ( he works DREADFUL HOURS leaves the house at 4am gets home at 8pm most times) so I do have sympathy for him in that way, he feels left out which is so clear. My boyfriend and his mum are very close. 

When divorce got brought up before he opened up to me about his dads “drinking problem” and I suggested him to do something together that his dad likes to do and they went fishing and they both were so happy they loved it. 

I sometimes feel like as much as I want to spend time with my boyfriend I feel guilty and feel like he should be spending this time with his dad. I don’t know what to do. 

I have dealt with domestics in my personal life and he’s promised me it’s nothing like that. I just don’t know what to do to help because I do get it and respect his decision of wanting to keep it private but he normally talks to me or his mum about things and he’s said he can’t talk to her about it for obvious reasons. I’m just worried about his mental health and how being put in the middle would affect him if his parents aren’t able to resolve this issue. 

Will probably delete this soon because I don’t want to change him seeing this. ",24Mar2019,1
21,"So this is the last thread I’m making because I feel that people are deliberately ignoring me.

Anyway, so before I go in, I’ll just say that I have a diagnosis of Aspergers (don’t treat me any different as anyone else). This is as far as I am concerned primarily the cause of my issues.

So, I struggle with a few things that are affecting me lately: 
1- making decisions
2- being lonely
3- people avoiding interacting with me because they don’t know how to deal with my condition.

3 is self explanatory. I’ll jump into 2. I live alone in a studio apartment, in a city far from home. I have one “friend” here who I go out with once a week. I have tried to get this “friend” to go out more than once a week but no go.

I really struggle to deal with loneliness. I find myself leaving my apartment for stupid reasons to get away from being there, alone. So like to the gym or into the town to walk around the shops. The problem I have is that I don’t know how to properly fill my time outside work. Because as I said I usually do random things to fill my time with for the sake of it, not because I enjoy it?

This has been depressing me lately because I feel that most young people don’t really have this problem. Like they have people to go out with? I have like one person to go out with, who will only go out once a week and isn’t interested in visiting me or talking.

So, I’m basically very lonely and don’t have any way to fill it.

What is annoying me is that I feel that I’m making a lot of effort and that no one respects me enough to respond back or even really cares. I have had several acquaintances at this university and most of them peter out after a few months (due to me getting fed up of inviting them out).

I just get the impression that most people don’t hate me, but are indifferent to me, and no matter how much effort I put in, I get little back. Most people live with others here and can’t be bothered making the effort with me, because they don’t need to.

Sometimes I feel insecure about this, like there’s something wrong with me and unlikable about me that people would be this way towards me? It is quite obvious that I get lonely with the invites etc that I put out.

I don’t know how to process all of this? Am I living life correctly with my condition or should I just stop bothering with people who don’t care about me?

What about feeling lonely and doing things out of boredom? What is the right way to approach that? Stop?",24Mar2019,1
22,"Recently my step father decided to get a new hunting dog, we don't own it yet because they get raffled off in like 6 weeks BUT we will be getting one. It's going to be a **german shorthaired pointer**. Normally as the kid you would be happy but I am the opposite. We already own 2 dogs both of which are rat terriers, and 2 cats that stay in our basement. I already have a decent amount of responsibility when it comes to taking care of animals and I don't think I am ready for another one.

24,"So I (22f)  have a situation that I’ve been going back and forth with. 

I’ve had a best friend since elementary school (22f). We are no longer friends because of reasons not important to this situation. She got with a guy [23m] I really liked, and he really liked me but she told me she really liked him so I let her go for it. Wasn’t wanting a relationship at the time. But after spending 3 years with them I fell for him so hard. Our chemistry was undeniable. But neither of us would ever act on it because we are very loyal people. They ended up having a child that passed away at an early age and they split up. She is now in a happy relationship with someone else. I now have a baby with someone who is a half interested. 

Should I leave the one I know is wrong for me and pursue a relationship with the one my soul connects with so easily? Or would that cross too many lines? He was an amazing father &amp; I know he would treat me and my baby like royalty. Something that I am extremely lacking in my current relationship. ",24Mar2019,1

They’d added glass cases to various areas of the store, rearranged the store so many departments are stand alone with a register in each department, more security presence etc. It’s not a super ghetto or hard up neighborhood by any means. Theft in other stores is not above any normal amount. 
Today this local woman posts in a Facebook community group about a weekly yard sale she does at her home. Her pic were advertising all new products.

33,"The past 3 years have been and roller coaster of events. I'm a 30 year old female. I'm married with one child. Three years ago my husband lost his job. We struggled and fought and come out of a financial crisis.We lost our car in the process and ruined our credit but we was building our way back up. Two months ago my husband lost his job due to his boss getting mad at him. He accused him of ruining equipment and was going to make up pay thousands to fix it. My husband didn't do anything so when he asked for proof and the witness statements his boss got mad a fired him. My husband did all he could to keep the job but everyone was on his bosses side. 

My husband soon regained employment but he has yet to start. It's been over a month. We was able to make a small savings but now it's all gone. I'm struggling to feed my family and we will soon have our power shut off and be homeless. We messaged people at his new job today asking when a start date will be and they told us everything should be done this week but here's the problem we will have no money to get him to work. This job will require him to be gone two weeks at a time so once he starts he will have to be gone for two weeks. How am I going to make this work? None of us will have food and my daughter and I will be without a place to live. I'm already eating crackers and ketchup just to have something to eat TBH though, its really tasty Lol. We are limited on food and I'm saving the better food for my daughter. I've went to our local government assistance location but since my husband is employed we aren't eligible for any assistance. I'm already on a payment plan with out power company that I've been keeping up on but since we are on a plan, they can't help us any further. My daughter and I can't stay with my father because he lives hours away and I can't pull my daughter out of school for that long. My mother is less then a mother. She is actually enjoying my suffering. She is a narcissists and her husband my ( step-father) molested me when I was younger. She blamed me for it and hates me more now then she used to. She is still with my step-father. He also got caught peeking into the bathroom while my sister was getting dressed. She still stayed with him but actually blamed him for that one. She moved us to a farm area when I was 15 and I'm still here. Nothing is around and there is no public transport. 

I have some major mental issues due to my past and I'm currently taking meds for it but now that I've ran out my mind is a mess. I used to consider suicide but always fought threw it. Now I wonder if I was supposed to commit suicide and that's why my life is such a mess now. My chest hurts and I spent days trying to figure out what to do but I can't see any options here. I figure my emotional state is blocking out any reasonable  options and I'm hoping a set of fresh eyes could maybe see something I'm not. I have no friends and my husband just shuts down. Had I known it would take this long I would of gotten a waitress job but I had no idea it would take this long for him to start. He will have the car while hes at work so I will be without transportation to get to a job to help out and with things being far away and no public transport I'm stuck here, in my house. I just need some advice on how to get threw this, if you can see a route please let me know.

34,"Hello, I apologize if I’m posting this question in the wrong subreddit. This is something that has been on my mind a good bit for the past several months. As a new user on Reddit that has had fairly good luck with receiving logical answers to previous inquiries, I thought I’d try my luck here too. 
I was in a long-distance relationship for about four months, but had been interacting with this person for at least seven months total. My ex claimed to break up with me simply because they did not think it would be practical to continue on with the relationship (which is completely understandable; I am a senior in high school and am therefore unable to travel alone, and my ex had a rather busy life as well). I was civil and polite despite receiving the shorter end of the stick and we stopped communicating from there, despite not having any hard feelings against one another (at least on my end, anyway). This occurred late last year. I found it rather odd that, despite the lack of communication as well as the breakup itself, this person continues to be very active on my social media. Their activity on my page has not waned despite the lack of communication for nearly half a year. They have consistently liked all of my posts with both of their accounts (and are often the first to do so), watch every single one of my stories (although that does not bear much significance alone as flipping through stories is rather commonplace), interact with my music suggestion boxes/polls on my stories every time, continue to follow my friends (despite never having met them) and like their posts despite the fact that most of them unfollowed my ex, as well as follow any new accounts that I happen to create on a whim. I have also caught this person stalking me at least five times. They also like comments I have left in response to other people’s comments on my spam page. My ex continued to do all of this, even though I never interact with their pages whatsoever. It doesn’t bother me that my ex is active on my page, in fact it does not provoke any emotions at all rather than simple curiosity. I know I may seem hyper-vigilant, but it is impossible for me not to notice as this has been happening for nearly half a year. As someone that’s over-analytical, I’m probably overthinking it. However, I would appreciate any insight as to why this person may be acting this way. Additionally, immediately after they had broken up with me, they asked if I was to remain in [insert state here] “forever.” That struck me as rather odd. Additionally, I supposed they would have removed me from their social media accounts by now or at least stop having so much contact with my page, but it has been quite the opposite. 
Thank you for reading. I apologize for the exhausting amount of information. ",24Mar2019,1

39,"I don't know where to begin. I'm a young adult and midway through college, but took this semester off due to overwhelming depression and loss of motivation. I've been unemployed since I was a teen and now without school I have absolutely no structure or responsibilities. The most I do now is cleaning which helps keep me sane and gives me something to focus on.

This wasn't meant to be about me, but my whole family. The main focus is my brother, who makes us all uncomfortable with the way he acts. He's suspicious and hides a lot from us, but he confessed recently that he has schizophrenia. That was a bombshell, but my family hasn't spoken about it openly.

It's gotten to a breaking point and I feel like I'm going insane. My family never talked about emotions growing up, and still doesn't. There is a massive elephant in the room with my brother's health conditions that no one is willing to discuss. Whenever I see my family, I don't really know what to talk about with them, and the hardest thing for me to admit is that some days I'd rather stay in my room on the PC. 

I've resolved that I will go back to college no matter how stressful or how much anxiety it causes me, because it gives me an escape from this torment. The easiest way to describe this is I don't feel comfortable at home. My family is not there. We all live in our own separate bubbles and rarely interact. I live with my family but I feel more alone than ever. I know that my situation can't last forever, and I am scared for the future.

I am close to my extended family and love to do things with them, it's one of the only things that brings me happiness now. But I have come to a point where not having anything to do isn't bearable. As foreign as it once was to me, I actually want to work and go to school, have friends and hobbies. My anxiety is holding me back and I am stuck in this vicious cycle.",24Mar2019,2
40,"Hi Everyone, 

Excuse me if this isn't the correct place to post. I would like your opinion on this... My ex best friend past away 6 months ago- today was her birthday. There was a cake and everything at the cemetery (birthday memorial is a thing I guess). Typically, I keep to myself and am not an outwardly emotional person/ care for anyones attention..just thought I would put that out there. 

As I arrived to the memorial, some people are there already and by her gravestone, praying and shedding some tears. I sit with them but don't cry. An hour or so later, after the cake was disbursed, I just started hysterically crying for two seconds and pulled myself together. Please note the girl that passed was a very big part of my life. The purpose I think of the memorial was so that the family would not endure it alone, maybe share some memories, and have a few laughs. Well, I could not help myself apparently as I was talking to her mother, and started uncontrollably crying again. Talking to her mother did something for me. Her mother kept asking me what the matter was, and if I was going through something, or was mentally perturbed. I thought this was really weird, and maybe I misunderstood her. Then as we were leaving I overheard her reply back to someone 'Its ok. People are going through their own problems, and mental issues.' It just left a weird feeling with me. The family all seemed numb, like everything was ok. She died in her early 20s, had a promising future, and was larger than life. I remember her telling me she isn't close to her family emotionally, and some other things... I think its religiously a cultural thing- although i'm from the same background (Muslim). Any thoughts would be appreciated. Why would her mom just assume i'm going through something personally?

44,"Hi. 
This is going to be a long post.

I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in an engineering course in a foreign country. I live in a students' house, on rent and I try to be financially independent by also working.

Having to afford all education and living costs on my own has caused difficulty on focusing on my studies, leading onto me not passing some exams, ect because of stress, anxiety and lack of time.

Since the very beginning, I am talking about the age of two or three, I have proven to have somehow of a decent talent in drawing, especially people/animals/creatures. 

There was a point in my life where I made a living out of my digital &amp; traditional art, doing freelance stuff here and there while also working for a company; all of this at age 19. I loved it. I was so in peace with myself; doing something I was good at with immense pleasure. 

When I decided to start engineering, I quit my job and moved to a new country.
In only six months, art became something so irrevelant that would only come up if a room mate or a friend saw a doodle or a piece of art through my papers.

I met a girl, who, amazed by my art, offered to manage several social media accounts where she would show off my work and get me as many clients as possible  just for a little percentage of what I would earn.
She gifted me a drawing tablet for my birthday and introduced me to friends who were interns at a very prestige art academy in the country I live in.

I went there on an open day, talked with the students, teachers. They saw my artist portofolio, asked about my interests and suggested a course; Character Concept Art for videogames.
All good right? I could easily do this!

Well, no. My residency permit does not allow me to attend two different schools at once, and the costs of them both would go up to 3000€ a year, making it impossible for my living as my current wage is near 4800 yearly, 2500 of those going only to rent.

I am honestly shattered as I really liked the academy and art is everything I've wanted to do ever since I was a baby, but I am also in fear.

The engineering field I'm in will get me a decent job surely, but what are my chances with concept art? I'd have to be really talented for videogame companies to hire me.
This is a very difficult choice as my future depends on it.

Am I unrealistic with my art dreams? Should I stick to my degree for a better living? Please give me your advice and be honest. Thank you.

So these past few weeks, I've been struggling with myself a lot. I'm actually in college and I've realized that it's really hard for me to be in college. In general, I'm a lazy person and it is affecting my scholarity. I've passed my entire high school without doing much efforts/homeworks and now I can't really do this. The thing is that I want to pass college, but I know that there is no easy road and just thinking of that makes me feel like I want to drop out. Also, I've started to ask myself a lot of question and I just don't know what I want in my life. I want to succeed, I want to change, but it seems I just can't. Recently, I want more and more to skip classes because I can't motivate myself to go to school and it scares me because I don't want to fail. 

At this point, I just don't know what to do. I feel like I've lost my motivation and my will.

50,"I wasn’t quite sure what to put as the title to be honest. But let me share my tale. A couple of weeks ago I told my wife I wanted a divorce. Her an I have been married for just shy of a year. We’ve been together for 4. Let me explain the history...

I’ve been in a verbal and mentally abusive relationship with this woman. I’m a very accepting, loving, and easy going person who loves to see others happy and who loves life and loves helping others. That’s how I would describe myself and did before I met her. The relationship started out just fine, and just like any normal relationship, we hit it off really well. However a few months into the relationship her true colors began to slip through the cracks of her cover up. She began to get explosive, and demanding. She began to get nasty and selfish and would spin anything into her favor or any situation into one that suited her. It was her way or the verbal Highway with anyone she came across including her parents. She’s an only child, and all she has to do is open her mouth and her parents eventually give her whatever it is she’s asking for. Her own mother told me that during the first few months of our relationship when she was calm and collected and nice, that it was all an extreme rarity in her personality. That she’s never been that way and that she’s always been this negative outbursting and outspoken individual. Moving on, I had fallen in love with her and I began to slump into a state of acceptance. I would take the verbal lashings and rude remarks, I would take the negativity and the attitudes and just absorb it all. I would never raise my voice back or never argue at all. In time I became this yo-yo of sorts. Something she would blow up on in random moments, blast on Facebook and to friends, and talk about at work. Then she would pull the yo-yo back up and repeat it all again sometime soon after.

This would continue and people would warn me or ask me if I knew what I was doing. I wouldn’t listen and I turned blind to it all. It became life. I would enjoy the short bursts of peace and happiness and absorb all of that crud and wait for a better moment. I was always forgiving it an excusing it. Some of the relationships I had with family members were destroyed and some of my friendships were destroyed as they couldn’t bare to witness the stuff I was putting up with.

I eventually proposed to her. The following day she caused a scene in public infront of a hundred or so people and insulted me, screamed at me once more, and told me I wasn’t ready for her or worthy of her and that she was giving the ring back. Like a blind fool I cried and begged her to stop and take me back. This wouldn’t be the only public outburst where she quickly threw the ring at me either. There was even one incident where her cellphone died in the mall and she screamed out loud over it and told me she would rather have her cellphone then me and would always pick it over me. Once more, I stayed and ignored it all..

Fast forwards ahead, countless outbursts against me and family members continued, and the wedding talk kicked full swing. She demanded for a wedding in an old “castle”. I would have 0 say in it and any slight input I would have would result in me being tormented more or threatened more. So I just remained quiet. Her mother would always rush to her side and do what she could to stick up for and make her daughter happy. The wedding was nearly $10,000. I would go to her mother and tell her that I’m being hurt, that it all hurt so bad. That I wish she was like she was during those first few months. Her mother and some of her friends had brought up therapy to her a handful of times, and I did as well. She wasn’t very fond of that. So the wedding came and she completely went off the deep end the night before on me once more. Throwing everything in the living room. Literally throwing. Screaming at me and telling me how much I had annoyed her and how she isn’t going to marry me and how it was all such a mistake. I cried and broke down once again and once more I pleaded and begged. I went through with the wedding, still not fully “awake” and hoping for the best after the stressful day had passed. For a few days after there was an amazing level of peace. Then at the end of the honeymoon it went back to the way it was. 

Here we are 9 months after that. I finally fully woke up. My mind has been replaying everything over and over and I’m sickened by just how much I tolerated. I’m upset with myself as well for allowing myself to go through all of this. Because I loved her. But the love I had is gone and destroyed. I told her two weeks ago I was going to divorce her and I told her i couldn’t handle anymore of the abuse. She begged me this time to stay, and I told her no. I told her that before her I had such a happy outlook on life. I had this inner light that shone brightly all around me and that the way she had treated me and broke me down destroyed it. That my feelings for her will never match the feelings I had during those first months and that she’s dealt way too much damage to me.

Now I’m being guilted and talked about on social media, as well as behind my back in public to her friends. She’s stringing together fake stories and painting a picture that makes her seem so kind and innocent and that I’m a monster for wanting a divorce. These people online that weren’t around us, or don’t fully know her in real life are comforting her and backing her up, and to top it off her mother and father are once more at her side fueling this new fire even though they know full well how this relationship had played out.

My only system of support is at my job where both of us used to work together at one point. Most of my co workers had seen first hand what type of person she is, and they see it online as well. They keep telling me how happy they are for me that I made this decision. I’m being told things like “you’re such a gentleman and an amazing person and you absolutely did not deserve to be treated like that” things I’ve never really heard before and it feels good. So here we are two weeks after I told her and her mom and her are trying their hardest to rope me back. I’m still standing strong and I’m holding my head high. I feel the old me breaking through the cracks of this weak being I became.

Today I reflected a lot on what the future could hold for me. Old friends I lost from this have been reaching out to me expressing their feelings of happiness and excitement for me. 

I end this by asking the silly question again...

53,"I am in a bit of a moral dilemma here. I am a freshman in college, and I have three roommates this year (four guys total). We were all randomly assigned to be roommates at the beginning of the year. Right now we have to decide who we want to room with for next year. One of my three roommates is leaving to room with other friends, so he is kind of out of the picture.

That leaves me and my two other roommates, Miles and Eric. There are only quads, doubles, and singles (no rooms for three people). I am really good friends with Miles, and he wants us to join two other freshmen who we know and like in a quad. But then we would have to abandon Eric, who is socially awkward and currently without rooming plans for next year. He is super polite but I just have a better time hanging out with other people.

54,"I've struggled with the ability to hear words, though I do well on my hearing tests. I know lots of other people face this problem. It's a bigger concern for me now because my son is 4 and has a significant speech delay (I did as well). He is in speech therapy, but I fear this might be a hearing issue. I'd like to get a discussion going on hearing difficulties and if anyone found a solution.  

Some background:

I was in speech therapy as well until I was in middle school. I struggle to understand words at times and have been using subtitles for movies/shows since college. To learn words to songs I usually have to look then up and read them.  In social situations, I've given up on understanding everything and have learned how to respond appropriately given body language.  On the social side, I think most people think I don't care to listen, when in reality i have a hard time comprehending what is being said and people get annoyed repeating themselves. 

I generally feel like cotton balls are in my ears and I get occasional ringing in my ears lasting 15-30 seconds. 

My son is 4 and is finally starting to improve and is saying more. We are working on 2 syllable words and I noticed he consistently says the second syllable with a vowel and I wonder if it could be a hearing issue. When I say it louder he gets it. 

I am going to take him to be tested but I have mixed feelings on it. I take yearly hearing tests and my hearing always comes back as ""normal"" and I know that's not the case. I even saw a specialist, but she basically laughed me out of the office. 

Who else struggles with this? Has anything helped? ",24Mar2019,1

56,"Hey guys,

this is a throwaway account because i wanna avoid parents finding a post from my real account. I'm typing this as I think, so it might not make very much sense, sorry if it doesn't lol. 

Anyways a bit of context: I am 22F, only child, with two relatively suffocating parents who are always up in my business (especially mom). My relationship with my mom isn't the best, every time we talk it leads to an argument over something so stupid and it causes tension between myself and my parents. My dad tries to neutralize the situations, but it always ends up in tears and fighting. A little over 2 years ago, I started dating my boyfriend. He's from a different culture where meeting with your significant others family means you're pretty much getting married and he used to be very uncomfortable with this. This is the first relationship where he's gone out of his comfort zone to meet my family on multiple occasions. However, my mom doesn't understand this and always questions his whereabouts when he doesn't attend family gatherings. I've tried explaining this to her, but she always hits back with the well in our culture meeting the family doesn't mean this blahblahblah. I feel so much pressure that he has to attend every event and I think he feels it too. We're both extremely busy with school and most of the time he doesn't come it's genuinely because he is working his ass off for school. His family situation isn't the best and he is at an immense pressure to finish University and get in to a masters program to provide him with a good income to support his family, this has caused him a lot of anxiety and needing to acheive good grades. Of course, I don't tell anyone this because it's no ones business, including my mom. So, it's gotten to the point recently where I've just had to start coming up with excuses for him. Tomorrow is my moms birthday and we're going to celebrate with some family. She asked if he was going to come, and he has a final paper worth a lot of his grade coming up, so I understand when he says he wants to work on this. But, knowing she will roll her eyes at this I come up with some bullshit excuse and she probably knows it's a lie. I just don't know what to do in this situation and I always feel so anxious whenever we are planning family get togethers because of this. Even worse, I'm graduating this year and have to move back home for awhile after living on my own for the last 5 years. My relationship is going to turn long-distance and I'm not ready to move back in to this overbearing environment. 

Am I in the wrong for lying? Is it her business to know his whereabouts all the time? Am I just overthinking everything? Does this even make sense lmao? ",24Mar2019,1

58,I had an interview Friday for a security guard position and I believe it went well. The only problem is I mentioned I got medically discharged and that I have 2 herniated discs. The interview lady asked me if this would affect my work since the job demands me to be standing for long periods of time. I told her something along the lines of “I don’t believe it will affect me in completing my job at all”. She said okay and we moved on. I later mentioned that I had gotten a procedure done for my discs and that I was attending aquatic aerobics. I’m worrying about this since she mentioned there are 2 other people being considered. She told me she would contact me this Monday in order to let know if they will be hiring me or not. Did I mess up? And should I just keep my mouth shut next time? Thank you in advance. ,24Mar2019,5
59,"My dad is honestly the biggest asshole you never want to meet. He was an abusive drug addict (cocaine) my whole life and a raging alcoholic to boot. I'll spare you most of the details, but that doesn't make for the happiest of childhoods. After extensive abuse my mother divorced him when I was 10. It was very messy, mostly due to my dad's profession (Lawyer) and his many friends. My sister's and I were interviewed by a woman sent from the court, I told the woman I would be happier with my mother and how scared I was of my father. She promised anything I said would be a secret between us and my dumb ass ten year old self believed her. My dad met me downstairs the next day screaming the transcripts of everything I'd said to the woman at me. Our relationship just got worse from there. My dad won full custody somehow and life for me got much much worse. My grandma (dad's mom) eventually took me from my dad to get me out of that situation when I was 15. (Mom moved out of state shortly after the divorce). My adult life has mostly been avoiding him whenever there was a forced family gathering. Despite our very tattered relationship I tried to remain somewhat involved in his life. I would always send birthday and Father's day cards to him and try to call once and awhile to see how he was doing. Though this was mostly done at the urging of my grandmother. She passed last August and it was devastating. After that I kind of lost all contact with my father, flash forward to last week. My sister tells me my Dad is in the hospital for swollen legs. I didn't think much of it and went onward with my life. Yesterday she sends me another text that he's still in the hospital and I should go visit. They don't know what's wrong, but they're doing a biopsy. Again, I ignore it. Today my other sister texts me and says my Dad had called her and let her know he had stage 4 lung cancer and doctors are giving him 2-12 months to live. She said all my other sisters knew and that I should call him to see what's going on. I feel numb to the news. I don't know if I'm relieved to know he'll be gone soon, or slightly distraught I'll never be able to repair the relationship we never really had. I don't know what I can say to him without sounding like a robot. I hate him, but I guess I don't want him to die knowing that. What can you even say to a person that has been given a death sentence, especially someone you're not particularly fond of? I know this will probably get lost, but any advice is helpful. I'm mostly just using this as an excuse not to call him yet. ",24Mar2019,2

However, lately I've been feeling a sense of coldness from them. It feels like I have to put in the effort otherwise we won't talk. Even though we only interact a few times a week I feel like somehow I am bothering them.

65,"I'll preface this with that I already have some plans of what to do but I feel overwhelmed enough to ask anyways and get some input. 

For background I'm FTM, I also have a male partner, due to insecurities that if I used a word like boyfriend that I'll be assumed as female I typically just call him my partner, and I have referenced him in several conversations at least one of which involved this person hearing me. Oh and this is happening at work. 

So this started off not being too bad. I'm new to this job, started about two weeks ago. At first this guy just called me bro wherever we had to talk. Then the fistbumps started, so far so normal. As he started having to work closer to me we started talking a bit, which is normal in my job. Now for context what I'm doing that places me near him is just pulling items out of totes and cleaning them. Those of us dealing with those items tend to show them to each other and talk about them, with the occasional chit chat throughout the day. This week he started to make comments trying to connect items I'm holding to my interests (in a way that he either asks if like a thing or assumes it). Then he started to ask kinda chit chat things about what my interests are. Random questions like my preference in music and favorite color. That would be normal... If he didn't do it as much as he did. Oh did I ever mention that he talks more to me than he does to anyone else (like 5-10x as much) at first I assumed this is because I'm the only one who appears to be a similar age and we're both newer to the place plus the other two main people we can talk to while doing that are women.

 Anyways he also started using the items to joke about taking pictures of me. Then very recently he started making up unbelievable lies about himself related to whatever I'm holding (like having wrestled against people like John Cena). He also took way to much interest in asking how excited I was for the pizza work was bringing, then after lunch asking how much I liked it. He also made a couple comments assuming things about me, the area we work in is super cold and he made a comment saying I like the cold, I corrected him saying the only reason I'm fine with it is because of my jacket, he also assumed when the idea of being let to leave early came up that I would take it and said what time he would leave and what time I would leave, I corrected him saying I want the money and they'd have to pay me to leave but it was still a bit creepy. We have some communication problems understanding each other (I think English isn't his first language) so I'm assuming that he doesn't understand that all of the times I said partner means I'm taken and didn't notice the ring, oh and when I mentioned that a situation about work would make a good joke to make to my partner he was suspiciously quite for someone who seemed to never stop talking now, it's gotten to the point where it feels awkward and I don't know how to respond, he also might have tried to compliment me and thought I replied because I was talking at the item I was working on. So my current idea is to just make a comment involving my partner but saying fiance instead (technically a more fitting word, we do intend to marry I just need to change my name first so I don't do it twice). And if that word doesn't get it across to him I think I'm going to suck it up and talk to my manager about this even though I don't want to and it's super awkward. Any advice and support you have for me I will be very grateful for. This is all very overwhelming. ",24Mar2019,2

-Unemployment isn't an option for me
-I've tried applying for disability and got denied. Regardless, I would like to work.

73,"Throwaway account. 21M in USA 

I’ve had a major anxiety disorder for years, like any particular situation could trigger a panic attack resulting in me throwing up. My parents new about it when it first started 10+ years ago but they never thought it was bad enough to seek outside help. If I told my parents I was having an episode the conversation would usually end with them telling me to control my breathing and power through it. Over time I became uncomfortable telling them about my situation because I felt like they wouldn’t accept how serious it is. It’s been so long no since I’ve told them about an episode that the think I’m cured. I’m now a junior in college and my symptoms are getting a lot worse. I constantly feel anxious like I’m on the verge of having a panic attack at any moment and it’s getting to be too much. I need help and I’m not comfortable asking for it especially from my parents. Anxiety has always hindered me leading a normal life an lately my mood has severely taken a hit as I watch everyone I know have happy healthy relationships and friendships. I’m scared that I’ll never have anything like that if I continue on this way. I’ve also noticed that I’ve stopped eating full meals regularly an am concerned that even though I’m aware of it it continues to happen. 

My family has good insurance, but I haven’t been to even a general practitioner for years. I feel like I can’t even talk to my parents about my mental health so even thinking about setting up an appointment to see some kind of doctor really freaks me out.

74,"Hello, I've been wanting to post this for a while but just recently gained the courage to do it.

For my whole life I have lived in an abusive household and...God, I can't even think of an introduction, let's just skip to the story. Keep in mind I'll try to make it as short as it can be so if you find anything rushed, confusing or unexplained just ask me, it's probably a detail I've forgotten about.

I am italian. I have an italian passport and everything. When I was 7 my mom decided to move to Bali (Indonesia) because she had always loved the place. I was a stupid 7 year old, and just thought ""easy school? I sure won't pass on this one!"" and said yes. My mom had spent the next 3 years trying to sell our house and make enough money to finally be able to move overseas, and when I was 10 years old we finally sold our house. We lived in a really small town, where I was basically an outcast because of how my mom was ""different"" and wanted to move. By that time I started having different interests in different things and had many online friends who I always texted. Since w ddin't have a house anymore when my parents were doing papers and stuff we lived at my grandma's house, which was pretty nice and had enough space for all of us. That was and still is one of the happiest times in my whole life. I started having and interest in art and would always spend my time coloring and drawing, texting my friends and having so much fun I remember losing my voice for days because of how much I laughed with them. Then we finally moved.
I started school in here and met so many wonderful people, though it's really expensive.

Now...I don't know what happened, but as soon as I came here things were not as expected. I wasn't having a bad time, I just felt weird about it. I shrugged it off and kept going...and now comes the hardest part of the story.
It is really hard for me to talk about this stuff.

First year:
The time difference started making my life fall apart, not being able to talk with my friends was terrifying for be because they were the only people I could talk to since I barely knew english. For the next 4 years my mom and my dad had so many financial problems even now it's really hard to be able to buy anything aside from food and our basic needs because of all the scamming they did to us (seriously, if you ever move to another country be really careful. A guy was able to stop our renewed passports from being sent to us and threatened us, saying that we had to pay him something like 40,000€. He had payed the police and they were on his side too so we lost A TON of money). I started feeling worse and worse, and I wasn't the only one, considering how my dad was getting more and more frustrated and violent with my mom. A lot of my relationships fell apart because of how depressed I was and how I couldn't stop thinking and talking about it, which made me even worse because I had no way of getting help. I had no way of escaping or coping with it, or even distracting myself from it since, again, we didn't have money so I wouldn't even be able to just have something that reminded me of my home country or my friends. I started going through my first phases (just things that I liked or how I wanted to dress) but was forced to just watch my rich classmates do whatever they wanted and go on trips when I really just wanted to be able to go back to Italy, even if for just a short amount of time.
First year, over.

Second year:
I started being desperate for attention, and I mean *really* desperate.
I started cutting myself even in school because I wanted someone to help me. I wanted them to see what I felt like. Pretty stupid since I could have just talked about it, as it wasn't even that hard for me at the time. I started feeling like utter shit because of how I was trying to get attention, I knew that wasn't the right way to do it but I needed it or else I would go crazy in my own thoughts. That was the time I realized that no, it wasn't just me having to get used to place. I didn't want to live here. I got more and more depressed, lazier and lazier, and I remember spending whole days pretending to be sick and staying in bed because I didn't want to see my classmates and be reminded of how shitty of a life I had. I remember laying in bed, face up, just staring a the ceiling...I had so many things going through my head I couldn't feel anything. Only when I started seeing less and less light coming from my windows I would look at the time, or maybe just wait until I felt my eyes start to fill up with tears, and silent cry while still staring at the ceiling. These are literally the only memories I have of that year. Everything was always the same.

Third year was not important, as I recall no memory of it. I just know that year we moved houses. By that time I also had a boyfriend, he was one of my italian friends who I was talking about before, one that I would always laugh and cry with. He was and still is an amazing person, so heh Alessandro if you're reading this thank you for giving me a reason to live. I love you so much...

Fourth year was the hardest. Everything started getting so confusing and messed up even now it's extremely hard to put everything in order. I started off being happier than before, but things changed quickly. My mom was also getting sadder and sadder because of work and how her own employees were treating her like shit, but she couldn't fire them because they were the best she could find. My dad started getting *extremely* violent with me, to the point I started being afraid of being near him in any way. Once he got angry at me for some stupid ass thing and beat me up for the whole fucking evening, and he only stopped when I called my mom and she hear my cries on the phone and rushed to pick me up immediately. After that she said she was done with my dad but huh, apparently not. I didn't see him for three days and my mom said she would send him back to his mom in Italy, but as always she didn't do anything. Can't really blame her, I guess. Money doesn't grow on trees.
I felt more and more trapped by my dad, who wouldn't let me do anything and would be completely unreasonable with both my mom and my teachers. He's also the kind of guy who thinks just because someone believes in something they deserve something happening to them. He believes all vegans should die, that americans are all mental and he and what he likes are the fucking best there is in the whole world. He believes he's an amazing musician just because some guy on the internet told him one of his tracks from when he was 16 sounded good, even though he always cruticises the internet and is just an overall terrible person.
Enough about my dad.
After a while my boyfriend and me were together we decided it was fine for both of us to see the other one, well...naked. It was fine for me and it still is, though it felt inappropriate for my age, since I was 13 and he was 14/15. I mean, I honestly don't care, he's a good guy and we both were consentual anyway.
But OH BOY I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE PARANOIA STARTED KICKING IN.
For a few months I had been feeling more and more paranoid, I don't mean to talk about this for 10 hours so yeah, I started having what I think were my first anxiety attacks when I was alone, when I wouldn't know what to do and shake and cry in my bed for no reason while being afraid my dad would come in or something would fall on me or, even more stupid, someone would come up from behind me and kidnap me. Every time I thought about how I hated everything around me and just wanted to go back to Italy, how I felt like a slut for sending pictures like that at my age, how I felt guilty for this, guilty for that, how nobody could see that I needed help but I felt so worthless that even the thought of telling someone made me afraid of sounding like some entitled brat. It didn't help that our school had a different counselor that year, and I fucking hated her. She never listened to me and would interrupt me, to then call my parents in for every fucking thing I would say. I know it is usually the right thing to do, but when you hear stories about physically and mentally abusive parents and the person telling the story BEGS YOU to not tell anyone, don't you think calling the parents, the ABUSERS, is probably not the brightest idea? I was forced to stop going to her office because my dad would be mad at me or beat me up if he got called in. My parents just told me to shut up cause they didn't want problems.
End of fourth year, I guess. There's more to talk about but this paragraph is already way too long.

I'm literally in a foreign country where child support is non-existent. I don't even know indonesian, and calling the police won't do anything, I know it. I just wish I was in Australia or America or literally any other country because I can't do this anymore. My parents haven't even noticed my anxiety, and make fun of me for carrying a stuffed bunny almost everywhere I go. They call it some sick fetish and it just disgusts me. They don't understand that I need it so I don't start physically panicking in front of everyone. I can't tell them how I feel because they would just laugh at me. I've been having really bad suicidal thoughts because just recently I even basically lost all of my internet friends because of a misunderstanding they wouldn't let me explain, and I have no one to talk to that I trust aside from my best friend at school (I don't talk about really private stuff with her) and my boyfriend, who I don't want to say this stuff to because I know it would make him sad or worried. If I don't find a way out I'm probably going to end it all. 

It makes me so sad because I have things I want to do. I want to meet my friends, I want to move out and have a happy life...I have a dream of becoming an illustrator and draw for a living. But I just can't stand this...I can't keep it up anymore.

Can someone help me? Please. Thank you.",24Mar2019,5

80,"Cross posted on r/etiquette :)

I’ve agreed to be a bridesmaid for one of my best friends. She sent the group of us the following message, and I’m not quite sure how to feel about it or respond. 

The message reads: “Also how do you girls feel about buying your own   bouquets? They would each be $56. flowers are costing me $750 total. If its doable that would help a ton. But if you dont have it that's ok we can figure it out.”

My immediate feeling was that it seems weird to ask bridesmaids to help share the cost of the wedding (beyond dresses and things like that, which are ours to keep). My second thought was that I can certainly afford it, and the expense isn’t a big deal to me so maybe it would be nice to help her out? 

She and her fiancée have a toddler and have bit off a little more than they probably should have with house and car payments. I am very financially stable, generally have more income than they do, and have much lower house and car expenses (and no kids!), so the expense would be no biggie for me, but I’m also engaged and have my own upcoming wedding to save for.   Also, many of the other bridesmaids have lower incomes or are in a less stable financial situation than me or the bride. 

The bride is one of my dearest friends, and I usually try to “treat” her when we meet for lunch or something, but this feels a little too far to me.

TLDR: bride asked bridesmaids to pay for their own bouquets to save her money. Is this a normal thing / am I being silly to feel weird that she asked?  Please help with a polite way to respond in the group message, either way! 

Thank you!!

81,"Backstory: So there's this girl i have a crush on, she has just recently broken up with her boyfriend and has been really depressed, i'd always notice and would try to cheer her up but she just wanted to be left alone, this friday was the last time i talked with her about a planning for extra classes we had made a week ago( before she broke up with her bf).

Now here's the main problem: she is suicidal. I never thought that she'd feel this way, she is an amazing person and doesn't deserve to be feeling like this. The main way i found out about this was her posting it on her day on social media posting things like ""today might be the day"" and ""suicide's been on my mind a lot, im sorry if i really comitnto it."" ,i tried talking it out with her by messaging her but she didn't even reply. I then tried calling her but she didn't pick up. I've been thinking to go to her home (i know where she lives, i've been there a couple of times it's pretty far and i don't have transport to go there) I've been having conflicting feelings about this, part of me thinks she's already committed suicide while the other thinks ""her friends must have went and helped her."" Feel really bad about myself and have been stressed out, cause not only is she a really good friend of mine, she is also someone i have a crush on. I feel helpless and don't know what to do nor feel. If i can't go to her house tommorow i'll probably see her at school on monday;(only if she's not dead by then.)The worst thing is, i don't have the numbers nor social media of her friends nor family. So i still don't know what the situation is.
Please i really need help with this matter, wtf do i do?

Tl;tr : don't know what to do, since my suicidal friend has barely made contact with me and it seems that she might commit suicide this weekend.

(I know this is a heavy topic, we're talking about human lives here, but i really am clueless and i feel helpless in this matter)

Note1: my grammar might be bad because english is my third language and i barely speak english here, i am willing to clarify anything in the comments though, so feel free to ask question

Note2: i might delete this tommorow or monday depending on what the situation is.",24Mar2019,1
82,"My little sister wants to brush her teeth, right now, and my dad and older sister insist that she wait and fold laundry first. I can see this turning into her resenting listening to them, and also being a little too uptight about hygiene. But only if consistent. But I guess if this is literally the kind of atmosphere that produces this sort of situation consistently, then it's only a matter of time before she has similar anxieties to the rest of us.

Anyway. She is really upset and she complained that her teeth hurt. She tried to pose the logical argument that what they were doing was unfair, relating to the idea that if she was an adult they wouldn't restrain her. They didn't sense the underlying concepts as a petition for equality, but she would not be upset if that wasn't the problem. She was totally fine after, and wasn't even resentful except for the duration of brushing her teeth as she stomped around the house in transit to get ready for brushing. 

I think it's ridiculous that all they (the ""adults"") can take from the situation is that she has an attitude and that she is acting like a child in the way that she cannot stand not getting what she wants.

Saying someone has an attitude is condescending as hell, and yeah she's 10, but the entire time she was upset she stood there and folded laundry. She did what they asked. They just don't respect her enough to let her take care herself before she does them. Like fucking rabid wolves.

I knew if I said anything my older sister would respond as though I were still twelve. I'm a grown butt man with a wimpy beard, but she is used to the smooth, streamlined me. She would have added several decibels to the situation which my younger sister was doing a good job at keeping low enough. Amazing.

My dad would have stayed quiet but would have given me dark looks and made pointed but inevitably faulty arguments, faulty in my opinion because they develop out of the very ideas that create this situation. The whole situation was preventable. I realize some things people are just gonna have to deal with, but that's still no excuse for neglecting to instill a sense of sovereignty in a little person as opposed to a sense of being an underling. That's what happened to me and all my other siblings (9 of us in total) and I don't want it to happen to her.

So I'm basically helpless to do anything to kind of help my sister out. Yeah, she is not my kid, but what she is going through is exactly what I went through for 15 years or so before I finally got ripped away from my family for two years. I don't pretend to know more, I just know that if I had to go through living with them again knowing what I know now, there would be a lot more conflict due to me defending my personal rights, or something.

84,"Question about cleaning and germs:

I have a pair of sneakers. I wore them one day, the exact date was anywhere from September 2018-December 2018. That day, I stepped in a puddle. (It was not a clear looking puddle, if this is relevant. I’m mainly concerned about germs and this puddle looked a lil “dirty”.) My sneakers got somewhat wet. It wasn’t like soaking wet. I don’t really remember if the water reached the insoles of my sneakers. I didn’t wore the sneakers anymore after that incident. When I got home, I just put them in a closet. 

Today is March 2019. I’m thinking of soaking the shoes in a bucket with laundry detergent and then washing the shoes and then letting them air dry. 

My question is, is cleaning the shoes according to as I’ve described, sufficient to kill any germs that possibly got on there from when I stepped in the puddle? I would like to wear the sneakers after I clean them.

During the time the shoes were left alone, did germs actually multiply? Is mold on the shoes a concern?

Problem #1 is (of course) I cant really think of a good way to explain.

 Problem 2# ..... There's a semi language barriar between my parents and I. I was born in the US while my parents in Mexico. While I was growing up I watched english speaking cartoons and spent alot of time outside so the main interaction with my parents was like ""Hey Im doing ok and im safe and not kidnapped"" and all that jazz so when I ultimately turned introverted I slowly began to realize that I sometimes can't speak to my parents about specific things because I simply don't know the words for it in Spanish.

A little backstory about my boy: My bf is in the army so he confided in me a lot about being scared to deploy. He also dated this girl off and on for 4 years and it was a shit show. She completely controlled him. I had a feeling he still had feelings for her, so when she texted him out of the blue, he responded with “can we keep this a secret”. I found out and he said it was wrong and just wanted “a back up plan”. He blocked her and we moved forward. In November, I found out he had been sending pictures to a different girl. The same day we became “official” and the nights he’d cry to me about the military (it happened multiple times). He said it’s because a lot of guys would dm me and stuff from college. Anyways, I broke up with him for like a week. He’d come over and try to get back with me. During this time, I had sex with his best friend. In early December, I told him about it and even though he was upset, he wanted me. He stayed with me through my hospitalization in December (I tried to kill myself- I have major depression and anxiety and my dad said I wasn’t doing enough for him during the stroke, even though I was there every day). My bf helped me through an intensive partial hospitalization program after that and has been helping me with my dissociation ever since. We have been living together alone for a few months now, and are supposed to be moving into my parents house in a week. (All of the drama happened while we lived at my house).

95,"Ok, this goes back to the end of middle school and the beginning of high school. i will try and keep this short while including as much of the story as possible.

So during late middle school, i went to a ""fairly decent"" christian school with some other people i knew, the school was very small and everyone knew everyone out side of it, most of us went to the same church occasionally. now here is when things get slightly weird... i found out about a quarter of the year in that the two hottest girls in my class were lesbians, this is important because, i was the only one who knew at the school. i will tell you how i found this out in a bit, but if i ratted on them, it would be essentially permanent expulsion from the school. so once they caught on to me knowing, they became kind of jerks, one more so than the other. 

So, here is how i found out: For about a year and a half, i learned that every weekend the two girls would ""sleep over"" at the ones house, so this seems normal for girls about at that age, but it gets worse. due to school policy (we will call them A and B) A was not allowed to call B by her trans name, the only way i ACTUALLY found out about it was at church of all places, when A called B her ""put trans name here"". so about 6-7 months later, i overheard some ""suggestive content"" about them and later on it started to make more sense. what was sooooooo messed up about this is i was trying to hit on A when i still did not know that she was already in a relationship, and the more i tried, the more i came to realize that something else was going on. no waaaaayyyyy later, i overheard a similar conversation between A's mom and someone else talking about her ""sexual"" relationship with another guy. this kinda makes sense when A went from zit face to no pimples in about a month if you know what i mean... Most of my suspicions were confirmed later by outside sources. 

TL:DR : I try to hit on girl. i find out that she is already in an ""illegal"" sexual relationship with her friend. i find out. friend makes my life kinda hell when i interact with them. find out later by A's mom that she might be in 2 separate sexual relationships. find out later that my suppositions were correct.  

So: Question 1: how do i Kind of talk to them because A distances herself away from me at all costs. Question 2: do you think that my analysis of the situation was correct? 

It is kind of sad because i really support them, but i am unable to actually tell them that because a, i am not entirely sure if they ""are"" lesbians or not, and b if they are, i WOULD like to support them in a circle of homophobic people. 

btw this was years ago and i am in no contact with B but i see A occasionally. 

unfortunately if i come off kind of blunt regarding this situation, it is because i have been kinda sheltered for the last 16+ years, soooooooooo.

99,"First of all, a bit of background is probably helpful. So I’ve known this girl for a while now, and I’ve been pretty good friends with her for around two years. Around last year, I developed a crush on her, and it’s what made me realize that I must be bi(I’m also female). This crush was huge to me, and she had to have been one of my biggest crushes ever. Eventually though, my feelings for her faded away, and I just accepted that I wasn’t going to ask her out or anything. 

Fast forward to this year, and we’re still great friends. At this point we’re even closer to each other than last year, and I started to have a crush on her again. She’s a very loud and flirtatious person(always has been), and I think there’s a good chance she has, if not does, like me. 

Next year, I’m going to go to a different school than her, and I figured why not tell her on the last day of school, after I never have to see her again if she doesn’t want to continue to be friends. I’ve thought about it for a while now, and at this point I’m not so sure it’s the best plan. 

As I already said, this girl is very flirtatious, and last year it was school gossip that she had a crush on me. She is bi(probably should have mentioned before), so it’s not like I’ve just got some unreasonable crush on someone who would never want to date me. I’m just unsure of what I should say to her. I’ve never had a bf or gf, and I’ve definitely never had experience with something like this. 

So, what should I tell her and when should I tell her? I don’t want to ruin our friendship, but it’s not will continue much longer after we part ways anyway, unless we both really want it to.

108,"Long story short, I (17F) was in the state's custody for a week, which meant that I was unable to go to school, and didn't have any access to the internet (computers/phones) at all during this time period.  

Now that I'm back home, I've realized how fucked I kind of am right now, and would really like some advice as to how to explain my sudden ""disappearance"" to my friends and teachers. **I don't want to be treated differently in any way, which is why I don't know what I should tell them.**  

Here are all of the things that I don't really know how to fix:  
* I don't know what to say to my friends. I've had a history of kind of disappearing (bc of depression issues) in the past, so I feel like this is kind of the ""last straw"". I really really REALLY don't want to tell them what actually happened, especially bc I don't want it getting out to the rest of the school, and because I don't want to lose our dynamic.       

* I had a required project due during this week. Like, it's the kind of required where the entire grade has to do it by the same day, and even if you're sick on the day it's due, you still need to turn it in somehow. My teacher is great, but precisely because of that, I'm scared of getting on his radar and getting special attention or something. I feel like it'd be really awkward.  

* My sports team had a game this week too, on top of the fact that I've missed an entire week of practice. Yikes. I'm scared that I'm going to get kicked off.   
* I'm in as many honors/AP classes as possible, so I already know I'm totally fucked in the homework department. F. Is it reasonable to ask for extensions on top of the normal absent work policy? How could I justify this?   

**My workers told me that it's ok to just make up something and say I was hospitalized or something, but the thing is that I don't have the papers proving a long stay, though I do have some prescription papers that I got from the hospital (to clarify: I *did* go to the hospital, but I never stayed there. I stayed at a different government facility).   

Again: Please give me options outside of telling the truth. I really really hate getting attention, and I don't want to be on anyone's radar.**",24Mar2019,2

So it hasn't been confirmed, but here is the back story. I am a 26/M and the other day my girlfriend (who is 20, been dating for about 6 months) was checked for herpes and the initial results were positive. I initially never saw this relationship going anywhere due to the age difference. We were hooking up for about six months before dating, then things just lead that direction. I do genuinely care about her and think she is great. She only had a few sexual partners before me and knowing this, it is most likely my fault and I feel terrible. I feel like any possibility of a normal dating life for either of us is out the window if we were to break up. So now I feel like I have to commit to a long term relationship which isn't terrible because I do care about her, I just don't feel ready.

140," I'm in a complicated situation. I'm leaving my husband who after years of sinking into a bad depression has become abusive. We have a small kid together and I'm trying to maintain a good relationship for the sake of coparenting. With that said, I'm not planning on doing anything for awhile, but my mind is stuck on thinking about this crush I have...

I met my crush when I was 12, I'm 30 now. He was 20 and my big brother's friend. Once I turned 19 we started talking and hanging out about once a year. That went for about 5 years then he moved away. Ever since I've still been crushing, asking my big brother for updates and such. I never knew if he was interested or if he just talked to me to look out for me on behalf of my brother. I have a sexy hip tattoo I once showed him (not proud, but it's a tactic I use to let guys know I'm interested because who is gutsy enough to just say it). He didn't do anything...

So now... I'm going through some stuff and to cope I stated fantasizing about a future with a loving partner... and he became the star of these daydreams. Well, then I started thinking about why him. We haven't talked in a year, he's not active on social media, so it's not like I see his face all the time.  And then I started to realize I've had fellings for him for nearly 20 years. So now I want to tell him (once I'm single), but that just seems so messy to me. I'm not afraid of rejection, I'm more worried about things getting weird.

142,"So the list begins with me being a 6 year old boy ...

The typical day begins with my being with-held food at the morning, with my mom refusing to cook me food until dinner time. So the wait begins, as I am locked in my room, blocked from the Internet, with-held from making friends, and forced to go to a stupid charter school where practically no one is allowed to make friends. This continued on throughout my 6 year old life. Whenever I DID TALK TO MY PARENTS, it was usually my alcoholic father beating up my mom or hitting and screaming at me. Then comes the later years... (oh great, hopefully it changes, right?) Also, being severely underweight for my age was a big plus!

I am screamed at every single day by my alcoholic, violent father who is worthy of Stone Cold Steve Austin levels of asshole. Some days I would get my 7-14 year old frail body beat up by my own father. If that didn't happen, they sent me to martial arts classes to get beat up by a professional. Despite breaking my arm, back, and suffering loads of bruises and cuts, my parents still forced my young self to martial arts right after school while screaming at me on the way there. Thanks mom and dad. You are worthy of getting arrested. (Oh yeah, what's a doctor? Do those exist at that point? Maybe my parents know someone who can, I don't know, fix my broken arm)

Come my 11-14 year old years, and I was ignored for the most basic of needs: attention, food, water, clothing, human interaction. My parents refused to buy me anything, feed me once a day, locked me in my room, yelled at me whenever I asked to see the light of day, and tortured me my mocking, mimicking, yelling, hitting, sending me to martial arts school (where the culture was alike to Neo-Sparta), telling me to clean the bathrooms, berating me for anything, calling me retarded, buying me clothes and then proceeding to tell me that I look like a homeless person (they bought me the only few clothes I have), and outright refusing any human decency in my life. Thanks mom and dad.

This pattern of emotional and literally physical attacks continued on throughout my life. I am 19 soon to be 20 now and I am locked in my room by my own parents. Except I have Internet now. For most of the my life, my parents locked me in my room and did not even allow me to go outside other than to go to school, where-in I was locked in a fascist-Neo-dictatorial charter school where saying ""Hello"" would render you in detention for 2 hours. Thanks mom and dad. That school was utterly useless, providing only the bare minimum of course load (English, low-level math). Also, thanks to my aunts and uncles, who unanimously agreed that everything in my life is my fault and that I should have owned up to it: I was kicked out of my house and left homeless for weeks at a time.

I made it into college, and I ended up with the most horrible people I have ever met (except my parents, brother, and father). They constantly raided my things, attacked me, yelled at me, woke me up at night every time I went to sleep, and basically were a lesser version of the assholes my parents were. They did a whole lot of other stuff.

I began suffering from a multitude of mental and physical health issues due to a lifetime of concussions, lacerations, arm-breaks, bone-breaks, mental abuse. One day, I couldn't take it anymore and started yelling, to which my parents threatened me with a knife. I ran away from home and called 911.

To my surprise, the police turned on me, saying that I was mentally retarded and sent me to a mental institution for 2 weeks, to which, to my surprise, the caretakers and people there were also My Parents 3.0 Reloaded. The police officers did not bother to think about what I was saying, and simply went straight to pen and paper to jot down the words ""autistic, needs help, mental hospital...""

The mental institution forced me to take medication, sat me for 2-3 hour sessions stating how mentally retarded I am and that I needed to take the medication or I wouldn't be released (by the way, the medication had horrible side effects.)

They sent me to my primary hospital, to which the primary hospital also unanimously agreed with the police &amp; my parents that I needed mental help, except that their form of mental help was superficial therapy, 3000$+ dollars worth of treatment at a time, the acknowledgement that I am indeed mentally retarded to think that a physical threat on my life is something that is TO BE CONCERNED OF.

Previously, when I was on medication, my parents turned on me once again, and shoved pills down my throat ""because it was good for me"". Currently on break from university, after suffering bouts of nightmares, extreme physical pain, and being financially withdrawn by my own parents, I am planning on working in fast food for years just to have my own place where I won't be treated lower than an animal.

Currently, my parents continue to treat me like a dog, waking me up in the middle of the night whenever I go to sleep, with-holding food from me, yelling at me, refusing to listen to anything I say, father physically threatens me for whatever I do, continues to berate me, is the biggest pussy I have ever met (would do something horrible, and literally run away in his car). Oh yeah, and any family member KNOWS of the horrible sub-animal treatment I am going through, and refuses to acknowledge my existence. So yeah, thanks world.

So yeah, if you have any advice (other than calling 911, who are completely fucking useless and only want to send me to am mental hospital again, and other than reaching out to ""supposed relatives who can help me at all"", or ""start working"", which I am going to start working) to deal with my extreme physical ailments, mental abuse, and neo-Nazi-Spartan household living conditions, it would be a great help, since apparently even the cops won't help me.

TL;DR: My family are made up of horrible people. I was physically and mentally abused for 19 years and continue to receive more and more physical ailments due to worsening conditions. My father is a violent alcoholic who continues to hit and yell at me. My mother treats me less than an animal and refused to give me food when I was younger. My brother steals from me and hits me as well. My extended family refuse to acknowledge me. The police, hospital, and mental institutions all acknowledge me as mentally retarded for looking after my own health after a physical threat with a weapon and seek to force treatment onto me.

143,"I met a girl last semester when a guy cut me out of his life and group I sat with in uni classes.


I was able to study her and become more mainstream and appeal to more people my age and fit in more. I did this by changing the way I dressed and spoke.


We get on really well and talk almost every day but, she never invites me out and there is a big festival coming up that I want to go to but know no one else so I keep hinting for her to ask me to go, ""there'll be no point for me waiting for tickets if I'm going alone"" and, ""my car's being fixed so I have no way of getting there"". Both times she just let it hang there and changed the subject.


She initially asked if I was going when she had a ticket and her friends couldn't get any but changed after they could.


It was pretty hurtful since I thought we got on well and arranged classes together and go and get lunch between classes. We even talked for ages when we saw eachother out the other day.
She seems to have her friends she went to school with and doesn't care about me.

144,"Recently I stumbled upon this concept of relationship martyrs. I recognized immediately that I am over the top 100% a relationship martyr. When I read psychology today's article, I got shivers as to how true everything sounded. 

I realized within a couple hours of deep thought and research that this sense of martyrdom has leaked into many other aspects of my life like work. 

I need to break the cycle and this feels like a very good first step. I've always known that I'm a major part of the problem in my relationship but always felt like an angry victim within. Now I'm starting to understand why. That no one is asking me to give it my absolute all and control everything under the sun, I choose to do that..worse I choose to then complain and serve blame around to everyone who wasn't a part of my stupid plan to take care of everything under the sun. A fun adult concept that I'm desperately trying to apply is that I don't have to agree to accept.

Vent over, if anyone has any relevant advice and quick tips to check myself on a daily. Stopping complaining/whining is actually going to be an extremely difficult one for me. I use that for attention and interaction in general.

147,"I'm going to just list facts to keep this as simple as possible. Went to college at 17, dropped out at 19 to take over my dad's construction company. Hated it, so at 22 worked in an IT service desk for 10 months. Worked hard, harder than everyone else, was never rewarded for it. Was promised a promotion multiple times and nothing ever came, only the people around me would get promoted. Lost interest in the job and as a result performance went from one of the most valuable employees to average (monthly scorecard of 97-100 to mid 80's). Some things happened at work that belittled me to the point where I finally cracked and at the end of my shift on a Monday I didn't say anything, packed my cubicle and left. Boss texted me the next day and I told him (respectfully) that I wanted to end my employment with the company. He said he understood (many of the ways I was screwed over was not his fault). Now I am living off of a savings of a few thousand dollars, I live with my parents who support me entirely (food and car payments and such, which is normal in our culture.) But now I feel like a literal bum and the way I left my job has shut out any chance of me getting a job in the IT field ever again. I don't know what to do.

149,"Hi. 

Some family background - grandma is an alcoholic (who drinks a LOT; yesterday finished a 24 pack I think) 
   And some of my other aunts have substance abuse issues. 


A lot of times my mom will say things like “ I’m never drinking again “, “ I’m going to stop drinking now, this times for real “, “ I’m just going to have a little “ , “ that’s it... I’m not gonna drink like that again “ and come home drunk or pretty tipsy. Stumbling when walking, dropping her keys etc. 


The other day I was surprised when she told me “ when it’s sunny out the first thing I wanna do is drink “. And I was like “wow... that might actually be a bad thing” and she was like yeah but it’s true. 



**She only really drinks on the weekends though** so idk of that qualifies her drinking as an issue. 


The problem is she says she can’t control herself when she drinks even though she wants to. Idk if it’s more of a peer pressure issue or what. 


Today she took carbonated water to her family gathering hoping it would take her desire for alcohol away and she comes back saying it didn’t work so she ended up drinking. Now she’s super nauseous and looks tipsy. 


I guess I’m more worried of it turning into a severe problem. Any advice?

151,"(22M) I'm pretty much ruled by my emotions. I get too wrapped up in them. Anger, love, depression, happiness, etc. its like a rollercoaster on steroids for me. Sometimes I just want to be the guy who is calm and quiet and doesn't let anything faze him. However as I've gotten older sometimes I wish I didn't feel any of them at all. Before I gave up on finding a relationship, I was always the guy who fell in love too easy. In certain situations I'd get angry too easy, usually it was self hatred. There are many different situations where I let my emotions get the best of me. I'd love to get to a point in my life where I don't feel anything. Its probably a bad idea, someone will probably disagree with this but I'd like to not be swayed by emotions. I don't want to catch myself thinking about finding love, or getting angry at some stupid inconsequential thing or depressed about everything I can't change or the mistakes I've made in the past.

153,"So a bit of a background for starters: I am pretty anti-social, had my last (and kind of only) GF like 9 years ago (29 yo now). I am not super-social, rarely talk to girls of my age and can't even remember anyone that I was interested in the last few years. 

So now comes this girl, that will actually replace my at my workplace, so we spent like 2,5 weeks together and she is kind of nice (tho just 22 yo) and I started to believe that she might want to have something more. And that is your question right there, does she want it? (Not sure if I do, but that is another question.) Let me give you a (hopefully unbiased) list of pros and cons, so that you can help me decide that from an objective point of view -

Pros - 

1, She does not mind touches on her back, neck, etc. She even requested a massage twice in the office. She also seems to enjoy my clunky compliments on her looks. In general, we have a blast while in the office together, but definitely not just your ""casual comradery"" or however you would describe it.

2, We had a pretty short day in office last week, so I told her to go to the cinema, which she agreed to and we had a good time.

3, My other colleague (same office space as us, 50+ female) jokingly told me that she definitely likes me and it is pretty obvoius.

4, She (jokingly, but not really?) told me how much it sucks that she will be in the office without me until Tuesday.

Cons -

1, (We happen to have a similar taste in music, so) I told her to join me/my friends for 2 different concerts. I would describe her answer as a weak yes, but she seemed to be happy when I gave her the tickets. Strange shit.

2, Asked her out to a wine-tasting place, the reaction was something between neutral and nice-no.

3, Asked her out to join me for a fun afternoon in the zoo, checking out the monkeys, etc. Same neutral, nice-no kind of response. (Proposed this Sunday, so you could classify it as a hard no by now I guess.

4, Told her the other day that I will be in x casino, she could join me. She kind of just changed the topic without really reacting to it.

154,"I didn’t want to use my main account so I made this one. Skip to the end if you don’t want to read it’s not that important.

I know it’s a common problem and it’s tried tackling it in different ways. I had some really deep falls with depression before and I was able to get through with the support of some of my close friends and parents. But now I’m in college and it’s been slowly coming back since fall. 

I don’t have any friends, the only time I talk to people are in online video games, I never leave my door room it seems, my classes have started to tank, and it seems I’ve been getting screwed on a lot of things here. 

I’ve been in much darker places before which is why I know I’m depressed but don’t want to end up there. I’m not mentally stable at all and I lose control of myself a lot. 

So basically the point is I’m depressed and I need help but I don’t want to go to something like the suicide hotline. Are there other sources online that can help me get through this? Or just specific tips that people have?

158,"I work in a career that is reputation and word of mouth are very important. At my company specifically the group thought of you has the potential to make or break you. The issue with this is that my direct superior (we'll call him John) uses that to do things that should not be acceptable. 

For example:
1)If John finds something annoying about a person, like eating loudly, ""talking strange"", pushing buttons too hard, etc., regardless of their ability to do their job, he will push that person out of their position, or have them relocated to another office.
2)If John has an issue with a person, he will tell everyone else about them to sway opinion and sabotage them and their career
3)John has a tendency to need to have a person to be against. What I mean by this is that if no obvious target is available, John will find one.
4)John will make threats when he doesn't like the way things are being done. ""If you guys don't get your shit together, I will have you working double duty blah blah blah"" for example
5)John has a lot of friends in other offices, so if he writes you off, it may be very hard to find a new place to work.
6)John has lashed out with mild violence in the past (slapping hands)

The normal thing to do, I would imagine, would be to go up the chain of command and tell a superior that this is happening, but the problem is that many of Johns friends, who are also superiors in other locations, also act a similar way, and many of his superiors are friends with him and I don't necessarily trust they would take action or take it seriously. Even worse, if they were, I'm certain the information would leak out and my career would still be destroyed in the process. 

I need this job, but I feel very troubled by his actions and my own inaction in the past. When I have been the one receiving the abuse I have held myself from responding out of fear of repercussions, and when I have witnessed these things happen to other people, I have done nothing in the past (and shamefully I admit I felt relieved that it wasn't me), but the thought of working in this cycle seems hard to bear forever, and the reputation of being a rat or getting a ""good guy"" fired would follow me to other companies in this tight knit community.

163,"So I have a few friends that I usually talk to at lunch (I’m in high school). Sometimes other friends will have lunch with us but it’s usually just the same people. I’ve known one girl my entire life and then the rest I’ve known since middle school. These people are pretty much my only friends. I’m not a very social person so I don’t make friends very easily. 

For as long as I can remember my friendship with these people has been pretty toxic. We make jokes about each other and just generally have fun at other people’s expense. I don’t personally like making fun of other people it makes me feel shitty and so I don’t do it back. I’ve noticed before that my friends all seem to make fun of me more than anyone else. Like they’ll make a joke about one person and everyone will laugh and then someone will bring up something about me and they’ll spend the rest of lunch talking shit about me to my face. This probably wouldn’t bother me but it happens every single day and it’s gotten to the point where I can’t say anything without someone telling me to “shit the fuck up no one cares” or telling me that I’m annoying. Often times they’ll talk about plans they made with everyone except me and make fun of me if I ask to come or ask my I wasn’t invited. If I ever mention something about myself they’ll just tell me that they don’t care or to stop whining “like a little bitch” (they do this if I do something simple like ask for an Advil because I have a headache). I suffered with depression and anorexia for a long time and I’ve just recently gotten out of that place, they all know about it this and because of them I feel like those feeling are starting to come back. This has been happening pretty much my entire friendship with these people but it’s been getting progressively worse lately.

I did have one friend in the group that was really nice and would sometimes stick up for me if she thought they were going to far. Recently however she’s also started doing the same thing as them. Just a few days ago she looked and me and just said “god you’re ugly” out of nowhere which is something she would never have said before. I feel like I’m kinda breaking down, I don’t think I can handle this anymore, I’m sick of being the laughing stock of everyone but I also don’t want to have no friends. A few months ago I asked one of these friends if he thought I was usually the one being targeted and he said “well yeah” and when I asked why he said “ it’s because you don’t react the same as the rest of us to the jokes” I can understand what he means but at the same time I’ve tried reacting the same as everyone else but it hasn’t helped at all. To make everything worse I work with all of these people and it happens at work a lot of the time. 

I have brought up to them before that I’m really not okay with being treated like that and I don’t like being excluded. It seemed to help for a little while but they pretty quickly started getting mean again. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’m scared that if I try to tell them I don’t like it again it’s only gonna get worse and I don’t know if I can handle that. I’m also scared that I’m not going to have any friends if I bring it up again and I’m just going to be lonely which in my opinion is one of the worse feelings. Any and all advice is appreciated.

164,"Now, this is a long post, so get ready for the ride. Real questions are at the end, this is just the background.

I’m a senior in high school and I applied to only two schools, Belmont University and Samford University. I applied to both of these schools on the very last day I would be eligible for scholarships because I am such a bad procrastinator. I got into and got scholarships from both, but Samford is offering me twice of what Belmont is. After visiting the two this past week, Samford trumps Belmont financially and campus wise. 

My first problem is this: since Samford is private and very expensive, my parents can only pay for two years, and I would just have a lot of student debt from the rest.

I know this is going to sound naive, but I am fine having to pay off my student loans myself. In the long run, I might regret it, but I'd get to go to a great school while making lifelong connections.
-
(This story may sound useless, but it will give you some background and I'll mention it later.) 
This year when shopping for a prom dress I was between two dresses and I got the one everyone else in the store said I should get. But immediately after that day I had a meltdown about it and ended up having to get a new dress I love, which I didn't have access to when I bought my first one.

All my life I have struggled with trying to make decisions, and deciding which college to go to is one of the biggest decisions I will have to make.

Some may say it's good I only have two options to choose from, but in my opinion, it makes it harder because I'm limited to what I have available. But from what I know, and correct me if I'm wrong, my options could all change if I took a gap year.

Before I even started thinking about college, I researched what a gap year was and how to study abroad. Except my parents don't know anything about what a gap year is because it is not the traditional thing to do after high school.
I think once my parents learn what it is, if I would spend my time wisely, and if I would go to college after, they would be supportive of it.

Now if both of these things don't work out, I'm left with probably attending University of Arkansas Fort Smith, because it is cheap and has a decent graphic design program, which is what I will most likely study wherever I go. 

-------

This post is getting really long, and here is the point and questions I am finally getting to:

- If my parents think Samford is going to work, should I go there, and bear the student loans of it?
- If Samford doesn't let me defer a year and keep my scholarship, would I be making a mistake forfeiting it?
- Will I regret going to Samford, and it's like my prom dress situation, where I immediately regret it?
- Is taking a gap year to work, and possibly study abroad, going to be worth it? This way I can look for more colleges and get more scholarships. 
- If I do take a gap year, am I still eligible for all the scholarships next years seniors have available?

166,"So I went to a really crappy school to say the keast and ended up getting mentally and emotionally scarred from bullying and psychopathic students AND teachers. I was introduced to cutting and other very mature things I shouldn’t have been introduced to in 5th grade by some psycho girl who was my best friend up until the summer going to 8th grade. She was very emotionally unstable and toxic and so were her parents. Anyways, I ended up developing depression and anxiety from the pressure she put on me to help her deal with her ‘problems’ that 20 year olds should be dealing with.
I recently dropped out of that middle school and started online school 2nd semester. I have all As and I’m doing great education wise but my depression is worsening drastically. I keep having mood swings and tiny things set me off and I start crying when I try to express my feelings because at my old school I had to be emotionless and accept everything that happened to me. I’m also still suicidal but I doubt I’m going to do anything because I’m very close to my mom and can’t stand the thought of her hurt. 
I don’t like attention drawn to me anymore. 
Ex. I wore makeup to one of my brothers birthday dinner tonight and my family kept pointing it out. Yes they were complimenting me but it made me uncomfortable and kind of upset because I don’t wear it that often and I just felt like putting it on. 
My mood swings are always random and unexpected. I’ll be sitting on the couch and talking when someone interrupts me and I’ll get upset and shut myself in my room. I’m horrible at telling people how I feel and when I’m upset, I don’t talk and shut myself away from everyone.
I have 3 close friends. 2 are in different states and one goes to my old school but I still don’t see her a lot. We all talk and rant to each other but I wish I could see them in person.
I want to disappear so bad but I don’t want anyone to miss me. I used to be so social but now I don’t even want people to look at me, especially people my age, because I feel like they’re judging me. I just want distance myself and hopefully everyone will forget about me. I don’t know how to handle this stuff anymore. I’m seeing a therapist but she’s not helping. I’m also extremely mature for my age but still have teenage traits, ya know?
Anyway, I’m sorry this is so long and kinda scrappy but I’m just so confused and lost right now. The only thing keeping me sane is my dogs.
Also my dad lives three hours away in another state and he lives in a trailer on a freaking highway in the middle of nowhere but I don’t have the heart to tell him I hate it there and at least want to live somewhere  where I can walk around and get space without worrying about getting kidnapped or ran over.

I'll keep this short. Everything has been considered. The factors, type of experiment, the number of subjects, treatments and so on. One thing that is in my way right now is figuring out how to perform an experiment on my subjects (employers in my city).

I created two treatments for each subject.

Treatment 1- Resume with address of homeless shelter

Treatment 2- Resume without address of homeless shelter

They are similar enough to not create confounding variables but different enough to not make the employers suspicious.

Problems:

172,"I'm self aware enough to know that how I feel is a choice, and that my actions/choices have brought me to where I'm at today. I need help from the awesome reddit community.

Quick story:

Had to stop going to college to help my family with the finances after my mom had an operation go wrong and left her unable to work.  My cushion was suddenly taken away since my mom was making alot of money.  Im tossed into the real world fast and had to grow up.

&amp;#x200B;

Bills were piling up, I couldnt be a server at a restaurant anymore.  I applied to be a car salesman.  The potential to make 10,000 a month they say.  Got the job.  Been here for 4 months.  I hate the job.  Why?  I basically have to be con artist.  To make the big bucks I have to turn my heart off.  I have the skills, but not the passion and its affecting my performance.  I need the money, but my morals are being tested...

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is fucking sick, 3 family members in the Philippines got a stroke in the last 2 months and I cant even afford to send them money for support, bills are stacking, rent is due in a week, I owe taxes, and I have 1 more week to meet my quota and make money at a slow Dealership...

&amp;#x200B;

My social life is dead, Im stressed the hell out because I feel like im letting my family down, my managers down...and myself.  Man, my managers believe in me, but I just dont have that drive after seeing how it works behind the scenes...but I need money asap and cant afford to job search right now...but Im miserable as fuck being a car salesman....geez what should I do reddit?? :(

Over the past 4-is years I've noticed that I get extremely frustrated and angry at very little things, for instance a member of my family would make a small joke nothing to harmful and I'd get pissed and yell at them and then feel awful later. 

Another thing is that often when I'm in my Math class, if I don't understand something, I'm too nervous to ask my teacher and will just get increasingly more frustrated with the topic to the point where I want to scream, it feels like my chest is closing in and I'm about to cry.

This one's smaller but I have so many things that I want to do but I never do them, for no reason, and then I think back on it later and just wonder why I didn't do it.

177,"My sister is one year younger than me and we've been close all our lives. I'm not super expressive, but I try to tell her that I love her at least once a month or so. She's never once, as far back as I can remember, actually said the words ""I love you"" to me. Until recently I didn't complain about this, though it does hurt me, because I understand that it's difficult for her to express herself. She's the most introverted and closed off person I know.

I've always been the leader and she the follower and I've always done my best to take care of her, stemming from when we were little and our abusive mother left me to change her diaper and mix up formula for her. She swings unpredictably from looking to me guidance to getting angry at me for being bossy, though on the whole we get along pretty well. Or, at least, we did.

Recently a disease left me wheelchair bound and dependent on her as a caregiver. She is not handling it well. She's begun to lash out verbally without caring who hears her or who she hurts. In our arguments it's come to light that she doesn't believe me when I tell her that I love her. She says that I'm being sarcastic in order to hurt her, and that I've always done it. I'm flabbergasted and bewildered at this! I mean, all this time I've been telling her that I love her and she's seen me as some sort of sadist who only says it to hurt her?!?! It doesn't make sense.

I asked her if she thinks I'm some kind of psychopath and she says she doesn't, but surely only a psychopath would act in the way she's accusing me of acting... What should I do? How can I get her to understand and believe that I love her?

(Additional Note: Also she says that I don't treat her ""like a human being"", and that lately I treat her like a slave. She won't explain what she means by this. I treat her better than I do anyone else and I always say please and thank you. People comment on my politeness and sweet nature. I make sure she knows that any request should be done at her own convenience, and I tell her how much I appreciate what she does for me. I apologize for the more unsavory things I'm dependent on her doing for me. I'm at wits end trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong and how I can fix it though a part of me wonders if there even is a right answer. I suspect that I've spoiled her throughout our lives and now that the tables are turned she's bitter about it.)",24Mar2019,1

I am pretty deep into my first semester at my University. Transferred with my AA from a very small college in my town. I am experiencing ""transfer shock"" and am overwhelmed by the difference in work requirement/difficulty and the way things are taught. It feels much different from my smaller college and I feel super unprepared and I am very nervous. Even small assignments like discussion posts have been daunting and I feel like I appear very dumb and uneducated in my writings. One class in particular is a glimpse of what my career would be and there are so many students that seem so crazy smart and hardworking and put together and I feel very insecure about my career now. 
I have A's in everything except for this class. I am at an 89 and I have a paper due in a couple days that I feel I will bomb and drop even further. 
I could do way better. I'm not keeping up with the readings for the class, doing everything last minute BUT I am freaking out about every assignment weeks in advance. I dont know how to get myself more motivated to do anything. I feel so nervous surrounding getting good grades and managing a good GPA to get into grad school that I have not really learned anything.

190,"Loaded title question but here's some backstory, it'll be a long one. 

My team works out of two offices, for simplicity we can call them A and B. A is a capital city and B is more regional but is where the majority of our customers are (we do application support for a train control room located at B). When I started work there were 4 team members at each location including a team leader/manager at A.

I work at B. When I started work site A had a combined 30 years of experience while B could not hold onto employees and had less than 2 years experience. A was also only senior roles which were more technical while B was meant to be junior support roles. I made a lot of effort to apply myself to the role at B and show that the role of a person from A could be completed at B and to a higher standard. I have a solid IT background and my feedback could not be better. 

Two people from B left the business and a third was moved to A for a senior role. So the team was 5 (4 workers) at A and myself at B. I worked very hard and had been told by 3 team members from A that a huge surprise was coming at Christmas for me. It was hinted (and spoken plainly by all except the team leader) that I would be reclassified as an A role while continuing to work from B. Because of this I took on a lot of work from my colleagues at A for a huge new project. 

I should also note that people at A get paid two pay grades higher than B (difference of 35k annually). Because I had been doing the work of essentially two A's and a B (not an over estimation I was working a lot of overtime and feedback from the business and project was amazing) I assumed the big surprise/change at Christmas would happen. 

A new starter joined B team during September and I trained them alongside my other duties then noticed by October he was also being delegated work from those at A. This is where some changes happened, one team member at A was made redundant in early December due to a reshuffling of staff. She had a target on her back but left with 15 years of experience. After this, another team member at A left the business as they thought the team had been taking on more and more work and we were going to burn out and cause system outages for the control room. There goes another 10 years of knowledge. Before both departed I took their knowledge transfers assuming that I would be asked to step up into one of their roles. 

Christmas rolled around and my contract was made permanent with no role or grade change. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was working above and beyond by duties since May in order to justify a role change and with one redundant position and another open, and the team lacking knowledge I assumed my value would be recognised.

Fast forward to now. Another team member from A is now on maternity leave, we have a backfill position advertised for her but that's another 3 years knowledge gone from A. A also got a new starter so is now a 2 year veteran and a new starter. B also got another new starter so we have myself, a 6 month newer guy and a brand new guy. 

Since January this year I have tried to raise my concerns with the team leader and been dismissed. We at B have been told we are all going to be reclassified to be called the same as A but pay equality likely will not happen - pay gap may shrink to 1 grade instead of 2 difference. I had to go to HR and request written responses to my concerns in order to get a response. During this time since January I feel I have been treated differently with my team leader avoiding me. 

I finally got a response from my team leader on Friday which was basically ""I've been very busy and HR made me realise I've been neglecting people from B especially OP. I appreciate you've been doing the work for so long. I have submitted a request for more money and have justification for a case for grade change so by end of financial year (by July 1st) you should be at least 1 grade higher but I have requested 2. Sorry I haven't been showing appreciation"". 

I should also mention the company is pushing for regionalisation and putting more employees in the regions which may have had a bearing on the response from my team leader. So Friday hits me like a wall of relief, that something is being done and I can expect a path to equality from July onwards. I have not felt this happy in a long time and feel as though the walls between me and team leader have melted away and we are back to the days of banter and friendship outside of work. 

I should also mention I love the work I do. I love the challenge and taking on all the work. I love honing my skills and improving them and feel I have knowledge that my team would be lost without. I have become an unofficial senior and with the lack of knowledge all round currently I feel I am appreciated by our customers and my colleagues. I should also mention I work alternating shifts (not 24 hours but morning/day/evening and alternating weekly). 

Now onto the dilemma (finally!). Friday afternoon once I left work I got a call from recruitment and have been offered a 12 month secondment within the company (returning to my position at the end of 12 months). The position does not seem to be as interesting as my current role but pays 2 pay grades higher plus is only day shifts. In my personal life the extra money would be immensely beneficial. 

So my question is should I take the secondment? Does it make me a bad person after all I went through to get a (possible not confirmed in any way) bit of recognition and equality to leave for 12 months? By then if I come back to my position I'd likely be looking to go elsewhere again as I fear this would cause another rift with my team leader. 

We also have another big project due in 2 months with a metric shit tonne of work to do on it and don't believe the team can do it without me. Reddit please give me some advice, I'm out for the afternoon but will respond if needed later on.

I have an appointment with the counseling center at my college on April 15th (the earliest they could get me in unless I marked it as a crisis, which I don't think it is), but I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to properly express the things I'm feeling to a counselor because it's so hard for me to show that I'm not doing okay in front of ""real adults"" aka not students/peers. I've just been struggling a lot in over the last couple months. I've dealt with anxiety my whole life, but it just escalated to another level recently out of nowhere and hasn't come back down. I'm also not suicidal, just to put that out there. I have aspirations and goals and I really like living and doing things, and dying is not something I view as an option.

Basically, I'm extremely self-conscious about who I am and how I act. I care immensely about what other people think of me and the idea of doing anything that would annoy someone or make think negatively of me in any way terrifies me. And I know that's dumb, because nobody is perfect and not everybody is going to like everybody else. But even though I feel this way, I love being around people and I'm also super impulsive and loud, so I never seem self-conscious and insecure at first when people meet me. I have ADHD, which I don't like using as an excuse, but it contributes to the way I act a lot of the time. I sometimes tend to interrupt or talk to loudly or talk at times that I shouldn't be talking, and those are all things that I'm super insecure about because I know that they annoy people. I try to work on them, but every time something like that happens I just want to curl up in a ball and disappear. It's really hard for me to let little things that happen go because I feel like I'm just a burden to everyone else and that I'm annoying them.

I also have this intense fear other people view me the same as they view people that I know they don't like, if that makes any sense. There are people I know that I don't care for and that many of my friends don't care for either, and I tend to see a lot of similarities between myself and those people, which makes me feel both super insecure and like a hypocrite because I'm so scared of people viewing me the way I view someone else. I just always see the things I don't like about other people in myself, and it's just really taking a toll I guess. And I feel like the things I hate about myself are things that are so ingrained in who I am and I don't want them to be, but it just makes me hate who I am.

One thing I'm really insecure about is how much I overshare and get emotional around other people. I've lost friends over the years because I would make things about myself in one way or another, which I really don't want to do and am trying to fix. But every time I do bring something up about myself or how I'm struggling, I feel immediately guilty and even more anxious. This causes me to have terrible, circular anxiety attacks because I'm so terrified of people leaving me because of my anxiety/me talking about it. I'll feel like my anxiety is a burden to people, which can cause an anxiety attack, which makes me feel like more of a burden, which makes the anxiety attack worse. It's a vicious cycle.

Anyway,
I am currently a flight school student (15yo. Freshman year of high school) and I am currently looking to become a commercial pilot. There is one problem.

I’m colorblind (red green colorblind).

I currently have passed my FAA medical for 5 years, but I was wondering for any advice, or ways, that I could get by this difficulty, or if their is any medical procedure that could fix this issue (that isn’t eating my carrots). I have heard of some test that I can do at the FAA facilities that I take once and never have to do again, but I’m not really sure if that’s real, and I forget if it was my parents, or the medical examiner that told me. I’m not incredible at the issihara (not quite sure how it’s spelled) test (the ones with the dots and numbers) and I got a 3/5 on it for my last medical, aka, just passing. I have hear that the farnsworth lamp test is easier, but I’m not sure. Currently I have met two adults in my life who have been working to get their license, but either colorblindness, or other health issues have held them back, and I don’t want to end up like them, not that they have bad jobs, but I would like to pursue a career in aviation, specifically the commercial pilot route.
Any advice on this?",24Mar2019,1
203,"Recently i feel as me and my girlfriend aren’t really feeling how we used to about each-other. were going on 5 months and I still love her i just feel like I’m giving 100% and she’s giving 20%. to me in a relationship it takes both giving 100% for it to be healthy and she just isn’t acting how she used to. I’d like to say i know her pretty well but she’s been acting shady lately. things like not saying goodnight then turning her location off at night, which is something she doesn’t normally do. Lately she’s been obviously ignoring my texts and going random places giving me no clue as to what she could be doing. this could very well just be me worrying as i’ve been cheated on before and have had trust issues ever since, i try hard to ignore those thoughts as she’s been loyal to me the whole time we’ve been together, so i have no reason to believe she would ever cheat. I don’t mean to sound crazy when i say she turns off her location, she has her snapmap on which tells you when the last time they were on it and their location, so its possible for me to see if shes ignoring my texts, i just find it strange how she doesn’t say goodnight like she usually does then goes on to turn off her location and ghost me till the next morning. i don’t want to mention this to her to seem crazy cause i don’t want her to think i don’t trust her and make the relationship unhealthy, any advice? i appreciate it.

204,"So at my school if you are in the top area of your sports code you earn the right to buy a ""Premier"" sports jacket with the name of the sport you achieved it on it. Now I just did a massive event today as part of this sport (maybe the equivalent of a half marathon for running?) and this was the only opportunity the school gives you to earn the jacket, assuming you complete it within a certain time threshold. Now there's only been two organised trainings THIS YEAR so far, none of which came close to the distance and and we basically had to babysit this new kid the entire time because he'd never done it before. Now my friend, who already has it, said he may be able to say he lost his and buy a new one and give it to me, and getting this jacket was my whole goal. And bearing in mind this event was something quite literally impossible for anyone just average at the sport to complete, and I did do a bit (but not enough) training to get in shape for it. I really want this jacket and I plan on training a bunch throughout the whole year anyway, and I'm also going to the gym a lot and I believe if it was on at the end of the year I should definitely be able to go fast enough to earn it, it's just the school won't hold any other events for it so I've missed my only chance. Should I go ahead and get it off my friend and continue to train and put myself in a physical position where I would be fast enough to get it anyway, or just leave it? This is my last year at school and I really wanted something that would show I contributed something special and I really wanted the jacket, and I've been involved with the sport for years and years. Also, there's 0 chance I'd be able to convince the school to organise another event later in the year for me to get this. What should I do?",24Mar2019,2

207,"Okay this will require a bit of context. I’m currently in highschool and I’m gay (or lesbian if it’s confusing) and I went through a very rough and emotionally draining breakup a few months ago which is still affecting me because I deeply cared about said person. I’m also ungodly loyal so even though we aren’t even together i essentially vowed not to date anyone for the rest of highschool (Ik it’s dumb okay leave me alone). And finally I receive a lot of invalidation from my family about being gay because I’m “too young to know what I want yet” and whatnot. 

Now onto what I’m actually here for. So i have this really close friend who is a guy we’ll call him Zorgon. So Zorgon is older than me and straight. It’s been a few months since my ex and I broke up and so I’ve been rather lonely and depressed as well I long for companionship. And going back to the whole invalidation thing earlier that shit really gets to me and makes me unsure about something I’m so confident in. So one day I ask Zorgon about if he’d ever hook up with me, and I’ll spare you the details but my question was answered that night. And I found out two things, I am certainly not into guys, and that I certainly don’t like him in that way. I talked to him about it and how I just wanted to be friends and whatnot (we discussed why I even did any of that beforehand so I didn’t lead him on or anything) and he said it’d simply be over. That only lasted for a few days, now every time we hang out he gets all touchy feely with me and acts as if we’re a couple or something, even though I brought up how I didn’t want to do that with him, but now I’m trapped in this and I don’t know what to do. He’s a good friend and I love him dearly, but I really don’t like having to deal with him trying to grope me or awkwardly flirt with me. And not to mention I feel an extreme guilt towards my ex because I feel as if I let her down by being with another person if that makes any sense.

208,"Long time lurker for the most part, sorry if this breaks any rules or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been struggling recently with my mental health. While I'm not suicidal, something definitely feels off. I just turned 21 and am attending my state university. In high school, I had lots of friends. I played sports, was very involved, and did well academically. I graduated with high hopes for college. Once I got to campus however, I had trouble making friends and finding any interests. I got a job that I love, and enjoyed most of my classes, but still found myself struggling to make grades. I actually failed my first class that first semester.

Most of the time, I am just too tired to do anything or focus on anything. My job requires me to get up around 5 am most mornings and work until around noon. Then I have class until about mid afternoon, but I often find myself unable to stay awake in class, no matter how much coffee I have. It's like I'm a zombie unless I get at least eight hours of sleep, which rarely happens as I am unable to fall asleep on time no matter how hard I try. I have tried almost everything to get to bed on time, but no matter what I always seems to be laying awake with my eyes closed for at least an hour. 

I know what it is to be a functional student. Go to class, do homework, and study outside of class. However, when I do have free time, which is mostly in the evenings, I always find myself scrolling through reddit or twitter. I've tried deleting these apps, but every time I redownload them a few days later. I just can't seem to bring myself to do the things I know I need to do. I usually wait until the night before assignments are due to start them, which really makes my life suck that night.

I really really want to be a functional member of my school and society. I don't know why it's so hard for me to get myself going on these things. I know I need to do them and I tell myself how nice it would be if I did start them earlier in the week, but no matter what I try I always seem to procrastinate. I have just recently started seeing a therapist about these issues (about two months) but it hasn't really made any difference. I just feel really unmotivated and sluggish, all the time.

I was so passionate about life when I was younger, and I just want that back. Any advice is welcome.",24Mar2019,1
209,"Welp, long story short im a physics major(and math because it's basically the same courses) that was historically bad at math in highschool. I didnt try at all and thus learned very little. I am now currently taking advanced algebra and trig at the same time and am generally doing well on my homework. Of 29 assignments I have a 94% average. I feel that I know this stuff but I have an exam average of 55% I get to the test and it's as if I've never seen it before. I'm trying to be easy on myself but at the same time be real. I do occasionally look up simalar questions to my homework problems and follow along to solve some of them. And I do feel pretty good with the material. The problem now is I must get a 90% on the next 2 exams and the final to pass with an A. I love physics and have even done a research internship which made me love it even more. I'm constantly looking forward at the math ahead and try my best to understand it with the knowledge I have now. But looking at these exam scores it's been very demotivating and I'm having thoughts of giving up what I love. Anyone been in this situation? Any tips? Also I have an entrance interview for a special school program coming up, it's basically for financially unstable students as well as students that have disabilities. There are other requirements but those are the big ones. They offer speciized tutoring and coaching so fingers crossed I get in. The tutors so far are not helping me.

I’ve always been scared of open nooks in my house (i.e. closets, under the bed, behind the sofa) but it feels like it’s escalating as I’m an adult and have since been living alone. It’s starting to affect my life enough, where I can’t go to bed without checking under it and inside all my closets. I’ve even checked that it’s physically impossible for a regular sized adult to get under the bed but I still have the fear that something is down there. Even as I’m moving my head down I always have a moment of fear that something might be there. 

Other fears include the dark, thinking something will pop up in the mirror when I’m using it, something is hiding behind the shower curtain, front door is inexplicably unlocked or that someone will try to break in (I live in a pretty safe suburb currently). As you can imagine, I’m now spending a lot of time at night doing all these checks to comfort my mind.

I simply have no interest in doing this. I do not feel as though we have anything in common and I do not even feel totally comfortable around them. I really don’t even like the personality the one girl who usually is the one asking me to hang out. 

I always decline their invitations. When asked why I say I just do not want to do that. I never lead them on and say “maybe.”

224,"To give a bit of background. I'm 22F. I grew up in an extremely conservative Catholic household. Got forced to join the choir at a young age. Went to Church every week. If I said no, my parents would tell me that I would be damned and that I'm ungrateful. I always disliked the religion because of how closeted the preachers (priests) are wherever I go. I just knew it wasn't for me since the beginning. My parents believe that drinking, going out too much, having grand ambitions in life, and premarital sex are all the devil. I am involved in all of those ever since I moved out for college. I don't think it has negatively interfered with my life in any way. 

I moved out of our home last year to pursue my postgraduate in a different country. Since I mentioned, when I moved out for college, I already realized how the religion just isn't for me. Now that I've been away for a year, the thoughts just get stronger. 

Here's the thing. My parents still ask me if I went to Sunday church. I say yes all the time even though I haven't been in one for four years now. This is mostly catholic guilt. And every time I tell before that I would miss it to try to see their reaction (I would say I have school for instance or academic stuff that I needed to do), they would make me feel guilty. Tell me I'm directionless, ungrateful, and that if I continue, the Lord won't be happy - or some shit like that. 

The thing is, aside from all this religious stuff, my parents are nice people. Aside from verbal abuse in the past (ie. getting called stupid - sometimes my mom also hit me), I think our relationship when I go a bit older got better. My dad works hard for us my entire life. And I appreciate it all. I hate living a lie. I hate needing to lie all the time to my parents. I hate that I needed to go to a different country just to be free from them (although I love it now and am planning to stay here long term). It's just catching up to me now. I just hate living a lie and needing to make up some story about why I couldn't reply to them at 9 pm (went out drinking with friends usually). I hate it all. I don't even think my parents actually know me as a person because I tried so hard to pretend to be someone I'm not to make them proud and to not be called names. 

Now I just want to come out clean. I waited this long because I know have a stable job, live overseas and am building a career away from them. I'm fully independent now from them financially. I just want to settle this to ease myself. I don't want to continue lying. 

How would you suggest that I approach this?

Friend = A

Friend's Sister = K

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past couple years, my friend A and her family have been having a lot of trouble with K, A's 12-year-old stepsister.  According to A, K is depressed, suicidal, has run away multiple times, has cut herself multiple times, has stolen money from family members, dresses extremely provocatively, and has behaved extremely promiscuously (Recently she had a run-in with a predator online and snuck out to meet him in person.  Police were involved.  After this was resolved, K stole her parent's phone and snuck out to meet with said predator a second time).  A lot of K's behavior matches up with those listed as the warning signs of a sexually abused child.  Also, K's behavior had gone on before K's run-in with the predator, so I'm worried something else might've happened earlier on in her life to incite this.  The possibility of an earlier incident is what I'm considering bringing to A's attention.

&amp;#x200B;

I have absolutely no proof that K has been sexually abused.  I haven't even seen K in a number of years, and even if I did see her I have no experience in this so I doubt I'd be able to gain any additional clues.  Everything I've heard about what's happening has come from A, and obviously I'm completely uninvolved in any of her personal family matters.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I know I should tell A, because even if I'm wrong about this and did say something, it would be a lot better than if I was right and didn't say anything.  Because it's so serious, however, I'm really scared to get involved, because I feel as if it's something I shouldn't stick my nose into.  I literally have no personal connection to K whatsoever and I would be acting entirely on a hunch.  I'm worried that if I tell A and she brings it up with K, and my hunch ends up being wrong, then K might lash out at A and make the situation even worse for their family.  Most selfishly of all, I'm worried bringing this up could somehow end my friendship with A, regardless of whether I'm right or wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

If I do tell A, how would I do it?  We rarely talk about our family problems with each other unless something extreme has happened, and I don't want to wait for something like that to spring this on her when I'm already suspecting it now, but I feel like it would seem weird for me to bring it up out of the blue, especially since I literally only have an internet search about the warning signs of sexual abuse in children to serve as proof.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do, Reddit?  Is this even my issue to bring up?  If it is, how should I talk to A about it?",24Mar2019,1

245,"This is going to be a LONG backstory but please bear with me. So I'm an 18 year old guy who lives with my parents when I'm not at college. My dad is a 36 year old man who was a 3 sport captain, prom king, and very handsome guy. Here's the surprise: he never did drugs, he never got drunk, and only had one girlfriend(my mom) and lost his virginity after marriage. His dad wasn't too strict and would let him go out and have fun and party. My dad went to parties but wasn't a partier at all and he couldn't care less about them. Now as a dad he holds me at his own standards with extra bs on the side. In high school I had a bedtime of 10 and if I wanted to stay up late and procracinate he'd make me go to bed and say you shouldn't have procracinated then and my grades would suffer and he'd be ready to get mad at me at the end of the grading period. I had to turn in my phone afterschool with no password everyday until the day I left for college. I still only have a permit because he made me wait until I was 18 and now coming back during BREAKS I have to sleep by 12 and wake up by 9. He doesn't mind me going out during the day but at night he's not willing for me to go out aside from a movie, which must end by 11. Whenever I try to argue(calmly), he blows up in my face with adrenaline and I'm always instantly in the wrong with him ""about to knock me out""(undermind this because he's never gone through with it although he makes the same threat when boiling for no fucking reason to intimidate me)(if he ever does it I'm gonna file abuse or some shit) but even if he doesn't he still layers on ridiculous punishments when it comes to groundings(months, early bedtimes, no new clothes, no watching t.v. and other basic wants parents should provide like eating out and dessert), and will pretty much do everything in his parental power to ""put me in my place"". Aside from all this, at college I party, I smoke weed, drink, all the fun stuff (within being reasonably smart and safe) and I'm even joining a fraternity behind my parents back. So back to the curfew and I tried to argue that I'm almost 19 I should have more freedom and he argued that it's about the respect of the house and so I don't keep him or my brother up(who is 10 and I share a room with). He said as long as I live here I have to respect that. Another thing I forgot to say is my dad is a super light sleeper because 1. he's had a kid under the age 2 for about 10 years now 2. He ""has to stay vigilant at night as a dad's role of keeping the family safe""(we live in a nice ass neighborhood with an alarm system) and 3. He has sensitive hearing so he can hear things a lot better. For example, I can't play games because he can hear my buttons clicking from his bed. Here's another thing:he doesn't allow close doors so at night all doors are open(so he can hear things even better) . Our house is average size and silent at night(aside from when the fan auto turns on which there's a little steath in sound) and it has an alarm system⚰️. Now my parents think I'm the cleanest boy in the world(maybe a couple drinks at most at parties at college, no drugs, smoke, or going crazy). I want to sneak out, I think the magnet method might work with the alarm things but my window would be impossible with the screen and blinds and in combination with open doors, my dad's hearing, the distance from his room(maybe like a 50-75 foot hallway and the somewhat loudness of the door closing I think it would be very difficult to sneak through the front door. The garage door is a little farther(maybe extra 20 feet) and maybe just as quiet or quieter so that would probably be a better option. So my question is should I try to sneak out during the summertime considering getting caught would result in monumental punishments and how should I go about it if I should(any tips).?Also any idea at all at how to fix this situation or get something better in my favor? The ultimate goal for me is to move out during sophomore year summer of course but that's going to be difficult financially unless I can figure something out but until I can move out what should I do? If you made this far I want to give you my greatest thanks and thanks for the extra minds.",24Mar2019,2

He came to my house and found out I was rich and so I’m guessing that’s why he asked me if he could borrow $120 and told me this whole problem he had and why he needed it, and he said he’d be grounded if he didn’t give it to his mom (since he usually gives his paychecks to his mom I guess). Anyways I told him I couldn’t do that so he supposedly got grounded and got his phone taken, but I caught him watching my friend’s story on social media, meaning he had his phone? Now I’m thinking all of this was just a plot to get me to give him some money and even though he said he’d pay me back, I doubt that now. I texted him today, “so how long r u grounded?” and I’m still waiting on a reply, but I feel like anything he says could be a lie if he truly is manipulating me. I thought we were good friends since I found out so much about him through text, and even though we have a class together we don’t talk in that class... He didn’t even know I was rich in the first place and our plan was just to hookup sometimes.

I had a girlfriend my freshman and sophomore year of high school but towards the beginning of my junior year I broke up with her. I started partying with new people and met this other girl. We ended up hooking up a few times and she started telling people we were exclusively talking. Keep in mind we barely text unless if it’s to see what we’re doing that night. So for her to say we are exclusively talking is totally unreasonable. I took the first sign and stopped talking to her. Ever since then she will not leave me alone. Several texts a day asking what i’m doing. If we happen to be at the same party she traps me in a closet and won’t let me leave unless i talk to her for a little bit and tell her what she wants to hear. I realized after the first time of her trapping me in the closet I needed a desperate escape plan from my already failed escape plan. So i cut off all communication, I blocked her on everything, she still finds a way to get things to me either through my friends or other means. fast forward to tonight, my ex took me home from a party (we are still on good terms and stayed friends through everything) so she took me home and came in to hangout for a little before going to bed. Eventually she leaves and I get a text from someone, it’s the psycho girls friend. it said something along the lines of why didn’t u hangout with me tonight, I responded with I didn’t know we had plans, I went to a party.

- I joke around in class
- I procrastinate: I wait to long to do important things.
- I am lazy: I always want someone else to do it. This might not be related however.

Like we started humping each other’s legs?? Then we took our pants off and I don’t remember what happened after that. I don’t know if we touched each other, but soon after my mom came in and we split apart from each other. We obviously knew it was wrong?? We pulled up our pants and my mom just .. left or something?

So today I was in the train, in a foreign country, and just before the conductor closes the door (they still do that manually here in Belgium), a lady was talking to the conductor, but the later was not responding ... she was saying goodbye to someone in the train, and stood outside. It seems that she was making sure of the destination for her friend, but I can't be sure.

I didn't understand the question, but the conductor replied: ""no no too late"". And continued to close the doors in her face, whilst she was still talking!!

Okay, so I didn't know what to say, and what to do. Basically the two friends look foreigners, very poor or had a really bad night (clothing wise), but hey, fuck the conductor for treating them this badly if that was the reason ... But I said no, maybe I have to give the conductor the benefits of the doubt.

Keep in mind it's Sundays morning, and this the ""slow"" train, and delays here are the norms, and the trains was not late yet .... 

After closing the doors and the train starts moving, she heads directly to that friend as ask for his ticket. Wtf, she did not ask anyone else in the whole train!!!!!

Yesterday I found out that he was stealing a lot of money from my card, that's how fucking sorry he was, so he would pay for his video games. He tryed lying to my face, until I presented my evidence, then he admitted to doing so because ""he's addicted, he has a problem and he would steal from me when he got mad at me for reasons"".

My friend has been unable to get a job for years due to depression and traumatic side effects of abuse. Due to this she has been forced to live with her mother even though there are issues between them which I will get to later. Her mother blames her for her divorce from an abusive man when she told her mother how the man would beat her and say sexual things to her for as long as she could remember having eventually gotten a restraining order to see the man gone from her life. Her brother still sees the man and has been becoming more and more like the man himself which is causing more problems for her with his disregard for her. Her mother has threatened to kick her out for years but she has nowhere to go. She cannot get a job due to the fact of her incredibly heavy depression and that she begins feeling physically ill when in public or with others. She started livestreaming playing games and doing crafts and art which she is incredibly talented at. The issue is due to her depression she always puts herself down and gives up. She has gone to therapy for years but her therapist has given up on her and the two outlets she still has are me and her pet. She has been getting more and more terrified of her mother removing her due to having nowhere to go and for her pets well being that her mother has wanted to get rid of any chance she got.

I just want to say that she has a friend that lives with us and he does nothing but driving her, but sometimes he does everything to avoid it. Every Saturday I take out the trash and I help with heavy things whenever she asks. I do correctly everything she asks. But now, I don't even go to the toilets because sometimes she is complaining when cleaning it, like it's my fault that it's dirty, even if I do noy use it anymore, and she is the only one (with her friend that is really gross) to use it like every 30mn. I don't eat at lunch anymore when I stay at home thr weekend because she is complaining about buying things, etc... When she is hungry, she buys breads and tells me that it's because I am hungry whereas I didn't ask for anything. I am just doing my things in silence in my room. Sometimes I clean the house when I am alone, but she and her friend come and eat chips everywhere and just fucking everything up. I wash the dishes to when I can, but she does not want people to wash dishes at night, so, when I go to university and shr does not work, she does it and then complain. 

Now, I can't take it anymore, I can't even sleep in peace or even doing anything without some remarks or thing like that. I really try to not bother her as much as I can, I am here only during the night and weekends, and I take the train to university really early in the morning (6Am) just to be far from her as much as I can. I don't even want to talk anymore, because I feel like the one that just fucked someone else's life. 

I really want to move but I don't know how to tell my family and her. I don't want to hurt my mother about this history and my grandma neither.

Sorry guys, I didn't realize it will be that long but it's the first time I am sharing it. Living it everyday is just hell.

271,"Bit of a backstory here. I'm 15M and I have a shitty phone that I can only use to make calls and text. I don't have a smartphone but I really need one. I started High School about a year ago and realized that our teachers actually depend on us having smartphones. They give out video assignments that I can't complete or they want us to take a picture of the white board instead of writing it down to move on with the class quicker. I'm also in a robotics club where you need to attend the club regularly but we have no regular schedule so all communication about when we are going to meet is done through whatsapp. I've started involuntarily missing the club because of the lack of a smartphone. How do I go about convincing my dad to let me buy a phone? He still uses an iPhone 4S and thinks that me getting a smartphone is going to distract me from my studies. I'm willing to make a deal with him about how I would use my shitty current phone instead of a smartphone during exam week, how I could pay half the price of the smartphone and kill any further concerns he might have about me playing on a smartphone too much by keeping the phone outside of my room at night so he won't have suspicions about me playing on my phone at night. Besides high school has changed me and I honestly feel much more responsible and think I have much more self control than I did a year ago. I'd appreciate any kind of help about how to convince my dad to let me get a new phone. Thanks in advance.",24Mar2019,2
272,"I am 17, a year ago I graduated high school to pursue a career in the culinary arts. I am currently studying at a prestegious culinary school and am currently working as a Chef. 

I went to the supermarket with my mother to do our grocery shopping, at that particular supermarket worked a girl who is the daughter of my mother's coworker. We ran into eachother and started talking as it had been almost a year since we last met. She complimented me on getting taller and losing weight, (I'm a big guy, 6'2, 2XL.) I was wearing my work uniform at the time and we got to talking about work. I jokingly said that they made the supermarket staff wear black because it hid the dirt. She jokingly replied that I must've had great hygiene then. (As my uniform is white) and I pointed out a stain on it. We laughed for a while and she asked me if I was working as a chef now. I said yes and she responded by suggesting that I cook dinner for her sometime. I replied ""haha, maybe"" and left it at that. 

I am not amazingly experienced with women and I'm not sure if she meant it in a romantic or a friendly way. Furthermore, we don't speak often, and she has no social medias that I know of. I am generally considered a charming person but I don't usually get many romantic oppurtunities so I don't want to miss my chance.

Anyway we somehow managed to keep in contact, got really close(think situationship) it felt wrong to us and she ended it but we were still friends. The kind of friends that spoke everyday without fail and it felt great.

I really cared for her, felt like she got me and vice versa, she opened up to me about her life, traumatic past and we were open and trusted each other. Like a best friend (with some unresolved feelings).

When I saw him his hair was oily so I asked him when was the last time he showered. I ended up learning this man showers and brushes his teeth once maybe every five days or so (and this is what he tells me, it might be worse).

I’m just worried for him since neither mine or my parents words can get through to him long term. Like I told him about my concerns for him today but at this point he finds any word that my parents or I say to be nagging and he will be like “yea yea whatever”. He’ll shower and take care of basic hygiene if we mention/remind him but otherwise he doesn’t seem to care or understand the consequences of poor hygiene.

This has been going on for years now and I thought it was a maturity thing (maybe it still is?) but these poor habits are concerning. Same thing goes with his academics, if we push him he’ll work hard for one night, otherwise he just lies down on his bed playing games and watches YouTube from his phone and procrastinate. I told him I worry for his hygiene and only want the best for him, and hopefully it resonates to him, but if it doesn’t, what should my parents or I do to get through to him?",24Mar2019,1

My older sister is 26 this year, she has had it tough over her life with my dad being resentful and she got bullied terribly in high school. But what I assume is from all that trauma my dad and being bullied has done she finds it's difficult to socialise, she has low confidence, terrible anxiety where she can barely leave the house, she has weight issues becaue she is depressed and she doesn't want to face the real world. All she wants to do is play video games and talk to her online friends which I love because it gets her talking to people. But she is 26 who has never had a partner, has never had a job and who has no real life friends. I do whatever I can for my older sister with helping my mum with rent and helping her with bills whenever I can. But recently my mum got diagnosed with cancer and I don't know what will happen if something happens to my mum. I'm just a 23 year old who works to support myself, my partner and help my mum where I can. If something were to happen I don't know what i would do. I've tried helping her by getting her to see a psychologist to help her with her anxiety and i got her into a job centre where they do what they can with what they have. But I feel like the world had given up on her and now she has given up on the world.
I hate seeing my sister like this, but I don't know what to do.
Luckily my direct family is supportive and we are all trying to help her with her confidence but we are stuck.

I just need advice. How can I help my sister who has crippling anxiety, no job experience, no social skills and no peers.

Come visitation time, it turns out that the days she said she'd make time to be with me she didn't take off, her response was like well 'I have to work' and shrugged it off. I was kinda pissed but I'm like well okay let me try and salvage this.

Full disclosure, after that I sent some flirty messages which she wasn't happy about and I owned up to it and we talked and seemingly got over it. We had this thing about being honest with each other.

We made a lot of plans to do things together with her and her family which didn't happen but specifically we made a plan to go to her daughter's b'day party but the day before that she told me the venue was flooded so they had to postpone ( she didn't invite her boyfriend either btw). So I take her word for it because it seems rational.

Anyway the trip was a disaster from the onset, if she didn't want to see me she would have just said something and I would have been fine disappointed but fine. I was reallt pissed off as I made a huge effort booked a place for 1 week and I had paid for it and if she would have been honest from the get go, I would have adjusted my plans, visited other countries and enjoyed myself instead I was stuck in a place I've been to before when I could have been out exploring other places.

I come back and I thought about the trip and the various inconsistencies in her story for about a month (especially the b'day event) because I thought this was a weird thing to lie about. I felt like I was going crazy, so I did some digging, went through her best friends social media and find out that she did indeed like because her friend psoted picture's from the b'day during the period I was around.

I was hurt and I asked her when she had the party and she said that she had it at a later date , and sent me identical photos to the one her friend posted. I finally mustered the courage and asked her if she lied and she flat out denied it for a long time and accused me of believeing she would do something outrageous. This hurt our friendship and communication got less and it seemed one sided. I was still pissed off so I sent her the screenshot, finally she came clean and said it was a small white lie but then called me a creep for having gone through her friends social media. 
 Our relationship breaks down, we didn't speak for a while and i delete her off my phone and social media because I was hurt and didn't understand why she couldn't just be open and honest with me. Then later on, I start missing her then I throw a white flag and we talk and I ask if we could be friends again which she said no chance and proceeds to block me off everything but not my number.

A few weeks later, I reach out to her on whatsapp and I ask again if we could try to be friends she said yes but she ignores me everytime and I get fed up. I message her and she blocks me and it hurt and I know that relationship is broken but I still don't understand her.



My question is: was I wrong? In hindsight did I come across as creepy?. Please kind people on the internet please help me understand this, this is a first time I've had this kind of scenario and I want to prevent this.

They have a home-built 'range' which happens to be perfectly parallel with our property. So every weekend he and his buddies shoot their guns from sun-up almost to sun set both days. They also set off Tannerite frequently. We have animals and the constant percussives irritate them. Especially my horse, Tannerite in particular makes him freak out. He bucks/bolts/rears and is going to hurt himself or put himself through a fence. I'm terrified to ride him on our land because if they start shooting I'm scared he'll toss me and I'll end up injured or killed, or he'll run himself into trouble. We've spoken to them twice, but they still don't give us a heads up so we can try and prepare. I've had a trainer work with him, but she says there isn't much she can do to help with his fear of explosives, it's not an irrational fear like a plastic bag which she could desensitize him to.

He is not very good with technology so I set up the ‘find my friends’ app on his phone. One night when he said he was working late and wouldn’t be back till the early hours of the morning. I knew something wasn’t right at this point because there was literally no reason for a sales manager to be working until 2am. Also he has never really had to work this late before this frequently..... 



So I checked the find my friends app and it clocked that he was at my brothers house which is weird. But me and my brother are really close, he was literally like my best mate and I trusted him with my life. So I got excited thinking that it might be a proposal in the midst because I always said that he had to ask my bros permission, hence the distance so I stupidly left it.... 


But then the next night he said the same thing, and then the week after again. Every time I check the ‘find my friends’ app he was always at my brothers. It doesn’t take 3 nights to ask someone permission to marry their sister. So I drove past. 


I pulled up and sure enough my bfs car was in the drive, I got out to knock on the door and through the curtains I could see they were both naked, curled up on the fucking sofa watching GOT. I immediately threw up and ran to my car! 


When he got home, I pretended to be asleep he, got into our bed (without showering) i’m lost...

289,"So I'm currently doing my third teaching practice for my teacher studies. It is a two month long practice and I have now completed two weeks of it. However, I am extremely stressed and feel anxious 24/7 because I'm not sure if I have chosen the right career path for myself. Thus, I need your help Reddit.

The pros for completing teacher studies:
- I major in English literature and my minors are Japanese and anthropology. You can imagine how difficult it is to find a job with this type of degree in Finland. Thus, completing the pedagogical studies would help me find a job either as an English teacher or for example in various companies because here companies often hire people who have completed pedagogical studies to run projects etc. 
- I have mostly completed my pedagogical studies. After this practice I will have two more courses and then I'm done.

The cons:
- The amount of anxiety and stress I'm currently experiencing is UNREAL. I feel anxious all the time and before I have a class to teach I can't eat or drink or function properly. The teaching practice and all the deadlines are bothering me constantly and I can't focus on having fun or hanging out with my friends. 
- I don't want to teach children or teens. Because most teacher are employed in primary and secondary education it seems like my only job option but I don't want to work in a ""regular"" teaching position. I have no idea what I want to do but I do know that is not it. 

I'm sure I could think of more pros and cons but I'll keep this post short. I just want to hear other peoples opinions about my situation because I'm very lost and I feel like noone around me understands how difficult this is for me.",24Mar2019,1

She has attempted suicide MANY times, and spent so much time in hospital. She claims it doesn’t help, and it will never help. Her family life is awful as well; her mom is a total bitch and her dad is dying of cancer. Fucked, right?

Some back story: (We are all 19 years old) She has a lot of mental illnesses, and she is a compulsive liar. my other best friend (let’s call her A) and I have a very hard time maintaining our friendship with this girl because of her behaviour. She lies to us and manipulates us all the time. And every time we are too busy to spend time with her she basically threatens to kill herself. A and I are extremely fed up with the lying and manipulation. She has tricked us into ending friendships with a few different people by saying they were awful to her, when I have recently found out it was all lies. I have no clue if she understands what she is doing or not. I think she has good intentions and I know she really does love us, but sometimes it’s so hard to deal with her... 

A couple years ago, when we weren’t as close, she lied to me, telling me she was being kicked out. In a panic I got my parents to agree to LET HER LIVE WITH US. only lasted a month because she was so poorly behaved (leaving messes in our house, being loud, having people over despite my parents asking her not to... etc). I literally had to spend a whole therapy session talking about what to do. Then a while later I found out she was never kicked out to begin with ... but we got over this. It seemed she was apologetic. 

Currently i am out of the country and she tried to kill herself a few days ago, ending up in hospital. It is extremely tolling on me to constantly be worried if my friend is going to kill herself. It may seem selfish that I am complaining, but this has been going on for years. Every time I don’t hear from her for a while I am worried I will get a call that she has finally killed herself. A is extremely busy as well, between school and 2 jobs, so we don’t have that much time to spend with our friend, whereas she doesn’t work or go to school so she tries to demand our attention all the time. I would honestly really like to cut her out of my life (because she treats me horribly), but she has like no other friends and I know she will kill herself if she is left alone.

291,"This is my first post here. It is very long, sorry in advance but TL;DR at bottom.

About four months ago I was fired from my casual position at my workplace. I had only been working there a few months but I loved the job and was friends with everyone there. I truly see myself as a hard worker and someone who is just enthusiastic to learn new skills. I thought I was doing well, and getting along with everyone. Then my shifts rapidly decreased from one week to the next and I had a gut feeling that something had happened or I had done something I maybe did not pick up on. I discussed this with a workmate who was also my friend and was having a few issues with management themselves. They suggested I be honest and try and talk to my manager about the situation and ask what I did wrong and what I could do to fix it. I was committed to doing this as I loved my job and was dedicated to showing them that I want to be able to do as best a job I can. I texted my manager the next morning asking if I could come in to chat about a few things I was concerned with. She never responded and a few hours later called and fired me. 

It was the biggest shock and was so heartbreaking. She informed me that she was about to call my friend (who I had discussed the situation with) and fire them as well for unrelated reasons. The reasons she listed for firing me were very shocking too. All of them I truly believe to be false. I do not wish to disclose them but I believe that one of my coworkers must have just been spreading rumours about me &amp; my other coworker as I have never done what I was accused of on the phone. I knew it was not worth trying to argue with or dispute as I was a casual and was too upset to. 

It has been months and I still replay the phone call in my head. I replay that day and so many interactions with my coworkers because I do not know who truly was my friend or not. I get so upset and mad sometimes at everyone there. I feel so resentful, and feel so much hatred towards the managers. I feel confused and conflicted because I’ve always only ever tried to work hard and put 100% into my jobs. These thoughts creep in almost everyday and I feel sick in my stomach and sometimes cry and I just don’t know how to move on fully. I don’t know how I can trust anyone I work with in the future. I also feel like I can’t talk with my other coworker (who also got fired) about it because they were planning to leave anyway and is still friends with many of the others still. How can I move on from this and learn to stop feeling mad and resentful? 

TL;DR I was fired out of the blue from a job I had been at for a few months. One of my other coworkers was also fired but for different reasons. The reasons I were given were shocking as I truly believed that they were not true. I believe someone made false claims and I wasn’t given a chance to defend myself. It has been months and I feel mad, upset and resentful to all my old coworkers and managers and it’s really weighing me down. How do I deal with moving past it all? ",24Mar2019,2

So basically it has been a few months since my parents split and it has been pretty hard on us, meaning my two brothers and I. I noticed soon after my mom had been messaging my friend's dad constantly, while on holiday, during the night, and would stop walking or pull over to respond. He is married and was my soccer coach twice. I thought nothing of it until the day I came home from my dad's place and noticed large footprints in the house. I asked my mom if anyone had come over and she denied it. She would be open about it if it was some friends so there was another red flag. Then I was out with my mom and was trying to hotspot my phone (I currently don't have a plan) and noticed a message from him was already opened when I logged on. He basically was flirting and this annoyed me because he was married with kids and I was great friends with his kid. I scrolled back and there is countless messages of him asking for inappropriate pictures and them talking about positions they would do in bed. He openly admitted to eyeing my mom off over 2 years ago.

I spent a night thinking about this, I am quite distraught and the only options I have though of include:

\-Telling my mom (although she may punish me for bringing it up but I won't mind)

\-Telling my friend (the dad's son)

\-Bringing it up with the dad next time I see him

\-Pretend I don't know anything about it and just let it happen

I think about her 24/7, I require too much of her attention. So much so, that she told me she literally doesn’t know how much more time I need to spend with her. She loves me and there’s no doubt that she does. 

  This started because we were both kinda like this and we were miserable. Around this time last year I expressed my unhappiness with being together 24/7 and I wanted to take a break. Then I took that back and said that I want to stay together, I  just needed more time to myself. A bit after that time she said she wanted to join a sorority and I actually died. I had so much anxiety over it and I dreaded it so much. 

  Eventually I decided I’d pursue a frat and when the time came, she got in and I didn’t. So I felt like I was missing out and she was slipping away from me and then I rushed again this semester and I didn’t get in. I felt like she was the only thing I had and I pulled her in so much she started to push away. I’d always sit around staring at my phone when she was at mixers and it succcccked. I would look through her phone and never really find anything. Until one day she was talking to her brother about how I don’t do anything bc im lazy and that if it continues she was gonna leave me. I didn’t say anything to her about that. Her brother tries to bond with me, but I don’t think he likes me. 

Then recently she was talking to her roommate about wanting to fuck other guys. She had a list and she said she would let the #1 guy spit on her and when I confronted her, she said it was all jokes and hypotheticals. Then now 2 weeks later, she expressed interest in me doing that to her in bed. That indirectly it led me to me realizing what I’m realizing right now. I need help and I want to change, and my girlfriend is willing to stick with me, but I’m not sure how long I can expect her to do so. But I love her and I want this to work.

3. I've been fat for a majority of my life. I've lost about 20kgs but need to lose almost another 30kgs to be in a healthy weight range.

I sort of feel like until I at least get my mental health under control I might not ever be able to complete study or improve where I can get a better job. I work in hospitality which i don't mind yet due to my poor social skills and mental problems i feel like i can't even move up from my station in the workplace or move away from the occupation. 

Like I'm already fucking up my current study. With therapy the psychologist is trying to teach me how to deal with issues and develop healthy relationships. I'm considering calling my university to drop out or find alternative options. ",24Mar2019,1

304,"I’m an incoming college freshman and I met potential college roommates. However, I have two physical disabilities that makes it significantly harder to live with other people, so I’m not sure if I should turn it down. 

I have extremely low vision but also a muscle disorder that makes it harder to move around. We would be in a quad, in a older dorm. I looked at the floor plan and it seems extremely cramped. We have bunkbeds and the pre- installed furniture takes up more room than anything. I’m afraid that it’s going to be harder for me to move around but also because I always seem to get a sense of claustrophobia (probably due to my vision being limited). It also does effect other things, like for example it’s takes me longer to do basic tasks that others can do. 

The girls seem like an awesome group. We all have the same preferences when it comes to sleeping habits, similar majors, same kind of personality but there’s still a variety of interests among us. I did talk to one of them about the medical situation already (who says she doesn’t mind), but I haven’t told the others. 

With that said, I could always turn down the group and room in a much larger room with only one roommate or just by myself. That way it’s easier to move around and there’s more space. The dorm I would get is a lot more accessible. The hall has more than one elevator, unlike the older dorm. 

I’m just not really sure what to do. I like this group of girls, but I’m not sure it would be ideal for my situation. Any advice is appreciated!

309,"This is long, mostly backstory and the conversation we had over Facebook, TLDR at the bottom. Going to try and sleep after posting so might not respond till the morning. Not sure if this should be posted to legaladvice, but figure I'll ask here first.

Background: myself, my partner, a close friend of my partner moved into a new flat early January this year. It's a four bedroom place and so we needed a fourth to cover costs, and the lease for my previous flat crossed over with the new place. Luckily, the landlord is a great guy, so we have a written agreement that we pay half rent until I'm able to move in with a verbal agreement that was made shortly after, that if we managed to find a fourth person, they would pay their share of the rent when they moved in.

We find a guy who I knew well through the local MTG community and who I had many mutual friends with and got along pretty well with overall. Sign the tenancy agreement, we're all go. Landlord asks for confirmation of when each of us are moving in, he said he couldn't move in till the week after our lease officially began, no issues; I pass this onto our landlord when I'm collecting keys for the others to move in. Guy ends up moving in on that first week and the rest of us are a bit like ""WTF dude, weren't you moving in next week?"" as he'd not paid that first week. At this point the landlord is aware that him, along with the two others that were supposed to be there, had moved in as he'd come around to fix a rain pipe day after move in.

We ask him if he can flick the rent over to the flat account so we can pay according to the agreement (he was witness to the agreement when signing the tenancy agreement). Says he's strapped for cash with paying bond and initial move in costs, we're a little chill so give him a few weeks to get stuff sorted.

Few weeks go by and I bring it up again, apparently he's had his hours cut back at work. Again, we're understanding and give him a bit of time to find new work and such. I even go out and help set him up with my Cousin's husband who works as the head chef of a local restaurant/pub.

Cut to now:

He's been really lax in his share of the housework (a rotating weekly roster with stuff like vacuuming, taking out the trash, wiping down kitchen surfaces and cleaning the bathroom, what we'd thought was pretty normal and not out of the ordinary) and the rest of us are annoyed and getting a bit iffy with the fact the first week's rent hasn't come in. Ask if we can have a flat meeting to talk about flat stuff to discuss why housework isn't happening and if things need to change for any reason.

This is the resulting conversation Partner (P), Close Friend (CF), Flatmate in question (FM) and (ME): (TLDR at the bottom)

CF (asking about what times would work for people to have a flat meeting): What about you FM?

FM: Nope, will be out

CF: Do you know when would work?

FM: No clue tbh

CF: Can you try and find a time because we need to have a flat meeting at some point

FM: Why do we need to have a flat meeting?

ME: To talk about flat stuff

CF: \^\^\^\^

P: Flat meetings are a normal part of living together. They are a time for everyone to catch up, and bring up any questions/comments/complaints about how things are going with the group. Please commit to a time, FM. As we've stated, our schedules are pretty flexible.

(The next day)

ME: You should know when you're not working, can you please give us a time that works for you. It shouldn't be that hard (We're getting annoyed at his lack of response/commitment by now)

FM: I don't do meetings, and having a group chat negates the need for a ""flat meeting"". 

P:  FM, you're acting like a child, grow up. The need for a face to face is entirely due to you *not* using the chat. There are issues around housework, and payment of week-in-advance rent. Since you have not fixed these yourself, and ignore every attempt to remind you of them, speaking face to face seems like the only option left.

ME: The fact that you don't feel like it's necessary to take half an hour to sit down with the people you live with shows a lot about how immature you are, and hour little you care about is as people. While we can discuss things through messenger, it's usually more respectful and often easier to discuss important matters face to face. 

FM: When I first met with Landlord, I said that I'd be moving in on the 7th, aka the first week. He said that the rent would stay the same for the first week. (This was in front of all of you as well). Only weeks after I moved in was this suddenly changed.

I'm not doing housework because I absolutely cannot be fucked cleaning up after you lot. The kitchen floor was covered in your guys food scraps, the toilet is always covered in shit stains, and there is always hair in the shower. Clean up your own messes.

(This is out of left field for us, as he's never mentioned issues with the cleaning roster before, and the flat is rather tidy)

After weeks of being talked down to, and feeling like I'm not a proper flatmate but rather staying in the flat you guys rent, I definitely don't think it's necessary to sit down and talk to you guys. Especially after yesterday when you guys where sending me these messages while I was incredibly busy at work.

(Not sure where this is coming from other than being asked not to vape in/around the flat due to the no smoking rule, and that P is asthmatic. I don't personally know if it matters, but he was super condescending of the whole thing and was pissed that it was first brought up in front of his gf who's been around half the time he has been)

And there is a difference between immaturity and depression/anxiety. Thought you guys would have understood that one. 

ME:  When I asked when everyone was moving in to pass the information onto Duncan, you'd said (in the flat chat above) that you'd probably have to move in the next weekend. We gave you extra time to get this sorted, and you said you would, because you were short on money and had recently had your hours cut back at work. It wasn't changed when you were moving in, it was the original agreement that those who would be moving in on the first week would be paying rent on that first week.

 If there was an issue with the way the chores were scheduled, why didn't you bring this up earlier in the flat chat instead of just not doing them? There was an issue with not having a toilet brush for a good chunk which didn't help with that issue. The point of having a roster is that these are all things that we all use on a regular basis.  We do understand anxiety and depression, that's why we've been trying to be patient with things. (As a note, I've got pretty moderate/severe depression that makes it hard to function without meds, but I've still been able to function pretty adequately when it comes to flat responsibilities, and his comment about mental health stuff feels pretty rich coming from him)

You need to communicate with us. We don't know that you've got a full on day at work and can't talk much if you don't tell us.

&amp;#x200B;

Several days later we try setting up a flat meeting again, hoping that given some time we've all cooled off. He's yet to have 'seen' these messages on FB despite being active in the past few days. At this point we have no idea what to do next. Are considering emailing our landlord to inform him about the rent thing as he's aware that three people had moved in the first week.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Flatmate moved in first week instead of second like he'd said and hasn't paid his share of a weeks' rent despite verbal agreement with landlord who's a lawyer. Gently been asking over the last few months. When pressed recently, yells at us over FB and refuses to communicate. We're mostly worried about what our landlord might say/do about the missing rent, but he's also been a dick about not helping around the house too.",24Mar2019,1

I have pretty much told her this but every time I talk to her about it she reasons with me and because I don’t know what I want sometimes she’ll momentarily make me change my mind. I think she knows where I stand like im about 80% sure I don’t want kids usually. I tried being honest with her and she will just think I’m being silly. I don’t want to waste her time though. I usually hate confrontation and I find it hard to tell her I don’t want kids and stand by that decision. I know my life would be better without children but my life may not be better without her. Because I think if I lose her I’m done with relationships. I don’t know what to do now. I don’t have anything against children and if I had them I would step up but it’s scary to imagine. Maybe I am just being stupid and kids would be the best thing to happen to me. I know most people would say not to have kids if I’m not sure but I can see the pros and cons of having them.

316,"Basically, around a week ago my girlfriend and I had sex for the first time. There was absolutely no pressure involved, it was protected and we have been dating long enough for both of us to feel ready. Almost a week after, she tells me that her mother found out. Genuinely curious, I asked how could she have possibly found out. It turns out that she ended up telling her herself. They were having a conversation about relationships and “being ready” and her mom said that my girlfriend is not ready yet, which she disagreed with. That lead to her asking my girlfriend whether she feels ready, or whether she already had sex. My girlfriend says she feels very uncomfortable lying to her parents, so she ended up telling her. Her parents are insanely protective, and now they’re even more strict than they already were. All of this happened a day before I was going to invite her to my house for the first time. Quite a while ago we moved into a new house and she couldn’t come over until now because we needed to buy everything and unpack. All of the previous times, I had to go to her house if we wanted to hang out. So I planned an entire day at our house, and we would have had the house to ourselves. I worked pretty hard to make sure that the house was ready for the weekend, so needless to say, I’m quite frustrated. If she hadn’t told her mom, it could have been the perfect day. Now that her mom knows, she is set out to not allow us any alone time at all, and she now only allows my girlfriend to come over to my house for no more than one hour, which is just ridiculous. We both live with our parents, so we have limited freedom as is. It’s not even about sex, I just want the liberty of spending time with my girlfriend without being strictly monitored, which seems like at this point it’s too much to ask. So now I have no idea how I am going to gain back the trust of their parents and get things back to the way they were. As much as I don’t want to, I feel like at one point I am going to have to talk to her mother, but I have no idea what to say. I encouraged my girlfriend to talk to her and she intends to try and convince her to be more lenient. Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. ",24Mar2019,1
317,"I had a baby yesterday. It wasn’t a traumatic birth, I am in a lot of pain and need help recovering. The midwives and nurses here are being amazing. The baby is quiet, feeds well and is beautiful. I’m not feeling super bonded or connected to her. The birth and bleeding/shaking after has reminded me of a traumatic miscarriage that I had two years ago and I think that’s playing a part.

I want to hold and feed her more/properly but sitting up still hurts. Watching my husband attend her every whim is simultaneously beautiful and hurting me. If she cries for a second, he holds and rocks her. I am wincing in pain and unable to get up, I have to ask him 3 times to come and help me. I shouldn’t be jealous of a newborn. I shouldn’t need and crave my husband’s attention like this. I feel like a child. On top of this, he can’t sleep here so goes back to our apartment and refreshes himself (sleeps, eats, showers) for 8-9 hours then comes back. I am waking up with baby and midwives every 2 hours or so.

318,"(Writing this on mobile so sorry for bad formatting in advance!)

For all my years of schooling I went to the same place: an expensive private school with a good reputation for results and for raising good kids. Maybe it was just my year that was an outlier then, because I ended up sharing my final year with a pretty toxic group. They were exclusionary, bitchy, and made me feel so bad about some of my other friendships I ended up cutting off friends in need. 
I can't say how intentional their behaviour was. After all, the main girl had 0 impulse control and didn't really seem to care about what was polite. The others, despite being known as friendly and kind throughout the school, never bothered to step in, and at times actively participated in making me feel like shit.

It wasn't like they were actively harassing me though. It was mostly just talking about upcoming events that I wasn't invited to when I was sitting right with them, or complaining about my other friends with me around again. Another habit would be to ditch school early or move without letting me know where they were so I'd have to spend lunch alone. Not awful behaviour in and of itself, but with all these behaviours combined I started to feel like I was the problem, and had bad self-confidence issues for most of the year. 

School's over now, I've got a new group and I'm rebuilding my self-esteem,  but now someone's organised a reunion for our year level and I'm dreading it. I've tried interacting with one of the nicer people from the toxic group from lasy year, and she's given me the cold shoulder. I don't have that many close friends in the year any more, but I'm still expected to turn up. Should I:

a) Spend some time with the girls from last year in the hope the others have improved in the past, like, 3 months? 

b) Try and spend time with another group, with whom I have nothing in common with, but contains people I knew from junior school

c) Ditch and make cupcakes

d) A much better idea that one of you people can propose

319,"Let me begin with a few details about myself. I'm 25, gay, and live in small town in NC, and I've been single for four years. I decided to give tinder a try and ended up meeting this guy who lives one town over who's 35, who I'll refer to here as J. We talked for about a month before meeting on Valentines day for lunch. I went with him back to his place, and despite telling him I wanted to take things slow, I caved and slept with him when he asked. Two days later we hung out again, and he ended up making margaritas. I didn't watch him make them, but there were four shots of two separate liquors in each drink. I typically stick to wine, so after having two drinks I blacked out. That night feels so hazy, and I can only remember bits and pieces of it. I met J's roommate that night who's 27, we'll call him L. After L arrived home he started drinking and J ended up going to his room and falling asleep. Apparently I was mumbling and L decided to sit beside me on the couch, and after listening to music we ended up making out. I don't remember this at all, only J coming into the room and freaking out. I apologized to them and called my friend to come pick me, but they said it was fine and J told me how much liquor he put in the drinks. The next morning I woke up naked in J's bed, and had no idea what happened, but was later filled in by the friend I called to pick me up and J and L. I still have no idea why I kissed his roommate and I was prepared to never speak with them again. We'll J really didn't want to stop talking, so we agreed to forget that night and move on. I've gotten really close to J over the past month, and we talk everyday via text and on the phone. He's a nice guy, but there's something about him I just can't trust. I don't know why I feel this way, but my gut just has a feeling. I also found out from both J and L that J likes to drink, and likes for everyone to be on the same level as him. Surprisingly, things weren't even awkward between me and L. I went to see them again the other day, and J had a rough day and wanted to drink whisky. I only had a little bit, watching him pour it so I didn't get too drunk. Well I did, and J fell asleep on the couch. I went with L, who has also been drinking to walk his dog, and he told me he hasn't been able to stop thinking about that kiss between us, and he also tells me some disheartening things about J, which kinda confirmed the feelings i have in my gut. We ended up talking for hours, and I feel like I can be myself around him. This is when I acted shitty. I kissed him and we made out. We went back inside and J was still asleep. I went to pee and L followed me into the bathroom and kissed me again, before I told him that I felt guilty with J being asleep on the couch and I wasn't going to sneak around. We agreed and ended up going to bed, but L put my number in his phone and we've been talking about everything. We agreed to talk to J about everything next weekend, which I'm fine with. We don't date, but I did a really shitty thing that I never do. My main problem is that I like both of them, but can actually see myself dating L. I know I would be a temporary fling for J, but I do like him, and I don't want to hurt him. I also don't want to cause problems in their friendship. I feel like I should stop talking to both of them, and just let them stay close. I don't want to hurt anyone, but my selfish actions already proved it's too late for that. I wish this was easy, but it's not. Despite my actions, I WILL NOT lead either one of them on. I would too J right now, but can't seem him in person until next Friday. Again, I’ve never been in this situation before, and although I have my doubts about J, I don’t want to hurt him. Any advice on what to do? Should I just cut them both out of my life so they won’t have any issues?",24Mar2019,2

Shortly after we first met I moved out of my house and stayed at my mom's for a bit. but I was never there since I would stay at his apt 4-5 times a week.

322,"Hello everyone.

So, as the title says, I am afraid that my little dogs will get hurt while on a walk.

Gonna introduce my dogs real quick.
I have three dogs. 
Olly, a 2 pound, 5 month old chihuahua.
Lou, a 25 pound, senior mini sheltie mix.
And Wyatt, a 15 pound wirehaired dachshund.

Okay, so the last time I’ve walked my dogs I was attacked by a lab, I literally had to body slam the dog to get him off of Wyatt, and right after I picked up Wyatt and while I was holding him the lab bit my arm while trying to get Wyatt. Super scary situation, but the dog didn’t draw blood.
Cops legit didn’t do anything, and animal control only set up a trap. 
The dog is still running loose around that neighborhood btw.

That last 2 times I went for a walk by myself I saw a loose boxer, then 2 days later on a different walk I saw 2 loose mix breeds.

Plus literally up my street is a loose chihuahua, he has a collar and he’s alway in the same area so I assume he lives there. Also, I can’t walk in that area because the darn dog always try’s to bite my ankles. 

The cops don’t do anything and literally don’t care,  and animal control only sets up traps and sometimes they don’t even put bait in them. 
I’m pretty sure they’re getting annoyed with me constantly calling, because they kinda stopped putting up the traps. 

What can I do? 
My dogs LOVE walks and I feel awful that I can’t take them without risking them/ myself getting seriously hurt.

326,"To give some context to this story I need to state a few things. I am currently in HS and I am in my senior year. Throughout high school I’ve had friends, but for the most part a very small list of friends. I’m very isolated, I don’t find relationships with any gender interesting or beneficial. I wouldn’t say my social skills are poor but their at least adequate. Although there is a girl in my class that i found interest in, only god knows why, i am still confused on why I found interest in her myself. Long story short, we were somehow always magically put in the same group together, and I thought to myself “fuck it, I never socialize and she seems interesting, why not give it a shot.” I thought it was better than us both just mindlessly working on some project neither of us care about awkwardly anyways. To my surprise it went great, I don’t know why but I felt oddly comfortable and very confident around her, we talked about the typical teenage angst with how we both work jobs and are trying to finish school, doing taxes for the first time, parents starting to slowly force us to be more independent. The typical teenage lessons that we both are experiencing that we love/hate. I flirted with her a little, gave her a compliment and she reacted in a positive way i assume? She smiled very bright and laughed and said thank you. I assume this is a good sign? Class shortly ended and we went our separate ways. few days later we were back in class I decided i wanted her number, again for whatever reason i felt like i wanted to pursue this girl. At the beginning of class i had my perfect chance, the teacher stated we could make our own groups and I thought if i was going to make anything happen I would need to be confident and clear. So when everyone was making the groups i went up to this girl and I told her “Hey come here I want you in my group” i told her just straight up that we were gonna work together and that i wanted her, she seemed more than willing and happy, and no one else asked her so I don’t believe i was being rude either. We talked a lot during this time and also got a lot of work done at the end I was straight up with her and told her i needed her number so i can get to know her more, she smiled really bright at this and gave me her number without hesitation and told me to text her. From everything that has happened, i would say it went pretty well but now she won’t reply. Yet now I can’t figure out how I fucked up? The day I got her number I texted her around an hour later, I didn’t wanna be boring and say something like “hey its me” or “hi” so i started off with a stupid joke, i said “Now that I have your number does this mean I also get free food? lol” This was me joking because earlier in class she was talking about how her manager lets her give away free food to her friends. She replied with “hahaha sure, if you come in while I’m working.” After that I replied with something i cant state here but it was about a class assignment and she hasn’t replied in 3 days, everyone I’ve talked to agrees she is ignoring me and has lost interest. What did i do wrong? ",24Mar2019,1
327,"Last night I was at work, my phone kept going off. Finally I go to the bathroom to check it. 5 missed calls later and a text from my boyfriend, E, “this is an emergency”. 

I call him back. He’s in the hospital. He just witnessed his 4 year old niece, R, get her face ripped off by their dog. 

His little sister, N (12years old) just witnessed it to. Witnessed her sister-like family member get her face ripped off by their beloved foster dog, in their own home. 

It’s bad. They transferred R to another hospital. E had to go home to clean up the blood. He found a piece of her face, which he brought back to the hospital. 

E had to be the one in the room. R’s mom, J, couldn’t bring herself to be in the room while they examined her. J works in a shelter full time. She’s the one who brought this dog into their house. I can’t even imagine the guilt she must be feeling. E said she refuses to talk about any of it. 

R’s first of many surgeries won’t start until next week. R is in shock. The entire time she didn’t even make a sound. 

I bought a hotel for E, N and I to stay in last night. N did not want to stay in their house and my house among other friends and family all have dogs. I don’t blame her. 

Today we are supposed to distract her by going out and doing something.... what do we even do? How do I even start to help her process this?",24Mar2019,12
328,"Hi there, let’s start off with a story. 
Two years ago, me and my ex gf broke up due to going different directions in life (college). The breakup was extremely amicable and we remained great friends to this day. 

Recently me and Jessica (Fake Name) have began talking more and more over winter quarter. We both have one year left of university. I’ve developed feelings for her again which I feel bad for. The reason I feel bad is I don’t want destroy the friendship we have. Also, there is no evidence to support that she has feelings too besides some flirty messages. My therapist talked to me about this but it’s too risky of a shot to take. I honestly don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: I have feelings for a friend. This is due to talking more and more and caring about her. Which has led me to have feelings again and I don’t know what to do. ",24Mar2019,1

Background info - the child is 2 or 3, and it’s a private school in France. Age of the other children is 2-6.

My boss seems kinda semi-aware that there could be some risks involved, but he is keen to take the child on.  I’ve told him that I’m worried about it for a few reasons. Eg the other parents finding out would probably not be too happy about it, and I think there is a greater risk that even vaccinated kids could get something from this one unvaccinated kid/carrying stuff home to siblings who are too young to be vaccinated??? 

BASICALLY I don’t really know. Can anyone give me any more advice as to why this is a bad idea and what the risks are to the other children?

337,"Something really really sad happened today. My ex's sister passed away. She was disabled and had been sick on and off for most of her life. I dated her brother for about 6 months and never met her, although had met other members of his family. 

He ended our relationship back in January, but it was on good terms and although we haven't seen each other since the breakup, we still text a lot. He told me she was sick last week, and I had been trying to do what I could over messenger to help him feel even the tiniest bit better (mainly dog pictures). 

Now I'm torn. Her passing has had an impact on me - he and his family are such lovely people going through such a terrible loss and my heart breaks for them. I would like to attend her funeral to support, but I'm not sure if that would be appropriate, as someone who never met her and dated her brother for a relatively short time (plus, we met through an online dating app, so it's not like we have mutual friends or anything). 

Should I go? Send flowers? Send a dog picture? It's a tough situation to navigate, and I would appreciate some different opinions, thank you!",24Mar2019,2
338,"I feel like there's something wrong with me, and that no one can or will want me romantically or sexually. I'm 27, female, I haven't been in a relationship since I was 20, haven't been even kissed since I was 22. It's something I'm ashamed of. 

Now, to be fair, I made a decision a long time ago not to get into another relationship (I had a very bad first experience but for brevity I'll leave that out), and so I've not been actively seeking them out. I also don't want to have sex with a stranger. Even so, there's been a lot of rejection along the way, and now I just deeply feel like there is something wrong with me that I can't figure out. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I haven't been seeking out any relationships, I have of course fallen for guys, and despite telling myself that a relationship would not be good for me, my heart can take over my head like everyone else's and wanted to be with those people.

First guy, university, I liked him, we got on, but he ended up with my friend. 

Second guy, also university, I liked him, he actually did like me a bit but had a girlfriend, we didn't take it anywhere. 

Third guy, a friend, he started seeing someone around the time I met him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth guy was more recent. I recently moved somewhere new and was thrown into a work/social circle where a lot of people all around my age are together all the time. Seems natural there will be some pairing up. I became friends with this guy, developed feelings. But... he liked my good friend. It got to the point where I told him how I felt just to clear the air and got the rejection I was expecting. We're still friends, and I'm over it. 

Fifth guy was recently. We met and got on immediately, just as friends. We're very close. In fact, a lot of people around us thought we were dating. For a long time I had no romantic feeling for him, and (pattern developing) he liked my other good friend. It was a brief crush, she rejected him and he let it go, despite saying she was ""amazing."" 

Well, I kind of caught feelings (I think). While I didn't tell him this, because of other people's pressure for us to get together, the subject was broached and I know he doesn't want anything more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of the two guys I've liked, both liked my friends. Said friends are also now with other guys. And no one wants me. I'm left comparing myself to them and wondering what makes them so ""amazing."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. I've been alone for so long I can't even imagine someone wanting me now. Sometimes I feel like I hate myself. I don't feel like a real, flesh and blood, person anymore. I have friends, but it's like I'm completely undesirable, sexless. I don't think its a physical thing, it's like there's something inside me that's wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I don't know what it is. I've tried to figure it out for so long and I just can't. If I knew what was wrong I could fix it. 

I know the obvious answer is self-esteem, that maybe I have a lack of it and a lack of confidence and that's unattractive, but can that really be all it is? I don't buy that ""no one can love you until you love yourself."" If everyone around you reacts the same way, don't you have to admit that you may be the problem? I don't even get hit on by guys in bars or clubs. 

&amp;#x200B;

So question is, what's wrong with me (ask me whatever you like that you think might help figure this out and I'll try to answer honestly), and the advice I need is how to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**: After years of no one wanting me in any kind of romantic or sexual capacity, I feel like there's something really wrong with me. How do I fix it.

339,"Yesterday was pretty good and then it went to absolute shit. My boyfriend got kicked out of his house and neither me or our friend could let him stay the night. The guards were called to see if they could find him a place to stay or to get him to go home (talking to his parents and stuff to make them let him back in) he refused to go home as he's terrified of getting beaten and everything. He was taken by social services and is now in a Foster home. Everything was a lot more traumatising than it sounds considering he had a couple break downs and I have bad anxiety. My best friend has just been a bitch to me all of last night and this morning. I can't process or cope with what happened and the two people who can help me are either not here or being a cunt. I can't even go to my bio family cause they all hate my boyfriend since he's trans and they're very religious.

340,"My (24F) boyfriend (22M) and I recently broke up. We have been together for 3.5 years, and lived together for most of that. I decided that I wanted to go to law school and am headed there in the fall, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted him to come with me. 
We had our issues. Some silly and some not so silly. But without getting too deeply into it, the relationship was generally really happy. We loved(d) each other very much. 
I was out helping my mom for two months and while I was out there, along with the advice of some friends, I decided to call it off. I had been mulling this over for months, and I thought if I was “certain” it was what I wanted to do, then I shouldn’t postpone it and just get it over with.  I thought it was important for me to learn how to be alone, and to grow individually. Which I still think is important. He was extremely upset and thrown off, rightly so. 
I’ve now been back to our home state, moved out of living with him, and since some time has gone by, I can very confidently say I made a mistake. It’s been about two months since I broke up with him and it was the wrong choice. I don’t want to make this post a novel so I don’t want to go super far into details, but I just know it was a mistake. I regret it every second and miss him constantly BUT some of the reasons we broke up are valid. It IS important to grow on your own and not always be around someone else. It’s important to have confidence gained just from yourself and navigating the world as an individual. 

So, what can I do? I’m heartbroken (I played myself). I want to show him that I know I made a mistake and that I value him completely. Is it possible for us to take things slowly and see if some distance may do us good as we try to resolve our issues? ",24Mar2019,2

Some people did some shitty things to me, enough to cause PTSD. I don’t want to get into it.

I have been so angry for so long that it has and will likely continue to ruin my life if I don’t stop. I logically know that I need to forgive them in order to finally be free from what they did to me.

Emotionally, I just can’t. I feel like forgiving them would make what they did OK. Pretty much all of them are living their lives perfectly happy and unaffected by what they did. Some of them felt guilty and have apologized to me, but after they promptly moved on.

I feel like the only one who remembers it and that it’s my responsibility to hold them accountable even though there’s nothing to be done in the real world for what they did. However, keeping it all inside feels like they are hurting me again and again every day. I just want it to stop.

Any suggestions for where to even begin?

344,"     I’m a 16 year old boy and have never really had any social problems. I met this girl 2 weeks ago (let’s call her O) and she has a lot of the same interests as me (she is also a quadruplet). We have been talking frequently over text about random stuff and getting to know each other. 

    One night we fell on the topic of friends and sports in school. She then opened up to me about how she really feels about meeting new people and doing things she likes. She wants to be social and join sports teams but she is held back by the fact that her siblings are better then her at every sport and she doesn’t want to be in the shadow of her siblings. I’ve tried to tell her that if you want to do something you need to try for it as she should enjoy every bit of her 4 years in high school. But I think the problem has to deal with mental health which is beyond my knowledge. She has gone to her parents about this problem but they didn’t take her seriously so she now only turns to me about her issues as I’m the only one who actually listens.

I don't know if that is overly specific, so I apologise in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some advice, preferably from people with similar experiences. 

I am in a long-distance realtionship with a boy (27yo, me a 25yo F). After the 2 year mark I have found out that he is heavily addicted to cam sites like Omeagle, but also Chaturbate etc. I know he is addicted because I have seen the amount of time and money he spends there and that is not a helathy amount even for a perosn with a lot of stamina (basically I am amazed his penis is still attached to his body).  He streams and pays the models for the sessions. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I found out I reacted really emotionally, he was mad at me (his defense mechanism) and after that sh\*itstorm I have talked with him calmly explaining that porn is fine but I won't accept such personal contact like cams. He told me fine, he will change.

He did not. Round number 2 was even worse, because I have started to build trust toward him again and he crushed it. Talked again, received the same response. It went well.

Round no. 3. Until a few days ago when I noticed he has started to act like 'that' again and caught him red handed on his fav cam site, while he was proudly fapping on cam.

Went furious. Like, I've seen red. Red I tell you. I love him, want to help him, but it seems like his addiction is too much. I have told him to think about the future, if he wants to be with me and if yes what steps should be taken to stop camming.

His was the last message that he will stop, consider etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice, not the usual just berak up. I want to geniuely try to help him because he is struggling.

Are there any techniques on how to talk with a person like that? Or like steps that should be taken (talk with him, ignore him? wait for him to contact me first or to contact first?)

But two traumatic years after graduation, here I am laying in bed completely lost. I don’t want to go into it too much but I lost all of my friends after they backstabbed me, my abusive father ruined the relationship between him and i, my precious puppy that lived 15 years passed away, etc. It was a really shitty end to high school and now I’m attending part time in college because I don’t know who I am or what I want to study. My self esteem is shot. I have been diagnosed recently with major depression, social anxiety, and ptsd, and i’m showing early signs of paranoid personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. I guess I’m just really fucked up.

The hardest part is what I want to do in my future. I hate living in the house I grew up in because there’s horrifying memories and damaged relationships here. I think I want to go away to college but I have no fucking clue what I wanna do. I got accepted to get my bachelors in Dental Hygiene at a uni starting this fall but It’ll be 4 years until I finish which scares me so much... I’ll be 24 when I finish... and honestly this is just a career I chose because the job outlook is projected to increase + it’s pretty good money.

The most sad part is when I feel torn and panicked about whether it’s what I want to do or not I get the question “well what are your interests? What do you like to do?” and I don’t KNOW. Those things I used to do in high school aren’t things I do anymore. And I can’t tell if it’s because I’m depressed and don’t have energy or if I just grew out of it. I don’t have enjoyment in my life and I haven’t had it for the past two years. Real life sucks so bad. I’ve even tried seeing a therapist but it didn’t work. I feel extremely hopeless.

My biggest fear is that I’ll finish school and everything, start my life and regret not finding what truly is my passion and be unhappy for the rest of my life. What if college isn’t for me? What if I need to just live in an apartment with people and make music? What if this college opportunity is the right way? The pressure is eating me alive and it has been for 2 years.

Like 3 years ago I would watch anime when I was bored but then I lost interest in that and developed a new hobby in drawing which I got bored of after a couple of months.
Then I started to get into exercising which I again got bored of. (I still exercise but at a lower level)
It took me a while before I got into reading light novels.
When I got into this the only thing I would do is read and nothing else.
Then I i was bored of this then got into writing novels myself.
I was writing from start of last year till towards the end of it, everyday I wrote an average of 1500 words or more.
At the start of this year I got bored of that too and if I try to write I won’t be able to do more than 30 words.
I’m looking for something to do, like a new hobby.
I wanna get some recommendation on what to do.

Ps: don’t worry I’m not depressed and yes I do have friends.

I have been over for sever hours helping her look for it and have found nothing. She has a home care helper that comes over twice a week. I have never met her, but I think that it is possible she stole it. My grandmother won't call her out on it because she isn't sure, which I totally understand since she doesn't know that she took it. So this is my question. The money is usually kept in a cloth bag in the dresser. I figure it is human nature to check a place where you found a large amount of money again.

I ""know"" how to improve my lifestyle and I am motivated to do so, but for the love of God, no matter how hard and often I try in the end (after weeks, or couple months at maximum) I fall back into my old self. What can I do to prevent this happening again?

This is about relative common task, such as studying, nutrition, daily home tasks, working out, etc. 
It's as if I can't change myself no matter what. I am just trying to become overall a more responsible and independent person.

What can I do? My overall lifestyle suffers a lot from this, I usually start very well in any aspect that I want to change, I see improvements, I feel good, it's working great, so why do I at some point just lose motivation and stop although there is seemingly nothing that's stopping me?

356,"This has been driving me crazy lately. So I had my first boyfriend when I was 14 and it was my longest relationship, and after that point any time that I would have a boyfriend, I would always make it about him. Yes, I guess you could say I’m that girl that gets lost in her relationship.

I think it may stem from having low self esteem, bc I grew up in a pretty abusive household + my first boyfriend when I was 14-15 abused me too. To add, I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd. Also never feeling like I fit in in school, so having a boyfriend would be like i’d have a best friend for some time until we’d break up for some reason. This makes me sad, because I focused more on my relationships in high school than trying to have my own fun and make friends. And now at a commuting community college, I’m more lonely than ever.

Alright, so here I am now at 20, and I’ve been dating this guy for about 9 months. I love him and we gel really well together, but at the beginning of this year i realized how lost I was in the relationship, and how subconsciously I obsessed over him. I make everything about him, every thought I have I always act based on how it could affect him, i talk to my friends about him, etc. you get the picture. I don’t do anything but go to class and then stay home and subconsciously expect him to be on call to come hangout with me. I’m not proud of this at all, in fact I feel very pathetic. I WANT to be an independent woman. He understands why i’m doing all of this so he wants to help in any way he can because he really doesn’t know how to. He knows how to live his own life. He has been really supportive through all of this and doesn’t let me apologize for it anymore than I already have lol.

I just don’t know if we should break up so I could focus on myself? I tried that, and immediately after he left I cried for an hour straight, had a panic attack, called him freaking out, and he came back. Like I mentioned earlier, I feel so pathetic... there is also internal guilt, and my pathological critic keeps shouting in my head “haha, you can’t leave him! you can’t leave him! you are dependent on others to feel loved!” Maybe subconsciously I fear being alone? Even though whenever I have a boyfriend I DO feel loneliness since I only care about seeing him and revolve my life around him. 

Just please don’t judge me here, my past friends, and ESPECIALLY my family makes me know how insecure I am that I need attention from boys, apparently. I don’t have anyone to talk to this about without either giving a biased opinion or me having trust in them. I’ve heard that someone in my situation should “seek support from loved ones” but I definitely can’t from my family, and I don’t want to bother what little of friends I have left about my relationship anymore.

I want to learn to be happy and independent. I don’t want my life to revolve around my relationship. I know that this is driving me crazy because it’s all I think about, and I can’t stop thinking about it! I’ve gotten on the verge to almost driving and admitting myself as an inpatient to a mental hospital. It truly is torture. I want to be able to do my own thing, then confidently return to my relationship and be fine. The only problems that hold me back in life is my insecurity, low self esteem, and a horrible, vicious pathological critic. 

TL;DR! - I want to learn to be happy and independent. I don’t want my life to revolve around my relationship.",24Mar2019,3

I work in a hotel as sports and fitness, so burn through around 4,000kcals+ per day, there's zero things outside the hotel without a car so I eat in the buffet, it's a 5 star resort so food is amazing for guests who are here for a few weeks but for 8 months it can get a little hard as everything is drowned in oil.

The vegetarian stand is non existent, just a few salad leaves. No lentils, no boiled veg, no chick/kidney beans. The potatoes are cooked in butter and oil and eggs are only served at breakfast. The meats taste amazing but again heavily oiled up. The fish is fried or battered.

I feel like I'm just floating in space with no purpose, I'm just existing. Also it seems everything is very complicated, say when someone goes on about a subject / how to do something I see everyone else fully engrossed into it i.e. Business Studies, learning get's them excited and 100% of there focus is into it, and when they get into the real world they just peak, everything they learnt is being put into practise, whereas me learning about it get's me confused, I struggle to get with the basics - and when I ask people the problems I see they're just like ""So what?

We live in quite a nice house, but the problem here is we all sleep in the same room and this room is also the ""ugliest"", like the whole house is kinda old but this room especially looks ""worn out"", mostly because the walls, window frames and of course floor are made of wood, which sure would look nice if the floor wasn't all that f-ed up. The problem begins as i have trouble having anyone over at my place, while sleepovers are basically impossible for obvious reasons, and that was also quite a big problem in my last relationship. Oh, and it's also worth to mention that my sister doesn't go to work or anything, and is at home like 95% of the time, so that just makes it worse. 

So as you can see, i am ashamed not of my house/place as a whole, but where i sleep. Basically noone i hang out with now knows about this, and i don't know what to do or how to react if they want to come over or something. Also, i've been getting close with this girl and if we got together, we couldn't be at her place which i totally understand (if she were to bring a guy home that pretty much means she's getting married).

I made the mistake of petting him and stuff and now my uncle is upset with me. I'm a little worried he intends to shoot it when I'm not around.

He's friendly but has no manners at all and my dog honestly just wants to eat him, so keeping him for myself is out of the question. Our local animal control is a joke. I suspect the woman who runs it just kills anything that's not a baby and keeps the funding for herself. There's literal bags of dead animals hanging from trees out back, I have no clue why this is the chosen disposal method. The conditions inside are awful. I almost think it'd be more merciful if my uncle shot him than to call animal control. I'm gonna try seeing if the neighbors might want him, but failing that I'm not sure what else I can do. It sucks because he seems to be a sweet boy and I hate that he just got dumped like this and probably doesn't have a bright future. I also don't think he'll be allowed to stick around long enough to search for him a new home, my uncle is already mad and tried to chase him off but he just keeps coming back, probably because I petted him.

I am 16. My family, all homeless, including me. We're not on the street, we're in motels. My mother after getting addicted to every mainstream drug a small college town can offer, is going to rehab soon off of her (separated) husband's insurance. He's really a good guy, he's helping, he's down here in a motel too. Anyways, that's that. That's already fucked up enough as it is. She's going to be going away to another state for months because of how fucked up she got doing literally everything she could grt her hands on. She wasn't anything like this before whatsoever, we used to be upper-middle class a long, long time ago. That's a long story. Anyways, she'll be gone. 

I live with my uncle and my grandmother in a separate hotel down the road. My uncle drives lyft, but the reason I'm worried is: he's a dick. I don't know how else to describe it. He brings in food, pays the room, but it never feels like he does it just to do it for the sake of family and he's threatened us with kicking us out before. I don't understand how to deal with it. Along with this, I have school obviously, which doesn't make life any easier, and I'm going to have to deal with a job as well probably. The reason school is a major issue with me is because I'm diagnosed severely ADHD, and I just can't focus in class ever, but I can't tell the school about it. I haven't been taken to get a prescription for my medication in about 3 years now. I'm failing because of unexcused absences and low grades because I can't make it to/function in class. I've failed 9th and I'm afraid I'm going to fail it again because I'm afraid if I tell the school about all the shit that's going on that they'll get CPS involved. I don't want that. I love my family. I don't want to be taken from them but I also don't want to ruin my chances at actual success in life. I want to get into a good college. I want to do well in school. I really don't want to be in this situation but I can't get out and I just don't know what to do.

Please treat your dogs with love and respect. They are living and breathing beings. All dogs have feelings, intelligence, and personalities.

I’m sure there’s another man in her life. I know her and I can tell this from her behavior and many other things.

She’s doesn’t talk about that with me. She doesn’t share with me what she’s thinking and what she’s feeling. This is a pointless relationship for me.

If she was my friend, she’d tell me everything about it, but since we were together she’s not sharing this with me. 

I think that, if she wants me in her life, she needs to be completely open about herself. And because we were together, she can be even more open with me than with a simple friend, because we’ve a more intimate relationship.

Do you understand where I’m coming from?

Let’s put it this way: she doesn’t have to talk about her life with me, if she doesn’t want to.

At the same time, if she doesn’t want to share her life with me, we shouldn’t see each other.

That’s my all point. I don’t want to force her into anything, I just want to tell her that I need honesty if we want to keep this relationship together. If she doesn’t feel like it, it’s better if we don’t see each other.

Am I being reasonable enough here? Also, how do I approach this conversation with her?

I believe she might be afraid of my reaction (even though she knows I’m a really calm person) or maybe she wants to keep my as a 2nd choice of anything, if things don’t work out with this other guy (who knows).

I wants to tell her she can be completely honest and open with me.

383,"I love my SO, with all my heart. No matter what. When we first got together he went to the gym and watched what he ate. And all was fine and dandy. As with all relationships he's gained a little weight, I could care less about the way he looks. My only concern is his eating habits. As of lately he has even told me how bad his eating habits have got and he is realizing how much he eats. I have hit a point of realizing how unhealthy it's gotten the other night. He told me he left work got a meal from a fast food restaurant,went back and ate it. He then said he was so hungry afterwards he went back and got the exact same thing again immediately after. I don't doubt he was hungry but it's getting out of hand. I love him and I just don't know how to tell him maybe we should think about his eating habits without hurting his feelings. I'm honestly just concerned about his health. He seems to get out of breath all the time, he talks of chest pains and I know when he went to the doctor they said his blood pressure was high.

388,"My [23] mother passed away last year and I got guardianship of my little sister [15] because I thought it would be better than her staying with my grandmother because she’s a hoarder. I bought a new house just so my sister can go to school in the same district, bought her all new clothes and furniture, she gets to do things after school with friends, has a new phone, I even found a new job so I can be home on the weekend so we can go out and do stuff because she complained of always being alone. Everything I do is for her and she’s so unappreciative and doesn’t see it.

She has tantrums. Stomping, screaming, slamming doors when she doesn’t get what she wants (for example, can’t hanging out with boys, making her do a single chore, punishing her by taking away her phone/WiFi) it gets to the point where I’m better off just not making her do anything because I don’t want to hear her mouth. I understand she’s a teenager but I don’t think she should be acting like this. She constantly says I ruin her life because I don’t let her do things she shouldn’t be doing, and if she only knew how worse her life could be living in a foster home or with my grandmother maybe she realize she has it made. 

It’s mentally exhausting and it’s tearing my relationship apart with my boyfriend I’ve been with the last 6 years. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have the option of sending her to my grandmothers house but I feel like such an ass if I do because she won’t have anything there and be living in a run down room. Another option is my aunts but she’s out of district and would end up ripping her away from her only friends.

389,"I grew up in a family that told me that if I work hard, I could achieve anything. That just by having the right mindset and dedication, I'll succeed.

Being in school, I'm starting to realize just how much of a lie that is.

I've seen countless of students cheat on exams, and get away with it. One student who is going to be our valedictorian is notorious in the student body for constantly cheating on tests, and despite all of our attempts to inform the teachers / principle, nothing has changed. He's just been accepted into USC, one of the best schools in the world, who only admit ""hard working"" students. Some of my best friends, although I am proud of their success, I know never truly study. They simply read the textbook briefly the night before, and somehow still ace the test. Other kids have advantages for other classes (ex. an Italian student in an Introduction to Spanish class already having an established framework of the language).

I have spent countless of years planning out my studying, taking careful notes, doing the homework on time, asking the teacher for help, and also make sure to eat well, exercise, maintain a social life, etc., you get it. But I can only dream of achieving a similar success, making everything I've done these past couple of years seem like an absolute waste.

So I'm here in desperate help with one simple question: does hard work REALLY pay off? If it does, than how can so many kids like the ones I've outlined above achieve high success with little work? If not, than how does one achieve success in the first place? Is it luck? Probability? Because at this point, I really just don't know.

390,"I'm in highschool, and have two younger brothers, one in middle school, one in elementary. My family found out that we will have to move at the end of june because our landlord is selling the house, and my parents decided it would be best to move up closer to my dad's job because he currently drives an hour to and from work. I would be going to a different school everything.

I've kind of come to accept the fact we were moving, but then they told us they were getting divorced and I don't know how to deal anymore.

When they told us they were getting divorced they made sure to say it wasn't our fault and that they love us and all that, and that they aren't angry or anything.

Our current plan is that we will live with my dad near his job, and my mom will move halfway between her job (where we currently live) and my dad's house so we can see her somewhat often. Like on weekends and stuff.

My mom told us she will be renting out a room until my dad moves with all of us to our new house so she can look at appartments to be as close as she can.  She said she's moving out in 3 weeks, and she will come by in the mornings to get me and my brothers ready for school, and she'll come by after she's done with work to help us make dinner.

I never expected this would happen. My parents have never yelled, I've never even seen them mad at each other, and my whole life they have been an example to me as to what I want my future relationship and marriage to look like, and now that's not there anymore.

I'm going to a whole new school district, I'm going to have divorced parents, and I don't know how to cope with any of this. It's too much change happening too fast.

391,"This is probably ridiculous but here goes. I was out walking my dog with my brother, as we heard the faint ""meows"" of a cat somewhere. I was looking around for the source of the sound, and not long from the little asphalt road we were standing on, was a fluffy cat, with grey paws. It was just sitting there like 20 meters away meowing at us. I walked over to it and looked for a collar, worried that it might be lost. It did have one, but no name tag. It was a really beautiful cat, fluffy fur and blue eyes. I was getting kinda scared that it might have gotten out of one of the houses near by (we were close to a little neighbourhood) so i tried to pick it up. It didn't like that, and it was scared of my dog, whom my brother was holding. So i decided to knock on a couple of doors, to ask if anyone knew who owned the cat. The first (and only) house i knocked on looked very expensive, and there was a black BMW outside. After a little while a young mid-twenties man opend the door. He had brown hair, beard stuble, and blue eyes and a big white smile. He was also very tan. I ask.

""Hey theres this big fluffy cat outside just meowing at us, i'm afraid it might be lost or something is it yours? Or maybe one of your neighbours?""
And as i ask this, he's looking me up and down as he's smiling... almost... sexually. I'm getting kinda weirded out.
He says that he doesn't own a cat, but that there's lots of them roaming around in the area, one that also fits the description i gave.
But it doesn't look like an outdoor cat to me, it looks well groomed and such.

Him: ""Where do you live?""
Me: *weirded out* ""uh, just back that way""
Him: ""oh okay, where's that? Where do you live?""
Me: ""just like *area name*

I'm sort of avoiding the question cus i don't wanna tell this rich guy the name of my street. So i just tell him the name of the area, which is pretty large. I look behind him because there have been some sounds coming from inside. I then notice a little baby crawling on the floor. Which explains the two strollers outside.

Me: ""Yeah, well if it's an outdoor cat it probably lives nearby here, and can probably find its way home""

He doesn't really say anything. He just looks me up and down. The conversation should normally end here do i'm just like ""well, bye"" so i turn around. It takes him a couple of seconds to say:
""Yeah bye, thanks for asking""

I walk over to my brother as it's beginning to rain, and i tell him about the guy. We decide to leave the cat, even though i don't feel all that good about it. And i start to talk about how creepy the guy was. Sorta the outdoorsy rich tan white guy, with a big white grin and an expensive car. Also how he was looking at me. It also felt like he looked at my groin. My brother agrees that it was weird. And we star talking about wether or not he's like a serial killer/psycopath.

We're both high functioning autistic (atypical), i guess you'd call it, and have a bit if anxiety. It's easy for us to worry. So when we get home, i open photoshop, and begin to find pictures that match his hair, his smile, and beard stuble. I write down every detail i know, including a picture of his house from google maps. I didn't get the adress though.

When my mom gets home she's also very weirded out about the fact that he asked where i lived, and that he looked me up and down like that. I'm just getting really paranoid, because when reading about people who were murdered by serial killers, it's often just completely coincidental. Like people just being unlucky enough to knock on their doors, or getting in their cars while hitch hiking. So i thought i'd make this post to ask for your advice. Again i'm autistic and over think things, but he just made me feel so uncomfortable. Though i know it's probably irrational...

392,"Growing up he had many hobbies, was active, had many friends and was happy and well-adjusted.

\- Around grade 8 he started playing video games a lot

\- By grade 10 he was playing all the time and had drifted from his friend group and spent pretty much all his free time in his room.

\- In high school he pretty much had no friends, very rarely hung out with anyone (I don't remember him ever doing so but maybe a few times), but he played games with some classmates occasionally.

\- So he missed out on developing social skills and experience etc. in an important part of his life.

\- Became depressed (I think I would categorize it as such) in high school - missed 20-30 days from school every year because he played video games all night wasn't able to wake up (probably did that because he didn't have the energy to go to school). Barely talked to or engaged with his family. I have barely talked to him for 5 years. Of course random daily stuff like can I borrow your car, did you walk the dog, etc. Occasionally I ask him questions about things he knows (computers, math etc.) But pretty much no casual conversation.

\- He's now in university studying a STEM major with decent grades. He still has no friends, plays video games a lot but nowhere near as much as before. He seems interested in improving himself; he studies a lot, cooks healthy food sometimes, walks our dog and teaches him tricks.

As he is now he won't be able to live independently after university and get a job, apartment, get friends, socialize, get a girlfriend/wife/family etc.

Me and the rest of our family are supportive but it seems like my parents are afraid to talk about him not having friends etc., talk to him about it. It's very possible that he has Aspergers/Autism. Now that I write this I can't believe we haven't done anything drastic as a family in the last 5 years to help him. I'm ashamed in myself and my parents for not having the courage to bring it up and just dancing around the problem for so long.

What should I do? Talk to my parents about it first I guess. Then what? And what can I do for him personally? I could ask him to start working out with me so he has something to do or invite him to hang out with my friends (But I'm 95% sure he'd say no because he'd perceive it as condescending.)",24Mar2019,5

395,"So here’s some backstory. I’m 13 and my dad’s friend is living at our house rent-free. He crashes out on the sofa. He works a job, but is too stingy with his money to purchase his own house. He has a job, I believe he works in some sort of construction site, however, he is not a builder. He works with powers, yet dangerous tools. The odour he brings into the house after work when he takes his shoes off is fetid. As he rarely takes a shower.

Due to his 'situation' his twin daughters come and stay with us every weekend. Don’t get me wrong, I like his twin daughters. We get along extremely well and are good friends. However, it’s becoming repetitive and annoying to deal with. We hardly ever have a weekend to ourselves. Not to mention, I’m still up at 3am because they want to sit on my bed late staring at their phones. However, I don’t want to seem rude, so I don’t say anything. They also, mess my room up time to time, they’ll leave their drinks or rubbish on my bed-side table et cetera. 

Furthermore, they don’t set a good example for my younger sister, who is 12 and easily impressionable, they both smoke cigarettes daily and drink alcohol occasionally. No one says anything, because 1, they’re not my father’s children and he isn’t responsible for them. 2, their father doesn’t care for them. On the weekend he stays asleep until 6 in the afternoon! Whilst his daughters sit there and practically starve! He needs to get off his back-side and care for his kids.

I wanted to run a bath one morning and I shouted him to turn on the gas. It’s not like I had woken him up at 9 or anything! I let him have a lie in! But it just wasn’t good enough for him. In-turn he decided to mumble to himself, and I quote ""retard"". Mind you, it’s 4 in the afternoon, on a Saturday! He never cooks, never takes responsibility, never helps out and refuses to do household tasks despite us putting a roof over his head. I help out more then he does! It’s awfully difficult, but I clean the kitchen on a daily-basis. I sweep mop and hoover the house without being asked. I know I’m not a saint but he can’t even wash his own mug!

His daughters bless them, make a mess too. They spill milk, sugar etc. All over the kitchen island. They don’t even clean it up, I’m the one who has to wipe it down. I find it disrespectful. I can’t just go downstairs and tell him that his daughters are no longer allowed to stay. His daughters have the choice to see him or not and they see him every weekend because they love him. I know if I only saw my daughters twice a week I’d plan something special for them. A day out, he has the money too, I know he does. He’s a awful parent. Hence why he’s fighting for his younger son in court and paying thousands in court fees, lawyers etc.

I hate to be pessimistic, but I know for a fact a judge is not going to grant a scruffy homeless man, living at a friends house custody of a beautiful young boy with more potential then he has. I’m going to go, but I would appreciate it if you could give me some advice. Thank you!",24Mar2019,1
396,"Hi Reddit.

It seems my [21/f] father [59/m] has a gambling problem. Occasionally he goes to a casino (by occasionally I mean every Tuesday night - but that's better than it was) but the problem has transitioned to a slot game called Slotomania. It's an app and I believe there is a Facebook version. 

Some back story on my father:
He lost most of his vision in his left eye after having a cancerous tumor behind his eye. His vision was poor to begin with. In early 2018, my dad started going to the casino. When I turned 21, I tagged along a few times and he seemed to really enjoy it. He is really good at math and stats and the like, and has a really really good memory (he once won an award for being able to play bingo without using space covering things). In my opinion, gambling appeared to me something that was mentally stimulating, and probably helps him feel more competent. He hasn't been able to golf or bowl or run much since he started having back problems a few years back, and I can only imagine that adding vision problems to the mix only makes it worse. He has verbally expressed to me before that he doesn't have any hobbies anymore..

He went to the casino frequently. I'm not sure how frequently or how much money he may have won or lost. But, like I said, he started using the app game more and gambling IRL less - I think beginning in the summertime of last year. 

In July, he asked me to help him make an in-game purchase. He didn't remember his Microsoft account info, so I just entered mine. I added his credit card info to my account, gave him my password, and showed him how to access it. 
I went back to my room and I'd gotten an email notification on my phone about the changes to my Microsoft account. A few minutes later, I got an email receipt about an in-app purchase for about $2.99. At the time, I actually felt happy! My dad is usually pretty frugal about stuff trivial things. It was nice to see him spend some money on himself.
Things took a turn, however, because I got another email receipt. And another. And so on..
I've seen receipts for upwards of $70. I'm not even sure why you'd want to spend that much.

In September, I studied abroad. I know my dad was stressed. It was stressful for me too. I feel like he may have felt more inclined to spend because the notifications didn't stop. At one point, I decided to add up everything.. In about 2 months, he spent around $500. I still, fairly regularly, get emails - I just got an email about an hour ago which is why I thought to write this out. I haven't had the guts to add up the dollar amount since that first time, but I have an email folder dedicated to all the receipts just in case.

I contemplated changing my password. I know he'd just ask me for help again. If not me, someone else. And maybe I'd rather know than not. I mentioned this situation to my sister, and it broke her heart. She wondered if maybe it was a mistake and maybe we should confront him in case he's not meaning to do this, but I feel like he'd lie and that would just hurt more.. Also, I can only imagine that for him to know that I know would be incredibly embarrassing for him.

What do I do?
Should I even be mad? I mean.. I have a small Steam game library and I play WoW which has a subscription cost. Though I usually don't play during the school semester. Maybe I just don't understand the hype about Slotomania. It comes across as a predatory game that profits off of addictive personalities. To be fair though, many games are addictive..",24Mar2019,1
398,"So yesterday me and my friend were out close to a barber we decided it would be fun to point the middle finger to him and run away, we did it and we went home because it got boring. Well today it became extra, we did the same thing today and ran away but this time the barber went out (keep in mind he’s in his fourties and could have easily done much) and he ran after us screaming stuff like ”You son of a bitch” and ”Im gonna kill you”. Me and my friend became very scared and hid for about 2 minutes until he was infront of us (1-3 meter distance) we ran away again and hid because he really was gonna hit us. We went home after that and thought to ourselves how it was dumb and immature.

I know it was very stupid of me to do but Im thinking that when a barber leaves his customer and starts shouting stuff like Im gonna kill you you start thinking that you are dealing with a psychopath because his way of speaking was very mad, me and my friend wanted to apologize but he was really mad and has psycho signs.

406,"Hi,

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this type of question, but this sub gets a lot of traffic so I though it would be a good place. I have an anxiety that I've been dealing with for a few months, and I'm not really sure how to handle it or get perspective on it. Basically, I feel like though I want to have sex, I'm afraid that the consequences (namely pregnancy), far outweigh the benefits (momentary pleasure). But I must be wrong in this fear right, because people have sex all the time?

For context, I'm a 19 year old male who is a freshman in college. I'm generally very happy and I have an active social life, but I have been having this internal conflict about sex for the past few months. I've had several opportunities to have sex with girls I'm very attracted to, but I've always backed out in the end not because I didn't want to or because I don't feel ready, but because I'm afraid that on the off chance the girl did get pregnant, it would ruin my life in a sense. I really want to join the Peace Corps after college, and my dream is to go into a job in foreign service or the military after that. I feel like if I had a kid, it would be so hard to even finish college, and there's no way I could have a job overseas. Why should I risk these long-term goals just to have sex now, when I could just wait several year to have sex and then diminish the risk?

At the same time, though, I recognize that this fear is sort of irrational. I know a handful of classmates who've hooked up with half a dozen people or more, or people who have sex with their significant other 10 times a week, and they don't bat an eye. Idk. It's just hard as a teenager, because sex is like the only thing at this age where 1. it's seen as a positive and healthy thing, but 2. a routine 10 minute encounter can completely change the course of your life forever.

Anyone have thoughts on this? Am I just being stupid?

412,"I (15M) am pretty lost at the moment. Over a year ago I suspected there may be something wrong with me as I started to stress more and more, overthinking every social situation. I became very unconfident and rather awkward in some circumstances. Since then I've spent countless nights up until 3 am in bed going over the day and all the things i didn't do or did wrong. I don't want to come across as an edgy teen thinking it's cool to be depressed, and I'm not going to act like it's worse than it is, because sometimes I'm fine. 

It's been stressing me out that sometimes I can't speak to anyone about the things that keep me up and stop me from being productive. I end up bottling everything up and occasionally in public I start having a breakdown that I have to hide. I'm not an emotional person to others and quite mature for my age, a couple of my closest friends and my girlfriend are aware of some of my breakdowns and my difficulties sleeping but I don't feel comfortable giving them any detail about the insecurities or causes of them, and they end up giving generic advice, which is no fault of theirs.

I've never been very close with my family, and my siblings are around 10 years older than me which puts me off talking to them as they wouldn't relate to any of my problems. My episodes have become more and more frequent and I end up spacing out in class often as my mind is so full. The only thing that helps me escape sometimes is sport, and alcohol helps me to loosen up but I'm not a fan of becoming an alcoholic at 15. When I try to explain things out loud it always sounds stupid and it's very frustrating, I want to avoid giving too much detail to my parents, I just want either antidepressants or a therapist. I'm not sure if either will really help but I just want to be more productive and stop dwelling on things. Music is basically the only thing keeping me going at the moment.

Sorry for the messy post, any advice on what to say or if there's any way to get hold of anything that would help me would be highly appreciated.

tl;dr: Pretty sure I have depression, want a diagnosis and some help, stressing out about how to tell my parents.",24Mar2019,0

So a while ago, Ann and I started texting each other. One day, she invited me to a birthday party, I was over the moon. Since then, we have had a chance to get to know each other, we've been on a few dates and I've invited her around for my own birthday. We are in a relationship that I'm happy with.

Last week, when I was in a class at school, a girl in my class, Betty, was asking for the answer to a question. Betty is always asking for my answer, as we're both top of the class in Biology and Maths. After a while, it's become frustrating since I never ask Betty for hers. On this occasion, I glanced back at my answer and continued to do my own work, effectively ignoring Betty's question. In hindsight, it was very impolite, but honestly I'd had enough. So Betty asks me again, this time in an angrier tone ""I asked you, can I see your answer?"" to which I reply ""nah, I'm good thanks."" So then Betty proceeds to go red, as she has a tantrum. At this point, I'm not proud of what I said, but I tell Betty ""Oh come on now Betty, don't cry.""

I know, I don't know why I went there. But now Betty won't speak to me, she's quite a stubborn person. I'm not bothered by it but I don't want her to be upset. So anyway, here's where we introduce Charlotte. Charlotte, Betty and I all attend an orchestra weekly. This week, Betty ignored me throughout the whole thing, I asked her why she was ignoring me, to which she replied, while storming away : ""I wonder why."" Charlotte has asked Betty about this, and is currently talking with me about it, but it doesn't feel right. I just want to get it done with, but since I've added Betty's sc, she's been constantly wanting me to talk to her, sending me ""Sb"" almost hourly. Idk if she does this to everyone in her list but honestly we're not really that close, we kinda have a weird acquaintanceship. So, idk, my girlfriend, Ann is such a kind person, I don't think Betty is good news, she seems a bit overenthusiastic. I kinda want to let her know that I don't really want us to be much more than distant friends, even though that feels selfish, I just don't know how.

427,"For some background: Around two years ago, my parents went through a nasty divorce. My dad was an alcoholic, and severely depressed in the year leading up to my mom filing for divorce.  My dad has always better exceedingly angry and bitter about the way that the divorce played out (my mom got most things, although she took on about 20k worth of debt that my dad had.). 

My dad has always talked bad about my mom to my younger brother and I (he’s 14, and I’m 16). Never anything that I felt super concerned about, just a lot of “I hate your mother”, “She screwed me over in the divorce”, “Her lawyer was ruthless”, etc. 

However, recently, I went on a trip with my dad over spring break. It was great, until the drive home, when he began to talk about my mom. It was the usual, until he said this: “Your mother probably hides behind you kids. If it weren’t for you two, I think I would’ve killed her by now, or at least tried to. I could easily take her in a fight, you know.” 

I was, and still am, stunned by the statement. I’m afraid to talk to anyone about it, because I don’t want my dad to be angry with me or something to happen to him. However, I’m very concerned for my mom, because this isn’t the first time that he’s threatened violence against her. The implications of that statement scare me immensely, and I don’t know who to turn to.

430,"Before Christmas i had a hole in my roof where some shingles had blown off. Ling storybshort i call insurance since redoing that side of the roof would cost over $1000 (its a small part but thats the estimates i got). They sent a guy to look and after 2 weeks told me its not because of wind damage but just because the roof is old so they wont do anything. My premium has gone up again and my home insurance payment is due in a few days. My mom owns the home and weblive in NYC where natural disasters dont really hit us.

We have been thinking lately about how much money insurance has wasted over the years. I could literally just be putting that money away and using it for repairs on my own instead. Insurance payment is 2k for the year now. Seems pretty ridiculous since they only cover damage from a fire if the house burns down, water damage and floods(we dont live on low ground so kind of useless, and the house above street level on top of that), and it covers some minor theft. Just basic stuff. 

I feel like insurance is a scam since they will make excuses no matter what happens unless my youse literally gets burnt down. I should add that the roof damage did cause water damage inside and the insurance didnt help with that either.

431,"okay, so right now I am just finishing my first year of university. I have not declared a major, but I am in the faculty of arts. I started university straight out of high school, and didn’t even consider other options (working, traveling, etc.) However, now I am unsure of how to continue next year, and it’s stressing me out. When it comes to choosing a major, I don’t even know where to start... English (writing, communications) has always been something that I enjoy and am relatively successful in. I hesitate to chose English as my major though, because I have been repeatedly told that English majors only become teachers, and I don’t see myself as a teacher.

Now, in the past few   moths I've at least been having some social contact and made a couple of friends, although I mostly help them with stuff like maths, physics or chemistry - unless they have some sort of mental breakdown which most of   them do quite frequently and while I would really prefer them just being fine, I love listening to their problems and (at least feeling like) helping them by being there.

Anyhow, that's not what I need help with, I believe I need to fix my life,  because I think there's about nothing not wrong about it, hygiene is  something that exists once every now and then, order is something you might think I never even heard of, I might be great at listening to what   other people want to talk about and I am a very trustworthy person,  but  I'm horrible at talking, I couldn't lead a conversation if my life  were  dependend on it.

I sleep about 6 hours a night, because I just stay up way too long doing I don't even  know  what, mostly watching youtube and other useless stuff like that, I guess.

My nutrition is (most likely) pretty bad, I hardly ever exercise, so I'm overweight, 86Kg (\~190 lbs)   at 1,78m (\~5 ft 10''), though it would most likely be quite a bit more if I had anything muscle-like in my body.

Now, for everything else you want to know about, you can most likely just assume it's non-existent/pretty bad.

433,"I have a mutually benefitial relationship with a former school teacher of mine. She finds students for me to teach them private math classes and she takes a cut. The pay is OK for my country's standards. She charges them about 16 USD an hour for classes in spanish and 20 USD an hour in english. She takes the same cut for both types of classes, 6 USD. All in our local currency. This job works for me fine even if I could get a better one because the schedule is extremely flexible to my needs as a university student. 

I'm graduating uni quite soon, less than half a year until I'm done. This means I won't be able to work for her in the same measure as I do now or at all, since I have to do an internship soon to finish my degree and this usually means getting a full time job.

Summer 2017 I taught enough hours to make around 400 USD for myself not including her cut. She found out her boyfriend of 7 years (who had also raised her daughter with her) was cheating on her and got into a bunch of debt as well. She decided to stay with him even with him having cheated because she didn't want to raise her daughter without a father, especially the man who had been doing that for essentially her daughter's whole life. 

She alleged that she had to take the money she was supposed to pay me to pay some debt she had. I understood and only asked her how's she doing and when does she expect to pay me maybe once a month since then. 

She paid me half of it in may 2018, now it's march 2019 and every time I ask her she's like ""oh i'm totally out of money now"". She went on a trip to NY like a week ago for a whole week and doesn't seem to be particularly frugal lately as she was back when she took the money, since I saw her purchasing food multiple times from places and gotten it delivered here as opposed to cooking which is significantly cheaper where we live.

I asked her about the money a week before I knew she was on a trip to NY and she said the same thing, that she's out of money and can't pay me now.

What do I do? It's almost been 2 years. There's no urgency for the money, I don't need it desperately but holy hell my patience is running out.

**TL;DR**: boss has owed me money for nearly two years, always says she can't pay me now every time i ask (monthly) but went on a trip to the US recently and spent about a week there and has been purchasing food from restaurants and gotten it delivered instead of cooking (which is much cheaper), something she didn't do before, when she originally needed the money.",24Mar2019,1
434," ***I don't expect anyone here to want to read this whole thing, so I'll include a short version at the bottom.***

The title is pretty self explanatory, although in a sense it isn't. I'll explain why now.

I'm currently 18 Years old (Male, Western Australia), struggling with becoming an adult. Why exactly may you ask? That more lingers towards the career aspect. I do suffer with a bit of anxiety and at times depression, so if some of the thoughts in the post seem to come across as weird or out of the blue, it ma be because I'm not thinking straight.

At the start of this year, I started a Certificate IV course in Cyber Security. Why exactly I started this course? Since I was interested in both joining the Police Force &amp; Computers, I thought this would be a good blend of the two. Oh how wrong I was. I never entirely understand just how much I hated being cooped up inside until I started this course. Not to mention the fact that it is hard, incredibly complicated (for my brain) and disinterests me entirely. See, ever since I was a kid I've had a dream of moving to a regional/country town, getting a job and settling down. Growing up, you start to realise it isn't as easy as that when people start trying to throw life/career planners at you and force you to stick with a life-long career path from the age of 14 (when I started high-school). Whilst this works in some cases, it didn't in mine and the same occurred for a lot of my friends, and now I'm stuck at a crossroads.

I have the perfect opportunity (at the end of this year) to move to a regional town called Exmouth with my girlfriend (whom I've been dating a year) as she will be pursuing a career in that location. I've sat down and laid out my options, and I feel like these are my best ones at the moment.

1. Instead of pursuing Cyber Security, instead try and join the Police Force (could take anywhere upwards of 3 years) and then try transfer to the same town my girlfriend will be going to (Exmouth).
2. Move (maybe not permanently) to Exmouth at the end of this year, get a part-time job in the area (girlfriend has family up in that direction, so I might be able to quickly with connections) save up some money, and start looking at courses/jobs I can do in that area whilst living up there.
3. If option 2 doesn't work out, move back to the city and pursue the Police Force like I said in Option 1.

Now I know what some people could be thinking? ""Is he mainly wanting to move to the country because his girlfriend is?"", No. That isn't my reasoning at all. Like I stated before, I've wanted to live in the country ever since I was a kid, and I've visited this place before myself and thought it was absolutely beautiful. It just happens to work out that she has family there/wants to live there too.

To be honest, this has all put a lot of stress on me recently and I'm really stuck on what to do. I've also been trying to find a job at the moment that I can use to save up a fair bit of money to go at the end of the year if I wanted to pursue that, but everything seems to be online applications and as if your application won't even be considered without experience (how do they expect people to have experience, if they won't give people a chance to gain experience in the first place). I don't know, maybe that's just me not making sense.

TL:DR - Struggling with making a choice, (Leaving my current course which I dislike and trying to join the Police, or instead move away to a place I would love to live, try find a career there and then move back to the other option if that doesn't work out). Kind of a shitty long story short, but too much information to include without making it longer.

Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you so much.",24Mar2019,1
435,"I am struggling to decide which school to attend for my PhD program. For context, I am an undergraduate senior that has been accepted to both programs and have been together with my SO for 2 very happy years.

School 1 is a prestigious university in the large city where my SO has accepted a full time job he loves. They are a top tier program, but are very small (~3 students/year). During the first year they do rotations so you can experience 3-4 advisors before you chose. When I visited school 1, I liked it but was concerned about the size of the program and finding research I really loved. However, if I went to School 1, I would live with my SO, and get to spend the next 4-6 years in a very exciting large city.

School 2 is a large and reputable state university in a city very similar to where I am doing my undergrad. It’s about 2.5 hours (driving) from my SO. The lab I was accepted to is the best it gets for my field: well known stellar reputation, good work life balance, and many students to collaborate and become friends with (plus alumni effect). If I went to School 2, I would live on my own and would hope to see my SO at least every other week.

436,"I applied to three colleges this year: Evergreen State College, Kenyon College and Warren Wilson. Evergreen State is according to my family out of the question, and I was rejected by Kenyon. Unless I find some other college I can quickly apply to, I basically have one option. 

I could apply to colleges nearby, but I think I need a change of scenery. Here's my problem, though: I've been reading a lot about Evergreen and Warren Wilson, and my gut tells me to go to Evergreen. But I'm not convinced that I'll get any of the money my grandmother left me for college if I don't follow my family's instructions. I've been taking financial help from the family for over a year, because I felt like I had to, but I now realize that I don't have to take any help from them at all if I don't want to.

437,"So this is a very complicated situation.  And I'm not very good at determining what information is necessary, so I'm gonna give as much detail as I can.

So. This all started in about mid December.  I met this girl in this game I play. We played together like a few times, and then I met her girlfriend. I'm gonna give them names just to make this easier.  The girl I first met, her name will be Carah. And her girlfriend be named Tasha. So Carah was really sweet to me and very affectionate. Tasha was alot more reserved but still pretty nice. They soon became the most important people in life. And I guess you can say they liked me a bit too, at first. 

So as the weeks go by, I really start opening up to them. And I'm a very lonely person  and I haven't opened up to anyone in years. So this was kind of a big deal. But anyway, as the weeks go by , I start texting back and forth with Carah. And we become pretty close I guess. I tried to do the same with Tasha, but I guess our personalities didnt really mix well for that sort of thing. Like we would text about the game we played and stuff about when she would be on, and she would occasionally text me saying that she missed me( I really enjoyed that). But I could never really get anything going with her like I could with Carah. But it was fine. I had enough fun with her on the mic playing the game. 

But anyway. I guess the problems really started when started to feel ""special "" to them (for lack of a better word). Like me and Carah at least texted just about every day. And we would play together almost as frequently.  And so I guess you can say I thought I was a real friend to them. But I am a very insecure person and also very paranoid. And so I would sometimes get into these doubting moods, where I  would doubt validity of our friendship.  And honestly just act like a bitch. They would call it being ""dramatic"" .And they would get mad and all , but the would eventually just forgive me. And they even invited me to their home for 5 days after just 2 months of knowing me. And they wanted me to even move to their town so we could be closer and hang out more. But even after all that, I would still have these dramatic episodes.  And eventually,  I could tell that Tasha started to not like me. And this bothered me alot. But I guess I was fine as long as at least one of them liked me. And Carah seemed to still like me alot. But I would still act like a little bitch, and I was expecting her to stop being my friend during one of these dramatic episodes.  But she would always just move on. And it was fine. 

So I decided that I was gonna move to their town. I'm in a very stressful situation at my current living quarters.  I live with my sick mother and pay her bill and mortgage,  and help provide for my younger siblings. And honestly,  I want out of this situation. And moving to their town was perfect. It would be far from here so I couldn't get guilt tripped by anyone for money. (My relationship with my family is not good at all). So I told my family plan on moving and there were some big fights and my mom even threatened to kick me out right then. ( Even though I pay her bills). But it was all fine. Cause soon I would have a new start and I would be close to the only 2 people I ever considered real friends. 

But then out of nowhere.  It all changed. On Monday I asked Carah a question about the game we were playing. Instead of answering,  she just kinda made fun of the way I asked it. So I asked it again. And then I waited an hour and a half. And I checked, and it said she read the message. And never responded. So this kinda made me mad. So i simply told her that i was having a bad day and this question being on my mind was just making it worse. So I would appreciate if she would just answer it. I kinda started to regret it as soon as I sent it. And rightfully so. Cause her response pretty much ended our friendship I guess.
I will now post exactly what she said
""Listen I know you don’t have a good support system and I am truly sorry for that but I don’t think I can be around as much anymore. I think you have become too attached and are getting this relationship confused. if you still want to play video games i would very much enjoy that but the constantly talking and expecting a reply has to stop. I can’t always be messaging when I’m not on the Xbox. I’m sorry, and I hope you don’t take that in a bad way""

 So I kinda started to freak out and asking a bunch of questions, and it turned into kinda an argument I guess. And towards the end of it, i asked if she still wanted me to move close to her, and she said that she would talk to me about it later. I said ok. So I wait until Wednesday.  And I'm getting impatient.  So I send her a really long text being all dramatic and everything.  And another argument happens. And I ask her again if she still wanted me to move. And she said "" you need to slow your roll"" and I ask what that means and she says ""obviously it's a fucking no"" and that kinda just shattered my world. I have had this mindset and this plan to move to Tennessee.  And now it was gone. It was so confusing to me, because literally 12 hours before this, she was asking her grandmother if she had any places available for me to stay ( as she's a landlord) . And me and her were talking about jobs in her town. And nothing really happened in between,  except for the question I asked. And I tried asking questions about what I did, and that just made her angry.  She just keeps saying she wants to keep playing video games with me. Then she asked if I was gonna be online that night. I just ignored the message,  turned my phone off and drove up to the mountains, and stayed there until Saturday.  Its something I like to do when I'm feeling sad or feel like I want to die. Most of my time I just layed on the cold ground thinking. The only thing I had to eat all 3 days was a bag of sunflower seeds.

With all my thinking during those 3 days,  I came to the conclusion that I need this moving thing and I need a real friend.  So I eventually went home. And I turned on my phone, kinda hoping that my phone would have been blown up with messages from them. But no. Just  a bunch from my mother asking me for money.  

It happened to be their anniversary on Saturday.  So I just sent them each a congratulations text wishing them a great day and all. Carah messaged back saying thanks, and then started to ramble about some things going on in her life. Tasha never even replied. Me and Carah talked for a bit, and it seemed like everything was fine. Then I told her that I missed them, and then fell asleep. She responded saying ""you wouldn't miss us if you just played with us more"". 

When I woke up I told her sorry I fell asleep.  She said that it was fine and that she was at work. And when she's at work that's when me and her text the most. Cause she's an overnight caregiver.  Where she basically just watches old people sleep and help the use the restroom. So I was expecting to be texting her all night like we usually do. But no. She just left me on read. And that's where we are at now. 

I just want our old friendship back and I want them to want me to move closer to them again. I just dont know what to do, and I feel like any attempt I do ti talk about it will just push them further away. I feel helpless. I was so motivated when they wanted to to move. It was going to be like a rebirth for me. But now I feel dead inside. I have no motivation.  I haven't even worked since Monday.  I would just like some advice on ways I could get back to where we use to be. I've never had a friendship like this and I just dont know what to do

440,"Okay so me and best friend have had great times. Up until recently there were things she has said very hurtful things.(Ex. ""Your Dad is stupid""-just because he didn't want to drive like 50 minutes to a movie theater for a movie). Another example is when I complained about my homework and I said I didn't like the teacher and she said that to stop exaggerating since she had that same teacher and class and said it was easy which really annoyed me since when she complains I just listened and was understanding to her. Another example is when she called my mom boring just because she doesn't go out to get someone to color her hair and her mom does and in my head I thought why does it really matter that much to her is that really any of her business? And the last example is when her and her mom said they doubt I'm mexican since I can't speak spanish that well and I don't know a lot of the foods from Mexico. Maybe she was just joking I don't know or maybe I'm reading into things but what she said really hurt and I don't think I can put up with it anymore.",24Mar2019,1
441,"I was with a woman from 21-25 (married 24-26).

She worshipped me, literally did absolutely everything and anything for me. I’ve never been with anyone so caring before or after.

I was the biggest cunt to her, I treated her like shit, I gas lighted her, made her apologise for MY fuck ups, I kicked her out time and time again, she begged ME back.
I screamed at her for buying the wrong brand cereal, made her go out at stupid times to buy things for me. I screamed, threw things and generally made her life miserable for pretty much 4/5 years.

I was the biggest cunt, looking back I feel absolutely nothing but shame for my actions/words &amp; general mistreatment of her. We last had contact in September 2016, harsh words came from her and her friend (so I blame her?? Nope).

It’s been 4 years since we split, lord knows I still regret every negative word, every negative way I treated her. She just wanted me to love her like a gf/wife should and I did nothing but cause her grief.

I just want to apologise, tell her I’m sorry, that that person back then has officially gone and won’t ever come back, that I hope she knows I do regret how I acted &amp; hope one day she could forgive me.

I don’t want or expect anything in return from her, I don’t expect a reply or any kind of contact. I just want to apologise. I feel like I can’t move on until I do it. 

However it ended NASTY, worse than nasty. I’m worried it’ll bring up unnecessary contact from her friends/family.

Do I just live with the fact I was a cunt and her thinking I’m still the same prick now or should I apologise.

TL;DR Treated ex wife like shit, now I want to apologise but haven’t had contact of any kind in 3 years.",24Mar2019,1
442,"I don't know if it's relevant, but I am an early 20s female.

Backstory, I met this girl online about a year and half ago. We fell for each other, but because of distance and her own problems we never got past friendship. Her problems were that she did not feel fit to be in a relationship due to mental illness like depression and suicidal issues. Out of respect, I never pushed for a relationship, but always believed it would somehow all work out.

Fast forward around July last year we had a very petty argument and she blocked me. It really messed with me and I said a few harsh things because I really did not expect to be dropped just like that. I soon apologized for it and said I'd leave her alone and eventually moved on. While I kind of moved on, I still missed her a lot and had some lingering feelings for her. I tried to date again, but it just wasn't her.

Months later (around Oct-Nov) I got a good amount of money saved up from working and not really having much to spend on, so I decided to visit her country. I have many friends in that country so initially it was for me to see them, but I couldn't stop thinking of her after I booked that flight so I, who still had her phone number, texted her that I was going to her country and I was wondering if she'd like to meet up. She called me telling me she missed me and that the whole thing was a mistake, etc. I cried and told her I missed her too.

Everything was fine, we'd play video games and voice chat and make jokes about how we'd meet up like before. I was eager to see her and she was eager to see me as well.

Fast forward a month ago, I'm landing in her country and I go to see her. We share a big hug and I'm exhausted for an 8 hour flight plus hours of preparing and getting early to the airport and yada yada, so I ask if we can just go directly to her house since I'm also carrying a lot. On the way, we talk just like normal, I hug her again and she hugs me back, I lay my head on her shoulder and she lays on her head back on my head. Honestly, everything seems completely fine so far.

I spent 3 days and 2 nights there total. 3rd day she had to go see her mom which was pre-planned from before, and I had to go see my other friends, but the plan was that I'd be back in a week to spend another full week with her before going back home. During those 3 days I felt everything was fine, though, unfortunately my body was not used to the country so I ended up sleeping at odd hours and feeling sick, so we weren't able to go outside as much as we wanted to. We were just like friends staying in, watching movies and talking and eating snacks. Nothing felt wrong. On the last day, I thought I'd be brave and ask her if we were on the same page about staying friends or not, and she hit me with the same reason of not being able to be in a relationship because of her issues which she compared to something like ""a cancer patient wouldn't go get a girlfriend"" because of her suicidal thoughts problems and the fact that she feels that her being with me would just hurt me. I didn't push her, so I did kindly ask her to please look at me and reject me then. My reason for this is that I wanted to be a proper friend to her and finally get the closure I needed to not pursue her anymore. She did, and she assured me it had nothing to do with me and that I wouldn't have trouble finding someone, etc.

It was a bit awkward for a few minutes but because of my weird body not used to the place, I just go sleep it off and she goes to the other room to play video games. After I wake up, I watch her play with other friends on voice chat and we have a normal nice time, with me giving her advice on how to play, etc. And then it's time for me to leave and she has to leave a bit later. I leave some clothes because I was coming back anyway, and go stay with another friend. I have a blast at my other friend's house and then it's nearing time to go back to hers, so I call her to see how she is, no answer. Next day is the day before I'm supposed to take the train to hers, I'm calling again and no answer. I send her a text message asking if she's okay for tomorrow? hours go by, night time before I go see her and finally she sends me a message saying she doesn't feel well and that it would not be a good idea for her to be near anyone.

I'm shocked. This is the thing I was worried about. I asked what's going on and if I did something wrong. She repeats herself in different wording and says something about not wanting to relive ""that time"" if i recall correctly. It kind of sounds like I did something terribly wrong, but I have no clue. Usually when she's like this, she has friends come over anyway because she feels better around other people, so I tell her this and say that I must have done something wrong, otherwise it wouldn't just end this way. I also ask if I will get to see her again. No response. I ask her if she could call me. She said she would when she's up for it. I say okay, and I guess to throw away the clothes I left since I had a strong feeling she just didn't ever want to see me again whatever the reason is.

Now at this point I'm wondering what the fuck. I have no idea what's going on. She's seen exactly what I look like in pictures and video, so I'm wondering if I was disappointing in real life or not (mind you, while I was tried to show myself exactly how I am, her irl was a lot bigger than the pictures (which weren't many) I ever got. But I did not mind at all.) Was it because I was sick and boring? I have no idea.

4 or 5 days later she still hasn't called and my phone breaks (unlucky). I have no clue if she ever even tried, but she has other ways to reach me which she didn't try at all.

Last day in her country, I just give up. I had spent all those days devastated, disappointed and feeling humiliated and trying my best to hide it, but I guess it was still kind of obvious. Thankfully my friend and his housemates were all lovely people who tried to support me a lot, even when I accidentally broke down crying during one of the days I stayed there.

I know in my heart there's more to the story, but I came home almost 2 weeks ago never knowing what. 

Angry, hurt and exhausted, I didn't try to push her, so I blocked her on my last day there and decided to just delete all of this from my life. I thought I could fight it and not let her hurt me so bad. I hate that I'm letting her hurt me this bad, but everyday has just been pain and confusion. I don't sleep well, my eating disorder is back and my depression has never been this bad. When I'm not thinking about her, I just think about dying. Everyday it haunts me and I don't know what to do. I feel like a fucking idiot for allowing all of this to happen.

I'm sorry this ended up being so long, but what should I do? People say time heals all wounds, but feel like I just want to shut everything down than live another day like this.

Should I just wait until it all somehow gets better? Should I try to get my answers?

Sadly the latter is also scary because I feel like she'll just ignore me. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I feel broken.",24Mar2019,6

Second of all, if you have negative comments, please keep it to yourself: 

Let’s just call this person JN. Anyways, JN &amp; I live in the same city and we met through Reddit from r/MakeNewFriendsHere. At that time, I was hella new to Reddit &amp; all. At first, their were huge red flags. He’d ask inappropriate questions that were strange. Long story short, we were “friends” for two days. He told me how he was into BDSM &amp; DDLG. He talked about how he had some relationship with a 15YO about a year ago when he was 21M. He kept asking for verification photos &amp; nudes. I never sent any explicit content or anything like that. At most, I sent one picture of my stomach laying down and pictures of my face. That’s it. I just felt like shit and I ghosted and left. 

Then he found me again through some other post I made &amp; texted me through Reddit yesterday. Anyways, he wanted to be friends but only teasing &amp; no nudes. But he was in a relationship. Then we exchanged Snapchat &amp; he kept asking for explicit pictures and verification photos. I got tired of this shit and told him if he wanted to leave he could. He just removed me on Snapchat. 

But I’m confused because he said no nudes only teasing but kept asking for nudes (?) Then said we could only be friends but implied meeting up &amp; hanging out (?) 

Idk this situation is hella fucked up.

My choice right now is whether to move in with a friend or live in my own place.

If I live with my friend I wont get lonely and I'll save a lot of money. But it'll be a 40 minute/30 mile drive to work every day twice a day. And I wont be put on the rent agreement so if something goes wrong with the landlord they'll default to his opinion.

If i live alone I'll be truly on my own for the first time ever in my own place, an experience I may never get again in my life as my girlfriend and I will be moving in together next year. And I'll be much closer to work and have a garage. But I'll save way less money and lose more of my savings in the move for deposits and such. Also might get lonely (not really sure about that last part).

So ***TL;DR***

Live with my friend and save money but have a long ass drive to work every day and put crazy miles on my car?

We wanted one of us to be at home for her first three years, and since my wife made more money then I, I stay home. Also, my work could be done from home as a freelancers; I work at a motion graphics/ animator. The last 3 years I've lost most of my clients from home. The workload and time to accomplish most of the work, it turns out, was too damn high. 

So at the beginning of 2019, I decided to focus on my work, recreate a new reel and portfolio, and apply for jobs in June. Although, for last three months I have not been able to create anything useful. I don't know if this is something I want to do anymore. The reason I say I don't know, is because I want it to be my job but I can't do the work for it to be my job. I know the work, I know how to follow through and complete projects, I just can't do it.

Most mornings I wake up thinking I should be working in another field to make money and focus on paying off my debt and put money in saving. When I bring this up to my wife, she usually has the same response, ""Why would you want to do something that you're not happy doing."" Which I understand. But I guess I don't feel happy doing this work anymore... I love art, I love design, I love animation. I just can't do it anymore.

Not being able to create or complete work started about six months ago and I thought it was a small creative block I had to work through. It's become increasing harder for me to get out of this creative block. 

I'm deep in student debt and years trying to fulfill my career, and I feel like I can't turn away from it at this point. 

This is the 6th draft I've tried to write about my problem for this subreddit, and every time I write it, I feel my problem doesn't come across the way I'm experiencing it. I feel like it's an easy fix. Either 1. focus on work, make a reel, apply for jobs 2. go get a job anywhere and make money to pay bills and live. 3. find a job is a relatively close field...

I don't go to church because of social anxiety and the last thing I am going to do is walk up to a stranger and admit I am addicted to whacking off. Not happening. Also if you are not a Christian do not tell me these feelings are normal or that I should stop believing in God. Also not happening. 

I hate my body and my sexuality. I wish I were asexual and didn't have feelings. 

I've been struggling with masturbation addiction since last year. I am female so yes I know I am in the minority, as females aren't supposed to struggle with that sort of thing. But I do, and it has been consuming me. And the sad part is, deep down I know I don't want it to go away because it makes me feel good when I am stressed or lonely. I wish I were married so I could experience those feelings without shame or guilt. 

I've been in a long distance relationship with someone for 11 months and we haven't met yet but I already have strong feelings for him. I wish I could be married to him already because of these feelings but it will be a long time before that happens if it does. I guess that was my first mistake. 

It gets worse when I am stressed out by work or have failed the expectations of those around me (happens alot). I go into my fantasy world where I am able to finally feel desired. I daydream of being able to explore those feelings without shame or fear God is going to punish me. I wish those fears were strong enough to get me to not masturbate at all. 

After I'm done I feel remorse and pray for forgiveness but it has happened so many times I don't think I am sorry anymore. If I were truly sorry I would stop. I feel like a reprobate. 

I was able to go two weeks without it and I went to God like an excited child who kept a promise and thanked Him for helping me stay clean. I felt so happy and like I could be free from this sin. Then I started having x-rated dreams Thursday and I fell after I woke up. I did it again today. I am in the part of my cycle where I am fertile and it makes it so much worse because hormones are involved. I wish I could rip out my uterus and throw it in the garbage can. Better yet I wish I could take a pill that would diminish all of my hormones so I could be clean inside and not feel anything sexual.

458,"Just to add some clarification and background, we are a “blended” family — my mom, me and my brother with my stepdad and his three children; two step sisters and brother. I’m the oldest out of everyone at 19. We’ve had problems with trying to mesh our family and everyone getting along well over the past couple years. It’s all been awkward and forced and not enjoyable for anyone really. That’s been the topic of heated discussion with my parents lately among other normal things, such as money. My mom feels like she’s severely under appreciated (or as she says, “hated”) by my (step) siblings and their dad. She feels like she tried to have a relationship with them and failed and doesn’t really go out of her way to try anymore. My stepdad and I get along fine, though, and though he’s not perfect either there’s definitely not as much of a strain for us to interact as it is with my mom + step siblings. 

Last night, they got absolutely wasted and decided it was a good idea to argue for five and a half hours, starting at 6pm into the night. My mother was more drunk than I’ve seen her in a while and it was honestly embarrassing and hurtful to hear the things she said to my (step) dad. Of course I’ve always looked up to my mom and seen her through rose-colored glasses. There’s a lot that she does that’s extremely negative and hurtful, but I don’t know if she wants to believe that she’s in the wrong or not, and I don’t wanna be the one to tell her. Especially after the really, extremely, mean stuff that’d I’d rather not repeat she said last night that sort of changed my perspective of her. I was so upset and angry at her, and I still am. 

This morning my siblings and I figured stuff would go back to normal like what usually happens the morning after they argue but the mood in the house felt really tense and my mom simply refused to talk to me face to face. My dad has been oddly panicky. They’ve been locked in their room for the majority of the day and didn’t even sit down to eat dinner with us (which in itself isn’t odd, but on Sundays they usually make an effort to spend time with us). My first thought was that they’re embarrassed or trying to patch things up without us knowing whatever they’re talking about. Maybe I’m overthinking, but now I feel like something more is going on and worse-case scenario are going to divorce. They’ve talked about it before in the recent past and I can’t help but wonder if it’s going to really happen now.

This would be the third divorce I’ve been though and the second my siblings have been through. I’ve been disassociating/depersonalizing all day and have been having trouble snapping out of it, and I figured asking here would help me figure out what to do and kind of help bring me some much needed clarity from an outside perspective. Obviously there’s a lot I haven’t mentioned for the sake of how long this post will be, but if any extra information is helpful then I can offer up what I know. Part of me feels like I’m just over reacting, but it’s just been super weird. I can’t help but worry. ",24Mar2019,1

I'm 21 and I have been told that this happens when you have grown up being alone and you unconsciously look for attention and appreciation from other people. 
I didn't grow up alone but most of the time I was with my grandma while my brother was with my mom and my dad was working. 

So... I don't know guys. What do you think? How can I stop being a jerk with other people and unconsciously competing about ""dumb"" things?",24Mar2019,1
460,"As title, and adding more, I really like my friend of three years. 

She's very pretty, smart, funny, and very caring of me. I will see her this summer, and we'll hang out seeing how our schedule fits.

Why? We go to different colleges, nearly a whole state apart, so we only see each other when we're back home for the summer.

I've been working out and eating right, but it's a slow process. I plan to try intermediate fasting to speed this up. 

But there are problems:

I'm fat, 6'1"" 270 lbs, trying to get slim and lean as much as possible. 

And my social skills are very trash because I don't really have ""in-person"" friends like that anymore. 

But I'm working on my confidence and it's showing, and I tell she wants to talk to me for longer in our monthly text conversations.

What else should I do to win her over?

461,"As the title says my (19f) roommate (20f) won’t let my girlfriend come over during the week. My roommate is my best friend from high school and we live together in a dorm, but really it’s an apartment. We each have our own rooms plus a kitchen, living room, and full bath. We’ve lived together for almost a year and it’s been okay. We have a lot of fun together but she’s definitely more uptight and that definitely bothers me a lot. 

I have my girlfriend over around every 3 weeks sometimes it’s more or less since she lives a few hours away. Usually my roommate isn’t home as she leaves to go back to her parents house on Wednesday nights. Lately however she has been. I’ve introduced them and we’ve hung out a minor amount but we’re all awkward and honestly when I do get to see my girlfriend I wanna spend it with her rather than my roommate who I see all the time. I typically stay in my room with my girlfriend unless we’re gonna make food or use the bathroom. I also leave my girlfriend there while I go to class/work for a few hours a day. Really not long and I’m on the same campus as my dorm is so I’m never more than a 5 min walk away. 

My roommate just texted me and said she feels uncomfortable when my girlfriend is over and honestly it upset me a lot. She said she doesn’t like that we avoid each other when she’s over but it’s not that. My roommate ignores us when I try to talk so I just close us in my room.I didn’t tell her that and instead just agreed to have her wait to come over till Wednesday. But it’s really bothering me, honestly I do have a little bit of attachment issues with my girlfriend and I miss her a lot. Literally everyday I’m not with her I’m just planning the next day I will be. All this means is I will have to wait a few more days to see her but it’s still upsetting. I wanna be understanding but I can’t help feel taken advantage of. I usually give into my roommates demands since she’s a bit more high maintenance but this one just angers me. Is it a bit much for me to get upset with her over this? I totally get being uncomfortable but I really try my hardest to not make it weird. And in my eyes she’s the one who makes it uncomfortable. 

TLDR: my roommate won’t let my girlfriend over and I wanna know if I’m being irrational

466,"Quick breakdown of my situation so you all can understand my situation
-I work for a sister company to a larger successful company. 
-This company is fairly new but the vp and president are the same in both companies.
-I was hired as second tech. Soon after, first tech left I became lead tech and we searched for new entry level tech for hire.
-I worked directly for VP until he left, now I work directly for president of company. I have good relationship with both him and owner of company. They trust me and want me to continually take a bigger role as company develops.
-Company is doing really well. Those who left was just due to circumstances.

Now this is about the second tech. He has done very well and I thought we had a great working relationship. During one job we finished and he brought the customer the paperwork. The customer gave him a tip. My second tech was told to meet at the office and he thought I’d get in my vehicle and leave. He left the site as I was in my vehicle ready to leave. I see the customer walk back up and I’m think, “I’m going to leave him my card.” I get out hand him my card and he happens to tell me, “hey I gave your buddy some lunch money for you guys.” I say, “thanks!” And I take off. Now the other tech had thought I didn’t know about the tip nor that I would go back and speak to the customer. He never mentioned the tip to me and probably thinks he was able to pocket it and I would never know. To me I don’t care about the money. It’s the lack of trust now that bothers me and I can’t trust him from now on. He inadvertently stole from me and it makes me wonder how far will the grey area of his moral compass will sway his behavior in the future. I was going to take him far in the company with me but now I don’t ever want to give him a lot of responsibility. Do I leave it like that? Have him never know I know and just constantly double check him and not trust him and never give him a bunch of responsibility? Do I confront him to let him know he’s not going to pull a fast one on me? Do I let the president of the company know that I no longer trust this guy? I like the guy but I hate having someone I can’t trust.

467,"I live in a very highly Catholic country. Usually people without education and from poor families here are very Catholic while people with education and money are agnostic/atheist/other religion. This has destroyed my view of the world because Catholic people here lack any kind of tolerance and common sense.

I'm perfectly aware that religious people are not in any way less intelligent than I am, but for some reason, whenever I learn that someone is a religious person - I automatically consider myself a bit more intelligent than them. It's not something I'm proud of and it's not something I can control. I'd love to change my way of thinking but it seems impossible to me, it's like my brain automatically assumes other people have lower or higher IQ based on their beliefs or philosophies. It's kind of getting in my way because my girlfriend of 5 years is a religious person and I sometimes just let go during an argument and let her win just because, in anger, I think to myself that ""meh fuck it, real arguments won't get through to her"".

470,"Sorry for the wall of text. 

I've been online dating for a while now. Recently, I had two dates with guys I liked. One of the guys ended up leading me on and then standing me up for a date, which was really hurtful. I spent a lot of time talking to my friend about it because I've never been stood up before and its really hurtful and made me feel stupid. But meanwhile, there was another guy I liked (M) and we continued to talk.



I decided to introduce my friend to M. We went out to a bar and all had drinks. That night M and I had sex for the first time. The following week, my friend and I were at a restaurant near M's house and I invited him to come grab a drink and say hi. 



As soon as he got there, I felt like my friend, K, was competing with me. K made a comment that I was uneducated because I didn't know the name of same historian. Then she made a comment that I wasn't her best friend (??). Really weird, and it all felt like she was trying to distance herself from me to M. THEN she steered the conversation to a very sexual place. She soon began talking about all the sexual comments guys have given her, like how tight her vagina is, and how one guy told her she had the best vagina he had ever tasted. She was going on about this for a WHILE, and M seemed to feel awkward but he was engaging. I made a few comments like ""this is an awkward topic"" and ""let's talk about something else"" but she kind of ignored me and just kept repeating how amazing she in bed. I even said at one point, ""K, what are you doing?"" And she didn't get the hint. Finally I said sonething along of the lines, ""K, everyone gets compliments in bed. It's not something to be this proud of,"" to which she responded ""oh really? Has a guy ever told you he liked how your vagina tastes?"" This was very embarrassing as I don't want to talk about sexual feedback I've gotten from other men in front of a guy I had just had sex with for the first time and wanted to keep dating.



This was the last straw for me. I excused myself to the bathroom and texted her ""are you trying to fuck M? Why are you talking about your vagina so much?"" And she texted back that she was just making friendly conversation. Obviously she didn't see how uncomfortable she was making both of us, and she was trying to get attention or sexual validation from my date. I went back to the table, grabbed my stuff and said my uber was there and left, and then sent her a wall of text. She didn't respond.


So basically, I stormed out and sent a load of texts, which wasn't the most chilled way to handle this conflict. It was an overreaction and I probably owe her an apology for that. 



It's been 1 week and I haven't spoken to her. I'm not ready to apologize for overreacting because I don't really feel like I did. I feel like she thinks M is the guy I like less because I spent so much time upset over being stood up and she thinks she can get a pass to hit on him. I also feel like she has a complex about sex that I get caught in the middle of often. For the last 3 guys she's dated, she made comments about how they probably like me more than her. She also fishes for compliments a lot. She'll say things like, ""I'm probably not pretty enough to have a boyfriend"" and expect the people she's with to tell her how pretty she is. One time, a guy approached me in a bar to talk to me, and she asked him if he wanted to go smoke with her outside; once outside she demanded that he make out with her and he refused. He came back in and walked right past me. She told me about it the next day and I didn't even mention how rude it was that she felt the need to take a guy that had approached me outside and try and make out with him. 



Lastly, I feel like she is just naive. We are 30 years old. Every woman in the world has been told they have a tight pussy, that they taste good, and that they are good in bed. These are the types of compliments people give about sex. I have NEVER felt the need to let others know anyone has given me those comments. They aren't awards. It doesn't mean you're the best person in bed ever. WHY does she feel SO validated by these comments? Or why does she feel like she needs MORE validation ABOUT those comments from another guy - namely one that I am dating? 



So I'm not ready to apologize. I'm not sure what I'm most mad at. The more I think about it, the more I feel like I'm just mad at her for being so childish. I'm mad that she thinks sexual approval is everything and that she's so insecure. I'm mad that I sometimes end up being the victim of her insecurity. I'm mad that she didn't respond to my texts and doesn't seem to think she did anyhing wrong. I'm mad because I think on some level, she WAS trying to fuck M. I'm mad because I apparently can't be upset about one date without her trying to steal my other date. I'm mad that she can't handle not being the center if attention, and that she can't take cues to stop.


So basically I want advice: I think my plan is to wait another week before I talk to her. Idk how to handle the conversation though. She is a great friend in many ways, but I can't handle this level of insecurity. Idk what to say. Idk if I should apologize for storming out. I feel like she embarrassed me and herself and Idk how yo address that. What should I say to her? I feel very self righteous in this argument and do not feel like I should have to apologize and maybe that is wrong. Any advice or insight welcome. ",24Mar2019,1

472,"So recently, I’ve been going through some problems with friends. All of them in this issue are either gay, transgender, or Pan sexual, all part of the lgbtq+ community. Now before I go any further, I would like to say, I 100% support the LGBTQ+ community and am I in no way homophobic, racist, etc.

On this server I play on their is an owner who I have known for 5 years, three other kids have known him for this long. He is 10 years older than us, but it’s not too weird because he was a librarian that just ran this server. (We are all freshman students in high school). The server was realistically private, (yes it’s Minecraft, no shit). The admin is honestly a great dude. Recently he has someone help out on the server. None of my friends like him. One day, when I was offline for the day, and completely disconnected, shit happens. When I come back the next day, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is screaming on the discord about how the owner and the helper are homophobic. I don’t really believe this, we were changing worlds, and so the server was messed up a little bit (important later), ie some of the plugins and mods were not longer working. The owner was trying to fix the server. Trying to test something, he killed one of my friends to see if something on the server worked, he did this a few times. And then my friend has the idea to say, “are you killing me because I’m gay??????”
Obviously, this was not why he was killing them, and then my friends begin bombarding him with questions about why he is so homophobic, originally it started as a joke, but then my friends got serious. Then “he shut down the server”.
This was what I priced together what happened. I have known this man for 5 years, and for a fact I know he isn’t homophobic. My friends constantly flamboyantly talk about how their gay, and yes it is annoying. I don’t feel the need to have my sexuality brought up every two seconds talk about how straight I am.
Anyway, I do have a explanation for what happened that day though. I know that admin pretty well, when put into specific situations, like everyone yelling at him, he just kind of shuts down, and won’t say anything. This situation is like people screaming at him, when everyone is screaming at him. I know this because it’s happened before, and that’s exactly what happened here, I later learned that the reason the server shut down, wasn’t because of him, one of the plugins crashed the server at that moment due to us switching updates and it being unstable. A few days later when the server reopened my friends had abandoned it due to him being homophobic. Another reason I know he isn’t homophobic is because like I said before, they always talk about it, it’s not less than once a day that they mention it. If he really is homophobic I believe he would’ve said something sooner, and put into those circumstances, the following happened.

So the problems I’m here for, is how to tell my friends this. Previously, I know what my friends do to people they don’t like, if someone is homophobic, or does something bad, they in an instant kick them out of the friend group being extremely hostile and don’t talk to them again. I know if they believe it a homophobe they will instantly do this to me. There is one friend in the group who is more understanding, and I’ve thought of trying to get into a private discord call with them to tell them, but I dunno if they might tell anyone of take it the wrong way. Also, I do know for a fact how hostile my friend group can be, one time they didn’t like a kid, and now he lives over 4000 miles away. Yeah.

477,"TL:DR
My younger sister is bedridden, she wouldn't talk to any of us in the family, she would only stare at us blankly and she literally does nothing. She acts normal infront of strangers but at home she's completely different. 




Three an a half years ago my family and I relocated to another country where we didn't speak the language and were in a quite the unfamiliar environment. At the time my sister was 14-15 and she was quite normal, at that time she was showing some signs of isolation but we didn't think much of it, most of my family is introverted including myself.

The last normal sentence I heard her say was ""This is going to be my room."" when we had first moved to our new apartment. After that my brother and I joined a language course center and life moved on normally for us, my sister however was getting more and more isolated.

She wouldn't go out with my parents anymore. And she started getting too quite, she wouldn't leave her room and wouldn't take care of her hygiene. They were classic signs of depression and when I alerted my parents that we should take her to a therapist my religious dad was like, nope she's got nothing wrong with her, it's just the devil (????) and he did some religious therapy that obviously wasn't going to work.

We moved to another apartment a year later, at that time her condition was really bad. She wouldn't talk to any of us, and if any of us addressed her she would just stare blankly at us. Honestly one could see why my father thought she was possessed. Her stare was very annoying and without even blinking. Her grades were bad and she wouldn't go to school. She accused a teacher of assaulting her but when my parents went to her school the video tape showed them nothing. She wasn't assaulted or anything.

My mother broke her leg last year and she didn't even come out to see her. She actually avoided her and only once did she come out to just look at my mom and then leave. 

After that my parents found out that she'd stolen and sold all of my mother's jewelry worth tens of thousands of dollars for a fraction of the price and tried to sneak up at night to run away to Japan. The funny thing is that we can't even go there without a visa.

She lies about everything. EVERYTHING. And she's not even a good liar. We can all tell when she lies (except for my parents at first, who had too much faith in her) and she acts completely differently around strangers in the rare occasion she goes outside. Late last year we made some new friends and when I told them about the way she acts home they couldn't believe it, to them she was nice and chatty and intelligent. But they soon saw the reality when they started visiting us and she wouldn't even say hi when she'd see them.

My brother and I tried to reach out a few times, but whenever we go out with her she never talks, she either walks too far ahead or too far behind us, and if we leave her for a minute to look at a store (she wouldn't come with us) or go to the restroom or something she would literally straight up just go home. Plus she emits so much negative energy its unreal. 

When we convinced dad that we should really take her to a therapist he finally accepted. For more than a year and a half he took her to a psychiatrist, who prescribed some medications for her. After a few months of seeing no change in her behavior my parents discovered that she had been spitting out the meds. And the last time she went to the therapist he actually returned the sessions fee to my parents and told them he couldn't see her anymore; she'd done nothing but lie to him during their meetings.

This problem has really taken its toll on my family. Someone always has to stay home on fear of her doing something stupid like trying to run away again. We can't trust her with anything and she stinks all the time. My parents are very depressed because of her and it's even affecting our relationship with them now, and it feels like we have run out of options. Sometimes we wish she had run off that night so we could get rid of her.

I won't say I was the best older brother growing up. But despite everything I still loved her and I got her a gift every time I went outside. She was too spoiled as a child and always had her way. Maybe that contributed to this whole mess. I just don't know what to do. We all don't.

482,"I wanted to share my story here today.  I want to save my grandparents house and property. Reason being I am emotionally attached . I have never owned a house before ! I would love for this one to be the one, I would love to  finish raising my children there. Turn the house into a home again. I know when you look at the picture of the house it dosent look worth saving but to me its priceless. 
Many generations of my family grew up together on that very land . My grand-parents lived and passed away in the house.  The house really means more to me than i could actually express in words. My gran-dad served in the army in the 1950's and worked exceptionally hard to buy his house and land by the way is sitting on a good amount of land of course you cant tell from the picture but (13.6 acrs) of land  i believe.  
His main focuse was his wife and children having a stable place to call home. Years would pass by and irreplaceable memories would be made.  All through my child hood i had the best time of my life, I lived about 10-20 steps away from my grandparents . I could pretty much go see them when ever I wanted to. 
One of the most devastating times in my life was when my grand-mother  was diagnosed with cancer nov of 2002. They had found the cancer in the very last stages . She passed away jan, 22 ,2003 . One month before my first child was born.
I can still remember that day so vividly.  That very day changed my life forever. I can still remember my grand-mother making my gran-dad promise to take care of the house and the land that she loved so much. 
My gran-dad assured her that he would continue to take care of business. He continued to live in his home ,but needed someone to help him manage his finances. One of my cousins who i will call jim moved in with my gran-dad. Everything seemed to be running smoothly,jim seemed to be doing a good job at keeping his bills and other expenses up to par. My aunt ,jims mother which was my gran-dads favorite child moved in with an ill intent.
You see my aunt lost her husband to alcholism  sometime  in the middle of 2014 ,which im sure was a rough time for her or was it ?
My aunt , im pretty sure was hurt emotionally, but no one knew  the real reason she was moving  back into the family home . Her initial  story was that she couldnt live in the home she shared with her husband because there were to many memories ,she said everything there reminded her of him . Im pretty sure there may have been some truth to that ,but no one knew that she was moving in like a snake and not a loving ,caring daughter. Later on the the real truth for her moving in with my gran-dad was because she borrowed money against her house and didnt pay the bill so the house was foreclosed on and she needed an escaped route.
Soon after she setteled in with my gran-dad she called her self taking over my gran-dads finances .she was supposedly helping him manage his bills and money.  My cousin moved on with his life and couldnt manage things for my gran-dad anymore . My gran-dad put his trust in his daughter and relied on her to do right by him. 
She began to use his social security checks for her own personal spending pleasure. For one long year and 6-8 months she would keep using my gran-dad as here personal ATM. All along his bills were piling up. She intercepted the mail so my gran-dad would not see all of his unpaid past due bills and  final notice letters from the mortage company . 
Her selfish,greedy, self-centered act had no effect on her conscious.  My gran-dad became  ill in may of 2015 and unfortunately passed away jun,02,2015.  I can still remember getting a phone call at work that day ,which was rare no one ever called me at work. My mother  called me and told me that my gran-dad  wasnt doing good . She said i needed to get to my gran-dads if I wanted to spend some time with him . He really wasnt doing well at all.  When i arrived at my grand-dads home  I tried to stay strong even though i was an emotional wreck. As i stood by his bed ,I was wishing there was a way to change the situation. Soon , my sister and my dad showed up to be by my gran-dads side. We started to cry together i knew that we all were wishing that we could do something for him. Sadly at this point we had to accept what was happening and we let go and put it in gods hands . We realized and trusted had his own plans . 
When i entered my gran-dads home he was in one  of the  back rooms of his house ""ALONE"" suffering  in a hospital bed . What was puzzling was the kitchen and porch was full of people laughing , smoking cigarettes , and having some what of a party but not one person was by his side . 
Me ,my sister and my dad was in the rooms spending the last moments with him and then we would have to say goodbye forever. My auntbcame into the room and poked her head around the door and said ""DADDY ,WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ? ,YOUCAN GO IN PEACE! I PROMISE I WILL STAY HERE AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOUSE AND KEEP YOUR LAND STRAIGHT"".
 She knew that wasnt so, she knew that she was hiding some dark secrets ,she never expected  them to come in to light. 
After my gran-dad passed my aunt continued to live in the house with no intent on keeping her promises to my gran-dad. 
Soon the dark secrets she had thought she was hiding so well came out into the public eye. A listing showed up in the local News paper that had my gran-dads land up for sale (it was up for auction). No one knew that she had secretly only put her name on everything including all the paper work for my gran-dads property. She didnt want any of his other 5 children to know what she had been doing this whole time .  
She had let the payment go so far behind  that no one would have a chance to catch them up  because the company had it back in their posession. 
The property is still up for sale thank god no one has bought it yet .  It has been up for auction twice but no one bought it which made me relieved.  I made a fundraiser to ask for help  you can find it here: Https://gogetfunding.com/help-me-save-my-familys-land 
I would love for it to stay with in the family . I intend to stand and fight in my gran parents honor.  Thanks for reading my story. Please Share..",24Mar2019,1

484,"was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it. I am just heartbroken because she feels like the best female friend i ever had and will never have someone like her again. The best female friend I had but she bossed me around and kind've abused me and has been for years. I have been hurting for years. I want to be friends but the way she acts makes me not want anything to do with her but I do care about her and love her platonically.

TL;DR

I met a girl when I was younger she did stuff that's impossible to ignore to get my attention. She continued this stuff for years and flirts to the point it is uncomfortable and doesn't stop then has an issue when I get mad or uncomfortable and ignore her and she lashes out. She does things that are impossible to ignore and continues this into college. Showing up 30 minutes early to her class when I am in the class before, and walking by a lot and standing in the door, waiting outside. I have not felt comfortable by how she acts and have been ignoring her.

PS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows",24Mar2019,0
485,"This particular coworker, let's call her Cathy, and I have never quite gotten along since she started a year ago. I always go out of my way to engage in conversation with her and while sometimes she would play nice, most times she would pretend that she didn't hear me. But whatever, I can ignore that. At least we we're civil.

We never had real issues until two months ago when we had a state inspection in our place of work. We needed to have our degrees openly displayed. I brought mine in first and hung it up and she brought hers in the very last minute. The last person we work with doesn't have any degrees, so none to display, so mine was hung above hers. 

It sounds like the stupidest thing but since then, she has been acting out. Up until that point, I thought we both had bachelors but she has an associates. To me, that doesn't matter at all. We both get paid the same because my boss doesn't realize there is a difference and, like I said, up until that point, I didn't even realize or care. I still don't. 

On top of this, she is our absolute slowest worker. I think it maybe lack of skill but personally I think it's also lack of trying as well. The rest of us can easily keep pace and she is constantly straggling. She is constantly asking questions about the same 20 things. Things that she has the answers to within an arms reach. She refuses to follow our recipes for things we make and instead makes them from memory or doesn't measure properly. On top of this, she has criticized the way I do things and snarkily tells me I need to change or will tell a coworker to tell me. No one else has an issue with me and I'm one of our top performers. But if anyone even suggests that she do something different, she will shut down, storm out and not talk to you for three days. 

I feel like I need to stress this because we don't treat her any differently because of this. We've never talked down to her or even thought it f mentioning trying harder or whatever. We all wanted to be friends, especially because it's just the four of us and we're stuck in a room together for 40+ hours a week. 

Friday, she had a bit of a blow up. We were super slow and it was rolling around to lunch time. The bench that she is on (we all rotate through it once a month) usually goes to lunch, alone and much later than everybody else. The two other girls go to lunch and I decided to stay and help her so she could get done. I finished up a couple of things for her and asked her what else she needed. No answer. I waited a bit longer, asked again, no answer. Pulled out my phone for a bit and decided,fuck it, I'm going to eat too.  I asked her again, nothing and then told her I was going to lunch. She said fine. 

We ate, went back, no issues.  One co-worker, Tina, went to get her stuff. She just had a baby and needs to pump her breast milk usually once per shift. Cathy absolutely lost it and says that she already got her break. She storms into the managers office and berates Tina and I about how we're so lazy and we're on our phones all day, and she's out here giving 120%. 

I'm absolutely floored by this. It's absolutely not true and it screams of jealousy. Our manager knows that this is bs but we're having a meeting on Monday about the direction we're going and what we what to see changed? 

I want to tell her exactly what I think of her but I think that would really be difficult to continue working with her. If she hates me now, I can't imagine how it would be then. 

How exactly should I approach this meeting and how can I word things is a not accusatory way? 

Things I'd like to address:

- her attitude

-lack of productivity (skill level/speed/constant question)

-keep your eyes on yourself and focus on your numbers and nobody else's.

487,"So a friend of ours passed away recently, I wasn't as close to him as others but, I'm still very sad about it. I hung out with him litterally 3 days before the crash, we saw a movie together. Overall his death has impacted the people closest to me very strongly... it feels really weird, like it didnt happen, but it really really did.

He will be missed and I hope he rests easy, but I worry most for my friends right now. Yesterday was a sad day. People telling me they slept all day, my boyfriend cried for a good couple of hours and another friend is choosing alcohol to just try and forget about it all. I still feel uneasy, I just recently saw that guy too, but I wasn't as close to him if that makes sense.

489,"Background: My friend's (I consider him a damn close friend) brother was in town visiting. I came to know his brother through him and we once went on holiday for a week, just the three of us, so we have developed some sort of a spin-off friendship (me and the brother). I texted my friend at 19:00 to inquire, seeing that his brother is going to leave town soon (as he was just visiting), would they perhaps like to get drinks. I made it clear, I am not suggesting we should, I am merely asking (we have tests coming up and need to study, I didn't want to appear forceful by suggesting). He replies, 2 hours and 35 minutes later stating, they are already out with some other people.

To be honest, I felt awful. Awful about myself, the fact that I even asked and also the fact that he took his time to reply to a question that could have been answered with a simple ""no"", or ""we are making alternative plans"". Even is he said, ""we don't feel like hanging out with you"" would also have been okay ( I think). I replied, ""oh well"". I was already in bed at 21:35, felt such pain, got up and went for a walk. Out of anger starting studying again until midnight.

Do I address this issue, or do I just let it slide as a potential mistake from his side?",24Mar2019,1

I'm 16, and i have a boyfriend and he's practically the only ""friend"" i have, i guess. 
My parents don't give me a lot of attention, mostly because of my younger sister, who is 13 years old. She has ADHD and she has slways gotten much more attention because she has needed extra help, which is completely fine.
Recently, i've been getting very angry often, and if my family talks to me in a wrong way or says something wrong, my whole day can be ruined. It's especially bad for me when my boyfriend and i fight, i come upstairs to say that i am sad and my mom can answer with ""well i am sad too, because you're being too much"". 
This hurts and worsens my mood. I don't know what to do because i can't talk to my boyfriend about it, because he is going through things on his own.
The reason i have no other friends to go to is because my best friend of nine years decided to start dating my mentally abusive ex which i have no interest in having contact with whatsoever, so i don't want to talk to my friend either because even as i begged her to come meet me at my place because my ex made me feel so bad i was planning suicide, which my friend knew, she went to meet my ex instead. This was a month before they started dating. She later called me in the evening to tell me that she had the right to talk to whoever she wants and that she loved him in a friend way.
I also have no friends because a girl in my class doesn't like me at all. She will go out of her way to make me feel unwelcome, while doing her best to make sure nobody notices. If she notices i'm getting close to a girl in the group, she will single the girl out and only talk to her. The other girls in class have noticed a little, and they know i struggle with coming to school, so i hope they poeced 2 and 2 together. This ""mean"" girl is also one of the reasons my ex and i didn't work out.
This is all so depressing. I don't know what to do anymore, i have no money, so i can't run away. I don't want to be here anymore and i feel like people are just getting completely and utterly tired of me, so i kinda wanna die a little, but not so much that i'll do it. I feel like i'm a burden to anyone and i wondered if anyone had any advice on what to do in my situation, like how not to get so angry and how to get my parents to give me more than just negative attention and how to just make things right, because right now i feel like a failure.

TL;DR: (that's what they're called, right?) My parents give my sister almost all their attention, i get angry very quickly and i don't feel like i can tall to anyone about my feelings. I need advice because i feel like my life is just spiraling and i want to get back on track.

Also, i don't know if i did all this right. I've never posted here, so i feel like my post may be written ver unorganized.",24Mar2019,2
492,"First post EVER, on mobile. Sorry.

I’m a college student living off campus with 2 other girls (friend A and friend B.) When we moved in a year ago, we decided that friend B would have the master and friend A and I would live in the other two rooms. 
Friend A and I have been roommates for the past 3 years, we know how to share a bathroom which is why we were set up this way in the first place. 
Now, friend B is moving out and we are getting a new roommate in May. New roommate is friends with Friend A and they set up everything for moving in, so I don’t know if she’s getting the master or not. Friend A is also studying abroad and won’t be back until August, but new roomie and I will be here over the summer. 
I need advice on how I should ask friend A (and probably new roomie) that I would like the master. My reasoning for wanting the big room: I have the most furniture/stuff, I have a dog and the master has a door to the backyard/ more space in bedroom, I’m an art student and there’s ample sunlight/ lighting in the room, it provides the most storage and it would be convenient for me to smoke on the small backyard porch. 
Should I even ask? Is this unfair? No idea how to go about it...

Lately I’ve sorta been struggling through figuring what the hell I want to do with my life. I’m gonna be as honest and open about my paths that have lead me where I am today, failures and all, and I’m hoping for some insight from anyone willing to give me some advice. 

So to start off, I’m 20, I’m a male and I live in Southern California, I’ve lived here my whole life and most of my family lives here as well. I’ve lived with my parents and sister for the past 20 years, parents went through a divorce in 2017 and reconciled in 2018. I was always shit at school, even from a young age, I just wanted to play and run around and make up games and just have fun, I hated homework and sitting still and all that jazz. Got in trouble a lot as a child for being disruptive, spazzy, loud, etc. I mellowed out a bit in high school, but still was shit at school. Very poorly organized, very unmotivated to try very hard, I just hated school too much to really try. Graduated high school, sort of just floated about, working jobs here and there, didn’t really have anything going for me. I tried one semester of school at a community college near me but started failing one class, and eventually just dropped out completely. Sort of swore off college at that point, didn’t seem much different from high school so I really wasn’t interested. Decided maybe join the military instead of school, and that way I’d go get some real world experience for a couple years and have free college at the end as an option if I chose that route. Tried joining the Marine Corps, and sustained an injury in the first month of basic training, ended up getting sent home. It’s been around 4 months since I came home from my month of basic training, just working full time as a cashier now. I’m an avid spearfisherman, if I’m not at work or at the gym, I’m out spearfishing. It’s literally an all consuming obsession almost, I could see myself spearfishing every day for the rest of my life and being happy as fuck. Problem is I don’t know how to turn that into a career, and I don’t think I’m even good enough yet to do so. Should I try going back to school? I know I won’t like it, but I don’t see many options left, I’ve thought about going to a trade school, considered underwater welding, but from what I hear it’s a pretty brutal career and it takes yeeeeaaaaars to make good money. I just feel sort of lost. The one thing I had that felt somewhat secure was my relationship with my girlfriend, but we just broke up a month ago, I just feel kinda lost for now. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.",24Mar2019,1

I have physical problems which keep me from holding any retail job for more than six months, and I desperately need something where I don't have to be running everywhere working with two hours of sleep at a stress level of 1,000.

I can't afford college. I'm trying hard to save up but half of my paycheck goes towards rent, not to mention insurance, food, lots of medical bills, etc. I'm struggling to get out of bed every morning because my paychecks aren't making a dent in what I owe the hospitals.

I can't keep surviving off of $11/hr in the first place, let alone when I'm constantly being left to work my entire shift without any help on the busiest days of the week. I have no time to breathe.

500,"TL;DR My husband is graduating college soon. I want to move out of state and he doesn't. 

My husband and I get along very well. We argue occasionally and only fight once every couple years. He's in college for mechanical engineering, starting up his bachelor's degree this summer.
We live in Utah, both of us born and raised. All of my family and his family live within 45 minutes of us. My husband's mom has been single since he was 15 and he has only one brother who is his best friend.I am not super close with my siblings.
Now that he's working on his bachelor's, we have been talking about where we potentially want to move once he graduates. He wants to stay local so he can be close to his family. 
I deal with mental illness of which I am medicated and currently looking for a therapist. We are LDS and as much as I love the church, for people who don't know, the stereotypes about Utah Mormons, buy and large, are true. There's a lot of judgement if I can't make it to church for a couple weeks in a row and I have a hard time putting myself out there to make friends. I go to church to be spiritually uplifted but my social anxiety makes me very self conscious in an environment like I just described. 
A couple of my friends from high school have moved out of state and told me how much more relaxed the congregations are and how there's more of a camraderie since LDS people are in the minority. This information has made me dream of leaving Utah. 
I brought this up to my husband and he made it clear that he doesn't want to leave the state because he wants to live close to his family. 
I don't want to be selfish so I won't force him to move away.  I'm not sure how to cope with other people's judgement though, and I don't want to continue not wanting to go to church. My faith is very important to me and I'm not about to stop going altogether. 
I'm not sure what to do.

I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

It’s really effecting my life. I’m not able to put the proper effort into certain things because I dont feel emotions when doing it. Example. All my efforts that I’ve put into previous relationships and then getting dumped has caused me to not feel like dating or not be putting a lot of effort into a relationship because I expect the same results.

516,"So this is not professionally diagnosed, but it is clear to me that my friend has body dysmorphia, and possibly other issues. She is thin and has a very nice body, yet she constantly calls herself fat. She is 15 years old, has been on a ‘diet’ for over a year where she only eats fruits, vegetables, and chicken. She always says “I hate my life” because she ‘can’t eat anything’, (even though she’s physically able to eat anything she wants). She gets terrified of even gaining just a pound, and she said she was happy she got the flu because ‘at least she lost weight’ from throwing up (pretty f**ked up I know). She doesn’t eat any carbs, cheese, nothing. I am scared that this will only get worse and possibly lead to anorexia or bulimia or any other kind of health issue, whether it be physical or mental. 
I have talked to her multiple times and tell her what I know needs to be said. I tell her that I don’t think it’s healthy to be so focused on your appearance and weight. I told her that anything that you are so fixated on that it is able to consume and control this much if your life, is an issue. Whether it be stress, anxiety, etc. I don’t want to tell her to do anything specifically, because obviously I am no doctor, but I just want her to understand that her obsessive dieting and obsessive concern over her weight and appearance is a mental issue. 
The only thing that I told her to do is to talk to her mom about the thoughts she has and stuff. I know she has discussed this with her mom (at least to some extent), and has been seeing a therapist. She has been seeing the therapist for maybe 3 months now, but I notice she still acts exactly the same and has the same obsessive thoughts. 
I try my best to help her without giving any medical advice, because obviously it’s not my place, but she just doesn’t do anything. The worst feeling is seeing someone you care about go through shit and know there is nothing you can do. Honestly, I have tried to distance myself from her because it is annoying and frustrating to hear her constant comments about her weight and figure and know that nothing I have said has helped her. She’s really begun to piss me off, I guess it’s the situation that’s pissing me off, not her,  and I just wish there was something I could do.",24Mar2019,1
517,"Met online, and have been living together about 6 months. We have a roommate agreement which I have been fairly lax on. Aka — we agreed to split utilities and internet, but given she’s been “pretty good” I haven’t forced the issue. 

Cleanliness is an issue, I’m not a freak, but I like my kitchen clean, aka stove top and counters wiped, dishes out of sink, and the dishwasher loaded and unloaded timely. Often I find myself coming home from long shifts to clean up the stove, empty the sink, and put dishes away. The other day my roommate asked “do you always clean in the morning” I responded with “only when there is something to clean” and thought she would pick up on it. I was wrong. I consistently come home to things boiled over on the stove. We’re approaching summer here and she often will cut half a banana and leave the other half on top of the fridge. I’m concerned about flies becoming an issue... often I take out recycling and garbage, and she allows it to pile up to astronomical heights. Generally speaking I’m home 50% of the time, so often the garbage and recycling are mostly hers. 

Recently she has been talking about decorating the living space — which I’m not okay with. This is my first home, and due to travel wit work I haven’t had the time to decorate it the way that I want to. I told her I will decorate and paint come the summer. Often she is sending me “ideas” which are extremely expensive and quite frankly not my style. 

Security became an issue when she would leave doors unlocked while no one was home. And I brought it up on multiple occasions. That issue seems to have since been resolved. 

Also has tended to err in the side of paying rent quite late (often by the 7th when rent is due the 1st) 

As the person who owns the house, and pays the majority of bills I feel like I should have access to put my things anywhere in the common space, decide on how storage is divided etc. Yet often I come home to find new spaces “taken over” it’s becoming increasingly frustrating, and I’m not sure how to address it without coming off like a crazy person. 

Any ideas on how to broach any of these topics, and come to resolution? 

Overall my roommate is pretty good — we get along and often are quite chill. She’s more or less easy going, and I trust her in my personal space. So these are a lot of amazing qualities that I would like to keep around. But I’ll be honest the “little things” are driving me bonkers

519,"Hello! So, I feel I'm in a tough situation. I'm 18, almost 19, and i really need a job. I'm a senior in high school and most teens my age and younger already have jobs and cars. It's kinda frustrating because I still have to rely on my parents money and we don't have a lot of money. I managed to save up $26 just by doing stuff around the house but honestly, i just really want to be able to afford things for myself. 

The problem is, I've never had a job before. Last summer, i did get a job interview but unfortunately didn't get the job and i was bummed about it. I did put in a lot of applications online, never really got any calls. I'm really new to this with the applications and such. I know a lot of jobs probably won't hire me because i lack experience and it just sucks.

Another issue is fitting it in with school and not having a cell phone that works for calling and texting. My school ends at 3pm, i get home at around 4pm due to taking the school bus home. Although, a lot of kids in my class go to work right after school, they also have transportation where i just have to take the bus. I also feel its just irresponsible on my end to not have any reliable source of communication. While my younger sister is letting me use her phone whenever i get job interviews, it's just not going to work out while I'm at school.

I think with interviews, I'll just need to look up examples online and such and try and practice. I feel i can strengthen that on my own.

One day I decided to talk with her on the bus, took her phone number and asked if she wanted to hang out sometime and she said yes.

A week later we met, took a walk and talked about our lives. I then asked if she wanted to come to my place and study and she did come to me some days later. We studied and talked about all sorts of things. My feelings for her only grew and i started to really like her. I were a bit depressed before I met her and so, but now I were really happy.

I walked her home and asked if she wanted to go the the movies someday, and she said ""I can't, I have to study"". So I just said ok, maybe some other day. I knew something was up...

When I got home I got a text from her that said that she had a boyfriend. That text really turned my life from good to bad.

We still meet 4 times a week on the bus, we always talk there now. We even have one lesson together every week where we study together (even tho her boyfriend is there). 

She knows I have feelings for her. I don't know what to do since she and her boyfriend doesn't even have a serious relationship. Does that even mean anything for me?

535,"Hello. Sorry in advance if this is not well written, my thoughts are a total jumble right now. 

I spent 8 years living overseas and had been with my (now ex) fiance for 2 years when last spring, my dad had a heart attack. He asked me to come home and help out and I did. It was just before the time my fiance and I were about to apply for visas etc for me to stay over there - so when I left, I didn't have a visa to go back on. 

Shortly after I returned home, I was doing my best to help my dad around the home. He'd spent a month in hospital and had ended up having the triple heart bypass, so he was pretty weak at that time. 

My dad is a bit of a clean freak so I took extra care to make sure everything was left as I found it. I was washing a glass when he suddenly snapped at me for wasting water and that I was to do all washing up in one go. I was shocked given that I had left my entire life behind to help him and he still found something to snap at me about. I calmly left the room when he accused me of having an attitude and said I was no longer welcome to live with him. He kicked me out knowing at that time I didn't really have anywhere else to go. I ended up sleeping on a friends sofa bed for a while.

I did go back to live there about a week later as it just didn't seem practical for me to sleep on my friends sofa bed indefinitely and she didn't really have the room. He didn't apologise when I went back and instead talked the whole time about how upset he had been and how devastated he had been. 

I kind of knew from that point on to keep myself to myself. I was trying to save money to pay for a partnership visa to go back to my fiance (expensive) when the distance became too much for us and we broke up. I would stay out of my dads way at home because I was frightened to disagree with him on anything in case he would kick me out again. I started medication for anti depressants last Summer, which I'm still on now. I guess these made it easier for me to ignore when something upset me. But he found every little thing to have a dig at me about. Whether I'd left a pair of shoes by the front door (where he kept his) or whether I'd put something in the fridge instead of the cupboard where he said it belonged (eggs). It was just everything and I learned to go along with it because I was saving to leave and the rent I was paying was cheaper than if I was renting a room somewhere. He even snapped at me for wanting a bath on a Saturday evening at 8pm because it was 'too late.' 

So fast forward to Thursday evening. It was his retirement party. I will admit, I had a few drinks on an empty stomach and was feeling no pain. Dad had been drinking quite a bit too. He introduced me to everyone and they all commented how I was my dads 'princess' and that he talked me up all of the time. I was quite surprised given that he didn't even seem to like me at home. 

In the taxi home, my dad battered me. I wish I could remember why but I can't. I was later taken to hospital with multiple head injuries, cut to my ear, a split lip, cuts all over my face, most of my fingernails (which had been acrylics) had been ripped off, and I later developed a pretty awful black eye. He gave me one once before when I was 14, but never this bad. I had been pinned in the foot well of the taxi whilst he had been hitting me and I couldn't move. When we got out of the taxi, I tried to get into the house because I had nowhere to go, and as I tried to get in, he knocked me to the ground again and began hitting me again. There was blood on the stairs. The neighbours called the police and my dad was arrested on ABH charges while my mum and her husband came to get me and took me to the hospital. I'm now living with them (they have converted their dining room into a bedroom for me and have been incredible.)

The police asked whether I wanted to press charges and whether I wanted to make a statement. This was only about 8-9 hours after the incident and I was not sure at that time. They then asked if I would make a decision and come back on Wednesday to let them know what I wanted to do. The policewoman seemed like she wanted me to press charges. 

Since then I've just been in shock. Dad has tried to contact me. He sent me an essay about how much he loves me and misses me and is devastated by 'whats happened'. (No apology) I have not responded. He also sent my mum a lengthy message about how 'I need to consider how my mental health affects those around me.' 

I'm just in shock. Mum has said I can live here until I've saved up enough to make some decisions. I just don't know whether to press charges. Or anything. I can't go back to work for a week due to my injuries. Luckily my boss has been fantastic. 

How do I move on from this? 

tl;dr - dad beat me up and I don't know what happens next.

Thoughts, any recommendations? I do not want to be the only friend who is texting others to ask them out, or ask them how they are. I would love if someone other would come and ask me out or ask me if im even alive.. Is that too much? Am I asking too much?",24Mar2019,1

So i was at a party, and obviously we drank a bit, but not that much, and both of them were there. At one point, when the party was at its apex i would say, she sat next to me, a like really close to me, and put her hand around me, and we talked a bit. She said stuff that really alluded to her liking me, and i was like but he is herex isnt it a bit obvious, and she was like he doesnt need to know, and then she stood up and sat in a more comfortable place and called me there where the talk continued. I didnt do anything of course, im not a bad friend. I sent her a message this morning and aksed her about it. She said oh yeah, i was just mesing a little bit, but her messages where still sounding like she wanted to hear something from me. I feel weird af because i dont know what to do.

540,"So, my dad scheduled this family summer vacation where we all head overseas. We would leave in June. Unfortunately, my dad also forgot that his sister is graduating from business school, but her graduation ceremony is two days after we leave! The issue is that he already promised his sister he’d go and also that none of his other family members can attend in his place. Also some of my siblings are older and only have so much vacation time, and can’t afford to waste time. 

Anyways his only solutions (so far) are that he go alone to his sister’s graduation and miss the first couple of family vacation days (which I guess would shorten the “family time”) OR that he just tell his sister that it’s too late and he can no longer go.

She's a perfectly great therapist, super sweet, great listener. I had 3 sessions with her back in January- early Feb. I postponed on scheduling another appointment after my Feb one, because the weather got so bad (couldn't drive to her appts), and because things got crazy busy at work. I've procrastinated on scheduling another appointment until now. 

If this is relevant, at our last session, she said that she suspected I had ADHD. She noticed symptoms like forgetfulness, acting spacey, anxiety, disorganized, etc. Well, after forgetting to schedule another appointment, I also forgot to pay for my last one! I didn't realize it until just a few days ago, when she took a payment from my debit account (which she was fully entitled to due to the agreement on her website I clicked on before signing up for appointments with her). I was supposed to make that payment through her website, but I guess she figured that I wouldn't make that payment after a month, so she did it on my behalf...

So, I'm really embarrassed, and not sure how to go about scheduling a new appointment with her. Should I email her to apologize and explain? Or should I schedule the appointment and explain in person? What if she doesn't want to work with me anymore because of this late payment?",24Mar2019,1

But yea I’d keep the cars separated, I write the paper copy plate and tape it on the car it’s registered for and the car with the real plate that it’s not registered for will be at a neighbors house it won’t be driven.

550,"This is my first post here. It is very long, sorry in advance but TL;DR at bottom.

About four months ago I was fired from my casual position at my workplace. I had only been working there a few months but I loved the job and was friends with everyone there. I truly see myself as a hard worker and someone who is just enthusiastic to learn new skills. I thought I was doing well, and getting along with everyone. Then my shifts rapidly decreased from one week to the next and I had a gut feeling that something had happened or I had done something I maybe did not pick up on. I discussed this with a workmate who was also my friend and was having a few issues with management themselves. They suggested I be honest and try and talk to my manager about the situation and ask what I did wrong and what I could do to fix it. I was committed to doing this as I loved my job and was dedicated to showing them that I want to be able to do as best a job I can. I texted my manager the next morning asking if I could come in to chat about a few things I was concerned with. She never responded and a few hours later called and fired me. 

It was the biggest shock and was so heartbreaking. She informed me that she was about to call my friend (who I had discussed the situation with) and fire them as well for unrelated reasons. The reasons she listed for firing me were very shocking too. All of them I truly believe to be false. I do not wish to disclose them but I believe that one of my coworkers must have just been spreading rumours about me &amp; my other coworker as I have never done what I was accused of on the phone. I knew it was not worth trying to argue with or dispute as I was a casual and was too upset to. 

It has been months and I still replay the phone call in my head. I replay that day and so many interactions with my coworkers because I do not know who truly was my friend or not. I get so upset and mad sometimes at everyone there. I feel so resentful, and feel so much hatred towards the managers. I feel confused and conflicted because I’ve always only ever tried to work hard and put 100% into my jobs. These thoughts creep in almost everyday and I feel sick in my stomach and sometimes cry and I just don’t know how to move on fully. I don’t know how I can trust anyone I work with in the future. I also feel like I can’t talk with my other coworker (who also got fired) about it because they were planning to leave anyway and is still friends with many of the others still. How can I move on from this and learn to stop feeling mad and resentful? 

TL;DR I was fired out of the blue from a job I had been at for a few months. One of my other coworkers was also fired but for different reasons. The reasons I were given were shocking as I truly believed that they were not true. I believe someone made false claims and I wasn’t given a chance to defend myself. It has been months and I feel mad, upset and resentful to all my old coworkers and managers and it’s really weighing me down. How do I deal with moving past it all? ",24Mar2019,1

552,"Hi.
18/F/State: NJ (as of now - NJ law may apply here.)

My abusive grandmother has a friend (Let's call him ""A"") that just so happens to take care of my Uncle's dog (Let's call him ""M"", and call my uncle ""K"".) A has another dog (let's call her ""S"") that is also living in the apartment with him.

K pays A around $300 to keep M in that apartment. A is a money grubbing bastard sometimes, and originally that $300 was rising up to $500. K is planning to move in with A with to escape an abusive relationship - but he did agree to let me possibly take M into my own hands (as I will be moving out in a few months to another state, into a house with calm roommates, and wide open spaces for him to run - but that isn't for a while more.

A SCREAMS IN M'S FACE, THREATENS TO HIT HIM WITH HIS METAL BOWL, HITS HIM WITH A FLAT STICK-LIKE OBJECT WRAPPED IN DUCT TAPE, AND TENDS TO LOCK HIM IN A CAGE MEANT FOR ONE DOG WITH S, SOMETIMES FOR MORE THAN 12 HOURS AT A TIME.
A is always screaming for M and sometimes even S to ""shut the f--- up,"" banging the side of the cage, threatening him with aggressive postures, and has spoken repeatedly of beating him with a belt, or blunt objects, or even bashing his head in. The other dog, S, isn't in nearly as much hell, but is almost always shouted at to do nothing but lay on her bed. The dogs are usually not allowed / are unable to roam, as A isn't even home most of the time - he goes out with girls, out drinking or to the casino, and will sometimes only feed the dogs once a day. S became tiny, and her ribs are slightly visible, though my grandmother has been kind enough to do some wellness checks and feed both dogs according to their weight, and as a result, S is doing better.

Today, I finally lost it and, after I told him told him not to HURT THE DOGS, he hit me with a hard bag on my hurt shoulder. I WOULD CALL THE POLICE/ANIMAL RESCUE, but I know damn well my grandmother wouldn't vouch for me and would claim I was the one who started the argument. I know that K will be coming soon, and if I can't outright call the police, I'm thinking of tipping him off to the abuse, but he is also guilty of smacking M on his side repeatedly or ""spanking him,"" sometimes hitting him with a rope etc in the past, but no longer would do so now. (He changed after leaving his abusive relationship and has been better since.)

Everyone told me that M was off the chains and out of control, he tugs the leash and will drag you forward if you don't hold your ground - but after exercise, he would walk with me just fine, he accepts pets, loves to play and is all around a great dog! He does take basic commands.

Now, about S - there are blood stains, old ones, dark ones, all across every wall in A's apartment from S repeatedly catching her tail in the cage (she wags it and sometimes it catches in the metal squares.) She bled for a long time and would repeatedly re-open the wound, etc. I'm not aware of anything else wrong with her currently. I don't know if any of this would help to open a case.

I don't know what to do, I'm at my wits end, what should I do at this point? Should I make the call? Alert K first? Please, I need advice as soon as possible

Recently I got told from a lot of people (even one of his close friends) that he is taking harder drugs like cocain and xanax. Keep in mind that he is still 16. I told this my other cousin and he said that he does not care anymore at that point and that he tried everything. Another cousin of me once said: ""I was going down the wrong path too.

I googled it and from what I've seen, it looks like a real company that is just getting started, but I'm still not 100% sure, as feeling the need to email me more than once seems a bit...overeager as most companies at most just send 2 if you missed your first chance, I think.

The 1st email goes:

Hello (my name)

We found your C.V in an online database.

You have many qualifications that fit our current needs. We would like to discuss in more detail the positions we have opened at this time and see if you are eligible for an interview.

If you are still looking for work, we would like to meet you.

You can contact us at (phone number).

We are scheduling interviews following the next couple of days between **12h00 et 15hr00**. (there is a mild typo in this line?)

The next 3 emails were asking me to choose a specific schedule slot time, and so on the last one, I chose one. 

Shortly after a detailed email with instructions followed:

Your interview is scheduled for 03/26/2019 2:30 PM.

Duration: 15 - 30 minutes

Attire: Professional Attire

Documents to bring with you: Photocopy of your CV

Location: \*\*\*\*

Please note that when booking an interview, it is NOT a telephone interview. We only do face-to-face interviews. Prepare to travel to our office.

Please note that the elevators are undergoing maintenance and you must take the stairs to the first floor.

Your interview will be held with the President. Please note that this is an advancement position in an executive role and a professional and mandatory attire to be considered for the growing position of director

Thank you for coming prepared at the scheduled time.

561," Hi Reddit,

Let me preface this post by stating up front that I'm fully aware that this is only one side of the story.

I know full well that relationships are a two way street, and that there is another side to this story that I, and you by proxy, are not getting. (I am also aware that I posted this in another sub, but I am posting here for additional opinions).

Now, to the story...

I had a ten-month relationship fall through recently, and I'm trying to determine exactly what happened, and how much of the blame I carry for the end of the relationship. For background, I am a 29 year old male, and my (now-ex) girlfriend is 26 years old.

We started dating. and for the first few months, everything was great. I noticed a few weird quirks, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Slowly but surely, though, I started noticing her getting upset over what I perceive to be extremely minor issues.

The first time I noticed that something was definitely off was when we were getting ready to go somewhere. I was looking for my keys, and I said out loud, ""where are my keys?""

The question wasn't even necessarily directed at her -- I was just talking out loud to myself. Eventually I found them, and I said, ""alright, found 'em, let's go!""

She came along, but she was acting strangely. I asked her, ""what's wrong?"", and she says, ""you accused me of hiding your keys."" I didn't know what to say in response, as I most certainly did not.

However, that's how she interpreted my question.

Her sensitivity became more and more evident as the relationship went on. One night, we were driving and I said, ""hey, you've picked every song so far, can I pick the next one?"" She got quiet.

Totally silent. Again, I asked her, ""what's wrong?"" She responds with, ""you yelled at me."" The rest of the drive, she gave me the silent treatment. I tried to salvage the night by talking to her, but it was too late at that point.

The night was ruined.

The next instance of this happening was on a plane flight back from vacation. She was being handsy, and she put her hand down my pants. I thought we were having fun. So I ask her, ""are you horny right now?""

Immediately she recoils. Again, the rest of the plane flight, silence. Later on that night, she calls me to tell me that, ""I accused her of being promiscuous,"" by asking her if she was horny.

I remember being dumbfounded, and quite angry, as I try to be a respectful guy.

There were many moments throughout our relationship of this happening. I would say something that I thought was completely normal, and she would shut down on me. And quite frankly, it would ruin the remainder of the day together.

I don't think she was doing any of this maliciously (although I could be wrong about that), and I definitely don't think she's a bad person.

That being said, it made it extremely difficult to be around her. Every time I was around her, for the last four months of the relationship, I felt like I was walking on egg shells. Now, she would never act hostile towards me, but instead she would just let small comments ruin the rest of the day.

I mentioned to her multiple times that I felt like I was walking on egg shells with her, because I didn't know what remark would ruin the rest of the day. So, I started saying less and less around her. Until one day a few weeks ago, she goes, ""it makes me really uncomfortable that you have to walk on egg shells around me. It makes me feel like I don't even know the real you."" Which is a completely fair point, although I think she underestimates the role she played in creating that environment. This led to her ending our relationship, rather unexpectedly.

Now, this relationship has been over for a few weeks. I do miss the good times we had together, but I'm also sitting here wondering if I'm better off. Moreover, I'm wondering to what degree I played a role in creating these problems. I keep blaming myself, thinking, ""oh, if only I had done more to figure out why she was mis-interpreting what I would say, I wouldn't be in this position.""

I would really appreciate some outside perspectives on this. Any comments or criticism are welcome.

Thanks.

tl;dr: Dated very sensitive person for 10 months. Her sensitivity made me feel like I was walking on egg shells. She didn't like that I felt that way, and she broke up with me. What could I have done differently?",24Mar2019,1

564,"Oh boy, rambling post incoming (hope it makes sense, sorry...just panicking a bit right now) (also, a bit of a two-fer with two related situations)

**Part 1)** I'm pretty fresh out of college and wanting to start down the crazy career path that is film making. I'm basically living the age-old story of ""moving from the midwest to be discovered in Los Angeles"". I know I'm a dime a dozen, but of course I like to believe my ideas are special. The good news is that I'm not starting this process completely cold - I've interned in Los Angeles a few summers ago and have friends and contacts currently there. However, that's about where the positives end because I have no idea where to go from there. Coming fresh out my internship everything seemed crystal clear but now that I'm no longer riding that ""high"" and instead have settled into adulthood, I've been too scared to make the jump. 

I've been working, saving money, waiting for my SO to finish college aaaand that's about it.  I've made a few changes to a script that's now on draft 4 and talked my way into one film shoot as a PA, which would totally be an okay amount of progress if it had been 1 month since graduation and not 8...From time to time I'll feel guilty about accomplishing nothing and then spend an hour researching apartments in California before fear of the unknown makes me give up and another month passes. This cycle needs to stop. 

I've been on my own before, but nothing like moving across the country. I don't know how to seek out and judge apartments that aren't school housing. I don't know how to estimate utilities into my meager Starbucks salary (it's at least work I can bank on having from day one of the move). I barely know how to budget. I don't know how to physically get me and my things to California. I'm terrible at networking. I don't know how to cold call (for housing, jobs, or anything). There are so many things that scare me about moving, but I'm sick of letting it get the best of me. 

Please help me figure out where to start. 

I'm sick of the same generic advice everyone gives me - Network by going to events and talking to people (no shit, thanks for that), be prepared for high prices (awesome, but how do I prepare and what can I expect to afford), find lots of roommates (okay but how and how to avoid weirdos), seemingly obvious stuff like that. 

**Part 2)** I may have found the ideal additional roommate (and a resulting deadline forcing me to act) but the more I think about things the more I worry about the logistics. My SO and I have been planning on moving together from the start, but the possibility of only two people affording rent for a decent place seemed slim to none. Last month, I found out one of my long-term friends (as in elementary school) just accepted a job in California. Everything seemed too perfect - she starts in June so I'll need to move with her, I know her incredibly well so we get along swimmingly, she doesn't mind my pets,  - until I learned the job is in Irvine. At first I figured commuting would be fine as I honestly don't mind driving or traffic. 

We've been slowly making progress for the move (as in researching places, I've still been too scared to reach out for lease info), but today she said we can't keep being wishy-washy and start making decisions. Long story short, 10 minutes of ""serious"" research and I have myself terrified of the commute. I was thinking an hour with traffic (not ideal in the slightest, but totally manageable)....it's looking more like easily over an hour each way (used my internship as an estimate since it was in Studio City) from the city more northern than Irvine. I can't commit to a drive like that, can I? I don't want to burn myself or eat through gas when my money is already so limited. I know I need to compromise as someone starting my career, but is this too far? 

Additionally, I don't know what would be better. Everything but the commute is perfect. I know her, we could afford rent, and it forces me to not just talk about moving anymore. If I let this pass by just because of the drive, where do I go from there? I'm back to having no clue where to start and zero leads.

565,"Hey guys, (21M) had a breakup a few months ago with a girl i’ve been with for 3 years. Now i am completely alone, no friends, nobody to talk to and isolated. WHEN i go out in public i feel lost and out of place from the people around me. It feels like no-one is interrested in me. I mean i think i’m a decent looking guy. Yeah i have alot of personality issues (probably from the toxic relationship i was in because before i was in this relationship i had NO problem speaking, flirting and making women like me/fall inlove with me. Now nobody wants to even know me. 

Is it really necessary to have a bombing body to be noticed, What does a woman look for in a man. I life in an apartment by myself, i have a decent car, i’m a business student, i have fun hobbies, i think i’m a funny and very loving person but it seems that i am the only one who thinks so. I used to think women want to be with me for my earthly possessions and i have stopped showing ‘what i got’ and no poof, all gone, not even the ‘nice girls’ want to know me. Talking to women, getting their numbers but when i text i get ignored. (Why even give someone your fucking number if you dont want to know them? Just say no! But this is besides the point) 
I know this sounds so cliche and overly spoken, but at this stage it feels like i will grow up and old alone. I know i’m still young but I’ve tried to start anew this year, i’ve been rejected/ignored by +- 30 women i have approached, i have given up completely, i dont even turn my head to look at a beautiful girl anymore. 

Is there any advice that anyone (specialy women) can give me on what i should do to actually get attention? ",24Mar2019,1

567,"   So I'm male and my neighbor is female. This all started when a two week ago when I stepped out of my apartment to go walk my dog, I over heard her talking to herself she ran up stairs and went inside. Only to come back out seconds later shout profanity out her door and slam it.

   She has a history of drug abuse and recently had her children taken away by cps (including one at birth).

  Well a week passes by from no sign of her and nowhere to be seen. Turns out she was in a psych ward; ever since she came back she insults me as she is leaving (driving away or going into her apartment) she doesn't yell or shout it at me in an aggressive manner she says it under her breathe just loud enough so I can hear her.

   I don't want to say anything hurtful to her given her mental state but I don't want to be putting up with this especially given that all our prior have been friendly and all we really did was greet each other.  What should I do?",24Mar2019,1
568,"I’m not trying to sound like an edgy teen but I literally can’t feel emotions anymore. I went to a therapist about this and they told me that my past and dealing with a lot of disappointments and other shit has caused me to have barriers and expectations of all things to be bad and thus not feel any emotions about things that would’ve 5 years ago. It’s really effecting my life. I’m not able to put the proper effort into certain things because I dont feel emotions when doing it. Example. All my efforts that I’ve put into previous relationships and then getting dumped has caused me to not feel like dating or not be putting a lot of effort into a relationship because I expect the same results. That’s an example but it gives you an idea of what most things are like in my life. I’ve stopped doing school because I don’t feel comfortable with other people, I stopped doing basketball cause people are too aggressive, I’ve stopped a lot of stuff and it’s really ruining a lot of opportunities for me. Any advice?

569,After 4yrs of talking to a guy (Taurus) I thought would be a potential partner in the future. He decided to friendzone me. He said he thinks we’re better off as friends becuz he’s not ready for a serious relationship or making any commitments &amp; that he wouldnt be ready until 2yrs. I feel I never gave him the impression I wanted anything serious right now. I did potentially if things worked out between us. (26 cancer) I let him know I had no feelings at the moment after he asked me if I felt anything for him. I don’t have feelings now but I know I care about him i just don’t want to express how I feel because I’m not ready. I was confused when he said our relationship hasn’t come to an end and isn’t on hold but just wants to be friends? Should I drop him? We used to talk all the time and now things are awkward that we rarely speak. I don’t go out of my way to try to talk to him.

But a week ago I was added in a group chat with her on Snapchat because we were all going out in a  couple of days. So added her on Snapchat as I friend, but a couple of days went past and I noticed that she hadn't added me back. At first I thought that maybe she hadn't seen it, but when we all went out she was on Snapchat nearly the whole day. When we were all sitting at Subway she was talking about how many people were requesting her on this app and she showed it to the girl next to me, when I looked over she quickly jerked the phone away and changed the subject (I'm guessing it was Snapchat).

Me and her are not really that close and if she doesn't want to show me things then that fine. However, I felt hurt especially she is so much warmer around my other friends and doesn't really make the effort with me.

She had an abusive upbringing and alcoholism runs in her family. She’s struggled in the past but appeared to have gained control for the past 5 years.

I’ve ask her why she “seems tipsy” and she says “I’m fine” or “just tired” but I’ve persisted that something is wrong. Ruled out medical causes (IE. diabetes) as best we can and she refuses to see a doctor.

578,"TLDR; college decisions have been releasing this month and i regret not trying more in high school. i’m feeling like a dumbass for wasting my potential and i’m worried that i set myself up for mediocrity for the rest of my life.

i apologize in advance for this wall of text. i really feel like i have no one to talk to about this.

so i'm a senior in high school and college decisions have been releasing this month.

during the application process, i regret how much i didn't try more in terms of having strong extracurriculars and rigorous class courses. until 11th grade, i hung out with a group of people who weren’t interested in school. i only started caring about what i did in high school when college applications started.

i only applied to one prestigious school, and the rest of the schools i applied to were not too selective but also not too open either, if that makes sense. i got into my other schools but not the prestigious one.

two of my friends got into prestigious schools and i’m feeling happy for them yet bad about myself bc the schools i got into are not as prestigious.

The schools i got into aren’t BAD, but i can’t shake the feeling of inferiority if I end up going there when my friends are in more prestigious schools.

i feel like if i had the college application process in mind earlier, i would’ve had a chance in improving myself and have a shot of getting in to amazing schools. i feel like i wasted my potential. hindsight really is 20/20.

i guess i’m also feel insecure that i’m not sure of what i want to do in terms of a career. because of this, community college looks appealing to me but i feel like college is supposed to be a time where I grow as a person become more confident and idk if going to community college will foster that. 

basically, i’m worried that i won’t amount to anything because i didn’t immediately get accepted up to an extremely well-known school for undergrad and i don’t have a clear idea of what i want to do for a career yet.

see, i KNOW that as long as i work hard, i can find success no matter what school i go to and there’s nothing wrong with going to community college and then transferring to a 4-year school but my anxieties are so strong that it just leaves me wondering if i’ll ever find happiness in my life because i wasn’t thinking about the future early on. what if i had set myself up for mediocrity and i won’t live a fulfilling life?

i also know that not going to a prestigious school isn’t the end of the world. and i know that this all comes from a place of inferiority and i should stop comparing myself to others but whenever i fathom the idea that i’m not as bad as a person as my insecurities make me out to be, i eventually feel shitty again.

i probably sound melodramatic because i have my whole life ahead of me, but i just feel scared and insecure. do things really get better over time?",24Mar2019,1

581,"I made a tinder when I was 16, which was stupid but at that time Tinder had a feature to only interact with people under 18 so I thought it was fine. This was in 2016. 

There was one dude I matched with, lets call him John. I thought he was cute and seemed nice on our Tinder messages, so we exchanged numbers and snapchats. After a few days of talking, I started getting really bad/creepy vibes from him and stopped responding. I never met him in person, thank god. He continued to try to contact me for three weeks even though I wasn’t responding, so I blocked him on both platforms and forgot about it. 

Last year, I received a really suspicious text message from an unknown number, basically it said there was a company recruiting for a job that they thought I’d be a great fit for and to respond if I was interested. There was no information about what this “job” actually was, the text was very vague. At the end of the text, it said that John had recommended me for the position and given my number to this “recruiter.” I was really sketched out because I didn’t think he still remembered me and I had forgotten about him. I obviously didn’t respond. I brushed it off because maybe he had given out all of his contacts for the message to be sent to, or whatever who knows. 

This morning I woke up to a follow request on my instagram from John. My instagram does not have my name on it, but possibly is connected to my phone number. I have no idea how he would have found it otherwise. I’m really freaked out. I don’t understand why he’s still trying to contact me when our contact initially was so limited in the first place. 

What do I do?? Is there anything I even can do? Has anyone experienced something similar? I’m scared he’s going to reach out to people I know, if he hasn’t done so already. I’m also afraid that he’s been sending me messages this whole time but I haven’t seen them because he’s been blocked. Should I unblock his number so I can be sure that if he contacts me, I see it?

It was an energy consuming experience but I loved it. Last August I resigned (so that’s 1.5 years there) since I have always wanted to do Law so I started studying Law last September.

I told her that it was bad to again but she kept saying it's to keep food from falling in the oven. I should say this is a gas oven.

It takes approximately 25 minutes to preheat it. I was making 2 pizzas in it at once, with the box saying 18 minutes for one, and it took over a hour to make both.

Unfortunately, I'm in the middle of my down period. It's probably connected to seasonal depression issues, along with ongoing personal issues in my life.

I know I have a problem. I've come out talking with my family about these issues, and more recently I forced myself to go to a therapy service my school uses. Unfortunately though, the therapy service can only do so much, and the person I'm seeing is telling me to see someone outside the school as she does not think she can help me, especially since the service closes at the end of the semester.

594,"So around 4:30 PM, I posted in a subreddit called r/AskTransgender about this young trans woman's libido and my thoughts and concerns about that. Basically, she had a low libido possibly due to her medical treatment and I asked a few questions in that thread about her libido. Now I used an alternative name to reference the woman since I wanted to protect her privacy. However, within 20 minutes from posting the thread, a moderator on the subreddit locked the thread and threatened to ban me from the subreddit if I were to post something similar in the future.

I asked a few questions out of curiousity only to have my thread locked and hidden from that subreddit. Can someone please tell me what I messed up on? 

Also, I sent an apology message to the moderators of that subreddit in the hopes to get forgiveness. 

What should I do now?",24Mar2019,0

There was a ton of spamming, and I eventually muted it.

They were bragging about sending them to other people without her consent, and possessing nudes of other girls too.

She couldn’t take it anymore and told me everything. She hasn’t stopped cutting, almost everyday, and all over her body to make it look like an accident. And now, she wants to kill herself.

     I agreed to be in a faux relationship with this guy (his parents were the kind to nag constantly about him not having a girlfriend, the agreement was that I would act as a stand in while he went to family gatherings, posted occasionally about “us”, sent his family photos from time to time, etc). And everything was great, up until when I started having feelings for him. I noticed it when we hung out and just talked more and more that I did actually like him, but it’s thrown me into an anxious storm because I feel like it’s not right for me to feel this way, and that something is wrong with me.

608,"Here’s some background info: 
So I’m in secondary school (12-18years old) and I had a really rough last few years in primary school ( couldn’t wait to get out) I didn’t realize then but I only had one friend (that’s another story)when coming into secondary school I was quite lonely but it was ok I guess. Half way though first year I became friends with this girl, let’s call her Emma. We were best friends, we hang out together, spent our school lunches together and FaceTimed after school. It was great I finally had a best friend.

So fast forward to this school year.
Everything started out good but she started hanging out with these other girls in our year. At first it was just a “hello” when we walked by, but now she spends most of our school lunches with them. 

Usually we would sit at the wall of the canteen all lunch and talk. We would hang out every 2nd/3rd weekend. We would face time every night. But now, at lunch as soon as she finishes her food she wants to go to her other group of friends ( ever though I’m only half way through my food) sometimes she just leaves me there all alone. She goes to her friends and talks with them for the rest of lunch ( our lunch is 40 min and she spends 10 min with me and 30 min with them) 

me and Emma’s other friends aren’t really friends (it’s not that I don’t like them we just don’t click) so when she’s with them sometimes I go over to them but have to stand outside their circle like a loner. I just want to have lunch with her but she seems to prefer to be with them.

I have been just sitting in the bathroom for 30min and waiting for the bell to ring. I don’t have any other friends who I could spend lunch with. Last weekend she went to a teen disco with them. That’s all she talked about with me the week before the disco. I tried to act like I didn’t mind but I did. When she went out of Friday night I felt so alone. This weekend she went out in our town with them, she also went swimming in the lake with them on Saturday. I keep trying to make plans with her to do something but she keeps saying she’s busy doing stuff with them. 

Today I friend to ask her if she wanted to go to the movies with me but she said that she wasn’t allowed because she’s only allowed to go places with her friends every second week. I now this is fake, she goes out every weekend with her other friends. 

All I want is to be friends with her and to hang out. She is my only friend and I feel like I am losing her.

I always go above and beyond, often staying late unpaid and skipping lunches to make sure that I really make an impact on the branch I am in that day.

My boss came to me about a complain made against me in a branch that I frequently work in. Saying I refused to do something I was directly asked because I ‘didn’t like it’. This is untrue and I believe there is some crossed wires along the way. 

How do I handle this? I have put my side across but don’t want this complaint to hinder any development I may have in my career.

613,"Sorry it’s so long, there’s a TL;DR at the bottom :)

On Friday I was at a work event with around 50 other employees from all areas of the business. An old school friend had joined the company earlier in the week after seeing a job advert I had posted on my social media pages, and this was her opportunity to meet new colleagues. Around 20 minutes into the event, she told me that she felt dizzy, and on our way towards the exit her legs turned to jelly and fell to her knees. Myself and some other colleagues helped her up and supported her until we got outside, where she was given water and seen to by a first aider.

She kept up her story of feeling dizzy for a while, with people offering it being too warm/busy inside and her having had a glass of prosecco as reasons for her episode. She kept up with this story for a while, before instead saying that she was fine and just tripped up.

I drove her home as I was concerned about her driving, and during the journey she insisted that she was okay and kept mentioning how weird/embarrassing it was. It wasn’t until after I dropped her off that I remembered a story she had told me many years ago (probably around 8 years if I had to guess) in which a guy we both knew repeatedly tried to pressure her into having sex, to the point that she fled his house in the middle of the night to get away. This guy works for the same company as me, and was in attendance at the event. I also remember having clocked him entering the room around the same time that she first said she felt dizzy, although I am only now putting two and two together.

I can therefore only assume that her dizziness must have been as a reaction to seeing him. At the time of the incident all those years ago, I remember her telling me what happened in a fairly casual manner without any emotion behind it, and it was never brought up again. I’m left wondering if there was more to the event than she let on, but either way she is obviously still very affected by that night.

Her reaction has left me feeling so incredibly awful that I did not warn her before she started the job that he worked for the same company. Luckily they will not be working within the same department/building, but there’s still the potential for bumping into each other in the cafe, canteen, and at future company-wide events. To make matters worse, in order to lighten the mood I made jokes about her really making a good first impression and about it being funny that she fell (it sounds awful in hindsight but at the time she was laughing at her own misfortune).

Part of me really feels that I should apologise and ask if she wants to talk about it, or just somehow let her know that I understand what really happened. However, I am terrified of making things worse or opening old wounds even further, plus it could potentially be very awkward for her as we haven’t been in contact for years and are now working together in a professional setting.

I would really appreciate some advice on how to handle this when I see her in the office tomorrow.

She asked if I could talk to her for a bit about a problem she was having.
Turns out she is pregnant and says the child is our sons!

Turns out that she had a boyfriend these past 2 years. At first I was shocked about the whole thing but looking back I can understand it. After she left my dad got home from work and told me and my brother his side. He claimed that my mother was an alcoholic and that he had to divorce her so she wouldn’t get a dui that ruined all of our lives. I have never known my mother to be a drinker and we are very close. When I heard all this I was upset and I believed it because I didn’t see a reason for why he would lie. However, as the week progressed he would spend all of his time telling me and my brother that she had ruined our lives and was a terrible person and that we should be embarrassed of her. This was very tiring. He seemed to get more and more manipulative especially toward my younger brother. He keeps saying that if she gets help and apologizes he’ll take her back but I’m aware that’s not really how divorce works. I feel like he’s saying this to try and manipulate me and my brother. When my mom came to pick me up to hang out one day he went outside and made a big scene yelling that she had ruined our lives.

But she had to go and soon she would be away, back north away from me. My heart aches for her. I want her, want to have babies with her. I know she feels the same, she said she missed me and I miss her.

627,"So from 2018 to right now, my parents have gotten into numerous fights over many things. Before 2018, they were always really friendly to one another and got along well with each other. But as my mom's health started to decline a bit, they started to get into more fights. They never really stayed mad at each other for a long time, maybe a couple of hours to a day. The first time they got into a fight, I thought it was a huge deal, but as it happened more frequently, I thought less and less of it since I knew they would make up and would go back to being themselves again. Each time they got into a fight my mom would talk about divorce, but that never happened. But as of yesterday, things took a turn. Normally, instead of just arguing like they normally do, things started to get physical with one another. I won't go into much detail of what happen, but I believe that this time, things won't be the same. Now they won't even talk to each other, my mom is always crying, and my dad isn't as enthusiastic as he used to be. My parents are really wonderful people, they are both the nicest people I know, but since my mom's health has been declining, her attitude has been changing and she just gets more agitated with people now.

My mom, I believe, has diabetes and hyperthyroidism (or hypothyroidism, as of now I am not sure), and has skyrocketing high blood pressure, and even more things that I may not be aware about. This may be a factor into why she and my dad have been getting into more fights recently.

My parents and I need help, I want to do whatever I can do help them be family again. If this involves my mom or my dad getting perhaps help or maybe seeking a doctor for my mom, then I will take that into consideration.

628,"I have been dating a guy for about 3 months, and it's been somewhat up and down, but I really liked the guy quite a bit. Recently, however, he'd been getting really dependent on me (he doesn't have a steady job, I was paying for everything, he stayed here 4 nights a week.) I finally told him that I wasn't ready for us getting so intense, and that I wasn't happy with things, that he needed to get a job, take more care of himself, etc. He's also been very depressed, but I suffer with bipolar disorder and see a therapist, take my medications, etc. I was concerned that he wasn't seeing a therapist. In short, I felt that he needed to get some of his ""shit together"" and then we'd try to restart things. 

We both cried quite a bit, he stayed that night, and then went home the next morning. We kissed before he left. We exchanged a few text messages, but they were rather short. I finally texted him last night (about 10 days after the last time we met) to see how he was doing, and to ask why he hadn't written much back to me, and then saw a message waiting for me. It was from his ex-boyfriend. My friend (I will call him Jeff) had committed suicide the day before. 

I am utterly devastated. I don't think I've known a sadness as profound as this. I also feel guilt that I didn't do enough, that I hadn't helped enough. His ex told me that a number of Jeff's friends are all saying the same. I was really kind to Jeff, as much as I could be, but I also know he was deeply depressed. I asked him the last time I saw him if he thought he was in danger, or if he thought he needed to be in a hospital, but he told me that he had done it once as an outpatient and it made him more miserable.

I am so gutted by this experience. I feel guilty. I am utterly lost. I think that I shouldn't have fought with him about anything. One friend told me that even if he and I had stayed as a couple without a break this still could have happened. Right now, I simply do not know what to do with myself.

630,"So hopefully this doesn't come off as whiny / immature, but basically, I'm a teenager with fairly typical teenage issues. I self-injure sometimes, under-eat and occasionally force myself to throw up, have episodes of nervousness where I can't really breathe right, etc. None of it is super bad, but it's definitely gotten worse since it began around three years ago.

I've been reported to the school counselor twice. The first time, my parents told me to stop my unhealthy habits. I said I would, and of course, I understand that it's my fault for lying, but I sort of expected some kind of support, I think, and they didn't really seem to open that up to me. And of course that isn't their fault; they're adults, and have a lot going on in their lives, and I can't expect them to be at my beck and call for stuff that understandably makes them uncomfortable.

Anyway, I _do_ have a support system. I am so incredibly grateful to the many people who care about me, but I feel like I constantly let them all down. Lately, I've sort of been spiraling, I think (not to diminish anyone else's issues; I'm really lucky that I don't deal with half as many problems as others). I've reached out to a couple people, and I always feel a little better after venting.

Still, I feel really guilty, because they all show me so much love and care, and I'm not getting better at all. I'm trying to be more private about what I'm going through, because I want to stop worrying them, but I feel kind of lost. 

I guess I just don't what to do or who to turn to. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",24Mar2019,1

638,"If this isn't the right place for this post, please let me know or direct me to a sub that can help me. I grew up in a suburb of a big city, and I come from a white liberal family. The person who paid most attention to politics was my brother who's 5 years older than me. I first noticed a change in my brothers tone on things when the black lives matter movement started. Whenever we'd see things on the news about racial inequality in America or sexism in the work place, my brother would always explain that it ""isn't as bad as it sounds"" or ""its not true that women make less than men, there's no way a woman in the US would get paid less for doing the same job as a man"". While the rest of the family would be shocked and horrified at the details of the police brutality, he'd be going on and on about the split second decisions cops have to make in situations that lead to those shootings and he'd look for justifications for the cops decisions. It wasn't that surprising, since he works for the government and has always been someone who likes to have an independent opinion. He started saying that liberals are going way too far left. He's bisexual. He started saying that gay people aren't persecuted anymore, that he doesn't need ""special treatment"" even though no one was insinuating that we thought he should have ""special treatment"".

He gets angry at people like Jacob Tobia, who I'd never heard of until he told me to ""look up and tell me what you think"". He wonders out loud why Jacob doesn't want to be judged for their ideas, or opinions or why Jacob doesn't want to be an engineer or do other things with his life. Wonders why everything Jacob does has to be about them being trans.

Whenever we hangout he brings up examples of cases where brown people are being coddled by the system. I tune a lot of it out, because I know it's really not about what I have to say, it's about advancing and enforcing something he's already decided for himself. One example I sort of remember is how the Mayor of New York stopped doing these high school tests for students to get into advanced classes, because too many asians were getting in and no black kids were getting in. Apparently people were saying discrimination was going on and that's why no black kids could pass the tests (whether it's true or not, I don't care to know, all he knows is that it reenforces his thinking), but he reads with glee a comment on the article saying that ""it's not about discrimination it's about the fact that black homes are unstable because black homes don't have fathers."" Which may be partially true, but why the ceaseless focus on this? He hates when black people play the victim card. He thinks women don't rise to the high paying jobs because they are too worried about being polite and not concerned about being good leaders.

Just tonight, after the AG Barr released his summary of the Mueller report, I said I'd like to read the actual Mueller report. Reminding him that AG Barr wrote an unsolicited letter saying the Mueller investigation was going too far. He said (of course) that Barr was just expressing his opinion and he seemed like an honest guy. Why can't he just say, ""yeah that was strange."" ? He goes onto say that conservatives are thinking for themselves better than liberals are right now, and that liberals are getting too caught up in conspiracy theories. If I say, ""..and conservatives AREN'T getting caught up in conspiracy theories?"" He'll say, ""Well I'm not talking about MAGA hat wearing people, just normal conservatives""

This is getting long, and it feels really good to let out even if no one will read it. I guess my question is, if anybody is reading would be, how should I continue to talk with my brother? What's your assessment on his thinking? He's someone I trust deeply in many areas of life but I feel the gap between us is getting larger. His knee jerk reaction to playing devils advocate is exhausting, has anyone else had experience dealing with a person like this? I have many more details/accounts if interested.

645,"Here’s some back story about this. My best friend met a guy at a party and she gave him her number and her snap. And a few days later they started talking and all that stuff but she was annoyed that he would just disappear from the conversation sometimes. So she asked his ex which happens to be in the same dorm as her about him and she said that he was always like that and that he is a super nice dude and all... a few days later and he asked my friend to go out this weekend (this was two weeks ago) but she said tat she can’t because a friend of us had a birthday. She lives 100 miles away because of school. So here’s where the story starts getting really confusing. He suddenly asked his ex to go out to work things out... But what was sketchy about this is that on the Snapchat map he was jumping from where he lived to where his best friend lived in seconds. So then both my friend and his ex were super confused and didn’t know what to do and since my friend has truble with getting feeling to fast she was crushed so she asked us not to ask her about this. Meanwhile my life just started to get together since I was really anxious so my doctor wanted to give me some pills which I with his permission declined. 

So since she lives so far from home she started to smoke occasionally and she always tells me when she has smoked which makes me really angry and anxious to the point that I start shaking. That’s because not only my grandfather died because of cigarettes but also my uncle has a lot of medical issues and my mom which stopped smoking after I was born and when she coughs she just can’t stop coughing. 

And I told her that if she starts smoking I will stop talking to her since I can’t stand it or I will try to make her stop... 

And this is were the story begins: she sents me a snap with a caption like this: omgg I just smoked 3 cigs and I didn’t even realize. And naturally I flipped out and then when I calmed down I jokingly said something about that guy and she didn’t say anything at all... 

So a couple days went by and I asked if she is free for the weekend so we could catch up and she said how dare u talk to me after that. And I was like what? What do you mean and then she told me and I apologized and apparently this really hurt her feelings since she miss understood what I meant when I said maybe he doesn’t like u...

650,"Ok so I have been playing the violin since I was in 4th grade. I've played in so many concerts that left my teachers with tons of praise. I've played with my orchestra at assessments and left with nothing but 1's (the best score you can get). Obviously it's a huge achievement of my life.

But, I'm seriously reconsidering whether or not to play next year. And it's got me stumped. Next year i will be a senior, so it'd only be one more year. Plus a lot of people are begging me to stay. Not because I'm good (lord please help my intonation), but because I carry a lot of energy, especially in songs that need loud dynamics. Music is something I've always been passionate about, all the arts are.

It makes sense to stay. But at the same time, I'm really not happy. I hate the violin so so much. It hurts my ears, and the instrument itself feels too small and delicate for someone like me to handle. Not only that but my teacher is awful, he is very passive aggressive and publicly shames us for not pursuing orchestra as a career. Nunerous occassions he has made me cry. Again not even for my playing, but because I had to leave early or use the restroon. I don't really have a lot of time for it already, and next year I'm hoping to get a job.

So my questions are how much does orchestra really matter? Will colleges honestly deny me for not finishing my senior year with orchestra? Is it worth taking up my time that I could be using to develop in the career I'm actually pursuing? And is it selfish or lazy to want to quit?",24Mar2019,1

655,"In 2015, I knew about this young woman named Jessica who I found physically attractive and can relate to. She would often share her life story on social media and I would follow her. Throughout my experience of watching and reading her social media posts, I became enamored over her. I often think about Jessica and even fantasize about her being my girlfriend or wife. The very action of fantasizing made me feel really good and I would often dream about being in a relationship with her.

Fast forward to 2019, I am still doing that and I started to wonder if it is time to let Jessica go and stop fantasizing about her. I know that we may never meet in real life, yet alone form a relationship, but I still cherish my thoughts and fantasies about her. When I asked friends and acquaintances about this they either said that the decision is up to me or that it's not their place to tell what to think.

But this matter is a valid question. There are those who think that it may be unhealthy to constantly fantasize about someone who you will never even meet. But then again, I am not harming anyone by having these fantasies. I have pictures of Jessica on my phone and I sometimes glance on them if I want to think about her.

Lately I have noticed that I'm always anxious and stress over every little thing, I'm always worried what everyone thinks about me. 

I'm an 18-year muslim kid. Back in the day I used to be a popular kid with a lot of friends but as we got older I noticed our cultures are different, my friends do go out to night clubs while I'm not allowed by my parents. This seperated me from my friends, at the moment I basically have no friends except my school friends. 

I also have a lot of questions about life: What is the meaning of life? Why do we reproduce if our lives are already bad? Does god really exist? Why are we spending 1/3th of our lives working like we are mentally enslaved? 

I'm not sure if there is something wrong with me or this is just a stage of life everyone goes through. To summarise it short: I'm lonely, not happy (while I pretend to) at all and not sure what I should do with my life.

At school everyone says I'm a cheerful kid and that I laugh at all but at home I'm really not. I also repeated a year which makes me ashamed to get near my old friends/people I know. Currently I'm not playings sports and I work.

It's embarrassing and frustrating that I'm interested in things like politics but remain so ignorant as I can't read-up on subjects to educate myself, or when talking to people they may make cultural references I just don't understand. 

Throughout my life I had to pretend I read things, I'd love getting books out of the library and people thought I must be so knowledgeable on the subject I 'read' but I had to fake it. Sometimes faking it gets me into trouble, if I've not read something I can mess-up and the result of that is I suffer anxiety due to the fear over messing up. 

If it's more than a few paragraphs it's like my brain just goes 'NOPE' and it won't even attempt to take it in. I can't even read a simple news article let alone make it through books...I bookmark articles, I've an Amazon wishlist of over 500 books, but I just never read anything.

This is of course a tiny bit biassed but I made sure I added as little opinion as possible.
Key: my love = 10 me = me  my drama obsessed friend = J 

So to start off with me and this girl have been in the same tutor for about 3 years and we have been mutual friends for 2 of those. About 6 months ago we started becoming closer and after about 4ish months we became best friends. 

We were really really close we told each other everything and we delt with all our problems together. We were very close and there was a romantic hint to some parts of our friendship but nothing major. 

She started dating my best boy friend and they dated for about a month with noting too serious. About a month into the relationship he cheated and she broke up and told me that she hates cheaters and wishes she could kill them all. 

I started calming her down by flirting with her to stop her from missing her ex. She said this really helped and tbh I enjoyed having someone to flirt with.  

After about 2 or 3 weeks of flirting every few days for about an hour she asked me if we could just start flirting for real. I said yes and was happy to have a gf again. 
(Another point is that our flirting was basically phone sex, I'd discribe us doing things in a lot of detail to her and she'd touch herself. Sorry for the details)

She asked me out a few days later. Only a few days into the official relationship she cheated with my best friend (her ex). I was heartbroken and really sad. This is when I told J about my issues, she was supportive and kind about it and tried to help.

I forgave her and we started dating a week later after some more flirting. We we're both happy and I was head over hells like I'd never been before, she did everything I wanted a friend to do and also everything for a girlfriend

Suddenly she had this idea, she wanted me to prove I'm loyal (fair enough if she hadn't cheated on me) using this thing they do in the Philippines (she's from there) called courting where basically you have to do as the person says and some other stuff.

She abused this power and made me flirt when I didn't want too, made me tell her things that I found very very private (trust me this isn't stuff anyone apart from me and my doctor should know.) This is about the point she stopped telling me secrets and started texting a lot more boys all of a sudden. This hurt me badly. 

Me and 10 and another friend called.. L were all out at a park and I started having an anxiety attack. This one was bad, there was a lot of sweating and heavy breathing and so on. She told me she "" didn't want to see me like this"" and that ""I should walk myself to my bus (and wait an hour) and text her when I'm home so she can have fun with L"" 
Also her and L were giggling on 10's phone and texting a boy and not letting me see. 

After this she straight up left me and told me she ""isn't happy anymore"" and then the next day starts dating a boy who a few days later dump her. She then texts me and tells me to take her back, I do.

She promises never to break my heart again and promises ""nothing will tear us apart like before"" a few days later.. guess what!.. she leaves me, she's now only answering in ok and yeah/no and maybe a cool every now and again. She tells me she's gonna cut herself and when I tell her to ""take deep breaths 10, remember crying is just sadness leaving the body"" she just says ""idc"" and cuts herself (this is one of about 30 or those times) and now tonight I've found out that she is getting help from a new exciting boy 😞. 

Summery. 
My love cheats then breaks up for another man, breaks up again and is now interested in a new man. And I feel broken. 

I've also lost 90% of my friends so I'm left with 1 friend I can talk about this too. 1! Out of the 20 I could before only one friend is left! 

Anyway thank you for your advice I'm sorry for mistakes goodnight

663,"So I found this guy on Insta a while ago. I thought he was super cool &amp; talented and he's been in the back of my mind for the past few months; I just haven't been able to shake him for some reason, idk. He just seems interesting to me (even though I all I really know about him is what he presents on Insta).

So fast forward a little while - I'm actually moving to his city next month. Naturally, I'm thinking I could message him and introduce myself/meet up. Only problem is, I can't help but feel super stalker-ish even though I haven't really planned it to happen like this. I'm getting paranoid and I'm thinking that maybe I shouldn't message him because it would be weird, especially as I began following him months ago.

Am I thinking about this way too much? I just feel oddly drawn to this guy, idk what it is. I might end up meeting up with him and hating his personality lol, it doesn't really matter anyway I guess. Idk, I'm going to need some friends for those few months (I don't know anyone in the area), so should I just go for it?

But please be honest - do you think this is weird? Should I not message him? What would you do in this situation? Would you want a random girl messaging you to meet up? I'm pretty new to serious dating (only 19) so I don't really know the protocol. I just don't want to be seen as a stalker. I'm also pretty shy with people (at least at first) and I think I'd be super intimidated by him and wouldn't really know how to act. Maybe this idea is a disaster? What do you think?

Thanks for your help!",24Mar2019,1

A little background on me: I’m 25 living in my own apartment. I have a full-time job and make enough to support myself for the most part. I am still on my mother’s insurance due to me having to pay $600 a month in school loans. 

I went to college on the west coast and have worked out that way since graduating. I have just moved back to the east coast to be with my at the time girlfriend of 5 years and my family. I recently ended my 5 year relationship and had to leave behind my dog. I have  been having a hard time transitioning into where I am in my life. Without anyone to talk to, I want to look into seeing a therapist. 

I don’t know if my insurance covers it at all, therefore I would have to ask my mom to see if it covers it. 

My family is very nosy and very judgmental. Anytime someone in my extended or immediate family does something that is taboo or unconventional, it seems to make family headlines. 

My fear is that I will be judged or even worse looked down on. Every kid wants to make their parents proud and I just don’t want to look like a failure or someone who needs help. 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks for your time. ",24Mar2019,2
666,"I guess what I kinda want from this is some comfort and reassurance.

A friend, M for now, invited me and some other people to a birthday celebration for today. I really wanted to go, but I have church at the time of the event.

What I would say makes it worse is that my parents planned a party for me the day prior, but I couldn’t invite many people, M included. Me having a party a day before theirs makes me feel like such a piece of shit. I never wanted one to begin with, but my parents insisted.

I invited some friends from the group, but all cancelled except for one. I tried explaining to them all the situation, but I don’t know if they understood since I’m bad at explaining. 

Side note but kinda related: another friend, L, said how they weren’t gonna go to M’s celebration more than once

Today while going through snap chat, I saw that the entire friend group went, L included, and i just feel like shit. I don’t know why, but it hurts more seeing L there.

667,"First time posting in this subreddit.

I'm in my second year of university and it's approaching the end of the last semester of the year (only two-ish weeks left!) For the past few weeks I've been feeling so burnt out, unmotivated, and I'm just over everything. Obviously, since the end of the year is approaching, I've had assignments and papers due almost one after another. Usually I stay on top of my shit and I don't wait until the very last minute to do something.

However, recently I've been finding myself feeling less and less inclined to work on my various assignments. I put it off until the last day and then I scramble and pull all-nighters and end up regretting everything. Because of this, the assignments I've been handing in haven't been up to par with the rest of the stuff I usually hand in. At first I started to get worried, but now I'm so deep in this mess that I'm starting to not really care about the penalties and sub-par marks.

I'm tired all the time. I also work a part time job in customer service and I don't feel like I have the energy to deal with so many people, especially considering all of this. It feels like a drag to go to class. I constantly feel overwhelmed by everything that I have to do because I can't catch a break. After I finish one assignment, I have a project due in a week that I haven't looked at yet. It just doesn't seem to end and sometimes I end up having a little breakdown cause of the stress and being overwhelmed.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can beat the burnout and feel motivated to work again?",24Mar2019,1

669,"TL;DR at the bottom.

I don't know how to talk to anyone irl about this, so I'm posting here. Today when I was leaving Target, the place I am employed, I was checking out my groceries and I purposely didn't scan an item. As I was leaving I think I overheard they person who watches the self checkout say ""did he really except that? Let's check guest services."" My heart sank but I just kept walking. I don't know why I didn't just turn around right then and there and say I forgot to scan something, but I didnt. It's been an hour and my heart hasn't stopped beating out of my chest. I know that if they find out they will fire me. I am trying to move in with my girlfriend, and if I lose this job I will have to move back in with my parents because I have no money. This is the worst decision I have ever made, and I don't know if I can fix this. Is there anything I can do to remedy this situation? I will pay for it all if I have to, but if I go in I'm afraid I guess what I'm really looking for is advice for if the worst (and probably most likely) outcome happens, what do I do?

672,"I know I'm a sensitive (sometimes overly sensitive) person. I've always felt my own emotions very deeply, but it extends outwards and is absorbed (if that's even the right word to describe it) from others as well. Some sibling friends of mine just found out their grandpa passed away and will have to fly overseas to be with family, and I know that has to be hard and stressful on top of an already emotional situation.

I feel sad because I know they're going through a rough time; (and yes I know, that should be the normal reaction if someone truly cares for you and is a friend) but I know that because of the way I am, I can't un-feel emotions.

674,"So, I had a best friend. She was my best friend of 5 years. Let's call her A. So one night we were drinking at a friend's place and she asked me if I trusted her boyfriend. In my drunkeness I responded saying no. It's not that I don't like the guy, but he had said some shady stuff in the past and I'm protective of A. I continued to support their relationship and didn't have an issue in general with it. Anyway, my answer was no and she asked why not. Well this wasn't the real reason because I knew the real reason would upset her, so I mentioned there was a time when it was realllly drunk (like black out doesn't remember anything drunk) that he seemed to be flirting with me. I was drunk like I said and didn't think this through. He was just really...doting on me? It was super weird but I just let it go as him being really fucked up and didn't think about to much but it did stick out in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, she freaked out. She Facetimed him yelling asking if he wanted to fuck me. I tried to tell her that's not what meant at all but she just kept screaming at him and then calling me various names that I would repeat here. Her reaction was explosive and unnecessary. I got made and took an Uber home because I didn't want to deal with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Next day she decides to make an announcement to a group chat of people we were both in that I accused her boyfriend of trying to fuck me without evidence. She then went on tell a series of lies that were completely untrue. Most of these people in this group chat were not at all involved in the situation. I just responded saying that these things weren't true but they can believe whatever they want. She has turned a few people against me with her lies. No one has approached me to ask my side of the story. They just decided I'm guilty of these things and don't want to talk to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Its been a few months since this happened but I'm still having major anxiety about it. I'm finding it difficult to cope with A's betrayal and losing friends on top of that because of lies. There was one person present who saw the whole thing. She considered not being A's friend anymore but still hangs out with her sometimes. And she won't stick up for me and just lets these rumors run wild without challenging them at all. It gives me anxiety and makes me angry that A probably feels no remorse for her actions and I'm the one suffering consequences of things that I did even do or say. How do I let this go?

675,"In 2015, I knew about this young woman named Jessica who I found physically attractive and can relate to. She would often share her life story on social media and I would follow her. Throughout my experience of watching and reading her social media posts, I became enamored over her. I often think about Jessica and even fantasize about her being my girlfriend or wife. The very action of fantasizing made me feel really good and I would often dream about being in a relationship with her.

Fast forward to 2019, I am still doing that and I started to wonder if it is time to let Jessica go and stop fantasizing about her. I know that we may never meet in real life, yet alone form a relationship, but I still cherish my thoughts and fantasies about her. When I asked friends and acquaintances about this they either said that the decision is up to me or that it's not their place to tell what to think.

But this matter is a valid question. There are those who think that it may be unhealthy to constantly fantasize about someone who you will never even meet. But then again, I am not harming anyone by having these fantasies. I have pictures of Jessica on my phone and I sometimes glance on them if I want to think about her.

Let me know what you think and mention your strategies in the comments.

676,"I apologise in advance if this comes across as ramblings, I'm confused and not particularly sure how to articulate my thoughts and feelings.

For context, I'm a 19M living in the UK. I dropped out of college during the first year, and I have never really been a fan of the education system, choosing to join the workforce instead, as I know I can always revisit education in later life. Whilst I was in college, I loved Economics as a subject, and I feel I would have pursued this later in life had I continued with my education - this will become relevant later.

As a result of leaving college, I had to reflect on what I would like to do for a career. I dabbled in music, as I play the drums, some acting, modelling and singing, and I would really like to pursue a career in entertainment. I might sound naive, but I've always wanted to ""escape reality"", whether it be through games, music or movies. Growing up watching marvel movies and having these idols, real life superheroes, to look up to, has been as close to ""escaping reality"" as I can get, and has really inspired me to want to be a role model for people like myself, and to help others escape their own reality. I really enjoy the creative arts and I think it's important to pursue something that you enjoy. I love the idea of being someone's ""superhero"", as unrealistic or childish as it sounds, but it's good to have a dream.

The main conflict I have is that I have many dreams. I'd also like to change the world in one way or another. I'd love to be able to start and manage a business that centred around Virtual/Augmented reality technology, and really help progress its capabilities. I have many friends who are at university at the moment studying subjects that are very applicable to my ideas, and I have talked to a few of them, and they are supportive of my ideas and offer a lot of encouragement.

My issue is I feel like I've come to a fork in the road and I'm not sure how to proceed. If I were to pursue either of these dreams, the sooner the better. I loved Economics in college, and getting a qualification in the field would immensely help with setting up a business in the future. Obviously, the higher level of education, the more prepared I would be, however, I hold a full time job to pay rent, insurance and other monthly expenses, so dropping this job to go to university would not be possible. I have considered taking some online courses, but I am a little stumped as to what would be reliable and/or applicable for me.

In addition, I don't want to sacrifice my pursuit of happiness as an entertainer for my business ideas. I know that managing both at once may be an impossible task, but I'm sure that doing one before the other in life wouldn't be as difficult. I also understand that I may not achieve the level of stardom I would like, but I'd rather try and know I've failed, than to never try at all. If I were to pursue a career in the film industry, whilst studying business management, I would be prepared to move from one to the other, however, I'm not sure if this is a viable (or even logistically possible) option.

I don't want to miss a chance with either paths, and so, I'm stuck at the fork in the road. Any advice would be much appreciated, and I thank you in advance for reading :)",24Mar2019,1
677,"It’s been almost a week I feel numb, and empty. I cared about him. We weren’t close close but I did like him and cared about him. He and my mom are more my family than my own mother and father are. And I’ve only known them a few years but I am her daughter and he was my gramps.

We woke up and found him. She called 911 and the operator wouldn’t stop making us try to touch him and resuscitate him and my mom was freaking out trying to move him but he was extremely overweight and she couldn’t. 

I went in and tried to help. I have never found a dead body not touched one. And I tried to move him. He was cold and lifeless, his skin felt spongy and the second I grabbed his wrist and pulled I instantly felt nauseous and sick, and I grabbed the phone from her and told the operator that he was too far gone and to stop telling us to move him and leave us alone with him. I had to hang up on her. 

Then for almost a week I had to keep my shit together and handle loads of family stuff and business. I went to work on Friday and immediately broke down and told my job he’d died and left for the day. He died the Tuesday before. 

I turned 21 two days before he died and I haven’t ever felt as empty as I feel right now.

I feel not even sad. I feel empty and I hurt but yet I don’t? Nothing is making me happy atm. And I’ve dealt with depression and I have bipolar disorder like tendencies. I have been unmedicated for almost 7 months and been happy and fine and maintain stability on my own and I worked so hard to get there. And now everything feels just weird. The stupid things don’t even matter anymore, I’m more worried about my actual health and about bills and shit after this.

I am in the process of applying to post-grad schools but with little conviction. I should be spending my time preparing for my finals, but I have no motivation. Cooking and playing sports are the only two things I do with eagerness and passion. 

On top of this, I am on the brink of completing my undergraduate studies still a virgin, feeling sexually and emotionally isolated. I fear that I have missed out on some essential experiences during what many call the best time of one's life. I have grown up without ever experiencing loving somebody and being loved at the same time, which I find soul destroying. Right now, I don't remember the last time I shared a tight hug with a sweet girl. All of this has really been getting to my head recently. I am so scatter-minded right now, I even struggle to collect my thoughts and feelings for this post. 

Others in my shoes would know to take advantage of the great education and unique opportunities I have, but I have completely lost my focus and motivation. I don't know whether this is because something else in my life isn't quite right, or because I am trying to pursue something I have genuinely lost interest in.

685,"I don't know what to do anymore and I think I definitely need some advice...

&amp;#x200B;

I've moved to the other side of the country all alone, to study in a new city where I know only a few people... First, my ex-boyfriend (I moved here to live next to him, he's at two minutes from my apartment) who's always felt really bad about human contact (and I respect this). We broke up last December, and I feel even worse... We're still in very good terms and very close, but not as close as we were... A long time ago, he'd hug me when we saw each other, but now things are very different... He tells me he's always had problems with this, and even though he was able to do so when not feeling bad, he can't do this anymore (he does have lots of mental health problems, so I don't blame him for this ""phobia"" as he calls it, and I don't want him to feel obligated to hug me or touch me when he hates this...).

&amp;#x200B;

I also know a very few people from my class... I wouldn't even call them ""friends"", they're nice to me, so I do the same, but we don't see each other off class time... They hang out together, by groups, but I'm not a part of any of them, and this makes me so sad...

&amp;#x200B;

I do have birds. A cockatiel and a conure, which I love dearly and love me back. They love cuddles, like I do, and when they're out of the cage we spent most of the time together, ""preening"" each other. As if I was a member of their flock. They love to perch on my shoulder and ""preen"" my hair, as they would do to other birds. They're not humans but I don't feel so lonely when I'm with my birds...

I do have a dwarf rabbit too, who's very funny and despite not being as cuddly as the birds, he loves to be petted and sit on my laps...

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that I live in a student residence. Animals are forbidden. At the beginning of the year, I asked the director if I could bring mine, knowing it'd be my responsability if anything bad happened, and that they wouldn't bother the neighbours... She refused and told me ""it is forbidden, if you do so you'll be fired"".

So my pets are staying at my mom's, who lives at almost 500 miles from the place where I study... I see them every three months, when coming back home for vacation. And I only see them for a week...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore... The lack of physical contact is making me so depressed and sad... I feel like nothing really matters, and I don't want to do anything... I just feel so, so lonely and sad. I miss the times where my ex and I would still hug a lot and be here for each other through rough times... Now he doesn't have the energy anymore because of his own problems, and me complaining and being sad all of the time is just so draining... I feel like a burden, and do my best to let him rest and be alone when he needs to (while I hate loneliness and do everything not to be alone, he actually needs solitude and time to be by himself, without anyone, and I refuse to force my presence in these moments).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to find a job so I can get money to move to another apartment, where I would be able to take my birds with me and adopt a rescue rabbit (my mom and sister would be sad if I took ours with me at the other side of the country), but I'm not even sure I'll be able to...

And even if I am able to live with my birds and my rabbit, this will help, for sure, but will not compensate for the absence of human contact... I need friends. I need people to love and who will love me back. I need to get hugged, sometimes, to feel like I belong and not to feel ashamed for craving affection...

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone here ever dealt with that problem...? If yes have you found a solution...? Do you know how to make sincere, genuine friendships? Or is there a solution about this...?

691,"My work friends and I took a weekend trip to a local ski mountain. Almost 20 people were going, and finding people willing to drive and/or people who had cars was a challenge. My SO (does not work at my company) volunteered to drive to help make things a bit easier, despite not wanting to. One car had to be rented after all, and that cost will be divided among everyone who did not volunteer to drive.

Anyway, in Murphy’s law fashion, my SO’s car’s front tire got shredded by the ice after skiing on Saturday. He was driving three other people and they have no idea how it happened, but believe ice froze over on the tire hood, snow piled up and prevented the car from reversing properly, meaning the tire kept turning and somehow got slashed. Either way, it wasn’t his fault and could’ve happened to any unlucky car. Auto shops were closed, given the time of day, so it was just pretty awful luck all around.

We found a shop to replace the one tire for $120. My question is: is this something that can be considered a group expense, the same way the rental car is?",24Mar2019,1
692,"I barely have any. I have one best friend that I talk to once a week, but she doesn't count and I want older friends (around 18-23) I'm 18. 

I don't care what we do even. I'd just be ecstatic just going over to their house and either smoking or just fucking around. But I love going out to the beach and walking around or even a park. 

The skatepark at Venice beach, their house, santa Monica pier, even the snow/the mountains. I don't care! 

I noticed myself wondering and asking my sister when the next time we're gonna hang out again is. That's right, *my sister*, which isn't a bad thing to hang out with your siblings.. it's just I'm always wanting to hang out with her and her friends. 

Yes I have my own best friend but she's a year younger than me and we can't really do much by ourselves. I don't have any friends at school, hell I even went on a field trip and basically hung out with my teacher the whole 4 hours! 

I am talking to a lot of guys on a dating/talking  app called Meetme and at first, I was so fixated on a finding a relationship. But you can't be in a relationship without any friends to support you if ya'll break up. So I'm focusing on making friends.

It just breaks my heart when I think about it to much. ",24Mar2019,1

He repeatedly calls then texts me that he'll see me soon and we'll see whose laughing and said that i'll regret fucking around. Should I call the police or is that not necessary? I have the number on caller ID.,24Mar2019,1
694,"I recently turned 21 and have been in a relationship for just over a year now. As a generality we never fight or have any kind of issues with each other. Sometimes we may upset each other but we work through it. However for the first time I really messed up. I promised to never hurt her or cheat or any of that, and I probably jeapordized that. Here's what I did. She has a young sister that just entered a public highschool after leaving a catholic school. Due to her popularity, she's been able to become friends with people who have access to Marijuana and Alcohol and as a result of either peer pressure or personal desire, has started consuming it. Due to me recently being able to buy these things. She asked me if I would do so for her. I didn't really want to, but I also wanted to be good friends with her because she is important to my girlfriend. While it wasn't very often due to being secretive and what not, I bought her primarily alcohol when I could. I fucked up the other night and left my messages to her sister open on my phone when I went to sleep that night. My girlfriend has blocked plenty of people on facebook and wanted to see if someone she used to know would be somewhere she wanted to go and was going to use my phone while I was sleeping to check. She found out this way. She has told me that I have broken her trust and i'm concerned that I may never restore it as well as she may not want to see me anymore. What do I do? I love her to death and will have a exceptionally hard time getting over her if I have to. I would never forgive myself I let her slip away. I need to have second opinions on this so I can potentially save what I may not normally be able to on my own.",24Mar2019,1
695,"About two months ago, I met this really cute girl on Twitter, we were just mutuals at first but I had noticed she was going through something based on one of her tweets. I told she could DM me and we talked about it until it was resolved, it ended well. Personally, I catch feelings real easily so eventually I had this crush on her but I kinda brushed it off thinking: ""nah she's too cute, we'll just be friends."" But, eventually, we started flirting a bit but I didn't think much of it. 

About a week later, she told me she really liked me and I'm constantly on her mind, but she's not sure how to deal with her feelings given it would be a LDR. For me, I respected her wishes and I told her it'd be ok if we were just friends but we kinda kept up the flirting. 

Some time later, we have an extensive talk about our feelings and she tells me she really wants me to be there, next to her. It really hurt cause we both really love each other and I really wanna try to make an effort but I can't now, she deactivated her account and told me she'd be back soon cause she kinda needs to take a break, I'm assuming she feels bad cause she really likes me but can't really do anything about it cause she's not up for a LDR

but, I really am, however, at the same time, I need to respect what she wants and understand why she feels the way she does. So, I'm at a crossroads right now and I'd appreciate the help. ",24Mar2019,1

697,"Hi, throwaway account here! I mostly post bad shitposts and stuff on my main, and I feel like this is too serious a subject to post on my main haha. By the way, sorry if there ends up being a textwall, I’m on mobile. 

Anyways, I don’t know what to do with this situation. Keep in mind that I’ve never been professionally diagnosed with social anxiety, nor ever been to a psychiatrist or anything.

So basically, whenever I try to talk to people, I just assume they hate me? And it makes it really hard to reach out from my friend group. For example, there’s a couple of people that are super super nice to me, and yet I can’t help but feel like they only talk to me out of pity. In fact, I’m pretty sure one of them hates me, even though she’s been literally nothing but nice to me since I met her.

It also affects how much I reach out to people. I’ve never tried to reach out and become friends with anyone outside my friend group, and it’s horrible because there are so many people I think would be great friends and that I would get along with, but I just can’t talk to them at all in fear of rejection. 

I’ll give you an example of this happening. I have a class with one of my friends, let’s call her Anna. So Anna is literally probably the nicest person I’ve ever met, and we get along super well. Anyways, we had this thing in the class where basically we had to partner up for something. It was mandatory, and I had no other friends in this class besides her. 

But I was so scared to ask her if she wanted to be partners for this project, I started like having an internal meltdown, kinda. So I ran out of the room and to the bathroom, and had something that I can really only describe as a panic attack- my throat closed up, started breathing fast, I felt hot and dizzy, I was shaking, and I couldn’t hardly stand because my legs felt like they were about to give out. I stayed in there for about 15 minutes until class was over.

So, I was wondering if there’s any way I can get help for people. I really want to be less like this, and be able to reach out to people more without being so terrified of rejection.

Sorry for sorta going off, I really didn’t mean to make that so elaborate. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day&lt;3",24Mar2019,1
698,"For so long I’ve blamed him for our problems.  And after reading about how to deal with his narcissistic behavior I realized it’s me.  After really reading and learning what that really means, I am the narcissist.   All of the things are things I do with out even realizing it.   Just how messed up I really am.  

And now. He is at his limit.  And I know this.  Anything I do or say to him at this point will only seem empty and reactive.  Another ploy. I have ploys!  I do.   He is not perfect.  We’ve both played our part.  But now I can see. It has truly been me. More than anything it’s been me. My complaining. My tantrums. My demands.  My  playing the victim. 

How do I fix this? Where do I turn? Is there hope to not be like this anymore?   How do I try if he is ready to end it all and give up?  18 years of marriage.   ",24Mar2019,1
699,"So I am in junior year of college  I  have my required classes that I am taking. My major is chemical engineering if anyone wants to know. I've tried to minimize extra obligations this semester. But it still doesn't seem enough. 

My biggest time constraint is that I am president of a club. This means I have a team that I manage. I have certain deadlines I have to meet but it seems like I am the only one serious about it anymore. I am suppose to have an adviser but she is way to busy to be taking the club on. She was required by the department to take us on. I used to like the club but every time I try to go any get work done for it, I freeze. I blank out and no one seems to want to help me out. It seems like their mentality is you're the leader figure it out. It makes me not want to go to school even though I am almost done finally. 

I guess I need advice on how to manage the club. We have a competition in 2 weeks that I know we are not ready for and that is my fault. But as we get closer, the more and more I feel like I cant lead them and its not helping. I just ask how to get through these next weeks. We may or not have another competition next semester depending how well we do. ",24Mar2019,1

701,"He grew up in an abusive household. Molested (to the point of rape) by his father for 2 years, hit and abused by the rest of his family. His father is out of the picture mostly, but the rest neglect him emotionally, do a lot of drugs and are just generally terrible towards him. He recently found out that his parents are siblings. CPS has been called multiple (15+) times, and they just never do anything. To top all this shit off, he found out that he has a brain tumor that may be cancer. 

Basically, life keeps hammering down on him, he's suicidal. He can't be touched by people except me without freaking out, and the authorities won't help. I don't know how to help him. I've been inviting him over as often as possible so he doesn't need to be around them. It upsets me a lot, I'm his best friend and I don't know how to help him.

704,"So, I’ve had feelings for one of my best friends for like 3 years maybe. I’ve never told her because I knew she wouldn’t feel the same way and I always assumed she was straight. I’ve debated on telling her for so long but in the end I always get too scared that our friendship will be ruined.

Anyway, last night me and a couple of my friends got pretty drunk (including her). At one point I blurted out that I was in love with someone and they all tried to get it out of me but it didn’t work, thank god. Later in the night my friends are asleep except her and we’re laying there in the dark and long story short we made out and if I recall correctly we did some other stuff as well. I was cross faded and I was just going along with it, but then she told me she loved me... and I’m still trying to process it all. Part of me hopes that it was all a dream but I remember some parts so clearly that it would be impossible for it to not be real. I was conscious enough to know what was going on. Now I don’t know what to do, we woke up and she didn’t even address it and told us she vaguely remembers what happened last night and left that part out. I feel like a fool because I gave in so easily and I’m sure she knows who it is I’m in love with now. Although I can feel the tension between us I can’t bring myself to confront her about it. What should I do? Should I talk to her about it or should I let it be for now?

706,"So, I'll attempt to keep this short. Basically my job requires me to go in and out of stores everyday. Now a couple of days a week I cover for one of my coworkers store. He constantly accuses me of not doing any work when in fact I am doing lots of work in that store. For example one of the stores stays open very late and I go home around 2:30 or 3:00 pm usually. He gets mad when he comes in the next morning and everything is empty. I've tried to explain to him that I can't camp out at the store all night and he can't seem to grasp the concept that people buy things, thus the shelf and displays are going to be empty. It's starting to wear on my nerves. I'm not a very confrontational person. I'd rather this not escalate into verbal arguing and cussing. I just don't like being accused of not doing my job. I could go to my boss, but he most likely won't do anything. The guy I'm having a problem with is very stubborn and set in his ways. It's like talking to a brick wall. I really am not sure how you are suppose to rationally explain anything to someone that refuses to listen. He's also a bit arrogant and thinks everyone sucks at the job except him. For the most part we tend to get along, but if he doesn't like the way I did something then he'll come down on me like lightning and it just infuriates me. He's a perfectionist. I can't do things the way he would do them, I mean, I'm not him. I just feel like he needs to realize this. Now I could tell him this to his face, but I'm afraid it'll just makes things awkward between us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Really at this point I'm just trying to avoid an explosive confrontation.  Because, I'm just speaking honestly,  if he accuses me of not doing my job one more time I will go off on him. I just don't like being accused of not doing any work after bending over backwards. It's like if I don't leave things to his specifications it's a problem. I don't know how you deal with people like that. If it helps any, apparently he's acted this way to my other coworkers who have covered for him in the past. Even my boss is aware of how he acts. I mean, I don't want to get anyone fired or in trouble. I just would like to be able to do my job and not have to try and explain a simple concept to a brick wall. The guy is like in his 50's and I'm in my mid 20's. He's about double my age if not older, not sure if that information is relevant, but I feel like it slightly is. He's a very hard worker and he takes pride in his job, which I can respect, but I don't like people treating me like crap just because they consider themselves one of God's superior creations. How does a man this old act so immature? I mean, it just blows my mind. He complains more than some kids I know. The guy has a wife and a kid. I would just would expect someone in his position to be a little bit more mature in how he voices his complaints in the work place. He's not above me or anything. We have the same position in the company, granted he's been there longer than me, but I don't think that gives him any sort of power over me. ",24Mar2019,1
